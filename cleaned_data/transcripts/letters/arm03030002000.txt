                    What do you suppose my latest adventures are? Imagine you haven't the slightest idea 
                    what I'll do next have you? Well no more have I - and that's 
                    one of the great charms of life here in the burg - Well I've tried my hand at  
                    our Jersey and went horseback riding about ten miles both deeds accomplished last night (Saturday). We gave 
                    up our trips planned for the weekend after all for first one reason & then another as I guess I told you in my 
                    last epistle - Evelyn broke  & had to 
                    go at once to Knoxville to have it fixed & that knocked out Elkmont - Then Mr. Cresswell had friends & 
                    a brother from home visit him Saturday that spoiled our going to Round Top (a mountain about six miles off ) 
                    So we girls bustled around all morning & then in the 
                     sat luxuriously in  dresses & white 
                    shoes on the front porch. Sitting on our lovely porch in a rocker is something I don't have time for more 
                    than a few minutes at a sitting usually - Harrison's wife & some of the youngsters came over then 
                    later When Harrison came along Abbie & I told him we wanted some excitement like going after a still or 
                    such - The result was that he scared up some horses & he Mr. Cresswell Abbie & I set forth at dark 
                    up the Roaring Fork road to Bally  Lethicoe's (a man) where some fence 
                    posts were supposed to be ready for us - So picture us walking or rather ambling along over the rugged stony 
                    road up & down & through half a dozen fords - single file most of the way. It was starlight when we 
                    started but soon clouded over but as it's full moon the sky was quite light anyway. It sprinkled a few drops 
                    only however and we got back about ten thrilled & pleased with the trip & quite dry except poor 
                    Mr.  whose gallant steed stumbled in one deep ford so he was wet over 
                    his knees - Abbie had never been on a horse before so we made a good pair. We girls hope that this will prove 
                    the beginning of many rides - I do want to get so I can really !
                
                    The rain which threatened to descend last evening has come down with a vengeance 
                    all day and is the first continuous rain we've had as previ-ously 
                    it has cleared before night fell. We went to Sunday School as usual and then for a change all of us had 
                    dinner at the hotel. An elderly couple are there much of the time a Mr. & Mrs. Hall. He is manager 
                    of the little stub train running between Knoxvile & Sevierville. They are pleasant to meet and have 
                    been nice to us - Our dinner was unusually good as Mr. Hall had shot half a dozen wild ducks. Did you ever 
                    eat any? We visited with them some time on the porch & then Emily & I trotted back home in between
                    the worst showers & got to letter writing.
                 was over at the school tonight so about six we girls 
                    paddled over with the lamps & started things. Not many came - fifteen 
                    or so - but it was quite a nice meeting sang & read the lesson.
                
                    Everyone here is eating chesnuts now as there is a big crop this year - They were 
                    sold at the store for 3¢ - but in town guess the 
                    price is quite scandalous. You see people just go out and pick them off the ground in the woods 
                    so practically no one in the burg buys them. Persimmons are getting ripe. Did you ever eat any? They 
                    are quite good - I think - had just one which I found on a walk up Baskins the other day. Are not really ripe 
                    until frost and so far we have had none of that.
                 - I helped Aunt Lizzie chase the cows over to their pasture
                        in the school yard once too. Finally after while Harrison came ambling along & I told him we wanted something
                        exciting to do - like a still hunt or such - He thought & thought - and suggested our walking about four miles
                        up Roaring Fork to  (a man) to see
                        if some fence posts promised us were ready - We said - no -  no walking for us - get some horses & we'd go!
                        All right he would. I didn't think he could & so went off with Mrs.  &
                        Aunt Lizzie to the barn (way over in the school yard past the school house) to do what do you guess? 
                         the cows - Yea verily I milked our little  Jersey -  - not much but am going to keep on till I really can. When we got back - Mr. Cresswell
                        blew over - after a strenuous day with his guests. We started supper hot chocolate - peanut bread - (made by Abbie's
                        class in cooking) canned pears & ginger cookies - & I had just gotten the chocolate mixed together when lo
                        Harrison arrived with good news - horses! Abbie & I simply fell over we were so tickled! So off we rushed upstairs
                        into our riding skirts - big boots & niddies - Then dashed down a little cocoa & bread. Mr.  by this time was quite enthused & so went along with us - Abbie rode Dan - I had
                         a little peaceful joggy stead who behaved very well - The two men had horses that stumbled a good bit.
                        
                        It was a warm eve - no wraps needed - & the moon due to rise full & bright - We jogged along up that rocky road
                        through fords - on & on. It was loads of fun - and the walking just suited me as I did not feel equal to trotting - Abbie
                        had never been on a horse before so we made a good pair. We went only four miles but did not get back till ten. It was
                        weird - the clouds soon blotted out the stars but  in spite of that - it was light
                        enough to see the road - We got to Bally's finally but the fence posts were not ready - It was a typical
                         cabin - we rode right up to the door through the corn field - got off the horses to rest
                        a bit - They all stood in the dark on the steps - half a dozen children or more & several grown people - Did not ask
                        us in. Then we went on for another mile up the creek to a dark cabin where  roused the owner
                        & got a lot of apples - After this we turned our gallant steeds homeward & in the course of time arrived - It was great
                        fun any way. Evelyn arrived during our absence & had to be roused from slumber & told all - 
                    
                        The dinner at the hotel was awfully good - an elderly couple the Halls are there and Mr.  had shot
                        half a dozen wild ducks which we all enjoyed.
                    
                        Several hours have passed since writing the above - I got so sleepy I just had to  and
                        curl up in the bed a short space - then arose & began reading in a book "The Southern Highlanders" by
                         Horace Kephart - Do get it in the library for it is just about perfect they say in its
                        description of these mountaineers of Kentucky Tennessee and North Carolina - and has some good illustrations in it too. I would really
                        like very much to write about them myself but don't know exactly how to go about it - my style is rather flippant you
                        know - What would you suggest? Had a nice long letter from Mandie who urged me to write about them too. Aunt Fannie also sent me
                        a card. No particular news except that the salaries of school teachers has been raised & Art has a new car - Olympian - Did
                        you ever hear  of it?
                    
                        When it rains here its perfectly lovely - We went over to the hotel ploughing through the slippery mud - about noon but had to wait
                        nearly an hour before the welcome bell for food greated our ears. - We whiled away the interim sitting on the porch - it was warm
                        enough - Ahead were the distant ranges toward Elkmont - all gray like mist - outline perfectly distinct but this massed gray effect
                        blotting out the green - Then those nearby had little streams of white here and there on their sides - It seems to be characteristic
                        of them to don these little touches like puffs of white steam or smoke - when its rainy & it is 
                        very lovely. We enjoyed looking over some copies of .
                    
                        Did you read the article on "Touries" in the  27th number of the Saturday Evening
                        Post? Dr. Bishop sent it up especially for Evelyn to read - I just happened to see it on the table as I was ready to come up after
                         tonight preparatory to finishing this & sat down & giggled
                        over it. It has been so wet all day that we did not expect to have the meeting tonight. However someone rang the bell about 5:30
                        just as we were finishing our chocolate blackberry jam & toast (baked in the oven after being buttered. awfully good - try it) so
                        over we went in the rain bearing lamps in our hands a la the Virgins - There were about fifteen only present - but had a nice 
                        meeting - sang many hymns - read the lesson - for about an hour. 
                    
                        Ruth.

                        Ruth.
                    Dearest pa - your note from the hotel in Frisco was gladly received yesterday - and found 
                        you right away in the big bus - you took the same trip I did and I thought it all very wonderful and interesting too. 
                        Like a true tourie I love the big sight seeing cars - The ferries to Berkiley are huge 
                        affairs are they not? And isn't Berkeley pretty? You should go to our other 
                        cousins there and in Palo Alto before you return. Haven't the vaguest idea what Rudley is like - hope it 
                        will prove attractive and that the St. John's have a car.
                    What do you suppose my latest adventures are? Imagine you haven't the slightest idea 
                    
        
        Page 03:  
        
        what I'll do next have you? Well no more have I - and that's 
                    one of the great charms of life here in the burg - Well I've tried my hand at milking 
                    our Jersey and went horseback riding about ten miles both deeds accomplished last night (Saturday). We gave 
                    up our trips planned for the weekend after all for first one reason & then another as I guess I told you in my 
                    last epistle - Evelyn broke herateethtooth & had to 
                    go at once to Knoxville to have it fixed & that knocked out Elkmont - Then Mr. Cresswell had friends & 
                    a brother from home visit him Saturday that spoiled our going to Round Top (a mountain about six miles off ) 
                    So we girls 
        
        Page 04:  
        
        bustled around all morning & then in the 
                    p.m. sat luxuriously in thin dresses & white 
                    shoes on the front porch. Sitting on our lovely porch in a rocker is something I don't have time for more 
                    than a few minutes at a sitting usually - Harrison's wife & some of the youngsters came over then 
                    later When Harrison came along Abbie & I told him we wanted some excitement like going after a still or 
                    such - The result was that he scared up some horses & he Mr. Cresswell Abbie & I set forth at dark 
                    up the Roaring Fork road to Bally Left Lethicoe's (a man) where some fence 
                    posts were supposed to be ready for us - So picture us walking or rather ambling along over the rugged stony 
                    road up & down & through half a dozen fords - single file most of the way. It was starlight when we 
                    started but soon clouded over but as it's full moon the sky was quite light anyway. It sprinkled a few drops 
                    only however and we got back about ten thrilled & pleased with the trip & quite dry except poor 
                    Mr. C. whose gallant steed stumbled in one deep ford so he was wet over 
                    his knees - Abbie had never been on a horse before so we made a good pair. We girls hope that this will prove 
                    the beginning of many rides - I do want to get so I can really sitahorse!
                
                    The rain which threatened to descend last evening has come down with a vengeance 
                    all day and is the first continuous rain we've had as previ-
        
        Page 05:  
        
        ously 
                    it has cleared before night fell. We went to Sunday School as usual and then for a change all of us had 
                    dinner at the hotel. An elderly couple are there much of the time a Mr. & Mrs. Hall. He is manager 
                    of the little stub train running between Knoxvile & Sevierville. They are pleasant to meet and have 
                    been nice to us - Our dinner was unusually good as Mr. Hall had shot half a dozen wild ducks. Did you ever 
                    eat any? We visited with them some time on the porch & then Emily & I trotted back home in between
                    the worst showers & got to letter writing.
                B.Y.P.U. was over at the school tonight so about six we girls 
                    paddled over with 
        
        Page 06:  
        
        the lamps & started things. Not many came - fifteen 
                    or so - but it was quite a nice meeting sang & read the lesson.
                
                        Well - I shall no doubt hear more of your adventures soon - Imagine Katherine was tickled to death to see 
                        you wasn't she? Is she living at her Aunt's?
                        Isn't it exciting about Arthur's new car? Had a long letter from Mandie the other day - containing 
                        no special news - except that the teahcers' salaries have been raised & Art D. had a new car - an 
                        Olympian. Never heard of it before did you?
                    Everyone here is eating chesnuts now as there is a big crop this year - They were 
                    sold at the store for 3¢ - but in 
        
        Page 07:  
        
        town guess the 
                    price is quite scandalous. You see people just go out and pick them off the ground in the woods 
                    so practically no one in the burg buys them. Persimmons are getting ripe. Did you ever eat any? They 
                    are quite good - I think - had just one which I found on a walk up Baskins the other day. Are not really ripe 
                    until frost and so far we have had none of that.
                
                        Am getting sleepy and about ready for bed - another busy week is ahead of me - no doubt. When do you suppose 
                        we will all be together again & where? What if Jane sells the house? Won't 
                        that be thrilling?
                        Will tell you good night - it's only 9:30 but everyone else is in bed & has been for some time - the 
                        evenings seem so long.
                        With lots of love as ever -
                        Ruth.but we did not go over - I helped Aunt Lizzie chase the cows over to their pasture
                        in the school yard once too. Finally after while Harrison came ambling along & I told him we wanted something
                        exciting to do - like a still hunt or such - He thought & thought - and suggested our walking about four miles
                        up Roaring Fork to BallyLethaco's (a man) to see
                        if some fence posts promised us were ready - We said - no -  no walking for us - get some horses & we'd go!
                        All right he would. I didn't think he could & so went off with Mrs. Profit &
                        Aunt Lizzie to the barn (way over in the school yard past the school house) to do what do you guess? 
                        Milk the cows - Yea verily I milked our little

         Jersey - some - not much but am going to keep on till I really can. When we got back - Mr. Cresswell
                        blew over - after a strenuous day with his guests. We started supper hot chocolate - peanut bread - (made by Abbie's
                        class in cooking) canned pears & ginger cookies - & I had just gotten the chocolate mixed together when lo
                        Harrison arrived with good news - horses! Abbie & I simply fell over we were so tickled! So off we rushed upstairs
                        into our riding skirts - big boots & niddies - Then dashed down a little cocoa & bread. Mr. C. by this time was quite enthused & so went along with us - Abbie rode Dan - I had
                         a little peaceful joggy stead who behaved very well - The two men had horses that stumbled a good bit.
                        
        
        Page 10:  
        
        
                        It was a warm eve - no wraps needed - & the moon due to rise full & bright - We jogged along up that rocky road
                        through fords - on & on. It was loads of fun - and the walking just suited me as I did not feel equal to trotting - Abbie
                        had never been on a horse before so we made a good pair. We went only four miles but did not get back till ten. It was
                        weird - the clouds soon blotted out the stars but although in spite of that - it was light
                        enough to see the road - We got to Bally's finally but the fence posts were not ready - It was a typical
                        mt. cabin - we rode right up to the door through the corn field - got off the horses to rest
                        a bit - They all stood in the dark on the steps - half a dozen children or more & several grown people - Did not ask
                        us in. Then we went on for another mile up the creek to a dark cabin where H. roused the owner
                        & got a lot of apples - After this we turned our gallant steeds homeward & in the course of time arrived - It was great
                        fun any way. Evelyn arrived during our absence & had to be roused from slumber & told all - 
                    
                        The dinner at the hotel was awfully good - an elderly couple the Halls are there and Mr. H. had shot
                        half a dozen wild ducks which we all enjoyed.
                    
                        Several hours have passed since writing the above - I got so sleepy I just had to "strip" and
                        curl up in the bed a short space - then arose & began reading in a book "The Southern Highlanders" by
                        
        
        Page 11:  
        
         Horace Kephart - Do get it in the library for it is just about perfect they say in its
                        description of these mountaineers of Kentucky Tennessee and North Carolina - and has some good illustrations in it too. I would really
                        like very much to write about them myself but don't know exactly how to go about it - my style is rather flippant you
                        know - What would you suggest? Had a nice long letter from Mandie who urged me to write about them too. Aunt Fannie also sent me
                        a card. No particular news except that the salaries of school teachers has been raised & Art has a new car - Olympian - Did
                        you ever hear 
        
        Page 12:  
        
         of it?
                    
                        When it rains here its perfectly lovely - We went over to the hotel ploughing through the slippery mud - about noon but had to wait
                        nearly an hour before the welcome bell for food greated our ears. - We whiled away the interim sitting on the porch - it was warm
                        enough - Ahead were the distant ranges toward Elkmont - all gray like mist - outline perfectly distinct but this massed gray effect
                        blotting out the green - Then those nearby had little streams of white here and there on their sides - It seems to be characteristic
                        of them to don these little touches like puffs of white steam or smoke - when its rainy & it is 
        
        Page 13:  
        
        
                        very lovely. We enjoyed looking over some copies of "Life".
                    
                        Did you read the article on "Touries" in the Sept. 27th number of the Saturday Evening
                        Post? Dr. Bishop sent it up especially for Evelyn to read - I just happened to see it on the table as I was ready to come up after
                        B.Y. tonight preparatory to finishing this & sat down & giggled
                        over it. It has been so wet all day that we did not expect to have the meeting tonight. However someone rang the bell about 5:30
                        just as we were finishing our chocolate blackberry jam & toast (baked in the oven after being buttered. awfully good - try it) so
                        over we went in the rain bearing lamps in our hands a la the Virgins - There were about fifteen only present - but had a nice 
                        meeting - sang many hymns - read the lesson - for about an hour. 
                    
                            Well I must cease now & write pa and Aunt Carrie.
                            Hope I'll get a letter tomorrow one usually comes Monday - How about that new house going up next to Mulins'? You
                            have never said anything more since you first mentioned the starting of it - 
                            With lots & lots of love & kisses too - Pinkie.
                        Ruth.
