                    Dearest family - Well I'm arrived - unpacked and settled at the Settlement School
                    and will proceed to unfold my life history from the time of mailing the last
                    letter at Indianapolis - or rather giving it to a girl who got off there and
                    offered to mail it in town for me - which no doubt she did. After passing for
                    hours through almost continuous and constant cornfields we arrived at Cincinnati
                    about 6:30 p.m. A red cap carried my luggage for me to the checking station and
                    then I went to the dining room and got some food as I was exceedingly hungry. It
                    was pretty good and better than I had anticipated. After that I strolled up town
                    following the most respectable looking whites - all around the depot seems to be
                    the colored section and lots of it too. The nice stores are quite a little
                    distance from the depot & though I saw only a small part - was satisfied
                    to get back to the depot about 8 p.m. The
                    streets are quite narrow and were full of people - movies going full blast - I
                    went as far as a large public square adorned with a huge fountain. The depot is
                    a large old fashioned stone building overflowing with people also so my
                    impression of Cincinnati was that is quite a large busy city - not as big as
                    Seattle but larger than Tacoma. The Louisville & Nashville was due to
                    leave at 8:30 but since it was made up at Cincinnati I could get on at 8 which I
                    did having previously fortified myself with the August Atlantic Monthly. It was
                    an awfully long train and only two Pullmans - mine being the last car no diner
                    or observation accompanying us along the route. There were about a dozen
                    youngsters along - varying in age from two to twelve years. The porter said we
                    were due in Knoxville at 6:04 a.m. and knew
                    nothing about the Knoxville - Sevierville (accent 2nd syllable) &
                    Eastern line that I was supposed to take. Well - I and a good many others were
                    up at 5:30 and ready to alight at schedule hour - the porter put our baggage up
                    in front brushed us off and said we'd be there in ten minutes and lo we stopped
                    and remained that way a half hour or so - Finally I roamed out to the end of our
                    car where it was all open. A brakeman put in his appearance - the porter and
                    conductor - and I learned that there was a freight wreck ahead - 8 cars of coal
                    having turned over and that we had to back up to Coal Creek 32 miles distant
                    where we would switch to the Southern Railway's tracks & pursue our way
                    to Knoxville thusly. The porter got me a chair and it was lovely & cool backing along - we went through two tunnels for
                    we were right in the mountains - at least that's what they are called here - and
                    they are just like the pictures - many pointed - perfect cones - and others
                    rounding & larger all densely wooded - and the air! It's an absolutely
                    different woodsy smell from our forests - more medicinal - aromatic or something
                    - I think it's the cedar which is quite different from our cedar - I like it and
                    wish I could bottle up some & send to you to sample - I asked the porter
                    if there was anything on the train to eat - He laughed and said sandwiches -
                    asked me if I wanted some and as I was quite panting for food said yes - He came
                    back with a towel in which were two buns split & ham between - They
                    didn't look particularly good - but hunger is
                    quite insistent you know - so asked him how much they were - He said "nothing"
                    & thought they were part of his lunch probably but as there seemed no
                    way of getting out of it took them & ate them. He ate two similar ones
                    also. Finally we got to Coal Creek & then everybody began piling off and
                    going up the tracks to some little stores and getting food- pop - etc. Here we
                    had to wait for another engineer as the signals differed from those on the L.
                    & N. road - so it was ten before we finally started up Southern's
                    tracks. We ambled along for an hour perhaps going up grade & finally
                    stopped in the wilds - a long time - This was because the length of the train
                    was too much for the engine & half the
                    train was pulled up the grade & then our half - It was about noon when
                    we got to the railroad yards where we again lingered. Meanwhile it had been
                    getting cloudy - more cloudy - sultry and more sultry - The porter did not make
                    up the berths and you can imagine how uncomfortable it was but all those
                    youngsters behaved pretty well at that. While we lingered as I said above the
                    storm broke - thunder & lightning and torrents of rain a regular
                    cloudburst - so much so that one could not see across the street. We gradually
                    moved on again and about 12:30 arrived at the L. & N. depot for which I
                    was pleased as my trunk had to be checked again & they told me the Southern depot was on the other side of town. I
                    found out that the Sevierville train depot was four or five blocks from the L.
                    & N. so had my trunk taken right over for the 2:30 train and got some
                    lunch. Had coffee two poached eggs on toast and ice cream & cake - funny
                    combination wasn't it - but so good - as the two sandwiches & two  were all I had eaten since the night before.
                    When I asked what kind of cake they had - the woman in charge said - chocolate
                    cake - white cake and camel cake - I said "Camel cake - what kind is that?" Then when she said it was brown I grasped her
                    meaning and laughed and said - "Oh caramel cake!" She said "Why yes  cake!" I ordered it & it was "right
                    good." After this refreshment I hunted up the same red cap & he carried
                    my baggage over to the other depot. It was a funny little spot and there were
                    two waiting rooms - one was labelled "Colored waiting room" - so I felt I was
                    really in the South. The train reminded me of that one going to
                    - only the coaches are not quite so narrow &
                    there are only two - I rode just back of the engine - which squeaked &
                    heaved and grunted all the way - The other passengers were typical country
                    people. The scenery was very pretty but the
                    same funny little hills that I had seen all day with an occasional patch of corn
                    and farmhouses - very crude - and some of logs with stone chimney at one end -
                    just like the pictures in the Arrow - the women wearing sunbonnets &
                    dark colorless dresses - they themselves ditto. Finally I put my coats on my bag
                    at the end of the seat & curling up went to sleep. About 4:30 we got to
                    Sevierville which is quite a town - big red brick building - school house and
                    many houses spread out in a little valley shut in on every side by the  The train goes down the main street and way
                    off at one end is the depot. Here was quite a crowd
                    of people and half a dozen cars or more. A little dark eyed - thin faced - eye
                    glassed woman came right up and I knew it was Miss Bishop. She is quite southern
                    but very very nice & I imagine about 35 - She lead me over to a car
                    where were two other ladies - about her age and married - They do not live in S.
                    now but were visiting their father & mother Dr. & Mrs. Massey -
                    Mrs. Wood had her baby with her - a boy about five or six months old - awfully
                    cute fat youngster too. The other drove the car & we - Miss B. &
                    I sat in the back seat - We all went up to the Bishop's house - Dr. &
                    Mrs. B. were not there but came later. I
                    cleaned up & by that time Miss B. had supper ready & the two
                    Massey girls & baby also had supper with us. Their house is on a hill
                    overlooking the town - rather a rambling old fashioned structure. We had just
                    begun the meal when Miss B.'s father and mother arrived. He is tall &
                    thin & she is dark & rather plump - looks like the daughter.
                    Murphy College of which Dr. B. is president is right in Sevierville - They are
                    both very nice and hospitable and I enjoyed meeting them. The two girls had to
                    leave almost as soon as we finished eating - then we did up the dishes &
                    Miss B. & I sat on the porch and talked
                    school. Right by their house is a hill that has been set out in corn - and I've
                    seen others similar - imagine a cone shaped hill covered with great stalks of
                    corn - 6 or 7  high - or half a hill - way up to
                    the summit. While we talked there was a perfect chorus of crickets and all kinds
                    of insects that made the croaking of our frogs quite insignificant - also I saw
                    oodles of fire flies - my first - and am quite crazy about them. I slept like a
                    log & got up about 8 - as they had been up for some time ate breakfast
                    alone - But first I forgot to tell you that the night before Miss B. showed me
                    some "kivvers" & baskets - the latter are made of willow mostly - and I'm sure Mr. Van Decar will like
                    them. The only trouble is Miss B. has lots of orders that have not been filled
                    so don't know when mine will get done - Then the "kivers" are wonderful - The
                    pattern is quite small - & of strands about half an inch wide blue and
                    white - red and green brown & yellow - the latter combination is very
                    rare - imagine the blue & white is the kind made oftenest. They are $25-
                    and hard to get! I shall try to get one! About ten o'clock Mr. Huff came to the
                    foot of the hill in his Ford to take us to Gatlinburg so we hustled off - bag
                    & baggage - For seven miles we had a very nice gravel road similar to ours - only called a pike - and then we turned off
                    into a  road - Such a road I've never ridden
                    over - rocks - ruts & holes - then as it had rained quite hard the
                    afternoon before it was also skiddy - much of the soil is red - red as can be
                    like that around Colorado Springs - We went up & down over this said
                    road for nine more miles following Little Pigeon River - which was a very muddy
                    stream from the bad rainstorm - Then we came to a little valley and the road
                    took us past a hotel and farther on and back on a knoll from the road - are the
                    school - the big cottage - the little cottage which may be a girl's dormitory
                    and another cottage where the Ogles live who look after the farm in connection with the school - the horse and the
                    cow - also some nice white chickens - We got out of the Ford & said good
                    bye to Mr. Huff - who is a tall thin spare man - shrewd face and quite advanced
                    for a mountaineer I believe - in the ways of the rest of civilization - Arriving
                    at the big cottage I met Aunt Lizzie Reagan - who is also thin and spare - gray
                    hair - brown eyes - and almost as brown and wrinkled as our old squaws at home -
                    So many of these women are that way - the sun & hard work are
                    responsible I presume. I won't stop to describe the house in this letter
                    & will in the next and will also send a picture as soon as possible - several of them - We three had lunch or
                    dinner together - cold fried chicken rice & chicken gravy - tomatoes -
                    hot biscuits - jelly - and honey - very good too. Then one of the other teachers
                    who had been to the revival meeting came - Emily Burton - She is from New York -
                    is not a Pi Phi - but has been here two years and has primary grade - She is a
                    little mite of a thing - like Mrs. Ward & is very bright and interested
                    in everything & I like her very much - She arrived just the day before -
                    Our trunks came next & we proceeded to unpack - I had things nicely
                    messed up - when Emily came in & wanted to know if I'd go up to call on
                    the Bradley's - real mountaineers - I
                    forgot to tell you about Miss Abbott - She - her father and mother drove in a
                    Ford from Chicago to Gatlinburg & have been visiting here two weeks -
                    She is much older than I am and teaches English in one of the Chicago high
                    schools - is very nice & a Pi Phi - Well she took us about two miles up
                    a road similar to that we came over in the  into the  - then we three left the car & proceeded a long half
                    mile on foot - it was a very steep climb & exceedingly rocky - we
                    stopped at a spring house on the way up - my first spring house! and got a nice
                    drink - Then we arrived at a little clearing on the side of the hill &
                    there was a perfect  cabin - and inside ditto! Papered with newspapers - most of which had been
                    torn off or scratched - a big cobblestone fireplace at one end - and a double
                    bed on one side of fire place at other a cupboard with garments piled on it -
                    & at other end opposite fireplace were 3 more double beds! Mrs. Bradley
                    was a colorless woman sitting in a rocker by the littered up fireplace &
                    excused herself for not getting up as she had been "right puny for two or three
                    weeks" - Emily knew her & introduced Miss A. & myself to her -
                    There was another woman also sitting there but we were not introduced to her -
                    it was not etiquette I guess - Emily didn't know her & Mrs. B. didn't make any effort. Then there was a younger
                    woman - Mrs. B.'s daughter or daughter-in-law - I imagine but she was not
                    introduced either - She had a year old little girl lying asleep on one of the
                    beds - Occasionally one or the other of the two older women spit into the
                    fireplace - very neatly never missing so that it evidently was a customary act!
                    They talked about various relatives that Emily knew and many were the h's added
                    to various words - always "haint" and "hit" for "it"! Well I was just so
                    interested I couldn't keep from staring a little but not half as much as I
                    wanted to. We got back about 6:30 and as Miss B. & Aunt Lizzie were through we scared up our lunch and ate at the
                    table on the back porch - Then I rustled around & cleaned up for revival
                    meeting at 8 p.m. Oh my! the church was full - two hundred or more - the
                    youngsters seem to be the ones who go to the mourner's bench - There were four
                    little girls and three boys - they cry and cry - it's awfully pathetic. This
                    morning Emily & Miss B. went to the Sunday School while I finished
                    unpacking - then by ten Aunt Lizzie & I started for church which lasted
                    until noon - It was worse than the night before - as they all got wound up
                    towards the last & wept & shook hands all around! There is
                    service again going on now - it began at 3:30 - and another one tonight - We
                    have to go again to- night - The services
                    have been all week - a man from Knoxville conducting them - The church is just
                    beyond the school on the road - and is a white building with the usual noisy
                    bell - plain ceiled walls & ceiling inside - Miss B. played the organ
                    this a.m.Well I was glad to go to bed last night and am going to take a nap now - it's
                    bright and sunny again but is lovely & cool nights & mornings -
                    altitude about 2000 I believe - Hills or rather  all around us - and a great field of corn just back of the house -School begins at 8 in the morning and closes for the morning revival service
                    continuing in the  I believe we are ex -  pected
                    to take the youngsters down in the   Shall have the upper grade - the third
                    teacher is from Sevierville and will have domestic science - Miss B. has not yet
                    found a man teacher and doesn't know how big the school will be - or what we are
                    to do as yet - So shall tell you about that later.It is now nearly eleven - had a long nap - then dressed - had supper - Abbie
                    Runyan - the other teacher came from Sevierville tonight - She lives there and
                    has been to a college at Maryville something like a Normal School - She seems
                    very sweet & is quite young - was here the last 2 mo. of school
                    & will stay until they find someone else to take the domestic science
                    permanently - We went to revival again which lasted a good two hours - must
                    finish this up & get to bed - will you please see if you can get a book
                    for me - and if you can't get it ask Pirrel's - (?)
                    bookstore to send for it and have it forwarded to me or else get me the name of
                    the publishing house & price and I'll send direct - It's that book Miss
                    Holroyd lent me - games - and is called "Ice Breakers" by Edna Geisler. Then
                    Emily and I are talking about getting up a play & I wondered if my fair
                    cousin could "root" around & find one or send me the name of a
                    publishing house - We'd like one for girls - from 10 yrs. old up to 15 or 16 -
                    with or without music - She might see if she could find one that would do for
                    both boys & girls-Did you ever ask about my bank balance Jane - it ought to be about $4. I forsee a
                    busy year ahead but think in fact  it's going
                    to be very enjoyable - but lacking many of the
                    comforts of home - Expect to wash out my little union suits myself - also my
                    gingham as Miss B. says it's safer as they are apt to fade things. 50 cents for
                    the wash. I'm anxious to get another letter as the last arrived a week ago
                    tomorrow (Monday) The revival has taken a lot of time - a long session last
                    night & two today but after that is over it will be less rushed and I
                    hope to write again in a day or so & describe the house - the school
                    & my room -Have not stopped to peruse this hasty scribble so know not how it sounds - was
                    very sleepy & hot while writing it so there may be many mistakes - Wore
                    my white voile & yarn trimmed hat today & my new gray tonight
                    & last night - With just lots & lots of love to all and kisses
                    too - Ruth. 
                
                    Dearest family - Well I'm arrived - unpacked and settled at the Settlement School
                    and will proceed to unfold my life history from the time of mailing the last
                    letter at Indianapolis - or rather giving it to a girl who got off there and
                    offered to mail it in town for me - which no doubt she did. After passing for
                    hours through almost continuous and constant cornfields we arrived at Cincinnati
                    about 6:30 p.m. A red cap carried my luggage for me to the checking station and
                    then I went to the dining room and got some food as I was exceedingly hungry. It
                    was pretty good and better than I had anticipated. After that I strolled up town
                    following the most respectable looking whites - all around the depot seems to be
                    the colored section and lots of it too. The nice stores are quite a little
                    distance from the depot & though I saw only a small part - was satisfied
                    
        
        Page 03 :  
        
        to get back to the depot about 8 p.m. The
                    streets are quite narrow and were full of people - movies going full blast - I
                    went as far as a large public square adorned with a huge fountain. The depot is
                    a large old fashioned stone building overflowing with people also so my
                    impression of Cincinnati was that is quite a large busy city - not as big as
                    Seattle but larger than Tacoma. The Louisville & Nashville was due to
                    leave at 8:30 but since it was made up at Cincinnati I could get on at 8 which I
                    did having previously fortified myself with the August Atlantic Monthly. It was
                    an awfully long train and only two Pullmans - mine being the last car no diner
                    or observation accompanying us along the route. There were about a dozen
                    youngsters along - varying in age from two to twelve years. The porter said we
                    were due 
        
        Page 04:  
        
        in Knoxville at 6:04 a.m. and knew
                    nothing about the Knoxville - Sevierville (accent 2nd syllable) &
                    Eastern line that I was supposed to take. Well - I and a good many others were
                    up at 5:30 and ready to alight at schedule hour - the porter put our baggage up
                    in front brushed us off and said we'd be there in ten minutes and lo we stopped
                    and remained that way a half hour or so - Finally I roamed out to the end of our
                    car where it was all open. A brakeman put in his appearance - the porter and
                    conductor - and I learned that there was a freight wreck ahead - 8 cars of coal
                    having turned over and that we had to back up to Coal Creek 32 miles distant
                    where we would switch to the Southern Railway's tracks & pursue our way
                    to Knoxville thusly. The porter got me a chair and it was lovely & 
        
        Page 05:  
        
        cool backing along - we went through two tunnels for
                    we were right in the mountains - at least that's what they are called here - and
                    they are just like the pictures - many pointed - perfect cones - and others
                    rounding & larger all densely wooded - and the air! It's an absolutely
                    different woodsy smell from our forests - more medicinal - aromatic or something
                    - I think it's the cedar which is quite different from our cedar - I like it and
                    wish I could bottle up some & send to you to sample - I asked the porter
                    if there was anything on the train to eat - He laughed and said sandwiches -
                    asked me if I wanted some and as I was quite panting for food said yes - He came
                    back with a towel in which were two buns split & ham between - They
                    didn't look particularly good - but hunger 
        
        Page 06:  
        
        is
                    quite insistent you know - so asked him how much they were - He said "nothing"
                    & thought they were part of his lunch probably but as there seemed no
                    way of getting out of it took them & ate them. He ate two similar ones
                    also. Finally we got to Coal Creek & then everybody began piling off and
                    going up the tracks to some little stores and getting food- pop - etc. Here we
                    had to wait for another engineer as the signals differed from those on the L.
                    & N. road - so it was ten before we finally started up Southern's
                    tracks. We ambled along for an hour perhaps going up grade & finally
                    stopped in the wilds - a long time - This was because the length of the train
                    was too much for the engine & 
        
        Page  07:  
        
        half the
                    train was pulled up the grade & then our half - It was about noon when
                    we got to the railroad yards where we again lingered. Meanwhile it had been
                    getting cloudy - more cloudy - sultry and more sultry - The porter did not make
                    up the berths and you can imagine how uncomfortable it was but all those
                    youngsters behaved pretty well at that. While we lingered as I said above the
                    storm broke - thunder & lightning and torrents of rain a regular
                    cloudburst - so much so that one could not see across the street. We gradually
                    moved on again and about 12:30 arrived at the L. & N. depot for which I
                    was pleased as my trunk had to be checked again & they 
        
        Page 08:  
        
        told me the Southern depot was on the other side of town. I
                    found out that the Sevierville train depot was four or five blocks from the L.
                    & N. so had my trunk taken right over for the 2:30 train and got some
                    lunch. Had coffee two poached eggs on toast and ice cream & cake - funny
                    combination wasn't it - but so good - as the two sandwiches & two banannas were all I had eaten since the night before.
                    When I asked what kind of cake they had - the woman in charge said - chocolate
                    cake - white cake and camel cake - I said "Camel cake - what kind is that?" 
        
        Page 09:  
        
        Then when she said it was brown I grasped her
                    meaning and laughed and said - "Oh caramel cake!" She said "Why yes cahmel cake!" I ordered it & it was "right
                    good." After this refreshment I hunted up the same red cap & he carried
                    my baggage over to the other depot. It was a funny little spot and there were
                    two waiting rooms - one was labelled "Colored waiting room" - so I felt I was
                    really in the South. The train reminded me of that one going to
                    Ilunco- only the coaches are not quite so narrow &
                    there are only two - I rode just back of the engine - which squeaked &
                    heaved and grunted all the way - The other passengers were typical country
                    people. 
        
        Page 10:  
        
        The scenery was very pretty but the
                    same funny little hills that I had seen all day with an occasional patch of corn
                    and farmhouses - very crude - and some of logs with stone chimney at one end -
                    just like the pictures in the Arrow - the women wearing sunbonnets &
                    dark colorless dresses - they themselves ditto. Finally I put my coats on my bag
                    at the end of the seat & curling up went to sleep. About 4:30 we got to
                    Sevierville which is quite a town - big red brick building - school house and
                    many houses spread out in a little valley shut in on every side by the mts. The train goes down the main street and way
                    off at one end is the depot. 
        
        Page 11:  
        
        Here was quite a crowd
                    of people and half a dozen cars or more. A little dark eyed - thin faced - eye
                    glassed woman came right up and I knew it was Miss Bishop. She is quite southern
                    but very very nice & I imagine about 35 - She lead me over to a car
                    where were two other ladies - about her age and married - They do not live in S.
                    now but were visiting their father & mother Dr. & Mrs. Massey -
                    Mrs. Wood had her baby with her - a boy about five or six months old - awfully
                    cute fat youngster too. The other drove the car & we - Miss B. &
                    I sat in the back seat - We all went up to the Bishop's house - Dr. &
                    Mrs. B. were 
        
        Page 12:  
        
        not there but came later. I
                    cleaned up & by that time Miss B. had supper ready & the two
                    Massey girls & baby also had supper with us. Their house is on a hill
                    overlooking the town - rather a rambling old fashioned structure. We had just
                    begun the meal when Miss B.'s father and mother arrived. He is tall &
                    thin & she is dark & rather plump - looks like the daughter.
                    Murphy College of which Dr. B. is president is right in Sevierville - They are
                    both very nice and hospitable and I enjoyed meeting them. The two girls had to
                    leave almost as soon as we finished eating - then we did up the dishes &
                    Miss B. & I sat on the porch 
        
        Page 13:  
        
        and talked
                    school. Right by their house is a hill that has been set out in corn - and I've
                    seen others similar - imagine a cone shaped hill covered with great stalks of
                    corn - 6 or 7 ft. high - or half a hill - way up to
                    the summit. While we talked there was a perfect chorus of crickets and all kinds
                    of insects that made the croaking of our frogs quite insignificant - also I saw
                    oodles of fire flies - my first - and am quite crazy about them. I slept like a
                    log & got up about 8 - as they had been up for some time ate breakfast
                    alone - But first I forgot to tell you that the night before Miss B. showed me
                    some "kivvers" & baskets - the latter are made of willow 
        
        Page 14:  
        
        mostly - and I'm sure Mr. Van Decar will like
                    them. The only trouble is Miss B. has lots of orders that have not been filled
                    so don't know when mine will get done - Then the "kivers" are wonderful - The
                    pattern is quite small - & of strands about half an inch wide blue and
                    white - red and green brown & yellow - the latter combination is very
                    rare - imagine the blue & white is the kind made oftenest. They are $25-
                    and hard to get! I shall try to get one! About ten o'clock Mr. Huff came to the
                    foot of the hill in his Ford to take us to Gatlinburg so we hustled off - bag
                    & baggage - For seven miles we had a very nice gravel 
        
        Page 15:  
        
        road similar to ours - only called a pike - and then we turned off
                    into a mt. road - Such a road I've never ridden
                    over - rocks - ruts & holes - then as it had rained quite hard the
                    afternoon before it was also skiddy - much of the soil is red - red as can be
                    like that around Colorado Springs - We went up & down over this said
                    road for nine more miles following Little Pigeon River - which was a very muddy
                    stream from the bad rainstorm - Then we came to a little valley and the road
                    took us past a hotel and farther on and back on a knoll from the road - are the
                    school - the big cottage - the little cottage which may be a girl's dormitory
                    and another cottage where the Ogles live who look after 
        
        Page 16:  
        
        the farm in connection with the school - the horse and the
                    cow - also some nice white chickens - We got out of the Ford & said good
                    bye to Mr. Huff - who is a tall thin spare man - shrewd face and quite advanced
                    for a mountaineer I believe - in the ways of the rest of civilization - Arriving
                    at the big cottage I met Aunt Lizzie Reagan - who is also thin and spare - gray
                    hair - brown eyes - and almost as brown and wrinkled as our old squaws at home -
                    So many of these women are that way - the sun & hard work are
                    responsible I presume. I won't stop to describe the house in this letter
                    & will in the next and will also send a picture as soon as 
        
        Page 17:  
        
        possible - several of them - We three had lunch or
                    dinner together - cold fried chicken rice & chicken gravy - tomatoes -
                    hot biscuits - jelly - and honey - very good too. Then one of the other teachers
                    who had been to the revival meeting came - Emily Burton - She is from New York -
                    is not a Pi Phi - but has been here two years and has primary grade - She is a
                    little mite of a thing - like Mrs. Ward & is very bright and interested
                    in everything & I like her very much - She arrived just the day before -
                    Our trunks came next & we proceeded to unpack - I had things nicely
                    messed up - when Emily came in & wanted to know if I'd go up to call on
                    
        
        Page 18:  
        
        the Bradley's - real mountaineers - I
                    forgot to tell you about Miss Abbott - She - her father and mother drove in a
                    Ford from Chicago to Gatlinburg & have been visiting here two weeks -
                    She is much older than I am and teaches English in one of the Chicago high
                    schools - is very nice & a Pi Phi - Well she took us about two miles up
                    a road similar to that we came over in the a.m. into the mts. - then we three left the car & proceeded a long half
                    mile on foot - it was a very steep climb & exceedingly rocky - we
                    stopped at a spring house on the way up - my first spring house! and got a nice
                    drink - Then we arrived at a little clearing on the side of the hill &
                    there was a perfect mt. cabin - 
        
        Page 19:  
        
        and inside ditto! Papered with newspapers - most of which had been
                    torn off or scratched - a big cobblestone fireplace at one end - and a double
                    bed on one side of fire place at other a cupboard with garments piled on it -
                    & at other end opposite fireplace were 3 more double beds! Mrs. Bradley
                    was a colorless woman sitting in a rocker by the littered up fireplace &
                    excused herself for not getting up as she had been "right puny for two or three
                    weeks" - Emily knew her & introduced Miss A. & myself to her -
                    There was another woman also sitting there but we were not introduced to her -
                    it was not etiquette I guess - Emily didn't 
        
        Page 20:  
        
        know her & Mrs. B. didn't make any effort. Then there was a younger
                    woman - Mrs. B.'s daughter or daughter-in-law - I imagine but she was not
                    introduced either - She had a year old little girl lying asleep on one of the
                    beds - Occasionally one or the other of the two older women spit into the
                    fireplace - very neatly never missing so that it evidently was a customary act!
                    They talked about various relatives that Emily knew and many were the h's added
                    to various words - always "haint" and "hit" for "it"! Well I was just so
                    interested I couldn't keep from staring a little but not half as much as I
                    wanted to. We got back about 6:30 and as Miss B. & Aunt Lizzie 
        
        Page 21:  
        
        were through we scared up our lunch and ate at the
                    table on the back porch - Then I rustled around & cleaned up for revival
                    meeting at 8 p.m. Oh my! the church was full - two hundred or more - the
                    youngsters seem to be the ones who go to the mourner's bench - There were four
                    little girls and three boys - they cry and cry - it's awfully pathetic. This
                    morning Emily & Miss B. went to the Sunday School while I finished
                    unpacking - then by ten Aunt Lizzie & I started for church which lasted
                    until noon - It was worse than the night before - as they all got wound up
                    towards the last & wept & shook hands all around! There is
                    service again going on now - it began at 3:30 - and another one tonight - We
                    have to go again to-

        night - The services
                    have been all week - a man from Knoxville conducting them - The church is just
                    beyond the school on the road - and is a white building with the usual noisy
                    bell - plain ceiled walls & ceiling inside - Miss B. played the organ
                    this a.m.Well I was glad to go to bed last night and am going to take a nap now - it's
                    bright and sunny again but is lovely & cool nights & mornings -
                    altitude about 2000 I believe - Hills or rather mts. all around us - and a great field of corn just back of the house -School begins at 8 in the morning and closes for the morning revival service
                    continuing in the p.m. I believe we are ex -

         pected
                    to take the youngsters down in the  a.m. Shall have the upper grade - the third
                    teacher is from Sevierville and will have domestic science - Miss B. has not yet
                    found a man teacher and doesn't know how big the school will be - or what we are
                    to do as yet - So shall tell you about that later.It is now nearly eleven - had a long nap - then dressed - had supper - Abbie
                    Runyan - the other teacher came from Sevierville tonight - She lives there and
                    has been to a college at Maryville something like a Normal School - She seems
                    very sweet & is quite young - was here the last 2 mo. of school
                    & will stay until they find someone else to take the domestic science
                    permanently - We went to revival again which lasted a good two hours - must
                    finish this up & get to bed - will you please see if you can get a book
                    for me -

        and if you can't get it ask Pirrel's - (?)
                    bookstore to send for it and have it forwarded to me or else get me the name of
                    the publishing house & price and I'll send direct - It's that book Miss
                    Holroyd lent me - games - and is called "Ice Breakers" by Edna Geisler. Then
                    Emily and I are talking about getting up a play & I wondered if my fair
                    cousin could "root" around & find one or send me the name of a
                    publishing house - We'd like one for girls - from 10 yrs. old up to 15 or 16 -
                    with or without music - She might see if she could find one that would do for
                    both boys & girls-Did you ever ask about my bank balance Jane - it ought to be about $4. I forsee a
                    busy year ahead but think in fact  it's going
                    to be very enjoyable - but lacking

        many of the
                    comforts of home - Expect to wash out my little union suits myself - also my
                    gingham as Miss B. says it's safer as they are apt to fade things. 50 cents for
                    the wash. I'm anxious to get another letter as the last arrived a week ago
                    tomorrow (Monday) The revival has taken a lot of time - a long session last
                    night & two today but after that is over it will be less rushed and I
                    hope to write again in a day or so & describe the house - the school
                    & my room -Have not stopped to peruse this hasty scribble so know not how it sounds - was
                    very sleepy & hot while writing it so there may be many mistakes - Wore
                    my white voile & yarn trimmed hat today & my new gray tonight
                    & last night - With just lots & lots of love to all and kisses
                    too - Ruth.
