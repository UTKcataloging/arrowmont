        Keeping warm at school - Mr. Cresswell's chores when Harrison is ill - Getting butter I go after butter which is scarce -

        The sickness around here is not so bad & no prospects of our having to close school - but Murphey is
                    closed & others nearby.
                
                     Harrison and his family are up & around -  started working again Monday - much to Mr. Creswell's 
                     I imagine for he had to attend  the pumping - the fires - the wood & everything else that
                    came up.
                
                    No word came from Blanche so guess she didn't get the telegram or else couldn't make it or some such reason. Am sorry too.
                
                    The weather turned cold last night & in the  snow fell but it's been too cold today for more to flitter
                    down. Monday the twelve girls in the drill with Japanese lanterns practiced after school - then in the evening some of the youngsters in the play came 
                    over to get their parts & hear the play - We sat around the dining  room table & worked away for nearly
                    two hours - then toasted marshmallows a little while - and so ended that day.
                
                    Tuesday after school we tried out the play & I do hope it goes off all right - Then I spent the rest of the  &
                    evening getting clippings on the League of Nations &  general information on things in school. It's 
                    surprising what loads of stuff I find - some of the monitors are all cut up. You know I have them way back into July & when I want information for the 
                    debates I go through them. They are all stacked neatly according to months on my little book case The index of contents is a great help & time 
                    saver. 
                    Well tonight after school one thing & another came up as I was late getting home as usual - The girls have an awful spell of embroidering & sit
                    around the fire doing it much of the time. Our wood has been low so that we have hugged the fireplace much of the time. I have four classes in the 
                    morning around the big fireplace in the hall whenever it's cold. It seems quite natural now to do things that way.
                
                    Well I had a little walk tonight looking for butter. Went up to Mrs. Nan Ogle's - she often sells it - lives on 
                    above the Huffs - you go up Pi Phi Lane then across a field & past Harrison's & so to the creek - such mud!
                    All the rubber one sees worn around here - strap around the ankles. Mrs. Ogle didn't have any so I went on down the road to Charlie's where I paid for
                    my telegram & then over to the other store - Calvin Ogle's - where I got two pounds - each a pat - carried them home in big pasteboard box! Well - it's
                    8:30 & I'm going to bid you all a fond goodnight & go to bed - Aren't you surprised - 
                
                    Ever so much of love

                will ease up a little. I am so glad pa's cold has left him and hope Virginia is as bright as ever by now. I haven't 
                         answered Nellie's nice letter yet.The sickness around here is not so bad & no prospects of our having to close school - but Murphey is

                    Am not keen about your leaving for Calif. but if that is what you want to do

         to be made by a dress making firm in Philadelphia & are to cost $12.50! So tonight I sent
                        the measurements & check - & wrote my acceptance so the die is cast! Also asked them to please tell me whether the skirt is to be
                        of cotton or wool - & whether the collar of the waist is to be high or rolling! Wonder what I'll do next? I feel
                        it's rather a wild & perhaps - (no probably expensive trip. It is wonderful of course & I just can't
                        realize that I'm going to see theCapitol!! I've also written again about a 
                        position in the census department - the Civil Service

         commission is the one to write it seems. Am also going
                        to write Mrs. Helmick about a place to stay. Do hope Charlotte A.  will come.
                    No word came from Blanche so guess she didn't get the telegram or else couldn't make it or some such reason. Am sorry too.

                        As to underwear Jane - I really do not need the union suits for awhile - now that I've mended them they are quite respectable. As to chemises
                        you have quite enough to do without thinking of them. I'll manage them
                        Did I tell you that I had a very nice note from Mrs. Soule? Hope to write Mr. Suell
                        again.
