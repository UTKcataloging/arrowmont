                    Let me move on now for a minute about the wonderful coloring. Monday was very windy (a regular  wind people call it)
                     seemed to turn the trees druing the day so that at noon it was really starting to 
                    see the change. All had been touched except the evergreens which seem to grow in long fingerlike clusters down the ridges in quite regular stripes like - 
                    their dark green contrasts wonderfully with the solid golden color of all the other trees occasionally brightened by a maple - gum tree - sumach or
                    sourwood - a solid mass of flame color from top to bottom & then the copper colored oaks tone that down. Well it's
                    just about the most wonderful thing I've seen here - these golden - green - & red hills in every direction!
                
                    Emily Aunt Lizzie & I sat out on the porch steps after lunch today admiring it while waiting for Mr. Creswell to bring up the mail - Evelyn &
                    Miss Langmaid went to Sevierville Sunday afternoon & will be back tomorrow - at least Evelyn phoned tonight to that effect.
                     is rather lonesome without her playing & singing as Emily isn't much at the 
                    piano - but better than I am anyway. Mr.  got back from his  in time to take
                    charge though Abbie didn't make it until last the next morning. We got through about 7:30 & then Tom McCarter & Mr. 
                    brought the  lamps over & chatted awhile - Tom is the most amusing & original youngster you can imagine
                    but thoroughly good & dependable. He has been out nearly all month plowing getting in corn etc. & has been learning his part 
                     as Miles Standish while doing the ! 
                
                    There was a boy shot up in the Sugarlands Sunday noon - by a Mr. Bracken - an elderly man of about sixty - trouble over a still & about which
                    there are conflicting stories - Anyway  Harrison went up after Mr.  Sunday night - 
                    started right after  on old Dan. It was an awfully windy night way up in the 
                     & Harrison looked so excited while telling Mr.  about fixing the furnace at 
                    school etc. for Monday morning. We  can just imagine how 
                    & funny he was. Anyway he got his man & there was a trial by Squire Maples at his house at the foot of our lane to which men for miles around 
                    came Monday noon - He was let out on bail until  (circuit every 3 ) in February or 
                    about then. We were right at the house where  the scene of the shooting on our  trip - 
                    stopped to get a horseshoe for Dan.
                
                    Well I must on with my tales of my doings such as they are. Monday Abbie stayed with us as the Carr girls did not come to the cottage - Rose being sick &
                    Litha not willing to stay without her I suppose - they get mad about things every so often as do the others. Aunt Lizzie isn't much of a cook you know
                    & wondered what we could have for supper - so I made some  muffins & Jane they were about the best I ever baked - 
                    so light - these with our old standby chocolate & some war cake were quite filling - Then great excitement a man come up in a wagon with our dishes
                    a big barrel so after the repast was over down we went with hatchet & lamp & the three of us managed to get the top
                    off & the dishes out of the excelsior - Such a relief as it is to have cups - saucers - bowls etc sufficient for the food & partakers thereof!
                    They are a very pretty pattern neat & chaste! Something like Bavarian dishes - pink roses with a tiny blue flower and 
                    a little gold band.
                
                    We have sugar bowl - cream pitcher - three sizes of plates - sauce dishes - oatmeal & soup dishes - vegetable dishes & platters besides the cups &
                    saucers - Some of the dinner plates were broken - also vegetable dishes & two platters but we are content with the rest. We washed up enough for breakfast
                    & I arranged the table even to the bread & butter plates. Abbie had brought some little pink chrysanthemums from home so our table looked very pretty.
                    Did I tell you that Evelyn had a large window box in the dining room?  It is about
                    a foot wide & three long - wandering Jew - colis - begonia & geraniums make it very pretty.
                
                    I stayed till late at school reading about Daniel Boone for my geography class (we have been studying ) & looking up
                    information about the Constitution for my  class Incidentally I'm learning quite a little myself. We finished the
                    history having be-gun with the close of the Civil War - The Spanish-American War had been almost entirely erased from 
                    my mind & so feel that I'm quite a little more intelligent in regard to my country than before.
                
                    Yesterday we didn't close school but had our assembly from 2 till about 2:20 & then dismissed - Liberty Day - you know - It's my week to have assembly
                    but don't mind it any more - We had the flag salute - Star Spangled etc Columbia the gem etc America the beautiful - Mr.  told
                    about the doings in Liverpool where he was at the time & so ended that part. Then I drilled on my play for a long time & had much fun with them. They are
                     awfully nice about it & quite interested for them! You know I have Priscilla's part divided between Rose Carr &
                    Cora McCarter thus taking in the four in the 9th grade. Cora has the two spinning scenes as she can spin & we are using our "stage properties"
                    now  which makes it more interesting. Have planned to work in the whole class into the last scene
                    closing with a Thanksgiving song. Maybe I've told you all this before - for as you are situated in regard to me & pa so am I towards you both. (No your
                    items in today's letter had not been written me before & was much interested to know of your manifold activities in the bazaar as member of 
                    Aurora P.E.U. &  - also was glad to look over year books of first & latter.) After this rehearsing I did
                    a little studying & then went with Emily for a stroll up the river into all the gorgeousness. After supper for which we had some of Aunt Lizzie's good 
                    tomato soup we sat around the fireplace & read & talked. Mr.  came over and joined us - He is alone at the 
                    bungalow with Mrs.  & imagine he gets rather lonesome.
                
                    Oh yes - he & Tom - Rose & I have been slated for a quartette for the  Sunday
                    ! So that's my next feat - unless the boys don't get over their colds before then. What we shall sing is as 
                    yet unknown. A hymn no doubt. Rose & I will sing soprano - the other two can sing whatever they wish! Today was a repetition largely of 
                    yesterday - more rehearsing after school - Then Emily & I went to the store - Charlie's - for candy - (Is there a sugar famine home as here - ?)
                    He produced a box of chocolates perfectly grand fresh ones - & as  we have not bought any candy since being here we
                    purchased it between us & have had a gay time eating them.
                
                  Dearest Jane - Your nice letter came this Wednesday just as you predicted after I had expected it Monday & then was sure it would come
                    Tuesday - However Monday brought a great long one from Mabel Abbot Cousin Viva & Tues.
                    one from Brennie ditto in length so you see I fared well anyway although your fair handwriting is more welcome & pleasing to the eye
                    than any other! It's 9:30 this eve. & everyone has been in bed for over an hour but myself - I do not 
                    want to get the sleephabit though it's sort of a temptation when all the others
                    leave so early - but the newspapers - Literary Digest & such have much news in them & try to look them over
                    even if only hastily.
                    The youngsters must be too cute & dear for words & would give anything to see them. Can picture you & Miss Pancos
                    in front of the heater peacefully passing away the evenings - am glad she is quick for you have been in a storm center for so long! Mabel's letter
                    was very very nice and interesting & am glad she feels that my letters are for her too 
        
        Page 03:  
        
         and is so nice as 
                    to write me. I try & write pa about twice a week too so you see between the two of you there isn't much left for others - Sunday I 
                    dashed off letters to Mr. Snell - Miss Hobroyd - Uncle Art & Charlotte am pleased to say - 
                    As  going into business with Mr. St.  what sort does he mean?
                    Am not keen for Reedley or any part of the 
                    intenar for it's insufficiently am sure - part of the year -  are no doubt all right but
                     know  first before 
                    anything  Californians  It will friends  Don't  thing
                     hand  work in  for that
                    mostly you 
        
        Page 04:  
        
        make up your
                    mind to that. Why can't he find something else to do in Tacoma. I should think Arthur might be of assistance in that respect. You are quite right
                    when you speak of an upheaval in the midst of the family! But things will eventually work out as we'll know which way to turn.
                    Let me move on now for a minute about the wonderful coloring. Monday was very windy (a regular mt. wind people call it)
                    &which seemed to turn the trees druing the day so that at noon it was really starting to

                    sourwood - a solid mass of falame color from top to bottom & then the copper colored oaks tone that down. Well it's
                    just about the most wonderful thing I've seen here - these golden - green - & red hills in every direction!

                    piano - but better than I am anyway. Mr. C. got back from his week-end in time to take
                    charge though Abbie didn't make it until last the next morning. We got through about 7:30 & then Tom McCarter & Mr. C.

                    with green slip on & white shoes! Oh yes - this is Brennie's news & a secret - she is engaged! Someone I never
                    heard of & know nothing about - widower named Fred Marsh & Herbert's Sunday School teacher - perfect & she is
