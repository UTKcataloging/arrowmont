                    Dearest family - It's nine p.m. by my alarm clock (half an hour ahead of the real time are we up here) - 
                    have been sitting in my room tonight looking over papers that came in my absence & getting clippings 
                    for my bulletin boards at school - all sorts of things. Today had  an article 
                     on the first canning of goods - (by a Frenchman in 1795 during Napoleonic 
                    wars - food needed for the armies) census taking - appreciation of nature - poem part of the childrens page 
                    & article on one of romney's pictures & art in general. At my side are the two boxes - nuts 
                    & candies in your Christmas package of which I partake frequently while 
                    . They are very good & have not 
                    eaten much of them yet. Uncle Art's big box has been downstairs all week & is just about empty enormous 
                    as it was. Even Aunt Lizzie has eaten of it till she asked me to put it away - Evelyn piles magazines over it every so 
                    often says she can't let candy alone when it's around. The revival is still  
                    but is supposed to "break" tonight though every night we have heard the same rumor. Evelyn has 
                    gone every time nearly. I've been once - Tuesday night. It began about six and lasted over two hours!! 
                    "Preacher Baily" is much milder than the two who conducted "meetin'" last summer. 
                    The children are the ones who are stirred up especially. Two little girls in Abbie's room look 
                     the mourner's bench & wept & sobbed violently that night & 
                    I guess have done so nearly every  meeting but haven't 
                    "gone through" yet. We have closed school at ten each morning until 
                    afternoon so as to give them the opportunity to attend the morning meetings.
                
                    Tuesday took a little walk with Abbie calling at the Huff's & last night went  Emily - spent the evening reading. 
                    School has been very poorly attended - so many are waiting till church is over - several youngsters have visited school 
                    this week & may attend. One boy said he'd come if the others would which seems to be the attitude 
                    & state of mind generally.
                
                    Things seem very quick & peaceful here - Evelyn hopes we won't have any more company for a month. 
                    Mr. Cresswell has two boys staying with him now & Abbie another girl. Have started the school paper & 
                    Estel Huff is going to fix the cover - dark brown paper with  the cover of 
                    an old Literary Digest (fall number & very pretty woodland scene) & the name printed - Appalachian News - 
                    It will be read a week from tomorrow. 
                    Much love to all as ever
                
                    Ruth.

                    Tuesday took a little walk with Abbie calling at the Huff's & last night went upwith Emily - spent the evening reading. As yet have not 
                        written my Christmas letters but will get at them this week-end. I thought I'd get a letter to Arthur & Nell 
                        before this but haven't - the book & apron are both so lovely. Mary Weir sent me a very pretty handkerchief 
                        & sweet little note.
                    School has been very poorly attended - so many are waiting till church is over - several youngsters have visited school 
                    this week & may attend. One boy said he'd come if the others would which seems to be the attitude 
                    & state of mind generally.
                I enjoyed your letter Jane so much written New Year's eve & which arrived 
                        Monday an unusually quick transit.
                    Things seem very quick & peaceful here - Evelyn hopes we won't have any more company for a month. 
                    Mr. Cresswell has two boys staying with him now & Abbie another girl. Have started the school paper & 
                    Estel Huff is going to fix the cover - dark brown paper with picture from the cover of 
                    an old Literary Digest (fall number & very pretty woodland scene) & the name printed - Appalachian News - 
                    It will be read a week from tomorrow. Am enclosing the check for my sweater - which 
                        I've simply forgotten about until me letter was sealed each time. I do like it so well - & so does the 
                        family here!Will close & retire or withdraw. Mabel is so unexpected - Is she in Montana by now 
                        or where? And Marie was lovely about the flowers -
                    Much love to all as ever
                
                    Ruth.
