                    We celebrated Armistice Day with just a little program of patriotic songs and dismissal of half an hour earlier than usual.
                
                    Since last writing you have done practically nothing but school work it seems like. The weather is beautiful & bright but cold 
                    & frosty - so much so that our milk for breakfast is usually frozen. Have shed my thin dresses 
                    except for house wear as our furnace keeps us exceedingly warm.
                
                    Friday night was the debate and very interesting it was - the youngsters got quite warmed up over it & one of the boys kept us 
                    convulsed all the time he had the floor - Another one comes off this Friday about capital punishment.
                
                    Saturday I worked around the house all day & then Emily & I went over to Huff's for dinner & the night. We had 
                    a very nice time. They live in a  house - two stories - the front room (where we slept) has piano - bed 
                    bureau etc. - all the rooms have beds in these houses -
                
                    Well Sunday after the morning session was over we got Lillard Maples to take us in his Ford into 
                    the Sugar Lands - about six miles away - where we called on the Prickett's who used to teach here last year & before. 
                    They live in a two room cabin and as they have two small youngsters seem rather crowded - We had a nice dinner consisting of the 
                    usual fried chicken hot biscuits & sweet potatoes.
                
                    Then the next excitement was  for which we got home just in time. 
                    Yesterday was club meeting with my girls who took most of the time learning a song for Thanksgiving - Spent the evening helping two 
                    of the youngsters with Latin & today the play has taken all the extra time. There are a number of things to get ready - have been 
                    fixing some Puritan caps for the girls - suppose eventually everything will be done. We stay here for Thanksgiving & if it's 
                    nice will probably plan a hike somewhere.
                
                    Two men were up from Sevierville to discuss the proposed dam & site for factory which  the school wants to put in. The dam alone 
                    would cost 5000 - Miss Langmaid doesn't know how soon the money can be raised - it's more than was first planned.
                
                    This is a stupid letter but must stop & send it anyway for it's bedtime & I've been up late the past week.
                
                    Give my love to the  & with much for yourself -
                
                    Ruth.
                Dearest Pa - Your letter came this noon (Tuesday) and suppose by the time this reaches you - 
                            Los Angeles will be entertaining you - As to your plans for going into business I do not know what to think - don't 
                            believe I'd hurry about it too much for you have not had a real vacation for such a long time! It's nice you can 
                            fix their yard and that so many auto rides are coming your way -
                    We celebrated Armistice Day with just a little program of patriotic songs and dismissal of half an hour earlier than usual.
