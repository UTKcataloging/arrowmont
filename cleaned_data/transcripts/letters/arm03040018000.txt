                    Dearest family:
                
                    Sunday night again - I wonder how many more before I see you all again? Will be so glad to get out of the mountains
                    and into a city again & not see another mountain-
                    of any sort for awhile!
                
                    The days have passed off very quietly since I wrote the rest of my letter to you last Friday morning. Evelyn
                    left after lunch - goes to Knoxville tomorrow & then on through Ohio - back to New York and around at
                    all the chapters & clubs - will be gone nearly two months. I made out the attendance report of the whole
                     school - my grades - took a nap - then cleaned up my room & sorted over 
                    my possessions prepatory to packing. Spent the evening reading to Aunt . from Little
                    Lord Fauntleroy & to myself as she & Mrs. . went off to bed a little 
                    after eight. Yesterday (Saturday) I hemmed on the machine all morning - you remember Jane we didn't finish
                    some that should have been done. The next excitement was going after the mail - which at present is sorted & 
                    distributed in the old schoolhouse at the corner of our grounds & which Charlie has used for a storehouse. A 
                    little card announcing the arrival of Mary Leanor Shinvers  and my papers were
                    all I got - Saturday is an off day with me. Aunt . & Mrs. .
                    are so funny together. They walked part way down the school walk & then waited for me - they were not fixed 
                    up so wouldn't go all the way - were very anxious to get the Sevierville weekly - the Vindicator and always 
                    read everything - the  deaths & marriage licenses !
                    We sat on the porch & read them. It was a perfect day - then friend Tom came over to tell me about his plans
                    for next year - is finally about decided to go to Georgia again - to school - Expects to haul lumber for Mr. Huff 
                    this summer & stay with them - the girls & his father will do the farming. You ought to see the way the 
                    youngsters have to get out & hoe these stoney fields - They and the women work as hard if not harder than the 
                    men. After Tom left I mended - we had supper & read in the evening - This morning I was awakened by thunder & 
                    rain - such a surprise as last evening was perfect & not a sign of a change of weather was to be seen. Had 
                    planned all week to walk down to Banner with Maud Clabo & spend the day with her aunt - Ruth - but of course the
                    bad weather put an end to all that. 
                
                    So I put in a busy morning & part of the afternoon with more mending - let out all 
                    my white petticoats for one thing. They rang the first bell for Sunday School but guess no one went - that is of the
                    older ones for the second bell didn't ring & I saw some of the youngsters leaving early. We planned to go over
                    to Huff's this  - but guess they all went to the hotel for could not get them 
                    over the phone & Aunt  said there was 
                    - Anyway it was pretty stormy most of the  so doubt if we would have gone anyway.
                
                    Aunt  made bread today - She usually does on Sunday - 
                    so for supper we had hot rolls - chocolate & jelly.
                
                    Tomorrow am going to make some calls in the  - don't know just where yet - 
                    that depends on the weather - but shall get out & go somewhere regardless!
                
                    Mrs.  & Aunt   are so restless - sit around the 
                    fire - nothing to do - they can't read much or sew either because of their poor eyesight - I feel sorry for them.
                
                    The frogs are "hollering" as loud as can be. Such  lovely bluebirds as I've
                    seen - and the redbirds - Oh, my - the reddest things imaginable all over - like a flash of fire - I've written 
                    for a room at the Farragut Hotel in Knoxville - but no doubt by the time you get this & a letter in reply gets 
                    across the U.S. I'll be on my way to Washington D.C. a letter from you at Mrs. Helmick's would be very nice. 
                     She is trying to sell their house so it may be when I get there they will be gone - but
                    in that case she was going to find a boarding house for me. 
                    Will bring this scribbling to a close for this time. Hope all is well with you and that my letter of last Sunday is 
                    rousing you to think of Washington D.C. - !
                
                    Loads of love to you all as ever

                    in that case she was going to find a boarding house for me. Last summer when I visited Hazel 
                    & Rodney at the lake a friend was with them - a Dorothy Rogers who works in one of the gov. bureaus in Wash. D.C.
                    I looked up her address the other day & found she was at the Cochran Hotel - so know of one reliable place to fall 
                    back on if necessary.
                    Will bring this scribbling to a close for this time. Hope all is well with you and that my letter of last Sunday is 
                    rousing you to think of Washington D.C. - Pleasedo!
