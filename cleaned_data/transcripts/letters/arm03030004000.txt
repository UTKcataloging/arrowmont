                    Dearest Jane - Yesterday was the first Sunday that has gone by without my writing you - but as a long letter - two really - 
                    arrived this noon am glad I didn't write. The chestnuts are finally mailed however and I sincerely hope the worms
                    do not eat all before they arrive - examine each with care before chewing! They are powerful good too - I sorted them all
                    over the day I bought them and then according to advice put salt over them but had to go through them a second time before
                    wrapping them. I was struggling with the latter deed yesterday after Sunday School - had all the wrapping paper & string
                    of the establishment laid out on the seat by the fireplace & joy be - Mr. Cresswell came in & rescued the chestnuts
                    for they were mean things to do up - Emily mailed some last week but had them returned to her in a couple of days marked
                    "Improperly wrapped" & am  sure the same fate awaited mine if I had 
                    continued. Had loads of mail today - letters from Harriet Baker - 
                    Lida - Aunt Carrie besides your two - two newspapers and a box of patterns & wooden animals from Nellie
                    Kennedy & Harriet that I had asked sent - as we are going 
                    to try to make some here this Xmas. Know the youngsters will  them. You remember 
                    the elephant I brought home, don't you?
                
                    Am sitting on the front porch in white - though my old jersey coat  is around my fair shoulders & am also wearing my
                    little green slip-on. Butterflies & bees are still in our midst - It has been a lovely day - big puffy white clouds are in the
                    blue sky over the green mountains hiding the sun - but giving them a golden frilly edge - a lumber wagon has just ambled down
                    the road - our cows moo once in awhile - and insects are chirping as usual. The sound of distant hammering greets my ear - 
                    Mr. Reagan is fixing the roof of the schoolhouse (our  - Miss Turner called him - ) Harrison
                    &  occasionally blow up the road under a table bureau or bed for Mrs. 
                     &  are 
                     now going to live in Mary's house - the third one from here you remember - 
                    so our happy family will all be together on the hill. Mary & Marshall with the children finally left for Elkmont after reconciliation 
                    & moved this morning. Peace be unto them! Such a time as they caused for awhile. The Maples family will no doubt 
                    move back into their house at the foot of the road - they have been wanting to ever since school began - Tonight the girls' 
                    club had a meeting - the first for several weeks for they have all been so busy at home I just let it drop for awhile. We planned 
                    some for our Hallow-een Party of next week. It will be in the school house as such a mob usually turns out - the house would 
                    not be large enough. The youngsters are awfully trying in many ways - so shiftless & careless - so 
                     to really settle down to learning things. But I do like them in spite of it all & 
                    their dirt! The people make their living by farming - have corn  - pigs & chickens
                    - a few vegetables & do practically everything themselves - The more progressive like the McCarter family have sugar
                    cane - water melons & make molasses to sell. As for their ways of living they don't know any other - they don't
                    have magazines with pictures showing the rest of the world's ways - and 
                    here is the worst thing of all about their living - They do not have  - not any of these houses
                    ! They do not consider them healthy & you imagine the odors
                    round their houses especially on a damp day - no you can't either because its indescribable. This is one of the reasons why
                    staying over night is not desirable. Then the washing outfit for the whole family is a little tin basin & 
                    common towel. They have simply been shut away from all the rest of the world & consequently are as they are & 
                    the old people usually are fixed - 
                    in their ways - They do not care for anything else than their corn bread - beans corn & potatoes. Pie cake pudding salad etc.
                     do not seem palatable to them.
                
                    As for homesickness - well of course there are moments when I would just as soon be elsewhere - especially down at Sunday school
                    &  It's awful at times - I go to Evelyn's Sunday School class of big
                    girls - so does Abbie! Well! Then I wonder if I do enough here - if someone else wouldn't manage better than I am! There is so much 
                    to do & see that I feel sometimes I'm not doing anything well!
                
                    I scribbled off a note to you Wednesday when over at Abbie's didn't I? Well Thursday was a lovely day & after school
                    in our light dresses & shoes Evelyn & I went home with Mattie McCarter on Little Dudley  
                    (not  McCarter family but relations -) Mattie is about sixteen & the prettiest girl in school - dark
                    eyes & hair & the smoothest clearest skin imaginable - fine features. Their house is a frame structure about two miles from 
                    here - Beds in the two front rooms & fireplaces - kitchen. Don't know whether there is an upstairs or not. Evelyn & I had one 
                    of the front rooms to ourselves - slept on a straw mattress in a big double bed with a feather tick & little quilts over us - It was so
                    hot with the tick & so chilly without that we compromised by sticking out  our feet & hoisting
                    up the cover to cool off then tried shaking the feathers down. It was funny - but . A thunder &
                    rainstorm settled down on us so that in the morning we plodded back in deep muck & a heavy downpour. I held 
                    a coat belonging to one of the girls over my head & shoulders - but the rest was sopping. However it was fun & I got into dry clothes
                    as soon as I got to the house. Friday Emily & I went over to the little house where the McCarter girls & Tom are staying as Cora was sick - 
                    cold & general tired outness - from molasses making. We brought her back with us & she stayed over Friday. Is such a nice capable girl.
                    In the evening we sat around  came up - read - helped Evelyn with her scarf - tan color with deep shade
                    of brown for fringe belt & frogs - you've seen that effect haven't you? Oh yes that reminds me I like the sweater with the belt
                    & as you say probably the rolling collar would be preferable here - the girls  think it will be awfully pretty - so 
                    do I - and be sure to tell me how much the yarn & work come to! Saturday was another rainy day - I swept - cleaned up my wash - sorted
                    chestnuts - pressed - ripped my blue skirt for Mary to fix - & in general fussed all day - you know how I ! Oh yes
                    washed my hair. Then towards dusk Cora started Abbie & me  on a little basket of corn husks - She makes
                    such cute ones. In the evening there was a  at the school house - followed by 
                    much singing. Sunday after dinner I tried to write but gave up so sleepy & stupid did I feel - Cora & I went over to school to hunt up 
                    a song she is going to sing in the play - then we sat around on the porch & looked for birds - 
                    - warblers - wood peckers. Saw a king fisher Friday. Mrs. Hall came over from the hotel -  her 
                    "Young Visitors" then Evelyn & I went for a stroll with her picking up  on the way. He visited 
					in New Orleans at the time of the Mardi Gras - & thinks it a very interesting city. We got home about dark & 
                    I went to bed - not even going to  - 
                
                    Shall try to get my baskets off to you this week - the big one is for you - and little ones for Mabel & Nellie - If you'd rather have the smaller kind
                    all right - but for my part I'm crazy about the big one.
                
                    We are all going in this  to Knoxville & Sevierville. I thought I wouldn't do it, but think a glimpse of the
                    city will be good for me - and soon the road will be so Sevierville will be practically out of the question.

                        some more pictures to send soon - Just flashed into my mind - I'll send a basket for Jo to you. Couldn't get the October beans &
                        lara & persimmons now - will try later when frost comes as they are then better 
                        to fix house - Ever so much love as ever
