                    The weather this week has been beautiful and cold - This  we had our ! Wore my challie to school - with my old white shoes. Don't see how they manage to hang together so
                    long do you? We had a fire in the furnace at school yesterday & today both - for the first time.
                
                    Monday Lucrettie Reagan asked me to home with her & as I had long promised to do so said I would - we were there calling Sunday you 
                    remember. Emily went along too - We got there just  dark as I had to look
                    over lessons at school & then go up to the next house above Reagan's & tell them we would take a ham. Now 
                     that the weather has turned & the warm wet spell ""
                    people are beginning to kill their hogs & meat is abundant. Supper was almost ready - Lucrettie just finishing some doughnuts which we
                    were allowed to sample - Carl the little boy in Emily's room had selected one of his chickens for our breakfast. We sat around the fireplace
                    in the room off the kitchen - there are 3 besides the latter - all containing beds! Mrs.  our 
                    old friend whom we hadn't seen for weeks had come down also to stay so we were quite a party. Really I'm degenerating terribly - 
                    in fact we all are here - our own dishes are so  and where  you go the supply
                    is of course scantier far scantier than ours. We ate off a dark brown oil cloth in the light of a lamp set high on 
                    a pail at one corner. The two girls (Lilly is in Abbie's room) waited until we finished as there wasn't room or dishes for them - 
                    don't know which. Had pork - sweet potatoes - tomatoes (fresh) - corn bread (no butter) pickled beets - jelly - doughnuts coffee &
                    of course beans - forgot them.
                
                    After this we sat in a circle around the little stone fireplace which gave out lots of heat & was very cozy - on one side sat old Mrs.
                     puffing at her long pipe & opposite Mr. Reagan with his. Mrs. 
                    pulled off her shoes & stockings as did the girls. The heat brought forth the odors more intensely & the tobacco was 
                    strong! Mr.  has a mill up Little Pigeon & is very nice. Lucrettie said her father made her so mad - 
                    wouldn't keep any stock but worked away in the mill like an  old man. Their house is really the neatest
                    & most attractive in the  - Mrs.  is very pretty too. We were asking why
                    so many of the men stayed outside the "church-house" Sunday instead of coming in to the  preachin' - 
                    Mr.  said he liked to fish around so that Monday he could make a trade and that's what most of them do too!
                    About nine we went to the next room where were two double beds - In one Emily & I slept on corn shuck mattress with a feather tick over us - 
                    and in the other  were Mrs.  - Lucrettie - & Lilly who slept
                    in their clothes - Lucrettie pulled off her shoes & stockings but don't know about the others! The bed was very clean & comfortable
                    only that kind of a mattress is not really ! The door was open too & we slept !
                    We arose about six - putting on our garments & combing our hair best we could using a chair for bureau - no mirror & washing in tin wash
                    basin in kitchen - no soap but some Emily took & a very dirty family towel - I didn't have the strength of mind to wash my face or clean
                    my teeth & dried off with my handkerchief as much as possible ! 
                
                    Breakfast was bountiful with coffee - hot biscuits - fried chicken jelly gravy ham - doughnuts. But how glad I was to hustle up to the house and 
                    comb & scrub up before going to school. They are all so hospitable & kindly but the way they live in some respects! !
                    Mr.  it seems has been talking of building on to his house for the last two years - and is 
                    going to add a dining room amoung other improvements. Carl said "What is a dining room?"
                
                    Last night I stayed at school till dark cleaning up - fixing pictures - looking over writing papers etc. The room has needed fixing for some time
                    but knew there was no use until after the Halloween party.
                
                    By the way did I bring my  of Yellowstone & the Yosemite? Just can't find them among my things. They may
                    turn up - yet. Don't remember seeing them nor those of the Panama Exposition since I left home but it seems strange if I didn't bring them.
                     Miss Langmaid is very pleasant - chats along in a very calm way much of the time. She brought a lot of grape fruit
                    with her & you can't imagine how good they taste. Something acid like that just hits the right spot! We sat around the table & fireplace
                    in the living room last night - I crosslegged on the floor toasting in my usual fashion & looking over the newspapers - everyone had a book or
                    literature of some sort but a good deal of conversation ensued of course among so many females - Abbie came over & Aunt Lizzie always sits a little 
                    while.
                
                    Today was late again getting  home as Mr. Cresswell asked me to print three Red Cross posters to put up in the stores - 
                    notices of a meeting to be held at the schoolhouse Friday eve - A man or two comes up from Sevierville to talk. Suppose you have been going through a
                    drive too.
                
                    Our pump was working tonight so there was great rejoicing for it's been very spasmodic for a week & consequently no baths - washing etc. There
                    is a pump at Abbie's so we would never be entirely without aqua pura.
                
                    I washed my hair and again spent the evening in front of the fire on the floor. A roll of  posters arrived from 
                    Charlotte  today which will do nicely for our meeting - we have four in the building now.
                    So you see the days have been full again as usual - managed to write pa last night & do a little darning tonight. The next excitement is 
                    Thanksgiving for which I must compose my mind & finish planning my program & the details of the play. Half the class have been out until today
                    when practically everyone got back -
                
                    Dearest Jane - I wrote you quite a long letter Sunday & then got yours and the dear little yarn flower which I'm quite
                    crazy about - also the girls - It shall go to New Orleans with me! The green for my sweater is just right! Poor Jane - getting up in the cold to light the fire - it's not as it used be
                    is it? Had a letter from Pa today - in which he said he did not know how long he'd 
                    the St. John's and that  was going to Los Angeles and
                    San Diego - Guess he is having a good time & am very glad thing there Well - such & yet I have no  on the other hand
                    to see Tacoma! and wonder if I will change by spring - Just don't know Jane whether I want to come back here a second year or not.
        
        Page 03:  
        
         You see as in other days - I can say "I do not know what I'll do next!" Cannot picture
                    myself teaching again as in the past - in either high school or grade!
                    The week-end that I was in Knoxville you were surely a lively family with Jo - Eliza Mabel & Miss P 
                    Victoria & Mrs. McD.  Am just so sorry about the way I don't write people but so far just can't
                    do it! Miss Hebrezd sent me such a very nice letter the day you talked with her 
                    over the phone - she is one more whom I promised to write to & so far haven't.
                    And those baskets - they are still right here but do intend getting them off this week or "bust a lung" or 
					mabrel so appropriately remarks 
        
        Page 04:  
        
        
                    Maybe she & I will meet in New York this summer after all - who knows?
                    Nellie K. Miss English & Miss Bramble all sent me postals from Seattle Institute which was nice of them. East Tenn.
                    had me in K. last week-end - the County Schools closed for it Thurs.
                    & Fri. but we kept blithely on - Emily & I had no money to go & Evelyn didn't think it necessary
                    as Miss Langmaid went & so the school was represented. Tenn. is divided into West - Middle & East
                    Tenn. Funny isn't it?
                    Am sorry to hear about Mrs. Wein and hope this finds her flitting around as usual - Are they
                    going to California?
                    It was my blue suit skirt I ripped as it's always been too high waisted in front - Mary fixed it & like it
                    much better.
                    The weather this week has been beautiful and cold - This a.m. we had our firstfrost! Wore my challie to school - with my old white shoes. Don't see how they manage to hang together so
                    long do you? We had a fire in the furnace at school yesterday & today both - for the first time.

         that the weather has turned & the warm wet spell "broken"
                    people are beginning to kill their hogs & meat is abundant. Supper was almost ready - Lucrettie just finishing some doughnuts which we
                    were allowed to sample - Carl the little boy in Emily's room had selected one of his chickens for our breakfast. We sat around the fireplace
