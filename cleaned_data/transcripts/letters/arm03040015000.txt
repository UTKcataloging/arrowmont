                    Dearest family: Wednesday night again & no word from you since last Friday so suppose all is well! Hope for an epistle tomorrow.
                
                    Monday was a lovely warm day but very windy - After practicing the play Emily & I went with Arlena Maples up 
                     to Lillian Reagan's - Lillian quit school last week so thought I'd 
                    investigate though Evelyn said she always did before the year was up & had gone longer this term than usual. No one seemed to be home so
                    we sat on the front steps & enjoyed the view of the mountains & the roaring of the creek which is very big & noisy after so 
                    much rain. In about twenty minutes or so Mrs. Reagan appeared with Merle the year old baby. She had been at a neighbor's & the 
                    rest of the family  were at a "buryin'". The baby was awfully cute laughed at us all
                    very impartially & seemed to like my green cap especially - Wonder what you would have thought of the house and all. The baby was dressed
                    in dark blue serge gown! 
                
                    We got home just in time for supper which was a cold one but very good - (my appetite is still fearful & wonderful!) sardines - 
                    cold meat - biscuits - jelly - cake. Yesterday the weather turned to rain again & by the time I got home from school was coming 
                    down in torrents - Emily & I had promised to spend the night with Josie Trentham at the hotel so paddled down there a little after
                    five - (It's light now until nearly 6:30 - Think of that!) Josie & her  mother look after the 
                    hotel - stock & chickens & put up a stray drummer or two once in awhile. We had a very nice supper - beans - pork - fried
                    potates hot biscuits -  (wonderful!) coffee & cookies - We were in bed a little after eight after
                    sitting around the fireplace I started embroidering Evelyn's nightgown - Emily played the pianola the room was a bedroom but their
                    !
                
                    Today it turned "brite and fair" once more so after drilling the play - I dashed up Turkey's Nest on to Mill Creek &
                    called at Josie Ogle's - Josie has been out of school with the flu - is in Abby's room & will be back next week. Her 
                    mother is not up yet. None of us had been near them & thought I better go in awhile. None of the trees are out yet but I saw a huge
                     - poor thing - I wonder where it was in last night's storm of rain thunder & lightning!
                
                    This evening have been studying Ivanhoe - ancient history & correcting history papers! One more week only!
                
                    This letter I hope you will consider better than nothing! in spite of its brevity - poor 
                    etc
                
                    Must hie me to bed - 
                
                    Loads of love as ever
