                    Dearest family - Since Sunday no special news
                    has happened - The girls are chatting off & on so don't know what I may or may not write - Evelyn got back from 
                    Sevierville about one today - walking the seven miles from Pigeon Forge - She has to go in & see about her teeth. We were 
                    all so late this morning - Aunt Lizzie said she had been up since six waiting around for us - Abbie & I got down stairs 
                    just as the first bell rang at a quarter to eight - 
                 Not a sign of spring here 
                    as yet except the song of frogs when there is a warm evening - Everything is very late this year - 
                    Tonight after going through the play at school I went up to see Lila - Harrison's wife - sat by the fire while she chatted 
                    on & on winding up by showing me all her photographs - such funny queer people as some of them picture - I enjoyed the visit 
                    too - Yesterday Emily & I went up to see Hattie Maples - (wife of Charlie Ogle at the store)  who has a new daughter a little 
                    over a week old now - Monday afternoon I walked up Mill Creek to the Oakley's as Elmer had been staying out of school - the 
                    other boys tease him - He is back now & hope this is the end of that trouble. Such a pathetic family as they are & in 
                    such a dirty house - the mother only able to drag herself around - six children too. 
                
                    I must stop now & go to bed though it is only a little after eight - have turned ove a new leaf you see & try to retire 
                     But before closing let me tell you that going up to Elmer's Monday I was bundled up in my 
                    coat & my cap pulled down over my ears - gloves on too & hands in pockets at that - the mud thawed out some that 
                     & was fearful going but was frozen as I came back - Then the next day (yesterday) was so 
                    warm that I wore my sweater unbuttoned - no gloves - low shoes! What do you think of that?
                
                    This is a miserable letter but this has been a long day & full of troubles at school so haven't much 
                     - though the troubles were not serious & just things that come up every so 
                    often - 
                
                    Loads of love to all

                    Dearest family - Jane's letter came Monday & pa's today (Wed.)
                    so feel quite in touch with you again though the news is a week old when it finally arrives - you know - Pa's job 
                    was a surprise and am glad he likes it & has something to do - Since Sunday no special news
                    has happened - The girls are chatting off & on so don't know what I may or may not write - Evelyn got back from 
                    Sevierville about one today - walking the seven miles from Pigeon Forge - She has to go in & see about her teeth. We were 
                    all so late this morning - Aunt Lizzie said she had been up since six waiting around for us - Abbie & I got down stairs 
                    just as the first bell rang at a quarter to eight - 
                As to news in your respective letters - give my regards to Bessie if you ever see her - Katherine's 
                        letter sounded very much like those I've had from her - am glad she

        is so contented & 
                        hope it continues - Are the trees beginning to come out & the flowers or is it still too early? Not a sign of spring here 
                    as yet except the song of frogs when there is a warm evening - Everything is very late this year - Spring 
                        hats seem so far off & out of my ken! Did I evermakeone?
                        Think the gray dress could be fixed over very easily - there is so much material in it.
                        Are either of you or both thinking of coming east & visitme? 
                        Imagine when I get through the D.A.R. I'll want to take the train for home - But on the other hand what good will it 
                        do for me to come except the satisfaction of seeing you all - I can't decide definitely yet what to do - seem to be in 
                    as much of a
