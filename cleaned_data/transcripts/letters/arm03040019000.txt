                    Am writing so fast as I'm in a hurry to get started before the rain descends as it looks quite like doing - am 
                     of rain positively - but maybe it won't. Fear if I do not scratch this off now 
                    I won't get it in the mail tomorrow - and do want it to go out. 
                    Wish you could peep into the living room now & cast your eye around - You would behold Aunt Lizzie sitting by the fire
                    picking over wool - Mrs Proffitt is ironing - board is stretched from the other end of the library table to a chair - her 
                    irons are heated at the fireplace - a bed couch adorns the side of the room between the windows - I knew Aunt Lizzie would 
                    get a  in here when Evelyn left - she did it last fall & we had quite a time working it 
                    out without hurting her feelings - a broom also adorns one end of the fireplace - The two of them have been discussing the new
                    styles at Calvin's store - Well I'm chatting idly & to no purpose - Monday right after breakfast Aunt Lizzie & 
                    I went up to Russell Ogle's nearly a mile from here - Mrs. . has been sick you know - We 
                    took her some oranges & "light bread" - and found her much better. It was a lovely morning & on our way back 
                    we stopped at another house to visit a sick girl - she too was better & we resumed our journey homeward - Then 
                     we went along the river road I beheld a young lady & elderly woman approaching - strangers - 
                    They smiled & stopped & I discovered they were the two  who had written Miss Evelyn 
                    about coming - Nell Wheeler & her mother from Indianapolis. Miss . teaches English in a 
                    high school - and is very sweet & nice. They wanted to get a horse and buggy for the  & 
                    asked so I said I'd find out if Harrison were going to use Dan. We had an early dinner & then I went right over to 
                    's & found them all at dinner - he Lila & the four youngsters - I fooled around - 
                    visited with them took their pictures etc - then started on to the hotel after getting  mail - 
                    and enroute stopped at Maple's & told Emma to come & "knock about" with me all afternoon (They say 
                    "knock about" here for visiting) She said she'd get ready so then I finally got to the hotel & told the 
                        Wheelers they could have the horse & visited  with them - Then we started up to the cottage - 
                    First I stopped at the store to cash a check & get thread & found a number in there whom I know - Mrs. Huff - Betty - 
                    Mrs. Whaley & Mrs. McCarter (Tom's mother) who asked me to stay all night & am going there Saturday - but more of 
                    that  anon. Well eventually I got the Wheelers' off & then Emma & I knocked
                    around - going up Roaring Fork & calling at Josie's & the Parton's - got back & went over to the old 
                    schoolhouse on the hill & watched the sun set. Had supper of bread & milk & went to bed. Isn't this 
                    interesting? Yesterday I started right after breakfast to the hotel as I'd promised to go around with the Wheelers' - 
                        It was another  perfect day - and we walked up Roaring Fork - stopping at various places to 
                    take pictures & visit - met some of my youngsters & showed them the pictures I'd take the last of school which were
                    pretty good - Eventually we got to Maud Clabo's & visited at her grandmothers. They expect to move into their new house 
                    this week - Maud was helping fix the plaster for the "chimley" - 
                
                    We got back at noon - I cleaned up & ate - Mr. Cresswell then arrived - then Miss Wheeler - for we were going up 
                     - we visited enroute & took pictures stopped at Lana Ogle's where I'd 
                    promised to stay all night so had my little bag in case the time was . It was & we
                    got Lana & her sister - & went on up to the old schoolhouse & to some falls - Then Miss Wheeler left me at Ogle's - 
                    I  had a very nice time visiting with them - was in bed by eight - a whole room to myself 
                    with two double beds - & up by 4:10 - home by 6:30 - Such is life here! Washed & read then Miss 
                    arrived & we went up to Tom  - had a nice visit with them & wonderful view

                    - am so overcome with it - it is so pretty - Jane and you are simply a dear to do this for me and I shall get even
                    some time I hope. It will not be any trouble to put in the hem - & shall wait until I get to civilization that is
                    Knoxville or Washington D.C. before shortening it - imagine the skirts are movable again as to length - varying in 
                    different places aren't they?
