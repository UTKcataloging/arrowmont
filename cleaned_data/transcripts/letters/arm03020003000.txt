        Dearest family - It's 7:20 p.m. Saturday and I'm sitting out on the front porch
                        trying to scribble a few lines before people come for the ! Said  is quite an affair & very
                        interesting they say. It seems that some of the old timers here sing ballads -
                        ballads of days gone by & that used to be sung in the time of Queen
                        Elizabeth & before -Monday - 4:15 p.m. - You see I did not get very far with this epistle & now
                        the scene & hour are quite different - I have strolled about a block up a
                        lovely path back of our house that meanders through pine oak - maple & beech
                        trees - finding a nice broad trunked oak by the side of the path - deposited my
                        cushion & am more comfortable than in a chair & better yet where I
                        can't be interrupted unless the unexpected happens - nothing is to be heard but the
                        faint tinkle of a cowbell & the usual chirp of insects - there are always
                        some of these latter singing - but at evening it swells in to a great chorus. The
                        sun is lovely & bright as usual though last night was a thunder &
                        rainstorm for which I did not stay awake however - Our land consists of 35 acres
                        & goes up to the top of the  at the back -
                        along whose foot Pi Phi lane winds. There is a clearing just at my back & at
                        one end is the usual cabin while at the other spreads out & up the
                        usual cornfield - But I must not say cabin - house is the preferred name - the  people resenting the former. This noon was delighted
                        to get three letters - Pa's - Mabel's & one from Mrs. Hawkins berating me
                        for never having written her. Am so glad pa is going to have a change & hope
                        he makes up his mind to take a trip east via California - Mabel is sure living in a
                        state of chaos & changing winds but suppose by now something has been
                        settled. Just think a week ago yesterday since you wrote me & I wrote you
                        last a week ago Saturday & sent the pictures with note the middle of the
                        week - Haven't written anyone yet but you people - but hope to get into a settled
                        routine soon. Suppose Jane's glasses are now proudly sitting on her nose &
                        that she has an eagle like glance again - It's a great relief to me to have that
                        knock gone - don't forget about the weak spindles on the front wheels - It seems as
                        though Mr.  is getting quite superfluous now that pa is
                        growing so expert! Any more tire trouble? It's nice you all miss me - & it's
                        mutual I assure you - but am more than glad I
                        came - for these hills are so lovely & so interesting just like the people -
                        My youngsters at school are awfully dear too. It's not a bed of roses by any means -
                        & I've washed dishes - cooked - swept etc. quite some! Shall be glad to have
                        the book of games - hope you observed my message on the back of the envelope of my
                        last epistle - not to get a bathing suit! Don't imagine I would use it more than
                        half a dozen times at the most anyway - but I do think I'll want a sweater &
                        wonder if I better write to a New York store for a catalog or Marshal Field's - I
                        want a very serviceable one - for tramps through underbrush etc. - in the rain
                        & school - could use one in 2 weeks if our plans go through. We all want to
                        go across the Smoky  into North Carolina starting
                        early on a  & getting home Monday night - Monday being Labor Day
                        & no school. We will have a guide & horses for part of the way at
                        least. Mary Ogle shortened my old divided skirt which with my big boots makes a
                        dandy outfit - skirt comes just a little below my shoe tops now - Now I'm going back
                        to the trip Emily & I were just about to take a 
                        week ago  when I last really wrote you - my
                        birthday & a perfect day too - just wait till you hear about it - If you
                        have seen Victoria lately you may perhaps have already learned some of the juicy
                        details as I did write her about it the next day. We followed Little Pigeon up
                        beyond Gatlinburg & then crossing a bridge (of which I took a picture)
                        leading to the house of Lucretta Reagan - one of my girls- we stopped in for a
                        little call - & I snapped Lucretta & her little brother with his
                        Jersey calf & some neighbor children. Mrs. Reagan is quite superior
                        & a good housekeeper - Lucretta is the one of the rouge & ear bobs -
                        & is "sparkin' "! From there we climbed some fences into a big cornfield on
                        the side of the hill where we walked down between stalks towering over our heads
                        like young trees & right onto a little bit of a cabin - the house of Aunt
                        Lydia (Aunt Lydie as she is usually designated) She is a great character around here
                        - basket maker- herb doctor & nurse & always sent for in time of
                        sickness. Mrs. Bradley whom you remembered we called on that 1st  of my arrival is her granddaughter & her
                        youngsters are in school! Well the corn grows right up &  against her house - which is "low little & old" The
                        story is that this present abode is the second cabin on the site - for she burned up
                        the first. Originally it was the birthplace of a now quite prominent man in
                        Knoxville who very proud of his rise from such a humble beginning often took his
                        friends up to Gatlinburg to show them where he began life - Aunt Lydia was living in
                        the house & getting tired of having these strangers brought to inspect her
                        home - informed the man that if he came again she'd destroy the house - Well he did
                        & she did! Unfortunately she was not home & is still away so don't
                        know when I'll meet her. As everything was locked up - & the two tiny
                        windows about 8 x 5 were so dirty I couldn't see in. I took a snap of it &
                        also of her mill just back of the house & hidden from sight among the trees
                        & corn - It's a little bit of a place - but she grinds all her corn in it.
                        After this we struck right up the  side to the
                        trail leading to Tom  It was very steep all the
                        way & in a puffing & panting condition I got to the fence over which
                        we climbed into the little clearing between the 
                        which come right down back & at the sides of the
                        cabin - The trail is over a mile & Mrs. 
                        brought on her back all the lumber used in their cabin - Imagine! Mr. C. said he'd
                        build the house if she brought the siding - I was very much interested in my first
                        view of her on the porch - barefooted in the dark wrapper like dress characteristic
                        of them & mending a gourd! As Emily knew her we were cordially welcomed
                        & given chairs on the porch also - They always sit on their porch - chickens
                        & pigs dogs & cats running around promiscuously - In this case it
                        was chickens - as the dogs were shut up for it's 
                        days now you know - If Mrs. C. met one she'd "clumb" a fence at once! They used to
                        keep  (do you get that?) but don't anymore so
                        we were spared the pigs also. She soon finished sewing up the  - having fastened in a little triangular piece with needle &
                        thread so it was good as ever - Then she took it down to the spring where it hung on
                        a stick serving for a dipper - On her return, she went into the kitchen &
                        coming back thrust something at me saying "Have a
                        tater!" And sure enough it was a cold baked sweet potato - Emily was then presented
                        with the same edible vegetable. We were looking at them & each other rather
                        helplessly when out she came with another for herself. And sitting down proceeded to
                        skin it casting the pieces of skin to the expectant chickens & then she ate
                        it - So we did as our hostess did. It was all I could do to preserve my equilibrium
                        whenever my eye rested on Emily - for it was all she could do to swallow the crumbs
                        - it was so dry & rather queer tasting. Then imagine the picture we must
                        have made! Finally I said something about our going on & saving our potato
                        for lunch & we both gladly tucked what was left into our bag. Really though
                        it showed a very generous warm hearted hospitality on her part. For these potatoes
                        were some a neighbor had brought in & which she had been thoroughly enjoying
                        all morning. She told us she had eaten one every time she sat down - I snapped her
                        & the house & the big kettle by  the
                        spring - These kettles are very common & are used for washing - After this
                        we said we must go on up the hill & get our lunch started. Picking up a
                        man's old hat - her pipe & shoes she said she'd go along with us - I was
                        seized with a wild desire to get her picture again with the  & also a view of the other side of the house - so she
                        proceeded to light up & pose with Emily & by calling her attention
                        to a  which began to loudly sing nearby I got her
                        in . Do hope it proves a good one! Then we went on
                        to the top of the  where is a wonderful view
                        looking up Mill Creek Valley with all the foothills around & back of it
                        rising higher & higher one above the other into the Smokies themselves. Am
                        just wild over these ! Then we went on till we came
                        to a nice clear space all needles under the pines & the hill sloping away at
                        our feet but rising again abruptly. Here was a huge cornfield planted right up to
                        the top - the  corn - We spread out our lunch
                        & started a little fire for our coffee Mrs. C. meanwhile squatted on  the ground at one side smoking spitting
                        conversing & watching our preparations. She talked about various people -
                        snakes -  trees & religion. She
                        refused our offers of sandwiches - fried eggs - & coffee - & finally
                        went off after asking us to take a trip with them to the abandoned cabin of a former
                        hunter & herder - Charley Walker's cabin - it's called & which is
                        about 3 miles beyond their place - Of course we were charmed & the day was
                        set for the following  (last Sat.) We ate with
                        much glee- but couldn't finish up our sweet potatoes after all as frying did not
                        seem to remedy the flavor - Then Emily read & I proceeded to write &
                        write in my diary until about 4 or thereabouts. Reluctantly picking up our
                        possessions we were about ready to start down again when lo Mrs. C. loomed before us
                        on her way to the cornfield - We refused a pressing invitation to go with her -
                        & parting on our separate ways stopped to see Mr.  - Tom who had returned. He knows all the places  for miles around here since he is a trapper & as Emily says
                        is "rich & rare"! They have lived in that cabin for twenty years &
                        their children grown & married are away so company is a great joy I imagine.
                        When he met me he said - "Well you are feeling pretty  I reckon?" He meant  not . Stout is used that way quite frequently. The trail
                        was much shorter going back or so it seemed & we decided to call on the
                        Whaley family. There are a great many of these Whaley's - some in my room but not of
                        this particular branch - There are four boys - of whom I'm to make a picture some
                        day soon. They are awfully cute roguish looking little scamps - too young for my
                        room - but the mischief sticks out so I had noticed them right at the beginning of
                        school. Here we were loaded up with apples & finally reached home about
                        dinner time - pleased as Punch over our adventures. Now I'm going to skip the week
                        for the time being & tell about our expedition to Charley Walker's Cabin day
                        be- fore yesterday which came off according to
                        schedule. There were loads of reasons why we might better have stayed home all day
                        but I just didn't want to spoil a grand chance even though Mrs. Helmick was here -
                        the house dirty - Evelyn busy getting the house ready for the boy's dorm - letters
                        to write - washing to do - books to study etc!! So by 7:40 we were off - in our
                        boots - khakhi skirts - white waists- Panama hats & Emily's little bag in
                        which was first my kodak - extra films - diary - pencil - two hard boiled eggs
                        & half a dozen meat & blackberry jam sandwiches - As it looked
                        & felt like rain we had our coats & sweaters - In 40 minutes we
                        were being welcomed at the  porch - by nine we were
                        climbing the hill - single file - Mr. C.  pickaxe over his shoulder - little
                        knapsack & hunting horn (oxen) for his dogs over his shoulder & the
                        two hounds at his feet - let out for the occasion & tickled to death too!
                        Next came little  Emily - followed by Mrs. C. with her
                        same old hat - dingy dress & apron - tennis shoes on her feet - &
                        basket over arm - bewailing the fact that she hadn't put on a  & hoping we wouldn't see any rattlers & that a
                        storm wouldn't blow up! Next was I! We climbed the fence & started on the
                        longest 3 miles tramp up & down & along the tops of ridges with
                        wonderful glimpses of the  - finally left the
                        trail & struck right into the undergrowth going down a ridge &
                        through a grove of their  - the largest east of
                        the Rockies they tell me - huge poplars & chestnuts - about 5  in diameter & 60 to 70  high Mr. C. estimated. They are so straight & the branches high
                        - high above - It had showered occasionally but the trees were thick so we didn't
                        get really wet. Moreover we were thankful to have left our wraps at the  as it was quite warm walking - About 11 we
                        arrived at a little  "holler" where was a spring
                        & a lean to all that's left of the original cabin - At one side was an
                        immense chestnut log where we girls immediately climbed up while Mrs. C. sat on a
                        board in front of the lean - to & Mr. C. taking some pine splinters started a
                        grand big fire as there were some partly burned logs all ready to light up again -
                        After a good hot blaze was started our companions produced pipes & tobacco
                        & lighted them at the fire - Mrs. C. carries her "baccy" in the pocket of
                        her apron - and by the way its their own production too. Some tobacco plants are
                        blossoming in front of their house now - & leaves bound together are drying
                        in a little open shed by the dog's home - The two hounds are named Sing &
                        Lead & en route strayed off into the woods where we could hear them barking
                        at ground hogs- possums & foxes - Picture it! I may be eating ground hog
                        some time as it's quite a common beast "I "!
                        Occasionally Mr. C. blew his ox horn to call them back - They are very well be- haved animals too. To return to the group around the
                        fire as it got light and the sun came out I snapped several pictures - of them
                        & the place. Next Mrs. C. put on a pail of water into which were cast
                        several handfuls of coffee - and as it began boiling very soon we brought forth our
                        food supplies - Fortunately she had in her basket great cakes of corn meal - bacon
                        & . The corn bread was the genuine
                        thing - corn meal mixed with water (no salt -soda -milk -nothing else) & you
                        can't imagine how delicious it tasted with hot crisp pieces of bacon on top of it -
                        which Mr. C. had toasted on sticks - The coffee was almost black it was so strong
                        but I enjoyed 3 large cupfuls of it minus cream & sugar - The sweetbread is
                        like the plain cookies some people make - thick & rather soft - no cinnamon
                        however - you can't imagine what fun it was sitting near that crackling fire on a
                        board with another for the table - the lean to over our heads & those two
                        quaint old people for company beings from another
                        world they certainly are - Shortly after our good lunch & it was more than
                        good though maybe it doesn't sound so - the rain came down but we were under cover
                        & very comfortable. I got out my diary & wrote & talked
                        & listened to them for they got started on days gone by - Mr. C. came from a
                        place up in the  called Sheep-Pen while Mrs. C.
                        who was one of the many Ogles - is a real pioneer & belonged to the first
                        family of O's  to arrive & I think about the first in Gatlinburg -
                        They spun & wove all their own clothes & wore homemade shoes - Mrs.
                        C. had her first "store shoes" after she was married & Mr. C. his first
                        "store pants" at that time - Salt was practically the only thing they had to buy -
                        It must have been nearly 3 or 3:30 before we started back. We got to their cabin in
                        an hour & a half with no stops to rest - & were soaked by that time.
                        It rained some but the wet undergrowth caused the greater part of our dampness - for
                        in places we pushed right through dripping bushes & trees - They insisted
                        on our coming in & at least drying ourselves
                        before continuing our journey. We did go in a few minutes just to get our wraps
                        & say goodbye - & now listen with both ears to the next items - Mrs.
                        C. had  (they never say  clothes but always ) & was
                        taking off her shoes & stockings when Mr. C. suddenly from somewhere
                        produced a flask full of what appeared to me . He
                        held it out to me & sort of laughed & said it was something to
                        prevent a cold - ! Honest to goodness ! Well of course I  & took a small sip - it really is the strongest
                        stuff! Emily said Aunt Lizzie's was quite mild in comparison - Mrs. C. remarked that
                        she didn't know where it came from but just took it without question when it was
                        around. Said that she didn't want us to say anything about it - to anyone for it
                        might get them into trouble. It was very hard to get away from them for they just
                        insisted on our having more moonshine - staying all night or at least sitting down
                        until the rain stopped & drying out a little. We went on though & got home about 5 in the sunshine! Pleased!
                         charmed with the whole day - Now to return to a
                        week ago Sunday - Evelyn was in Sevierville & Emily & I scuttled
                        around the house all day alone - Aunt Lizzie being with her son's family at the
                        Glades in Sugar Land! It was a real day of labor - a little washing - pressing of
                        wrinkled garments - mending - cleaning my room - cleaning my silver - studying -
                        letters to Betty & Victoria etc. until 5 p.m. Then we sat on the porch
                        & watched a thunder storm come up - Mary Ogle & her two youngsters
                        were here off & on - I went to bed early - Monday after a busy day at school
                        - Emily & I go up the Roarin' Fork road & call on two Reagan
                        families - two of whose girls are in my room & very sweet girls they are -
                        These houses were better than some of the others too. Evelyn is home that night
                        & we 3 girls get dinner & clean up afterwards sitting on the porch -
                        A Ford arrives in which are 2 Sevierville people - Do you remember my speaking of a
                        Mrs. Blanche Wood who had the cute baby at Evelyn's? Dr. Massey - her father & her husband were the guests & stayed all
                        night going off fishing after breakfast. Four of the girls get settled in the
                        cottage with Abbie that day also - Tues. it was hustle at school as usual &
                        in the  after dismissal we make calls again. This day we went up the road back
                        of the house - Pi Phi lane - & branching off from it struck Baskin Creek
                        road & came to a real  cabin in front of
                        which sat a regular old witch of a grandmother chewing a snuff stick - toothless
                        thin as a skeleton - brown & wrinkled - Inside were the usual dirty looking
                        beds - they are always made up though - & on one lay an old man asleep with
                        his hat over his face. A chicken was scratching around on the floor under this same
                        bed - Some dogs - & kittens were at the doorstep & youngsters who go
                        to school - the mother wasn't home. From here we went a little ways farther to
                        another cabin where the family & neighbors were all clustered  on the porch doing nothing just . This was the home of Martha Whaley who washes -
                        Her old mother is partly paralyzed & feeble minded but she wants us to  a picture of her - as the only one she has was taken
                        when the mother was a little girl & Martha says (quite truly) that it
                        doesn't look much like her now! Then I stopped at the Huff's a minute as one of the
                        boys had been absent & after that we came back into town & went to a
                        little frame cottage near here where lives the Andy Ogle family - Andy is an old
                        white-bearded picturesque looking man & is the brother of our Mrs.  his daughter Cora is in my room & the son
                        Bill who has since dropped out - no fault of mine however - just "isn't interested
                        in school -"! Then Wednesday it's school again with Evelyn gone to Sevierville till
                        next day - Emily & I call on Harrison's family - up Roarin' Fork - Harrison
                        is the man about the place you know - must get his picture taken too. She &
                        the youngsters with a neighbor & family were as usual all sitting idly on
                        the front porch while down below scratched the chickens & gamboled the little pigs while the mother pig snorted over some
                        delicacy under the porch - Really this sounds awful I expect but their houses are so
                        picturesque & the green setting everywhere so beautiful that you don't mind
                        the dirt & smells - The people are interesting too & I thoroughly
                        enjoyed these ! We stop at another house on the
                        Roarin' Fork & get home very hungry - We root around & proceed to
                        get our repast ready on the oil stove - hot chocolate & creamed salmon. We
                        both planned to go to bed early when Mary came with the news that Mrs. Helmick was
                        at the hotel. Of course that meant clean up & go over to see her. During
                        this process she arrived with Mrs. Huff - so we cut short our dolling up &
                        went downstairs as soon as possible - You know Mrs. Helmick is a grand Pi Phi -
                        The wife of Gen. Helmick & has been stationed all over the world I guess -
                        the school has been her great work & for the first five or six  of its existence she was its main spring - She lived
                        here among the people & greatly endeared herself to all of them. She is
                        wonderfully fine & was not in the least dis- appointed in her - At present is living in  where she has done war work & came down just for a
                        fleeting visit for her husband will return from France any time now. We went to the
                        hotel with them for a little while so it was not early to bed after all -  she talks to the youngsters at assembly - after
                        school we all visit on the porch and the day just goes like the others - talking
                        eating & working- no time for reading or writing -  noon I go home to find Dr. Bishop & Mr. Wood again on their way
                        to fish & Harrison's little boy is stretched out on the couch with a broken
                        leg. He had either fallen or been pushed off the school porch - is about 6  old - Dr. Massey came up & set it & he
                        is doing as well as can be expected - it was a clean break so will mend all right -
                        This was the day for our open house for Mrs. Helmick - too. She was there of course
                        all  - for supper & the evening - The young people came in the  - singing & the usual games were played - spin the platter - bird beast or fish
                        - etc. All home by 10 - Saturday you know about up to the beginning of my telling
                        you about the  - And as it's just so late & I
                        must get up early am going to stop for now & if I don't get to finish this
                        in the  will just send it along & begin my next from where I leave off -
                        It seems to take a long time for our letters to get across - shall try to write the
                        relatives this week some time - Please don't mind my lumping you all in one letter -
                        Arthur & Nell & the youngsters too - After while hope to write
                        individually but not yet. Good night dear people one & all "consider
                        yourselves kissed many times" - with lots & lots of love RuthP.S. You see this didn't get finished up Pi Phi lane after all -
                Dearest family - It's 7:20 p.m. Saturday and I'm sitting out on the front porch
                        trying to scribble a few lines before people come for the sing! Said sing is quite an affair & very
                        interesting they say. It seems that some of the old timers here sing ballads -
                        ballads of days gone by & that used to be sung in the time of Queen
                        Elizabeth & before -Monday - 4:15 p.m. - You see I did not get very far with this epistle & now
                        the scene & hour are quite different - I have strolled about a block up a
                        lovely path back of our house that meanders through pine oak - maple & beech
                        trees - finding a nice broad trunked oak by the side of the path - deposited my
                        cushion & am more comfortable than in a chair & better yet where I
                        can't be interrupted unless the unexpected happens - nothing is to be heard but the
                        faint tinkle of a cowbell & the usual chirp of insects - there are always
                        some of these latter singing - but at evening it swells in to a great chorus. The
                        sun is lovely & bright as usual though last night was a thunder &
                        rainstorm for which I did not stay awake however - Our land consists of 35 acres
                        & goes up to the top of the mt. at the back -
                        along whose foot Pi Phi lane winds. There is a clearing just at my back & at
                        one end is the usual mt.
        
        Page 03:  
        
        cabin while at the other spreads out & up the
                        usual cornfield - But I must not say cabin - house is the preferred name - the mt. people resenting the former. This noon was delighted
                        to get three letters - Pa's - Mabel's & one from Mrs. Hawkins berating me
                        for never having written her. Am so glad pa is going to have a change & hope
                        he makes up his mind to take a trip east via California - Mabel is sure living in a
                        state of chaos & changing winds but suppose by now something has been
                        settled. Just think a week ago yesterday since you wrote me & I wrote you
                        last a week ago Saturday & sent the pictures with note the middle of the
                        week - Haven't written anyone yet but you people - but hope to get into a settled
                        routine soon. Suppose Jane's glasses are now proudly sitting on her nose &
                        that she has an eagle like glance again - It's a great relief to me to have that
                        knock gone - don't forget about the weak spindles on the front wheels - It seems as
                        though Mr. hinty is getting quite superfluous now that pa is
                        growing so expert! Any more tire trouble? It's nice you all miss me - & it's
                        mutual I assure you - but am 
        
        Page 04:  
        
        more than glad I
                        came - for these hills are so lovely & so interesting just like the people -
                        My youngsters at school are awfully dear too. It's not a bed of roses by any means -
                        & I've washed dishes - cooked - swept etc. quite some! Shall be glad to have
                        the book of games - hope you observed my message on the back of the envelope of my
                        last epistle - not to get a bathing suit! Don't imagine I would use it more than
                        half a dozen times at the most anyway - but I do think I'll want a sweater &
                        wonder if I better write to a New York store for a catalog or Marshal Field's - I
                        want a very serviceable one - for tramps through underbrush etc. - in the rain
                        & school - could use one in 2 weeks if our plans go through. We all want to
                        go across the Smoky Mts. into North Carolina starting
                        early on a Sat.a.m. & getting home Monday night - Monday being Labor Day
                        & no school. We will have a guide & horses for part of the way at
                        least. Mary Ogle shortened my old divided skirt which with my big boots makes a
                        dandy outfit - skirt comes just a little below my shoe tops now - Now I'm going back
                        to the trip Emily & I were just about to take a 
        
        Page 05:  
        
        
                        week ago Sat. when I last really wrote you - my
                        birthday & a perfect day too - just wait till you hear about it - If you
                        have seen Victoria lately you may perhaps have already learned some of the juicy
                        details as I did write her about it the next day. We followed Little Pigeon up
                        beyond Gatlinburg & then crossing a bridge (of which I took a picture)
                        leading to the house of Lucretta Reagan - one of my girls- we stopped in for a
                        little call - & I snapped Lucretta & her little brother with his
                        Jersey calf & some neighbor children. Mrs. Reagan is quite superior
                        & a good housekeeper - Lucretta is the one of the rouge & ear bobs -
                        & is "sparkin' "! From there we climbed some fences into a big cornfield on
                        the side of the hill where we walked down between stalks towering over our heads
                        like young trees & right onto a little bit of a cabin - the house of Aunt
                        Lydia (Aunt Lydie as she is usually designated) She is a great character around here
                        - basket maker- herb doctor & nurse & always sent for in time of
                        sickness. Mrs. Bradley whom you remembered we called on that 1st Sat. of my arrival is her granddaughter & her
                        youngsters are in school! Well the corn grows right up & 
        
        Page 06:  
        
         against her house - which is "low little & old" The
                        story is that this present abode is the second cabin on the site - for she burned up
                        the first. Originally it was the birthplace of a now quite prominent man in
                        Knoxville who very proud of his rise from such a humble beginning often took his
                        friends up to Gatlinburg to show them where he began life - Aunt Lydia was living in
                        the house & getting tired of having these strangers brought to inspect her
                        home - informed the man that if he came again she'd destroy the house - Well he did
                        & she did! Unfortunately she was not home & is still away so don't
                        know when I'll meet her. As everything was locked up - & the two tiny
                        windows about 8 x 5 were so dirty I couldn't see in. I took a snap of it &
                        also of her mill just back of the house & hidden from sight among the trees
                        & corn - It's a little bit of a place - but she grinds all her corn in it.
                        After this we struck right up the mt. side to the
                        trail leading to Tom Camel's. It was very steep all the
                        way & in a puffing & panting condition I got to the fence over which
                        we climbed into the little clearing between the mts.
                        which 
        
        Page 07:  
        
        come right down back & at the sides of the
                        cabin - The trail is over a mile & Mrs. Camel
                        brought on her back all the lumber used in their cabin - Imagine! Mr. C. said he'd
                        build the house if she brought the siding - I was very much interested in my first
                        view of her on the porch - barefooted in the dark wrapper like dress characteristic
                        of them & mending a gourd! As Emily knew her we were cordially welcomed
                        & given chairs on the porch also - They always sit on their porch - chickens
                        & pigs dogs & cats running around promiscuously - In this case it
                        was chickens - as the dogs were shut up for it's mad dog
                        days now you know - If Mrs. C. met one she'd "clumb" a fence at once! They used to
                        keep belled hogs (do you get that?) but don't anymore so
                        we were spared the pigs also. She soon finished sewing up the gourd - having fastened in a little triangular piece with needle &
                        thread so it was good as ever - Then she took it down to the spring where it hung on
                        a stick serving for a dipper - On her return, she went into the kitchen &
                        coming back thrust something 
        
        Page 08:  
        
        at me saying "Have a
                        tater!" And sure enough it was a cold baked sweet potato - Emily was then presented
                        with the same edible vegetable. We were looking at them & each other rather
                        helplessly when out she came with another for herself. And sitting down proceeded to
                        skin it casting the pieces of skin to the expectant chickens & then she ate
                        it - So we did as our hostess did. It was all I could do to preserve my equilibrium
                        whenever my eye rested on Emily - for it was all she could do to swallow the crumbs
                        - it was so dry & rather queer tasting. Then imagine the picture we must
                        have made! Finally I said something about our going on & saving our potato
                        for lunch & we both gladly tucked what was left into our bag. Really though
                        it showed a very generous warm hearted hospitality on her part. For these potatoes
                        were some a neighbor had brought in & which she had been thoroughly enjoying
                        all morning. She told us she had eaten one every time she sat down - I snapped her
                        & the house & the big kettle by 
        
        Page 09:  
        
         the
                        spring - These kettles are very common & are used for washing - After this
                        we said we must go on up the hill & get our lunch started. Picking up a
                        man's old hat - her pipe & shoes she said she'd go along with us - I was
                        seized with a wild desire to get her picture again with the pipe & also a view of the other side of the house - so she
                        proceeded to light up & pose with Emily & by calling her attention
                        to a jar fly which began to loudly sing nearby I got her
                        in profile. Do hope it proves a good one! Then we went on
                        to the top of the mt. where is a wonderful view
                        looking up Mill Creek Valley with all the foothills around & back of it
                        rising higher & higher one above the other into the Smokies themselves. Am
                        just wild over these hills! Then we went on till we came
                        to a nice clear space all needles under the pines & the hill sloping away at
                        our feet but rising again abruptly. Here was a huge cornfield planted right up to
                        the top - the  Camel  corn - We spread out our lunch
                        & started a little fire for our coffee Mrs. C. meanwhile squatted on 
        
        Page 10:  
        
         the ground at one side smoking spitting
                        conversing & watching our preparations. She talked about various people -
                        snakes - thunder struck trees & religion. She
                        refused our offers of sandwiches - fried eggs - & coffee - & finally
                        went off after asking us to take a trip with them to the abandoned cabin of a former
                        hunter & herder - Charley Walker's cabin - it's called & which is
                        about 3 miles beyond their place - Of course we were charmed & the day was
                        set for the following Sat. (last Sat.) We ate with
                        much glee- but couldn't finish up our sweet potatoes after all as frying did not
                        seem to remedy the flavor - Then Emily read & I proceeded to write &
                        write in my diary until about 4 or thereabouts. Reluctantly picking up our
                        possessions we were about ready to start down again when lo Mrs. C. loomed before us
                        on her way to the cornfield - We refused a pressing invitation to go with her -
                        & parting on our separate ways stopped to see Mr. Camel - Tom who had returned. He knows all the places 
        
        Page 11:  
        
         for miles around here since he is a trapper & as Emily says
                        is "rich & rare"! They have lived in that cabin for twenty years &
                        their children grown & married are away so company is a great joy I imagine.
                        When he met me he said - "Well you are feeling pretty stout I reckon?" He meant well not fat. Stout is used that way quite frequently. The trail
                        was much shorter going back or so it seemed & we decided to call on the
                        Whaley family. There are a great many of these Whaley's - some in my room but not of
                        this particular branch - There are four boys - of whom I'm to make a picture some
                        day soon. They are awfully cute roguish looking little scamps - too young for my
                        room - but the mischief sticks out so I had noticed them right at the beginning of
                        school. Here we were loaded up with apples & finally reached home about
                        dinner time - pleased as Punch over our adventures. Now I'm going to skip the week
                        for the time being & tell about our expedition to Charley Walker's Cabin day
                        be- 
        
        Page 12:  
        
        fore yesterday which came off according to
                        schedule. There were loads of reasons why we might better have stayed home all day
                        but I just didn't want to spoil a grand chance even though Mrs. Helmick was here -
                        the house dirty - Evelyn busy getting the house ready for the boy's dorm - letters
                        to write - washing to do - books to study etc!! So by 7:40 we were off - in our
                        boots - khakhi skirts - white waists- Panama hats & Emily's little bag in
                        which was first my kodak - extra films - diary - pencil - two hard boiled eggs
                        & half a dozen meat & blackberry jam sandwiches - As it looked
                        & felt like rain we had our coats & sweaters - In 40 minutes we
                        were being welcomed at the Camel porch - by nine we were
                        climbing the hill - single file - Mr. C. 1st pickaxe over his shoulder - little
                        knapsack & hunting horn (oxen) for his dogs over his shoulder & the
                        two hounds at his feet - let out for the occasion & tickled to death too!
                        Next came little 
        
        Page 13:  
        
         Emily - followed by Mrs. C. with her
                        same old hat - dingy dress & apron - tennis shoes on her feet - &
                        basket over arm - bewailing the fact that she hadn't put on a clean apron & hoping we wouldn't see any rattlers & that a
                        storm wouldn't blow up! Next was I! We climbed the fence & started on the
                        longest 3 miles tramp up & down & along the tops of ridges with
                        wonderful glimpses of the mts. - finally left the
                        trail & struck right into the undergrowth going down a ridge &
                        through a grove of their big trees - the largest east of
                        the Rockies they tell me - huge poplars & chestnuts - about 5 ft. in diameter & 60 to 70 ft. high Mr. C. estimated. They are so straight & the branches high
                        - high above - It had showered occasionally but the trees were thick so we didn't
                        get really wet. Moreover we were thankful to have left our wraps at the Camel's as it was quite warm walking - About 11 we
                        arrived at a little 
        
        Page 14:  
        
         "holler" where was a spring
                        & a lean to all that's left of the original cabin - At one side was an
                        immense chestnut log where we girls immediately climbed up while Mrs. C. sat on a
                        board in front of the lean - to & Mr. C. taking some pine splinters started a
                        grand big fire as there were some partly burned logs all ready to light up again -
                        After a good hot blaze was started our companions produced pipes & tobacco
                        & lighted them at the fire - Mrs. C. carries her "baccy" in the pocket of
                        her apron - and by the way its their own production too. Some tobacco plants are
                        blossoming in front of their house now - & leaves bound together are drying
                        in a little open shed by the dog's home - The two hounds are named Sing &
                        Lead & en route strayed off into the woods where we could hear them barking
                        at ground hogs- possums & foxes - Picture it! I may be eating ground hog
                        some time as it's quite a common beast "I reckon"!
                        Occasionally Mr. C. blew his ox horn to call them back - They are very well be- 
        
        Page 15:  
        
        haved animals too. To return to the group around the
                        fire as it got light and the sun came out I snapped several pictures - of them
                        & the place. Next Mrs. C. put on a pail of water into which were cast
                        several handfuls of coffee - and as it began boiling very soon we brought forth our
                        food supplies - Fortunately she had in her basket great cakes of corn meal - bacon
                        & sweet bread. The corn bread was the genuine
                        thing - corn meal mixed with water (no salt -soda -milk -nothing else) & you
                        can't imagine how delicious it tasted with hot crisp pieces of bacon on top of it -
                        which Mr. C. had toasted on sticks - The coffee was almost black it was so strong
                        but I enjoyed 3 large cupfuls of it minus cream & sugar - The sweetbread is
                        like the plain cookies some people make - thick & rather soft - no cinnamon
                        however - you can't imagine what fun it was sitting near that crackling fire on a
                        board with another for the table - the lean to over our heads & those two
                        quaint old people for company 
        
        Page 16:  
        
        beings from another
                        world they certainly are - Shortly after our good lunch & it was more than
                        good though maybe it doesn't sound so - the rain came down but we were under cover
                        & very comfortable. I got out my diary & wrote & talked
                        & listened to them for they got started on days gone by - Mr. C. came from a
                        place up in the mts. called Sheep-Pen while Mrs. C.
                        who was one of the many Ogles - is a real pioneer & belonged to the first
                        family of O's  to arrive & I think about the first in Gatlinburg -
                        They spun & wove all their own clothes & wore homemade shoes - Mrs.
                        C. had her first "store shoes" after she was married & Mr. C. his first
                        "store pants" at that time - Salt was practically the only thing they had to buy -
                        It must have been nearly 3 or 3:30 before we started back. We got to their cabin in
                        an hour & a half with no stops to rest - & were soaked by that time.
                        It rained some but the wet undergrowth caused the greater part of our dampness - for
                        in places we pushed right through dripping bushes & trees - They insisted
                        
        
        Page 17:  
        
        on our coming in & at least drying ourselves
                        before continuing our journey. We did go in a few minutes just to get our wraps
                        & say goodbye - & now listen with both ears to the next items - Mrs.
                        C. had stripped (they never say change clothes but always strip) & was
                        taking off her shoes & stockings when Mr. C. suddenly from somewhere
                        produced a flask full of what appeared to me water. He
                        held it out to me & sort of laughed & said it was something to
                        prevent a cold - moonshine! Honest to goodness moonshine! Well of course I couldn't refuse & took a small sip - it really is the strongest
                        stuff! Emily said Aunt Lizzie's was quite mild in comparison - Mrs. C. remarked that
                        she didn't know where it came from but just took it without question when it was
                        around. Said that she didn't want us to say anything about it - to anyone for it
                        might get them into trouble. It was very hard to get away from them for they just
                        insisted on our having more moonshine - staying all night or at least sitting down
                        until the rain stopped & drying out a little. 
        
        Page 18:  
        
        We went on though & got home about 5 in the sunshine! Pleased!
                        yes charmed with the whole day - Now to return to a
                        week ago Sunday - Evelyn was in Sevierville & Emily & I scuttled
                        around the house all day alone - Aunt Lizzie being with her son's family at the
                        Glades in Sugar Land! It was a real day of labor - a little washing - pressing of
                        wrinkled garments - mending - cleaning my room - cleaning my silver - studying -
                        letters to Betty & Victoria etc. until 5 p.m. Then we sat on the porch
                        & watched a thunder storm come up - Mary Ogle & her two youngsters
                        were here off & on - I went to bed early - Monday after a busy day at school
                        - Emily & I go up the Roarin' Fork road & call on two Reagan
                        families - two of whose girls are in my room & very sweet girls they are -
                        These houses were better than some of the others too. Evelyn is home that night
                        & we 3 girls get dinner & clean up afterwards sitting on the porch -
                        A Ford arrives in which are 2 Sevierville people - Do you remember my speaking of a
                        Mrs. Blanche Wood who had the cute baby at Evelyn's? Dr. 
        
        Page 19:  
        
        Massey - her father & her husband were the guests & stayed all
                        night going off fishing after breakfast. Four of the girls get settled in the
                        cottage with Abbie that day also - Tues. it was hustle at school as usual &
                        in the p.m. after dismissal we make calls again. This day we went up the road back
                        of the house - Pi Phi lane - & branching off from it struck Baskin Creek
                        road & came to a real mt. cabin in front of
                        which sat a regular old witch of a grandmother chewing a snuff stick - toothless
                        thin as a skeleton - brown & wrinkled - Inside were the usual dirty looking
                        beds - they are always made up though - & on one lay an old man asleep with
                        his hat over his face. A chicken was scratching around on the floor under this same
                        bed - Some dogs - & kittens were at the doorstep & youngsters who go
                        to school - the mother wasn't home. From here we went a little ways farther to
                        another cabin where the family & neighbors were all clustered 
        
        Page 20:  
        
         on the porch doing nothing just settin'. This was the home of Martha Whaley who washes -
                        Her old mother is partly paralyzed & feeble minded but she wants us to make a picture of her - as the only one she has was taken
                        when the mother was a little girl & Martha says (quite truly) that it
                        doesn't look much like her now! Then I stopped at the Huff's a minute as one of the
                        boys had been absent & after that we came back into town & went to a
                        little frame cottage near here where lives the Andy Ogle family - Andy is an old
                        white-bearded picturesque looking man & is the brother of our Mrs. Camel- his daughter Cora is in my room & the son
                        Bill who has since dropped out - no fault of mine however - just "isn't interested
                        in school -"! Then Wednesday it's school again with Evelyn gone to Sevierville till
                        next day - Emily & I call on Harrison's family - up Roarin' Fork - Harrison
                        is the man about the place you know - must get his picture taken too. She &
                        the youngsters with a neighbor & family were as usual all sitting idly on
                        the front porch while down below scratched the chickens &

        gamboled the little pigs while the mother pig snorted over some
                        delicacy under the porch - Really this sounds awful I expect but their houses are so
                        picturesque & the green setting everywhere so beautiful that you don't mind
                        the dirt & smells - The people are interesting too & I thoroughly
                        enjoyed these calls! We stop at another house on the
                        Roarin' Fork & get home very hungry - We root around & proceed to
                        get our repast ready on the oil stove - hot chocolate & creamed salmon. We
                        both planned to go to bed early when Mary came with the news that Mrs. Helmick was
                        at the hotel. Of course that meant clean up & go over to see her. During
                        this process she arrived with Mrs. Huff - so we cut short our dolling up &
                        went downstairs as soon as possible - You know Mrs. Helmick is a grand Pi Phi -
                        The wife of Gen. Helmick & has been stationed all over the world I guess -
                        the school has been her great work & for the first five or six yrs. of its existence she was its main spring - She lived
                        here among the people & greatly endeared herself to all of them. She is
                        wonderfully fine & was not in the least dis-

        appointed in her - At present is living in Wash. where she has done war work & came down just for a
                        fleeting visit for her husband will return from France any time now. We went to the
                        hotel with them for a little while so it was not early to bed after all - Thurs. she talks to the youngsters at assembly - after
                        school we all visit on the porch and the day just goes like the others - talking
                        eating & working- no time for reading or writing - Fri. noon I go home to find Dr. Bishop & Mr. Wood again on their way
                        to fish & Harrison's little boy is stretched out on the couch with a broken
                        leg. He had either fallen or been pushed off the school porch - is about 6 yrs. old - Dr. Massey came up & set it & he
                        is doing as well as can be expected - it was a clean break so will mend all right -
                        This was the day for our open house for Mrs. Helmick - too. She was there of course
                        all p.m. - for supper & the evening - The young people came in the eve. - singing & the usual games were 
        
        Page 23:  
        
        played - spin the platter - bird beast or fish
                        - etc. All home by 10 - Saturday you know about up to the beginning of my telling
                        you about the sing - And as it's just so late & I
                        must get up early am going to stop for now & if I don't get to finish this
                        in the a.m. will just send it along & begin my next from where I leave off -
                        It seems to take a long time for our letters to get across - shall try to write the
                        relatives this week some time - Please don't mind my lumping you all in one letter -
                        Arthur & Nell & the youngsters too - After while hope to write
                        individually but not yet. Good night dear people one & all "consider
                        yourselves kissed many times" - with lots & lots of love RuthMonday Aug. 18P.S. You see this didn't get finished up Pi Phi lane after all -
