                    Dearest Pa - scribbled off a letter to you Monday or rather Sunday so that by this time you should have received it - 
                    Think it strange several letters have not reached you and hope they are now coming in.
                
                    Had a letter from Jane yesterday - full of bustle as usual. How are you and what has happened by this time I wonder!
                
                    Such a raininess as we are having at present - bad as Tacoma - but it's warm. Emily & I went for a little stroll between 
                    showers after school tonight down the road - the river just roars & rushes along - you hear it way up here at the house. 
                    Such mud as these roads develop you never saw - slippery as ice & of much denseness.
                
                    In spite of the rain however - a small crowd gathered in the school house about seven tonight and organized a debating club. Mr. Ralph 
                    Whaley one of our substantial householders & citizens is president & Mr. Cresswell secretary. Next week we debate - "Resolved - 
                    that a state highway will benefit the people of Gatlinburg more than the railroad!" I'm on the negative. Our Halloween party also
                     off - and report cards made out & a letter to be sent in to the Arrow so I
                    forsee much busy-ness!
                
                    We are hoping that the weather clears enough so that we can  go to Sevierville tomorrow after school.
                    One of the boys is going to take us down in a buggy - don't know how much it will cost us - and then Sat. we will go in to Knoxville
                    & stay over night - Evelyn went to  last Tuesday and because of the bad road hasn't
                    been able to get back - at least that's what we surmise - Our phone is always out of order whenever there is a wind or hard rain - 
                    Two of the school girls stayed all night here yesterday because of the hard rain - They had a good time playing checkers and authors. Were
                    so cute at the table - watched Emily & me to see just how we used our napkins knives forks etc. and then followed suit as closely as 
                    possible.
                
                    This isn't much of a letter is it? but am rather sleepy tonight. The week has been very uneventful too. Have been doing some reading in my 
                    newspaper - Literary Digest and Outlook for am trying to work a little of current events into my history classes - It takes a good deal of 
                    preparation on my part too you know.
                
                    Hoping a letter comes tomorrow - with ever so much of love -
