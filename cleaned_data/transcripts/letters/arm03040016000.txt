                    Well to return to an account of my doings from Wednesday night on - After school that is about 4 p.m. for the play had to be gone over
                    first - Emily - Lucrettie - Cora Ogle & I and oh yes Abby took the trail for Tom  - cloudy afternoon but the 
                     were lovely & I see my first arbutus blossom - lovely too - Have you seen them? We had not been to the
                    's since our mountains visit last summer - when we took the tramp with them &
                    wound up with moonshine - 
                
                    They were both at home and entertaining a married daughter & child - Mrs.  sat before the fire smoking a big "store
                    pipe" (her corncob not visible anywhere) and holding the two year old granddaughter a pathetic little thing who wouldn't smile at all - her hair tied in tight
                    braids with rags - shoes tied on her feet with the same as they were so torn they would have fallen off otherwise - her undergarment (diaper) consisting of 
                     an old kitchen apron - Friday little Blanche & Mattie Huff came over after school & for the night - I took them for a walk
                    when I got home - We went up the river road & called on Mrs. Russell Ogle who is just recovering from the flu & is almost a skeleton is very thin anyway &
                    tubercular too I imagine. Blanche & Mattie played  with Abby & me after supper - a most 
                    hilarious performance - Then Blanche & I went to bed - was much flattered to be elected as hostess for Miss  for the night - 
                    She is a cute thing - is in Emily's room - Mattie is in Abbie's - They are both pretty as pictures - Yesterday it tried to snow in the 
                    but cleared off finally into a beautiful day - but I remained inside - did my Saturday work - wrote letters read & fussed around generally went to bed early. Emily did
                    most of her packing - Blanche & Mattie were here & there & everywhere helping & enjoying the confusion generally - Little Lucinda Oakley came in - 
                    she had been to the store to get some new shoes & stopped "to warm" winding up by staying until after  lunch - 
                    Emily went home with her to tell them good bye - 
                
                    Today the other girls went to Sunday School but as I shall be here two more Sundays decided to enjoy the lovely morning & walk over to the Carr's where we
                    four girls had been invited for dinner. I don't enjoy riding over these rough roads & as the other girls wanted to ride we were all quite satisfied. So about
                     I set off with my kodak & strolled along the Roaring Fork Road meeting various ones bound
                    for Sunday School although the last bell had rung some time before - They make no effort to arrive on time whatsoever - Saw a number of butterflies red bird - 
                    (do you know it?)  - crows - squirrel - About two mile up the creek you take a footlog and go through a yard 
                    close to the cabin & on up a ridge then down & finally up again and to a long narrow holler after a short steep climb - It's a three mile walk & their
                    miles are ! The girls arrived about half an hour later - Mr. & Mrs. Carr are very "good clever
                    people but old fashioned" to quote Aunt Lizzie - They keep their children in school right along one boy and four girls - divided among the three rooms - They gossip 
                    terribly and have not the fine principles of the McCarters! Litha and Rose are planning to go to Carson-Newman College next year - a Baptist school in Jefferson City - 
                    small town in northeastern  - They have two brothers there now in school - We girls say that all the mischief making - (quarrels 
                    among the girls)  always goes back to  one of the Carrs - Well they were all very pleasant to us & 
                    did their best - We had the usual dinner in the kitchen - Then they got together their small flock of sheep & we took pictures later tramping over the rockiest field - 
                    nothing but rocks - over a ridge up & down for a good long mile to Roaring Fork. After our return we sat around the fire & started home about 3:30 - the girls 
                    drove & I walked with Ethel and Maud Clabo - the latter lives with her grandmother not far from them & came over during dinner. The two little girls stayed for 
                    supper & went to  - Emily & I didn't go - I did my school work & 
                     wrote a letter. 
                
                    It's "now" more than bedtime & 
                    Loads of love as always
                
                    Ruth
                 school closes that morning - Shall mend - clear - pack - write letters - & do some visiting & take a few
                         more kodak pictures - so expect to have a busy time. Aunt Lizzie & Mrs. Profitt will both be here.
                        Oh yes will you please send me my kodak pictures - have decided it costs too much to have two sets and think I had better keep
                        them all in my new kodak book - The Washington D. C. Pi Phis know of my coming & no doubt I'll have to show them the pictures & talk about
                    the school - & a book will be better than loose ones - Those I'm en-

        closing you have not seen I believe & will 
                        you send them back with the others? I do not want the New Orleans pictures nor those of myself or those of the relations - just the burg
                        Sevierville - environs - people etc. Do you suppose you can get them to me before I leave here?
                    Well to return to an account of my doings from Wednesday night on - After school that is about 4 p.m. for the play had to be gone over

                    E. wrote a letter. 
                
                    It's "now" more than bedtime & I must wind up this long epistle. Do consider the wild plan in the first part of letter
                    very seriously won't you? I really would like to find something else to do besides teaching & shall make an effort strenuously to do so - If I do not
                    succeed will then come back here no doubt - unless they find someone else as I told Miss Langmaid not to hesistate to do. Thank
                    you for the offer of money - will need it if I come home but hope to earn enough to carry me through.
