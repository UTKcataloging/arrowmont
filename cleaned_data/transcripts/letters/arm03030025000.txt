                     Such a busy time since writing you last Wednesday! Thursday after recess I sent my  into the shop & put the girls through the  tableaux & I do believe we will get the robes from 
                    the lodge. Mr.  joined last night (Odd Fellows) so it looks propitious doesn't it? After school it was the Miles Standish play again. They
                    went through it beautifully and also cut up a good deal - My John Alden (Estel Huff) wore his cuffs & collar & the Indian headdress through the whole rehearsal &
                    looked perfectly  - Tom is quite fetching in an old uniform given him by Mr.  & 
                    which he wears  to school now - even to the trench hat in spite of our warning him that he'll be taken up for it. After this long spasm - 
                    Emily & I took a walk up the river & I read my "round robin" en route. I spent the  looking over papers - but it's rather
                    difficult to get much done in the living room when everyone else is around - Miss  or Evelyn usually are talking - The poor family about three
                    miles from here  whom Emily's mother sent a lot of old clothes & which  took to them last Sunday were so
                    pleased and Thursday morning three of the youngsters came to school - two little girls whom we put in Emily's & Abbie's rooms & the boy Elmer came to me - He
                    wears overalls made  an old pair of trousers & over his 
                    shirt he wears one of the heavy  undershirts Emily took out! They wanted us to come & see them all again & we must too somehow or other
                    before very long!
                
                    Friday the long anticipated day of the box supper arrived. Do you know what it's like? Well each girl is supposed to take an elaborately  box
                    containing lunch for two and  inside - These are then auctioned off - the boys buying them & eating with the girl
                    whose name he has found inside! Quite a lottery isn't it? But they are exciting events here and at the morning recess two of the girls begged to be excused so as to go home &
                    get their boxes ready - We compromised finally - but that was the beginning of the end - so that in the afternoon practically all my girls were gone - I couldn't do otherwise
                    than let them off - for they stayed out anyway. The supper is no  fluffy affair but must consist of fried chicken - pie - cake etc. Poor Evelyn
                    baked & fried all  morning too for we all had to go with boxes - except Aunt Lizzie & she positively balked. Abbie & I said we were
                    going to put  her name & Mrs.  instead of our own! Emily sputtered around beforehand too as she doesn't like
                    them at all. After school I finished making out  the month's attendance - Emily & Abbie put up  bells while the boys fixed the stage &
                    put up the panels for the play. Then we girls came home & packed our five boxes - fried chicken - bread & butter sandwiches - mince pie - chocolate cookies & apples! We went
                    up the lane & plucked sprays of holly to adorn the outside - We did them up in white paper & found some  seals & ribbon - I had some of the 
                    Pi Phi colors which I shared with Abbie - Then we cleaned up & hustled over with our lamps & quite a crowd was there al-ready. Finally everything
                    was ready for the play & it began & ended - much to my relief & that of the players. Then came the auction. Two men were  auctioneers
                    turn about - the boxes sold from fifty cents to a dollar and half - &  we took in about twenty dollars and a few cents. Tom had found out which boxes
                    came from the house - so we were quite pleased to have our own little crowd - he bought Evelyn's & Emily's - Mr.  - mine & Charlie Clabo
                    (our Round Top guide) Abbie's & Miss Langmaid's - Little Blanche Huff wanted a box all her own so Evelyn had Tom sell hers to them & ate with them. The rest of us got
                    around a table by ourselves & partook of nourishment.
                
                    We left the awful mess that  & came home - weary but having  done our duty. Saturday - we cleaned & then all 
                    went over to school & got busy - Such a wreck! After this I hustled off my Pi Phi letter on the mail so they'd have it for the meeting. A paper cutter came from them Friday
                    which will be a great help. Aren't they nice to send it?
                
                    I spent a luxurious afternoon in the house  by the fireside - Aunt Lizzie went to church & the others went up one 
                    of the "hollers" to call & didn't get home till dark - I had been there & besides it seemed good to be  for awhile!
                
                    Today had just sort of gone & really haven't done anything. Sunday School & church kept
                    us busy till noon - Tom blew in & stayed for dinner & on till the middle of the  - wanted some help on an account he wrote of a day's hunting
                    to send to Miss Abbott for  her class sent one of his productions. She is the who visited in the summer with her father & mother. Have
                    read the Merchant of Venice - some ancient history - had supper & been to  since 3:30 besides writing this awful epistle. Can
                    you read it? Such a lot of talking as goes on all the time! but had to stay downstairs as we had no heat on today it's been so warm we were out on the porch without wraps. However the 
                    fireplace was very comfortable tonight.
                
                    I must stop for now & get to bed - with  &  of love to you all as ever
                
                    Ruth
                
                    P.S. Had another idea as to  presents a little kodak book for my Gatlinburg pictures - shall take them to New Orleans!
                
                    Dearest family - You were all so wonderfully good to me Thanksgiving time - Jane wrote so much & sent such good "eats" and pa's letters came
                    too and then to have that wonderful "round robin" on top of all the other - I was quite overwhelmed & you can't imagine how pleased! It came at noon
                    just as lunch was over - (Abbie or Mr. Cresswell usually get the mail during the noon hour - ) I of course opened it quickly to see what the thickness meant - thinking it might
                    be kodak pictures and when I discovered the place cards & then the beautifully printed page of greeting I "chortled" aloud in glee but had to wait till after
                    school before I could read it! If you are so "sot" on leaving Tacoma - California seems to me to be as desirable
					as any spot in which to locate and if you both want to go there I think it would be fine 
        
        Page 03:  
        
        for you but I just don't know. It  seems too
                    bad to leave the children and all Jane's good friends - Time alone can tell though how things will work out! It's still too soon for me to know just what I will do when
                    school closes - the year is only halfgone! I want to do whatever seems nearest right whatever that may prove to be!
                     Such a busy time since writing you last Wednesday! Thursday after recess I sendt my girlsboys into the shop & put the girls through the Xmas tableaux & I do believe we will get the robes from 
                    the lodge. Mr. C. joined last night (Odd Fellows) so it looks propitious doesn't it? After school it was the Miles Standish play again. They
                    went through it beautifully and also cut up a good deal - My John Alden (Estel Huff) wore his cuffs & collar & the Indian headdress through the whole rehearsal &
                    looked perfectly killing - Tom is quite fetching in an old uniform given him by Mr. C. & 
                    which he wears
