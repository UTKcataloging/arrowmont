                    Please don't hustle yourself too much with the sweater - Isn't it an awfully hard color to work on very steadily? Know I shall be quite wild 
                    about it when it arrives.
                
                    I'm wondering about Christmas - Do you think I ought to send my relations anything - Aunt Lottie & the rest of them? It doesn't seem as
                    though Thanksgiving  so near - and Christmas & New Orleans a month off! Baskets are so hard to get & such a 
                    demand for them too that I may not be able to get what I want for you and Nellie -  in time for  - 
                    it's baskets of course & very different from those I've sent - Hope you liked the others as well as you expected.
                 
                    Thanksgiving afternoon - 2:45
                
                     Got just so far & then had to stop as my brain & hand did not seem to work together - Read a little while & then went to sleep - Spent the evening
                    luxuriously looking over The Atlantic & my papers! This morning Emily & I cleaned as usual & fixed the table - 10 people - Mr. & Mrs. Huff &
                    the two little girls - (Blanche & Mattie -) Aunt Lizzie & Mrs.  - we three Pi Phis & Emily - Fixed a centerpiece of autumn 
                    leaves holly & sprigs of something they call "red bud" - in one of the baskets - Then had some tiny ones at each place filled with the salted nuts &
                    a little  card - Took the initials of everyone - Evelyn's was "Entertains Brightly" - Evelyn's - "Ever Busy" - 
                    Mr. Huff's "A Hustler" - Mrs.  - "Manages  Households" - 
                    etc. The table looked very nice with all our new dishes - stuffed chicken - sweet potatoes - gravy - rice - hot biscuits - jelly - pineapple salad - mince pie & coffee - It took
                    us all morning to get things ready - the Huffs came at 11:30 just as I started for the mail - 
                    It's turned cold & cloudy & snow is being predicted by our weather prophet - Aunt Lizzie - The Huffs are gone & Mr. Huff has just returned with the Ford
                    to take Evelyn & Miss Langmaid to Sevierville - They want to visit an industrial school in North Carolina getting back here about 
                    Monday - Emily decided to ride down & back with Mr. Huff - but I'm pleased to be alone for awhile & get a few little things done. Mrs. Huff insisted on Emily
                    & me going over for supper tonight & staying till tomorrow so guess that's the program - though I much prefer staying here & sleeping in my own little bed - 
                    Such is life in Gatlinburg! My hair needs washing - my stockings darning - & several garments mending - besides some school work to plan - letters to write etc. 
                    Next Friday there is to be a "box supper" at the school to raise money for books for our library & Evelyn has decided that she'd like my play given again
                    that night too! Our program proved a great success - Monday night the stage & curtains were put up - Tuesday afternoon we went through the whole performance - Wednesday
                     had a few classes & decorated  with greens & autumn leaves - having gone over the night
                    before & planned it - the whole bunch of us! The oak trees are wonderful now - the maples & gums being practically bare - Our performance began about one - The 
                    stage was across the front of my room taking a little more than half - & the panel on the side was let down - the other raised giving entrance & exit & the extra
                    space filled in by the piano - big screen & greens - First my room & Abbie's were grouped on the stage & sang a Thanksgiving song - then Emily's
                    little youngsters sang too - next Abbie's class had a little performance about the months with a lot of singing etc lasting a good twenty minutes - Some of the older girls sang
                    a song - then Emily's youngsters gave theirs - meanwhile I was fussing around in the sewing room pinning on collars & cuffs - painting the Indian etc. etc.
                     Mr. Cresswell blacked very wonderful mustaches - side burns & beards on the boys' faces - I made three big Puritan hats & they
                    looked like the real thing too - thanks to my lessons in millinery - It was a job blackening them however. 
                
                    There were seven scenes - & all went very well too - Estel made a very nice John Alden - big white collar & cuffs over his dark blue suit - big wide ribbon round his
                    waist - bows on his shoes & at his knees - Puritan hat & Emily's blue cape for outdoor scene - Tom made a splendid captain - had a real helmet - sword - belt of
                    cartridges & powder horn  - stamped around & warmed up to the part generally - Cora was very pretty in her two 
                    spinning scenes - Had the whole class on the stage for the wedding scene & wound up  a 
                    Thanksgiving song. Several have said it was the best program ever given - Evelyn told me that plays had been attempted here before but that they never went off well as this
                    one did - which pleased me. 
                
                    Dearest Jane - The day before Thanksgiving and isn't it strange to be sitting here way off on the other side of the U.S. nibbling your 
                    grand old salted nuts & the delicious candies and you all getting ready for a realdinner for tomorrow - Who would have thought it a year ago? Pa wrote me that he expected to be home for 
                    Thanksgiving - so you will surely have a house full! The eats came this noon & just knew there would be salted nuts somehow - the first
                    I've had for months - The card arrived at the same time so dear Jane your doubly - nay trebly sweet 
                    thoughts are much appreciated. It's 3:30 this dark & rainy p.m. - the house
                    seems perfectly quiet & still - Evelyn Miss Langmaid & Emily have gone to the store to see about stuff for dinner tomorrow - Aunt Lizzie
                    is I know not where - so am enjoying an unusual calm in my own room. A calm is enjoyable too for the program came off this p.m.
                    & there was a grand cleaning-up afterwards. This was 
        
        Page 03:  
        
        followed on my part by my hustling up here - 
                    putting away my washing - hanging up my coats & gowns - getting into a wash dress - putting my little union
                    suits to soak & then subsiding into the rocker by the open window. Such sudden changes of temperature! Yesterday a.m.
                    we all ate breakfast on the back porch - no wraps either. What do you think of that?
                    Please don't hustle yourself too much with the sweater - Isn't it an awfully hard color to work on very steadily? Know I shall be quite wild 
                    about it when it arrives.

         in time for Xmas - 
                    it's baskets of course & very different from those I've sent - Hope you liked the others as well as you expected.

                    us all morning to get things ready - the Huffs came at 11:30 just as I started for the mail - Was so pleased to get a letter from you Jane - & one
                        from pa mailed at San Diego - I got another one from him yesterday which had been sent to Texas - the second that has gone there - Isn't it strange? Suppose he's
                        home today! and you all had a big turkey dinner. Poor Jane - don't try to do too much for Mrs. Webster - We make a lot more of our guests
                        than many people do - seems to me.
                    It's turned cold & cloudy & snow is being predicted by our weather prophet - Aunt Lizzie - The Huffs are gone & Mr. Huff has just returned with the Ford

                        If none of you are going to give presents to each other - please don't send meany! Everything is so
                        strange - feel as though it  the time  next 
                        any idea what I'll do or where I'll go when April comes!
                        Had a card from Uncle Art thanking me for the basket & saying that they had sold the old homestead at last & were going to the Evanston Hotel - a very new
                        & swell place - also very expensive. Aunt Lottie was keen to get there when I saw her last summer - so guess she's happy now.
                        Well dearest family must cease for this time - Am so glad Arthur & Nell are leaving thathouse - 
                        never cared for it - Give my fond love to the girls & to Mrs. Webster too.
                        With loads & loads to you & pa -
