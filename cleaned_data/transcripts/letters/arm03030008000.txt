                    my last epistle was written on Wed. As usual it rained Thursday & Evelyn still was in Sevierville. In the evening we organized
                    a debating club - Steve Whaley - one of our prominent citizens is president & Mr. Cresswell secretary - name - Gatlinburg
                    Literary Society. We hope it is going to work into a club just for the boys and men - For they leave everything to us girls to do as
                    long as we're around. We debate tomorrow night - Mr.  made out the list & put
                    himself in and me just to get things started - So picture me on the negative side with one of the girls Emma Maples and Lawson
                    Reagan (our chorister) 
                
                    The affirmative - Mr.  Tom McCarter and Rose Carr one of the school girls also - Our subject
                    Resolved - that a  highway 
                    will be of greater benefit to  than railroad. Well such is life!
                
                    Had to talk at  Sunday night too - poor Tom  was all
                    distressed over topic given him so helped him out. Evelyn & Mr.  also talked impromptu like
                    myself - Emily is on for next Sunday!
                
                    Well to return to my adventures. Emily & I gave up all thought of Knoxville for Friday  was a steady
                    downpour but lo at noon the brilliant sunshine so cheered us that we gaily packed our bag & got Mr. 
                    to hustle around about transportation down to Sevierville - He & Abbie both decided to go in too so about three we started off in two
                    buggies - Emily & I in one with  Reagan one of the boys and the other two in
                    the second. It proved to be a perfectly beautiful afternoon balmy and too warm really for  our jackets - I 
                    wore my lovely hat & felt quite dressy! It took us 2 hours to drive the  miles to  - such roads you never saw - impossible for a car even a Ford to get through - horse walked most of the
                    way. At  we were reunited in a Ford however for here the pike takes us to 
                    & we were soon at the Bishops' Emily & I - where they expected us.  After dinner we sallied
                    forth to Murphy College to an amateur minstrel show - not half bad either. Then bed & off on the train by 8:30. It cleared again and was 
                    lovely all the rest of the weekend - Miss Whittle went down on the train with us. The street car strike made walking necessary & we
                    gaily trod the pavement from the station about half a mile or so up town. There is one main business street - Gay Street where everything is
                    located. The new Farragut Hotel - very nice proved to be full and we finally wound up at the St. James - nice enough but not as nice as we would have liked.
                    Well we put in a busy day shopping - eating - walking - the movie etc. It was lots of fun and did us both good - For when we left Sunday 
                     at 9:30 we were perfectly satisfied with our trip and at the same time pleased at the thought of returning
                    to our green mountains again. Evelyn met us at the depot with the information  that we were to hustle up to the house and then on a trip up Wears Valley - 
                    Charmed at the prospect we hustled in our  up the hill bag & baggage - Didn't buy much
                    but seemed to take lots of space - comb & brush for Aunt Lizzie's birthday - some bulbs - hairpins - "Young Visitors" for Mrs.
                    Bishop - (Emily got her flowers) candles  for our jack-o-lanterns - cookie cutters for Abbie. Later the Ford
                    came after us and we three girls & Mrs.  set forth. We went nearly up the pike to Pigeon Forge but turned off
                    there right up into the ruts. Where we climbed in the trusty Ford to the top of one thereby having the finest view I've had yet - and then down and 
                    part way up another. There were a number of the usual cabins & people en route - our destination was Jim Watson's house. We found it up 
                    a holler off the road and across a creek - not very far. Mrs. Watson is going to make baskets - hence our pursuit of her. She 
                    wasn't home but two half grown girls showed what she had done - such pretty girls. But such a place - four double beds in that one room and a 
                    little kitchen! Smells and dirt galore.
                
                    We had a delightful trip &  about two got to the Forge where eventually the same boy & buggies brought  us 
                    home - arriving about 4:30. It took the rest of the day to clean up - put away - have supper and 
                    - start the wheels going again. Spent about $10 on the expedition - all told including expense there and back - but am glad I went for don't expect
                    to go out again until  We figured up our New Orleans trip will cost nearly $125 apiece - unless we can
                    stay at the Pi Phi House or  as we hope to be able to do.
                
                    Monday after school was a meeting  with the girls about the party - then corrected papers & worked my report cards till bed time - and planned Halloween
                     with Evelyn.
                
                    Today as I said before was struggling with my Arrow letter  getting home late from school - Sat out on the porch
                    in white minus wrap & wrote & watched a storm blow up & pass away again. Such huge black clouds but not a drop of rain
                    after all.
                
                    Stopped about half an hour or so tonight to go down with Emily to a corn husking held in the Maples barn at the foot of our lane - where our boy's
                    dormitory was you remember. The Maples expect to move back there this week. It was such an uncertain night that only a dozen or so were
                    there - Sit on the ground and husk - tossing ears up into big bin - might be fun with a big crowd - but we soon wended our way upward again. Finished 
                    my letter - while the rest of them sat on the porch - even Aunt Lizzie - & then we all went to bed - but !
                
                    Must cease for now - will measure my head in the  as the tape is downstairs just now.
                
                    Goodnight dearest Jane - with ever so much love
                
                    Ruth
                
                    P.S. On reading this over it sounds very airy like and also  and erratic - but have written so fast and am also
                    sleepy that you will excuse and know that there is much love with it too - won't you?
                
                    Head  low down where cap would come - Which kind are 
                    you going to make - shall enjoy either?

                    Had to talk at B.Y. Sunday night too - poor Tom McC. was all
