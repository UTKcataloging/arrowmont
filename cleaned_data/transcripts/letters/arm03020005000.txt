        Dearest family - was glad to get a letter from Jane yesterday (Monday) and it
                    sounded as though you all were a very very busy existence. Pa
                     must take a trip now to  &
                    St. Paul without fail. This would be just the time to go east for the worst of
                    the hot weather will be over. She'll be interested in hearing about Mabel's final settlement of her future and
                    the Aurora party! No do not get a bathing suit - as I wouldn't use it enough to
                    pay for the investment! Shall be glad to have the other dress - Mary Ogle will
                    no doubt fix it for me. Thanks Mabel for the list of plays - and  bulletin - & pa & Jane for
                    the papers - In the course of time I'll get them read no doubt. Have sent the
                    notice of my change of address so you will not have to forward any more to me.Jane will you send the recipe for your ! Think some day I'll make soon.The things in my trunk were packed so tight that they did not a  but in quite  am leaving them 
                    in  as Evelyn thought it wiser than  them  in  etc.  
                    enjoy them. Have spread them out so some wrinkles will  away. 
                
                    Had the  of Miss  wedding yesterday - but that is the only news I've had of the people at school - 
                    am so glad not to be in Tacoma this fall for  all the  of it! Wish I could go  for the week  in awhile but since  can't then is  thinking of it!
                Wednesday last I told you of the girls' picnic & our organizing a club
                    the next night -Friday was a most busy day - as  soon as school was
                    out & had started various girls to cleaning up - Emily & I
                    hustled over here & cleaned downstairs & our rooms - hall
                    & bathroom upstairs - washing our heads as a grand finale. After supper
                    Miss Whittle & a friend arrived - Miss Whittle goes through the county
                    teaching the girls how to can & had come to give those in the canning
                    club a lesson in the a.m. She is also working up fairs in all the communities -
                    (Ours is to be in the school & on the grounds Sept. 25th) Abbie went
                    home (a farm near Sevierville) and I went to bed early for me. Next a.m. we were
                    up bright & early in our tramping garb & finally got started at
                    9 (Emily & I).We followed the Roarin' Fork road a ways & then branched off to another
                    road which wound around between the  past
                    occasional clearings & cabins- After 3 miles we reached the McCarter
                    farm where we stopped to call. I have four of the youngsters - Cora - Polly -
                    Tom - (18 yrs. old & the biggest boy) and Birthana. Their house is a
                    frame structure & has an upstairs but beds as usual occupy the front
                    room. Mrs. Mc had been working & was very dirty so proceeded to "strip"
                    & comb her hair the first thing on our arrival - They wanted us to stay
                    for dinner & when we said we had brought our lunch & were on our
                    way to the Glades - Mrs. hustled to the tomato patch & Mr. to the melon
                    - Such wonderful watermelon as I've eaten here! Well we started off quite loaded
                    down & the two little girls with us. We climbed to Red Top - a hill back
                    of their house where we stopped at one side of the road & prepared to
                    eat. Building a nice hot fire we soon had our
                    coffee & scrambled eggs ready - which with sandwiches - cake - &
                    the grand melon made a great feast for the four of us. Then we bade adieu to the
                    youngsters & picking up our lightened bag & basket trudged on
                    for about four miles through a series of little clearings & an
                    occasional cabin where on the porch clustered the whole family just  and staring !
                    Finally we came to the Glades - our destination. This place of picturesque name
                    consists visibly of one store on the front porch of which were idly
                    balancing the male population - while across the road were the women &
                    children clustered on the porch of a rather large frame house - Beyond was the
                    church and up on the hill -  side a school built up
                    on piles of stone several feet - a slim pile at that - one at each corner - It
                    was "church day" - & later on services were in evidence as we left - our
                    passing down the road occupied the attention of the congregation more than the
                    minister - Mr. Watson - the same man who comes here  p.m. & Sunday once a month. Back on a hill from the road
                    with a field of tall corn between stood a small frame house - the home of Aunt
                    Lizzie's son - She has been with them for about two weeks you know - so we went
                    in & made a call for about an hour.They have a new son about a week old - two other small boys in the family also -
                    They seemed like quite progressive people for this part of the world - only one
                    bed in the front room - a range in the kitchen & an upstairs to the dwelling. Aunt Lizzie was awfully glad to see us
                    & said maybe she'd be home Sunday (the next day) It showered some while
                    we visited but by 3:30 it was quite clear so off we set at a brisk pace taking
                    the main road back to Gatlinburg which eventually lead us back to Roarin' Fork.
                    In all your walks you cross creeks so many times - by means of planks - logs -
                    & little bridges - in some places are regular hanging bridges but as yet
                    have not had to cross one - but know it's only a question of time until I do.Pen's getting dry & as I have not been able to get ink of my own
                    & the other is downstairs will have to take to pencil again - For two
                    hours we walked steadily homeward reaching our welcome porch with rockers at
                    exactly 5:30 - so we think it was surely more than 4 miles - and all in all
                    walked at least 11 or 12 - It's loads of fun & we both just love to do
                    it. Mrs. Profit the woman who has helped out during Aunt L's absence had our
                    supper just about ready & wanted us to make the cocoa - So I did - not
                    stopping to change my garb - Mr. Cresswell came in from a ride up Mill Creek
                    & during supper wanted to know if we were going to the ice cream party
                    at the Huff's - This was the first we had heard of it & felt pleased
                    that we didn't have to go - Well after supper we thought we'd enjoy the cool of
                    the twilight before tubbing & going to bed. During this the phone rang
                    & it was Stella Huff inviting Emily & me over - We thought it
                    the wisest plan in the end to go - so the two of us still in walking trim went -
                    some of the girls meeting us on the road - So
                    on top of all our  of supper we had ice cream caramel
                    cake & lemonade - We stayed just a little while however & left
                    the festive scene about 8:45 - Then I felt inspired & wrote in my diary
                    for several hours! Saturday seems to be the one day for that & try to
                    write up the whole week - The little Daylogue from Bessie is such a convenience
                    & write in it faithfully every day -Sunday was one  round! Oh yes- Evelyn went to
                    Sevierville Sat. p.m. as the next day was her father's birthday! Emily &
                    I went to Sunday School which lasted till 10:30 & then we took our
                    kodaks & went to Martha Clabo's cabin up Baskin Creek to take her old
                    mother's picture & one of the house besides - It was dinner time when we
                    returned & after that Emily & I went to our respective rooms to
                    write letters - I finished one to Aunt  Carrie
                    & then took a grand nap -The next excitement was the arrival of a Miss Cochran & a friend - Miss
                    C. has charge of the Juniper School somewhere around here - her friend teaches
                    sewing in the Ashville Normal - both are ! Evelyn & Abbie next came from Sevierville with Dr. Massey
                    in his little Ford roadster - He had a very bad cold & was about sick so
                    E. & his wife persuaded him to take a vacation here. We were all gaily
                    eating supper when a man  arrived from about a mile and a half up the
                     with the news that his small boy (in
                    Emily's room) had fallen out of the barn & broken his wrist &
                    wanted the doctor to come & set it - Of course Dr. M. said he'd go
                    & asked if one of us girls would go along & help & I
                    jumped at the chance thereby escaping the  meeting at church in the
                    evening - The three of us went down to the garage - The little  in the school yard &
                    got in the car & buzzed up the road - around - down & up again
                    till we came near a creek where we had to leave the car & walk a little
                    ways - of course crossing the creek - It was rather a neat place & the
                    mother was very nice - the youngster had broken one little bone - & I
                    helped hold the arm while the splint was fixed! Quite necessary wasn't I? Well
                    we left in an hour or so - & walked back to the little car starting down
                    the hill & then coming to an incline stopped & remained stopped.
                    On examination found the exhaust pipe red-hot - got water - still wouldn't make
                    it - fooled around & tried again - & I pushing behind we finally
                    got to the top & managed to get home. Here we found that Miss Cochran
                    wanted assistance - Her horse had stepped on one of her toes - so Dr. M. got
                    busy with her - Emily & I running around getting lights - iodine etc. By
                    that time B.Y.P. was over & Evelyn came home - so we adjourned to the
                    porch where Miss C. proceeded to talk school from a to izzard till finally I
                    said I'd have to leave the festive gathering & go to bed. Which I did - Monday was the usual poor day - nobody knows a thing on Monday & of
                    course Miss C. & friend visited all a.m. but were with me just a little
                    while during a geography class.After school the girl's club met & did some more organizing - have chosen
                    the name Evergreen Club - colors - red & green - meet once a week - This
                    coming Friday evening they will give a party for the boys - here at the house -
                    Emily & I with the social committee
                    are going to work up that old game  that
                    Mabel & I had once several years ago - We are not telling the others
                    what it will be & guess it will prove a success as the girls who do know
                    about it seem quite taken with it. These youngsters are not at all demonstrative
                    you know - so it's hard to tell what they do think at times.Think I shall turn their next meeting in to a  - get them to bring old stockings & mend them as a number
                    don't know a thing about it - Darning is not common here you know. We have plans
                    (Emily & I) for a  washing &
                    manicuring party - and perhaps if we can get shapes - millinery later on - But
                    that remains to be seen - There is lots to do but one has to go about it sort of easy like & gradually so
                    they won't take offence! After this I took a cushion & book &
                    went up Pi Phi lane - where I stayed till 6:30 - Took "The Squire's Daughter" by
                    Archibald Marshall - the writer who Emily says is very much admired in the east
                    just now - He is a good writer but felt that I had wasted my time &
                    wished I had finished my letter to you people instead - but just felt like doing
                    nothing so strenuous as pushing a pencil. When I returned Dr. M. &
                    Evelyn had returned to Sevierville - as Evelyn had to go on to Knoxville to see
                    about some things - She is there today & no doubt will be home tomorrow.Today as soon as school was out Emily & I started forth & went up
                    the road- past the church & store past Lucrettie's where we stopped first & visited a little as some of
                    them were on the porch & then on down & up through &
                    around cornfields to another house where we were directed to the home of a
                    Whaley family - One of the seven children is in my room & one in Emily's
                    has a sore foot & as they are new people we wanted to look them up -
                    Clambering over a couple of fences (creeks - cornfields & fences are the
                    usual obstacles here) & through a barn we got onto the trail up Aunt
                    Lydie's Creek which we followed for over a mile going up the mt. side all the
                    way - There were a number of cornfields right in this steep wooded &
                    exceedingly rocky hill - Look queer set in the midst of a virgin forest. Finally
                    in a clearing was the cabin & the home of the seven children - a
                    pathetic place but they seem happy enough. We got home about six & Emily
                    Aunt Lizzie & I had a peaceful meal on the back porch Mrs. Profit
                    & the boys now being settled in their own residence with meals down
                    there. Mrs. Huff came over after supper - so we took her home part way &
                    I came right upstairs & got at this letter again which I started about
                    6:30 this a.m. So you see how the days go - They just fly by - We have postponed
                    our  trip & go to Institute at
                    Sevierville  a.m. returning the same day Think
                    it will be quite interesting & novel - A note came from Miss Whittle
                    today inviting us all to have dinner with her that day. Must cease & go
                    to bed - with just lots of love to each & all & don't forget
                    Virginia has same - Ruth. Dearest family - was glad to get a letter from Jane yesterday (Monday) and it
                    sounded as though you all were havinga very very busy existence. Pa
                     must take a trip now to Cal. &
                    St. Paul without fail. This would be just the time to go east for the worst of
                    the hot weather will be over. She'll be interested in hearing about Mabel's final settlement of her future and
                    the Aurora party! No do not get a bathing suit - as I wouldn't use it enough to
                    pay for the investment! Shall be glad to have the other dress - Mary Ogle will
                    no doubt fix it for me. Thanks Mabel for the list of plays - and gov. bulletin - & pa & Jane for
                    the papers - In the course of time I'll get them read no doubt. Have sent the
                    notice of my change of address so you will not have to forward any more to me.Jane will you send the recipe for your warcake! Think some 
        
        Page 03:  
        
        day I'll make soon.The things in my trunk were packed so tight that they did not a arrived but in quite bundled am leaving them 
                    in  as Evelyn thought it wiser than letting them hang while the straps in  etc.  
                    enjoy them. Have spread them out so some wrinkles will leave away. 
                
                    Had the anniversary of Miss Sillix wedding yesterday - but that is the only news I've had of the people at school - 
                    am so glad not to be in Tacoma this fall for institute & all the rest of it! Wish I could go  for the week end in awhile but since I can't then is not worth thinking of it!
                Wednesday last I told you of the girls' picnic & our organizing a club
                    the next night -Friday was a most busy day - as

        nice hot fire we soon had our

                    the grand melon made a great feast for the four of us. Then we bade adieu to the
                    youngsters & picking up our lightened bag & basket trudged on
                    for about four miles through a series of little clearings & an
                    occasional cabin where on the porch clustered the whole family just settin' and staring too!
                    Finally we came to the Glades - our destination. This place of picturesque name
                    consists visibly of one store on the front porch of which were idly
                    balancing the male population - while across the road were the women &
                    children clustered on the porch of a rather large frame house - Beyond was the
                    church and up on the hill - 
        
        Page 06:  
        
         side a school built up
                    on piles of stone several feet - a slim pile at that - one at each corner - It
                    was "church day" - & later on services were in evidence as we left - our
                    passing down the road occupied the attention of the congregation more than the
                    minister - Mr. Watson - the same man who comes here Sat. p.m. & Sunday once a month. Back on a hill from the road
                    with a field of tall corn between stood a small frame house - the home of Aunt
                    Lizzie's son - She has been with them for about two weeks you know - so we went
                    in & made a call for about an hour.They have a new son about a week old - two other small boys in the family also -
                    They seemed like quite progressive people for this part of the world - only one
                    bed in the front room - a range in the kitchen & an upstairs to 
        
        Page 07:  
        
        the dwelling. Aunt Lizzie was awfully glad to see us
                    & said maybe she'd be home Sunday (the next day) It showered some while
                    we visited but by 3:30 it was quite clear so off we set at a brisk pace taking
                    the main road back to Gatlinburg which eventually lead us back to Roarin' Fork.
                    In all your walks you cross creeks so many times - by means of planks - logs -
                    & little bridges - in some places are regular hanging bridges but as yet
                    have not had to cross one - but know it's only a question of time until I do.Pen's getting dry & as I have not been able to get ink of my own
                    & the other is downstairs will have to take to pencil again - For two
                    hours we walked steadily homeward reaching our welcome porch with rockers at
                    exactly 5:30 - so we think it was surely more than 4 miles - and all in all
                    walked at least 11 or 12 - It's loads of fun & we both just love to do
                    it. Mrs. Profit the woman who has helped out during Aunt L's absence had our
                    supper just about ready & wanted us to make the cocoa - So I did - not
                    stopping to change my garb - Mr. Cresswell came in from a ride up Mill Creek
                    & during supper wanted to know if we were going to the ice cream party
                    at the Huff's - This was the first we had heard of it & felt pleased
                    that we didn't have to go - Well after supper we thought we'd enjoy the cool of
                    the twilight before tubbing & going to bed. During this the phone rang
                    & it was Stella Huff inviting Emily & me over - We thought it
                    the wisest plan in the end to go - so the two of us still in walking trim went -
                    some of 
        
        Page 08:  
        
        the girls meeting us on the road - So
                    on top of all our muchness of supper we had ice cream caramel
                    cake & lemonade - We stayed just a little while however & left
                    the festive scene about 8:45 - Then I felt inspired & wrote in my diary
                    for several hours! Saturday seems to be the one day for that & try to
                    write up the whole week - The little Daylogue from Bessie is such a convenience
                    & write in it faithfully every day -Sunday was one giddy round! Oh yes- Evelyn went to
                    Sevierville Sat. p.m. as the next day was her father's birthday! Emily &
                    I went to Sunday School which lasted till 10:30 & then we took our
                    kodaks & went to Martha Clabo's cabin up Baskin Creek to take her old
                    mother's picture & one of the house besides - It was dinner time when we
                    returned & after that Emily & I went to our respective rooms to
                    write letters - I finished one to Aunt 
        
        Page 09:  
        
         Carrie
                    & then took a grand nap -The next excitement was the arrival of a Miss Cochran & a friend - Miss
                    C. has charge of the Juniper School somewhere around here - her friend teaches
                    sewing in the Ashville Normal - both are real
                        teachers! Evelyn & Abbie next came from Sevierville with Dr. Massey
                    in his little Ford roadster - He had a very bad cold & was about sick so
                    E. & his wife persuaded him to take a vacation here. We were all gaily
                    eating supper when a man IsaiahTrenam arrived from about a mile and a half up the
                    mts. with the news that his small boy (in
                    Emily's room) had fallen out of the barn & broken his wrist &
                    wanted the doctor to come & set it - Of course Dr. M. said he'd go
                    & asked if one of us girls would go along & help & I
                    jumped at the chance thereby escaping the B.Y.P. meeting at church in the
                    evening - The three of us went down to the garage - 
        
        Page 10:  
        
        The little grandstand in the school yard &
                    got in the car & buzzed up the road - around - down & up again
                    till we came near a creek where we had to leave the car & walk a little
                    ways - of course crossing the creek - It was rather a neat place & the
                    mother was very nice - the youngster had broken one little bone - & I
                    helped hold the arm while the splint was fixed! Quite necessary wasn't I? Well
                    we left in an hour or so - & walked back to the little car starting down
                    the hill & then coming to an incline stopped & remained stopped.
                    On examination found the exhaust pipe red-hot - got water - still wouldn't make
                    it - fooled around & tried again - & I pushing behind we finally
                    got to the top & managed to get home. Here we found that Miss Cochran
                    wanted assistance - Her horse had stepped on one of her toes - so Dr. M. got
                    busy with her - Emily & I running around getting lights - iodine etc. By
                    that time B.Y.P. was over & Evelyn came home - so we adjourned to the
                    porch where Miss C. proceeded to talk school from a to izzard till finally I
                    said I'd have to leave the festive gathering & go to bed. Which I did - Monday was the usual poor day - nobody knows a thing on Monday & of
                    course Miss C. & friend visited all a.m. but were with me just a little
                    while during a geography class.After school the girl's club met & did some more organizing - have chosen
                    the name Evergreen Club - colors - red & green - meet once a week - This
                    coming Friday evening they will give a party for the boys - here at the house -
                    Emily & I 
        
        Page 11:  
        
        with the social committee
                    are going to work up that old game Five Senses that
                    Mabel & I had once several years ago - We are not telling the others
                    what it will be & guess it will prove a success as the girls who do know
                    about it seem quite taken with it. These youngsters are not at all demonstrative
                    you know - so it's hard to tell what they do think at times.Think I shall turn their next meeting in to a darning
                    party - get them to bring old stockings & mend them as a number
                    don't know a thing about it - Darning is not common here you know. We have plans
                    (Emily & I) for a hair washing &
                    manicuring party - and perhaps if we can get shapes - millinery later on - But
                    that remains to be seen - There is lots to do but one 
        
        Page 12:  
        
        has to go about it sort of easy like & gradually so
                    they won't take offence! After this I took a cushion & book &
                    went up Pi Phi lane - where I stayed till 6:30 - Took "The Squire's Daughter" by
                    Archibald Marshall - the writer who Emily says is very much admired in the east
                    just now - He is a good writer but felt that I had wasted my time &
                    wished I had finished my letter to you people instead - but just felt like doing
                    nothing so strenuous as pushing a pencil. When I returned Dr. M. &
                    Evelyn had returned to Sevierville - as Evelyn had to go on to Knoxville to see
                    about some things - She is there today & no doubt will be home tomorrow.Today as soon as school was out Emily & I started forth & went up
                    the road- past the church & store past Lucrettie's where we stopped 
        
        Page 13:  
        
        first & visited a little as some of
                    them were on the porch & then on down & up through &
                    around cornfields to another house where we were directed to the home of a
                    Whaley family - One of the seven children is in my room & one in Emily's
                    has a sore foot & as they are new people we wanted to look them up -
                    Clambering over a couple of fences (creeks - cornfields & fences are the
                    usual obstacles here) & through a barn we got onto the trail up Aunt
                    Lydie's Creek which we followed for over a mile going up the mt. side all the
                    way - There were a number of cornfields right in this steep wooded &
                    exceedingly rocky hill - Look queer set in the midst of a virgin forest. Finally
                    in a clearing was the cabin & the home of the seven children - a
                    pathetic place but they seem happy enough. We got home about six & Emily
                    Aunt Lizzie & I had a peaceful meal on the back porch Mrs. Profit
                    & the boys now being settled in their own residence with meals down
                    there. Mrs. Huff came over after supper - so we took her home part way &
                    I came right upstairs & got at this letter again which I started about
                    6:30 this a.m. So you see how the days go - They just fly by - We have postponed
                    our mt. trip & go to Institute at
                    Sevierville Sat. a.m. returning the same day Think
                    it will be quite interesting & novel - A note came from Miss Whittle
                    today inviting us all to have dinner with her that day. Must cease & go
                    to bed - with just lots of love to each & all & don't forget
                    Virginia has same - Ruth.
