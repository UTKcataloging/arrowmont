                     easily seated around the fire & not B.Y. - ing thank goodness - It is nice not to

                    now that stayed with Mrs. Profitt & Mr.  - One got mad & left - another had to go home & help get 
                    things ready for the planting and the third got a job on Little River - $2.50 a day & about ten years old at that. Their house is cold so Evelyn had 
                    them bath here (Mr.  & Mrs. ) for supper & to stay all night - and for 
                    dinner again - Tom usually spends his birthday with Mr.  so of course he was here too - Then at Sunday School 
                    this morning Evelyn asked them all to come up here and sing in the  - They often do 
                    that at the church - but it was too cold today - So about 1:30 they began arriving & I think there must have been fifteen or twenty here altogether - 
                    stayed until four - Sang hymns & had some phonograph records - They all behaved very quietly & nicely too.
                
                    After they left Evelyn & I went down the road with Josie Trentham (from the hotel) about a mile or so & met the girls who had walked about half 
                    way up here over the worst part & were met by Mr.  with Dan & the buggy -
                
                    It was a gorgeous afternoon though this morning was snowy & threatening & the ground all white again. The mountains in the distance 
                    which are higher are white - & glistening in the sunlight - each tree seems to stand out  a white specter as 
                    it were - The ground was frozen hard & full of ruts & uneven places which made the walking very difficult in spots. The air so cold that it made 
                    your face tingle - but walking is warm work so we enjoyed it. Every little while we spoke of how cold the girls - Abbie & Evelyn - must be but we found 
                    out later that our sympathy was quite wasted for their seven mile tramp had warmed them up so thoroughly that the ride of the remaining seven did 
                    not affect their temprature!

                        my staying here another year too. Perhaps I ought not - but on the other hand there seem to be about as many reasons for as against. Things do get so 
                        muddled up sometimes it seems hard to know just what is the thing to do. Well to return to a recital of events -
