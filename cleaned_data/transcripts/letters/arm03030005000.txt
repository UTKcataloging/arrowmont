                    There is no particular news I guess since last I scribbled to you. It has been pretty rainy this week & such slippery mud as results - you
                    can't imagine! Mr. Huff has put up  his car for the winter & will now depend on horse and buggy
                    to get through. Our mail doesn't get in till noon while ordinarily it comes up about 10:30.
                
                    Old Aunt Lydia Whaley a regular character around here and who has been away ever since my arrival visiting either children grandchildren 
                     great grandchildren. She lives about a mile up the river in a one room cabin so low that 
                    I just get in without stooping & the ceiling just an inch above my head - It was simply cluttered full except around the fireplace with boxes - 
                    beds - tables bundles - firewood baskets of corn sacks of potatoes - while from the walls & ceiling hang paper bags & news papers of 
                    various herbs - seeds - etc. She does all her cooking  in the fireplace even to baking her cornbread. She is eighty years old or thereabouts.
                
                    I stayed all night at a house on Little Dudley Creek about  a mile and a half from here. Evelyn went with me. Had a very 
                    nice time. It's rather strenuous staying over night however and doubt  to do it very often.
                
                    Am sending some chestnuts to the family - if you were there you'd get some too - but you won't now you see. They are good but pretty wormy.
                
                    Last night there was a "spelling" at the schoolhouse - We spelled round & round - our side won fortunately.
                
                    Began this yesterday after Sunday School but did not finish it - am now sitting out on the front steps after school as it has been a lovely day - 
                    still wearing white & enjoying butterflies & bees! We had company yesterday - the Halls - and went for a little walk with Evelyn & 
					them & instead of going to  - went to bed & slept like a log - Had a 
                    meeting with the girls after school tonight which kept me in late - we are planning a  party for next week -
                
                    Have decided to spend the weekend at Knoxville - if the weather is so we can get out. It will soon be impossible even to get to 
                     Sevierville and a glimpse of street cars - paved streets & bustling people will do me good.
                
                    Loads of love

                        Dear papa - you surely have received the three letters sent you to Reedley by this time containing my doings - was very glad to get yours
                        and hope you do not leave too soon for home - and pa be sure to go down to Los Angeles - For you do not really know California until
                        you see the southern part - Hope that in your next you will tell me you are going. How was Berkeley? You did not tell me a thing about
                        what you did at Katherine's.
                        Jane seems to be getting along without you - but am glad Miss Pancoat will be with
                        her until your return.

                        Had a long letter from Jane this a.m. - who seems busy and bustling as ever - you 
                        and I will keep her more busy with letter writing too.
                        Does California come up to your expectations? Now do write soon & tell me how you pass your days.
                    Have decided to spend the weekend at Knoxville - if the weather is so we can get out. It will soon be impossible even to get to
