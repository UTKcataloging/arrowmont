                    Dearest family: Monday morning & just 10:30 - have been up since six & busy every minute - There is so much to write about though nothing important 
                    except our ! Isn't this a great burg - First small pox then flood - next a  the 
                    latter taking place this morning. Whether I get out of here tomorrow morning or not remains to be seen. My trunk was taken down to the store  
                    Friday so there has been time enough for it to be taken if the roads are passable for a train - Perhaps I'd better go back to Wednesday - you remember I 
                    dashed off a letter just before setting out for my four mile tramp to Maple's. It took me just an hour and a quarter to get there as 
                    the road follows the river & is quite smooth for this part of the world - It is a very pretty walk & I enjoyed it greatly - in spite of a little mist that began falling the last mile 
                    or so - When I arrived we sat around the fire - had my embroidery - There are three boys - Ephraim about sixteen & the oldest & Rellie next in age were
                    both in my room - Bruce the youngest in Abby's - Mr. Maples as I think I told you has a mail route twenty six miles up Baskins - Sugar Lands - & 
                    Elkmont - It takes about eight hours on horseback so you can judge of the condition of the roads - We had the usual supper - biscuit 
                    cornbread - pork - beans - eggs - potatoes - honey - pickles and "stack pie" - This pie is  peculiar to the mountain people I guess -  It looks like 
                    a layer cake - one of four or five & round - It is like cookie dough baked in the round layers with apple sauce or some kind of fruit spread between. 
                    The Crocket Maples are very nice people - have a big farm house - a carpet in their best room - bed davenport - folding bed - bureau - library table etc. But 
                    they are peculiar to the locality. Arose at 4:10 next morning - after getting to bed about nine - spent evening playing games - As Ephraim was going into the 
                    burg after shoes - in the buggy I came along with him. We met Harrison with  buggy 
                    & Dan - Aunt  having seat him after we as the roads were bad again on account of the heavy rain during the night. 
                    I spent the rest of the morning -  - then cleaned up for dinner - After which Miss Wheeler arrived with her mother 
                    & I showed them the school - They went on up Baskins for a hike but as I had had enough of visiting declined their invitation to go - Dr. Massy blew in 
                    for half an hour or so & then as Mrs. Proffitt & Aunt Lizzie both were here - rocking & roaming around in their restless way I trotted over to Huff's 
                    where we sat around the fire & talked & played such games  as little Blanche wanted - Stella & Mattie 
                    were both there also Betty so we had a great time. They had been working outside all  & were rather tired. Well 
                    about 3:30 it began to pour & kept it up without ceasing until the next  morning - I came home about 5:30 & helped with supper - Mr. 
                     is here all the time - that is for meals & the night - is working at the mill setting up the machinery etc. - Read to Aunt 
                    Lizzie in the evening a while - Next morning when I awakened - such a roaring as the river was causing - sounded like the ocean & when I looked out - 
                    here it was a raging torrent twice its size & more - spread out all over a flat field just  at the bend beyond Maples - & 
                    such a current! After breakfast Mrs. Huff arrived - the mill up the river belonging to Luther Reagan - Lucrettie's father had been washed down & the
                    lumber with it & scattered at the bend referred to above - in different places - All the footlogs were washed away - and the roads were torrents too - Mrs. 
                    Huff said their house was surrounded by water - a little knoll on which it stands prevented it's being flooded. Well I can't tell you what a lot of 
                    damage has been done because the mails have not gotten through - but hope they will today. Sevierville is in a valley & has been flooded they say - 
                    the road  at Pigeon Forge where it meets the pike has been washed out ten feet lower - a steel bridge just above has been 
                    washed out - Only one footlog is left between here & Elkmont - & in several places - just around here all the soil has been washed out of the roads 
                    & great stones only left - also places dug out of the road along the river so that teams cannot get by - though a buggy can get through - A flood like this has 
                    not happened for fifty years they say - That high bridge (footlog they call it) in front of Lucrettie's was even taken out - so that all the people on that side have 
                    had to walk up to the Forks of the River to get across - People are raining money to help Mr. Reagan put up another mill - he needs just two or three hundred 
                    dollars to do it - You can imagine how everyone congregated - that is - the men - in groups all day & hung around the store - they will talk about this for 
                    years! Even the footlog in front of Charlie's & by the church was broken up & the creek so big you couldn't cross without wading. Mrs. 
                    Huff & I went down to the hotel where we picked up Mrs. Wheeler & Miss  & persuaded Josie too & 
                    went  the river to see the damage - The old mill that I sent the picture of & where Mr. 
                     has an interest was not damaged - though the bridge there over Roaring Fork where it empties into Little Pigeon 
                     was broken up some & further on we had to go into a field to get by as the road itself was under water. We walked 
                    about two miles & then on our return I stopped at the hotel visited with Mrs. Huff & the Wheelers & wound up by staying there for dinner as Mrs. 
                     was - we had lemon pie - a great treat for me - hence my mentioning it specially - I forgot to say that the day was bright & 
                    sunny & quite windy so that the river & creeks when down fast. After dinner Mrs. Huff & I in the course of time came back to the house where I 
                    combed my hair & made my bed - Aunt Lizzie was nowhere to be found. Then I went over to Mrs.  Huff's where her 
                    family had vanished also - she combed her hair & then we went up the ridge & down to Mrs. Russell Ogle's instead of going the long way by 
                    the river road - We had a nice call - & then walked up the river road to see the damage & destruction & on our way back stopped to see the 
                    sick girl Annie Trentham - Dr.  had come up to see her  the day before - Thinks she is tubercular 
                    & a  sick girl.
                
                    When we finally parted after our long day of "knocking about" it was nigh six o'clock - Saturday  I washed - 
                    swept & fussed around - The Wheelers left early that morning - at five -  with our rig & Harrison though they were not 
                    certain of getting through. 
                
                    However a crowd from the  (Knoxville) had arrived Friday eve  who 
                    walked up from Pigeon Forge & who said that a buggy could get through - Well - some of them & their chaperone arrived while I was cleaning the rugs 
                    on the front porch so had to cease my labors - show them the house & the school - They were young & exceedingly enthusiastic over everything so 
                    didn't mind.
                
                    The weather looked uncertain after dinner & there was no information to be had about the road to McCarter's so didn't know whether I could get 
                    through on foot or not - Mr.  had offered to drive me over but his driving is not good & though he is very nice & we get 
                    along I was not keen about going with him - Have much more fun with Tom - so when he arrived about three having walked up from Mr. Huff's mill where he 
                    has been working all week about six or seven miles down the river I was quite pleased - 
                
                    He got Dan ready & we started - the road was exceedingly rough & in two places just wide enough by driving up on the bank to get through - They were all 
                    home & expecting me - they said - Wonder what you would have thought of them all - The girls have gotten  at me at various 
                    times - but Tom never has - he has been away at school & so knows what  expect of their 
                    students - the others are all right until I find fault with their lessons & then the cross looks!! 
                
                    Well it was early to bed & early to rise - about 5:30 or 6:00  it rained hard again in the night but the next morning was bright 
                    but windy - We sat out on the porch awhile after doing up the dishes & then we all went for a climb up a high ridge by their house where you get a wonderful view of 
                    the mountains in every direction & can see Pigeon Forge & Sevierville - After dinner we played tricks - games - Mr.  arrived 
                    & about four - I started back in the buggy with him & Tom. Aunt Lizzie had been at Huff's & brought Mattie & Blanche back with her to stay all 
                    night - They are such dear little girls - Tom stayed all night with Mr.  as he is working for him at the  
                    mill this week - so we had quite a houseful - Blanche stayed with Aunt Lizzie & Mattie with me. Arose about six & have simply buzzed all 
                     It's cold as can be & as I said at the first - 
                    The little girls amused themselves with the Victrola & piano - I swept some - the house gets  - 
                    cleaned the bathrooms - washed again & ironed - started this letter to you never dreaming that they would get off with the mail until 
                    or later the usual time - but Mr.  arrived at noon with it & the information that it had been gone for a half hour or more. Your 
                    letter Jane & the kodaks came & thank you very much for them. Am so thrilled at the possibility of your coming east & 
                    think it possible for Pa to come too if he only would - Well we will just have to let things go along & see how they work out - You are so busy all the time! Am leaving 
                    only my old red dress of the wool variety - and it will not be given away unless I do not return - I told you what other things I was going to part with - am so glad to say 
                    goodbye to some of my old truck - & Martha was very glad to get the two washdresses - the old sleeveless sweater - you can't imagine what a sick looking 
                    thing it was - the old  kimono too. Yes I saw some hepaticas & the wintergreen is here - it's called "mountain tea."
                    I think I'll probably spend the night at Huff's - my last in the ! maybe! Oh yes - am sending such a beautiful basket which I 
                    had intended to keep for a mending basket but found it too large for my trunk after all - It cost me only 80 
                    & is made of white oak splits. Evelyn just got in some like these this last month & now they are all gone - Well I must cease & fly around again - ought to 
                    wash my hair & now that the pictures are here ought to  them. Margaret (Martha's sister) has been here all day - sitting around 
                    talking with Aunt Lizzie - such gossip one might glean if they tried - you can't imagine - am glad I hear so little. But then they have nothing else to think of - Just 
                    loads of love to you both as ever
                
                    Ruth.
                
                    Dearest family: Monday morning & just 10:30 - have been up since six & busy every minute - There is so much to write about though nothing important 
                    except our flood! Isn't this a great burg - First small pox then flood - next a snowstorm the 
                    latter taking place this morning. Whether I get out of here tomorrow morning or not remains to be seen. My trunk was taken down to the store Sat 
                    Friday so there has been time enough for it to be taken if the roads are passable for a train - Perhaps I'd better go back to Wednesday - you remember I 
                    dashed off a letter just before setting out for my four mile tramp to Maple's. It took me 
        
        Page 03:  
        
        just an hour and a quarter to get there as 
                    the road follows the river & is quite smooth for this part of the world - It is a very pretty walk & I enjoyed it greatly - in spite of a little mist that began falling the last mile 
                    or so - When I arrived we sat around the fire - had my embroidery - There are three boys - Ephraim about sixteen & the oldest & Rellie next in age were
                    both in my room - Bruce the youngest in Abby's - Mr. Maples as I think I told you has a mail route twenty six miles up Baskins - Sugar Lands - & 
                    Elkmont - It takes about eight hours on horseback so you can judge of the condition of the roads - We had the usual supper - biscuit 
        
        Page 04:  
        
        
                    cornbread - pork - beans - eggs - potatoes - honey - pickles and "stack pie" - This pie is  peculiar to the mountain people I guess -  It looks like 
                    a layer cake - one of four or five & round - It is like cookie dough baked in the round layers with apple sauce or some kind of fruit spread between. 
                    The Crocket Maples are very nice people - have a big farm house - a carpet in their best room - bed davenport - folding bed - bureau - library table etc. But 
                    they are peculiar to the locality. Arose at 4:10 next morning - after getting to bed about nine - spent evening playing games - As Ephraim was going into the

                    & I showed them the school - They went on up Baskins for a hike but as I had had enough of visiting declined their invitation to go - Dr. Massy blew in 
                    for half an hour or so & then as Mrs. Proffitt & Aunt Lizzie both were here - rocking & roaming around in their restless way I trotted over to Huff's

        Page 07:  
        
         at Pigeon Forge where it meets the pike has been washed out ten feet lower - a steel bridge just above has been

        Page 10:  
        
         who

                    students - the others are all right until I find fault with their lessons & then the cross looks!! 
                
                    Well it was early to bed & early to rise - about 5:30 or 6:00

         it rained hard again in the night but the next morning was bright 
                    but windy - We sat out on the porch awhile after doing up the dishes & then we all went for a climb up a high ridge by their house where you get a wonderful view of 
                    the mountains in every direction & can see Pigeon Forge & Sevierville - After dinner we played tricks - games - Mr. C. arrived 
                    & about four - I started back in the buggy with him & Tom. Aunt Lizzie had been at Huff's & brought Mattie & Blanche back with her to stay all 
                    night - They are such dear little girls - Tom stayed all night with Mr. C. as he is working for him at the

                    mill this week - so we had quite a houseful - Blanche stayed with Aunt Lizzie & Mattie with me. Arose about six & have simply buzzed all 
                    a.m. It's cold as can be & as I said at the first - snowing
                    The little girls amused themselves with the Victrola & piano - I swept some - the house gets sodirty - 
                    cleaned the bathrooms - washed again & ironed - started this letter to you never dreaming that they would get off with the mail until one
                    or later the usual time - but Mr. C. arrived at noon with it & the information that it had been gone for a half hour or more. Your 
                    letter Jane & the kodaks came & thank you very much for them. Am so thrilled at the possi

        bility of your coming east & 
                    think it possible for Pa to come too if he only would - Well we will just have to let things go along & see how they work out - You are so busy all the time! Am leaving 
                    only my old red dress of the wool variety - and it will not be given away unless I do not return - I told you what other things I was going to part with - am so glad to say 
                    goodbye to some of my old truck - & Martha was very glad to get the two washdresses - the old sleeveless sweater - you can't imagine what a sick looking 
                    thing it was - the old pink kimono too. Yes I saw some hepaticas & the wintergreen is here - it's called "mountain tea."
                    I think I'll probably spend the night at Huff's - my last in the burg! maybe! Oh yes - am sending such a beautiful basket which I 
                    had intended to keep for a mending basket but found it too large for my trunk after all - It cost me only $80 
                    & is made of white oak splits. Evelyn just got in some like these this last month & now they are all gone - Well I must cease & fly around again - ought to 
                    wash my hair & now that the pictures are here ought to fix them. Margaret (Martha's sister) has been here all day - sitting around 
                    talking with Aunt Lizzie - such gossip one might glean if they tried - you can't imagine - am glad I hear so little. But then they have nothing else to think of - Just 
                    loads of love to you both as ever
                
                    Ruth.
