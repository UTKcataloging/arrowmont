                  Dearest family - Do you see where I am - and a sad & orphaned feeling is about me too in spite of being in Knoxville's most elegant hotel! The 
                    reason is this - not a line not a sign of love & affection from the hands of my family has greeted me since Jane's letter of Monday & a very 
                    un-Christmas feeling I have! The first too that my loving parents have not shown their regard for me in a  way!! However I'm
                    not really so  as this sounds - listen to my state! 
                    Yesterday the people began coming to the  about 7:30 - though the time announced for the program & tree
                    was ! We got over there at nine & seemed to find a few little  things to do until the appointed
                    hour too. The panel between Emily's room & mine was up & enough people came to fill all the seats nearly! Emily's little youngsters were grouped
                    on the stage for the opening & sang several songs - after which was her little  play - I had meanwhile gotten my
                    girls into kimonos & bathrobes - nightgowns for the angels so that there was not much of an intermission between hers & my tableaux. The lodge fiddled
                    around about giving a definite answer for over two weeks in regard to lending some old robes - Finally Thursday morning (the day before) they sent back the announcement
                    that the robes were taken out of the hall in case of a  only. Fortu-nately I had 
                    about given up expecting to use them & had gotten together all the garments at the house including Abbie's & one of Josie Trentham's at the hotel
                    - which with two bathrobes furnished by Cora & Emma made enough. Abbie took Mary's part the last minute wearing my lovely 
                    nightgown given me by Nellie so long ago with a georgette scarf of Emily's for a . After this came the tree. Tom made
                    a good Santa & with the help of some of the youngsters  we got everything distributed & sacks of candy & oranges passed
                    too. Quite a number of the children brought things for each  other. The spirit of Gatlinburg is mostly that of receiving rather
                    than giving - we girls got two or three little things only - even Evelyn after all she has done for them! Miss Langmaid says it's really the fault
                    of the girls who have been down here before us - their attitude being that of a Lady Bountiful! We all had dinner together - even 
                    Mr. Creswell & Mrs.  - fried chicken & biscuits - as usual - (none of either on our trip say we!)
                
                    Then about fifteen minutes before we were ready to start Evelyn & Miss Langmaid decided to go down with us - so there was a grand scurrying on their part &
		    a great array of baggage -  & I each have a suitcase & bag - Mr.  package - suitcase 
		    & piano bench - (a  present he had made) Abbie suitcase - Evelyn suitcase - bag - two baskets & a sack of
		    holly - Miss Langmaid half dozen or so big brooms -  a small steamer trunk & huge suitcase. Tom drove up in a conveyance
		    that used to be used as a stage - 3 seated - (the piano bench serving as the front seat) with a top on it - a very high affair too - Well everything was
		    put in safely & bidding Aunt Lizzie & Mrs.  a fond adieu off we started on foot - the two youths coming in the wagon - We walked  			    
                    & rode part of the seven miles to Pigeon Forge over the most awful road imaginable - Evelyn fell down once - your rubbers were pulled off every few steps at the 
		    heels by the gluiness & for three hours we traveled.  At last we got the  where we left the wagon &
		    found two autos to take us down - Emily & I going to Abbie's. Before supper we went into  as I thought there might possibly
		    be mail from you on the 4 p.m. train - nothing doing! Then on to the Bishop's for my hat! It's cold again but had rained the night 			    
                    before - hence the bad state of our roads - but in  itself the streets are actually dusty.
                
		    But I must hasten this story. We slept most happily in Abbie's feather bed & this  got down to the depot for the 8:10 train which was late
		    & after it finally came we were over  making the 30  to
		     arriving about noon where we waited a half hour for a  to take us ! We went               		    
		    to the ticket office first giving up our original plan of getting  traveler's checks at the bank - (it closed at noon) &
		     buying our tickets we were informed that our train was  late 			    
		    - the regular time is 2:20 you know.
		
		    Well we had a delicious lunch at the coffee house of this place - ordered a tenderloin between us - French fried potatoes  -
		    French pastry & 2 cups of coffee per - at how much apiece do you suppose - only . We have a common purse for our expenses
		     which we will pay  - it's very convenient. Then we each got a shine 			    
		    - as our shoes were awfully muddy in spite of our having worn rubbers - Next  we went to a movie - horrid thing "Fair & 	   	     	    
		    Warmer" - which we came here where we checked our baggage on arrival this noon. Now we set forth for a light lunch & then to the train which the last reading seen at
		    the ticket office is 4  & 10  late. Streets crowded with people shopping!
		
		    Emily waiting so will say adieu with loads of love and again Merry !
