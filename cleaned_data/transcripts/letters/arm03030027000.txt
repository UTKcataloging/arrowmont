                    Dearest family - Just home from  & 7 by the clock - you see we begin early so as to get it over with. 
                    Emily is sitting near me also writing - Evelyn is at the other end of the table fixing kodak pictures in her album - Tom & Mr. Creswell are discussing  manual training & 
                    lumber with Miss Langmaid - Aunt Lizzie is trying to read & at the same time keep up with everything that's going on. Abbie has just 
                    over to her house as the girls came - sometimes they go back home after  & then Abbie joyfully remains here.
                    Since writing you Wednesday as usual have buzzed around - though do not seem to have accomplished so very much somehow. I got your package off yesterday noon - do not 
                    be startled by the size & do not open it until Christmas please - will you? Just think a week from tonight will be our first night in New Orleans am so glad we are going as
                    otherwise I fear it would be rather a  dismal season for us both so far away from everybody. Emily had a note from the Woman's 
                    Christian Exchange Saturday saying that at present they were full & did not  know how it would be when we arrived. We are going to see them anyway in case there should 
                    be a vacancy - We have been told of another place - a private boarding house taht some cousin of Emily's  has recommended. Shall wear my big coat & black 
                    dress - pheasant hat when starting forth - take my little old black hat - tan dress - light blue dress - and suit - what else I don't know - thought of sticking in my old red - 
                    but its so shabby & spotted  that I have my doubts. My kodak is going - also Emily's star book - my pictures to show any Pi Phis I may meet. As there are horse
                    races going on at the time we expect to be there - it will be rather crowded so we are writing to the  Charles Hotel - for a room for the first night
                    there. It's  hotel but  we think it will be fun 
                    first apperance to make a splash & then subside into a respectable & cheap place. Up here everyone speaks to those met on the street - rather road - all the way to 
                    Sevierville & in fact in every direction so there's no telling how we will act on the streets of the city (my sentences are rather wild as there have been many 
                    interruptions - the youths have left - Miss Langmaid has started on her kodak book &  Evelyn has to have
                    help every little while & Emily & I have written our letters for rooms.)
                
                    Thursday after school we practiced as usual - Friday Emily went home with Abbie - Mr.  had gone to 
                    the day before as his brother was very sick - the one who teaches in Murphy - He had skinned his arm playing  blood poisoning resulting - 
                    They finally took him to the hospital Friday night.
                
                    We three Pi Phis and Harrison went  around the establishment - climbed up the hill back of the house to the line and then scrambled down
                    again - It was very rough walking through the laurel - pines - holly etc. We picked galax leaves or colt's foot as Mrs.  calls them - two bunches 
                    of which I put in your  box - one for the children - They will last for a long time if in water. Evelyn says they are sent up north to the florists'
                    shops.
                
                    We got home just in time to clean up & eat & then take our lamps & go over  to the debate. which began about 6:15. Early hours we have! The subject was - 
                    grazing is more important in these mountains than farming. The youngsters in school are quite interested in doing their part and really behave nicely. After this Evelyn played
                    for singing a little while - they all  just love to sing.
                
                    Saturday noon Dr. Massy's office girl Christine Jenkins & Abbie's young sister Willa May arrived with the horse & buggy - Christine having come up to
                    give Charley Ogle's mother serum treatment - she is in the last stages of tuberculosis they say - they had lunch & got ready to start back about three - Evelyn's
                    mother had sent word for her to come home but she felt she couldn't & finally  went - just left all my mending & everything that 
                    should have been done - snatched up a few possessions & piled into the buggy & away we went for a 
                    ride - The road was indescribable - mud holes fearful - & a little drizzly rain most of the way. It was lots of fun anyway though dark before we reached Abbie's - 
                    (about a mile this side of Sevierville) Then it came down in torrents - &  kept it up till way in the night - Abbie lives in a big rambling
                    farmhouse - her mother is blind but gets around wonderfully well - the other sisters & brother go to Murphy College - They are very plain people & live the same - but
                    imagine there is plenty of money salted down somewhere. It was six when we arrived & supper over - but some biscuits - jam - fried pork - etc. were soon ready - after
                    which we scrambled out through the rain into a Ford sent up from town to go to a lecture at the college. The lecturer raved on & on for practically three hours - Brooks
                    Fletcher or Fletcher Brooks - of the Redpath Lyceum Circuit - He had lectured the night before on good roads & community work but branched out into hygiene - will power
                    psychology - survival of the fittest & such - He also informed the audience that it was rumored that he was going to be proposed for  of 
                    Ohio next year & he hoped it was true - owns a newspaper &  grocery giving lectures on the side! To cut a long 
                    story short - we were pleased to roll into a soft feather bed & stay there till 8 a.m. It turned cold in the night with a sprinkle of snow - 
                    coldest yet. We stayed right around the fireplace all morning & had dinner early so we could start back with Dan & the buggy about 1 - a hot brick for each of us was 
                    very comfortable.
                
                    So you see another weekend has flitted by & now comes the last pull before we can !
                
                    With just loads & loads of love to each & all as ever

                       Jane's letter & pa's came this past week pa's all enthusiasm over California & Jane's containing not a word. I just don't know
                       what to say about it - Do you think Palo Alto is a good place? It seems so awful to go away from  the children & everybody - don't see how you can - As to where
						I'll be next year I do not know how things will turn out - My letter from the supt's office was in regard to my donation of 
                       $6 towards the retirement fund - It was due Nov. 10th but as I did not get the letter in time & as I can't imagine myself
                       teaching there again have not answered it. Hate to put more money into it & yet do not know as it's quite wise to take the fatal step & sever all connections with 
                       th it.
                        Isn't it awful not to know your own mind?
                    Thursday after school we practiced as usual - Friday Emily went home with Abbie - Mr. C. had gone to S.
                    the day before as his brother was very sick - the one who teaches in Murphy - He had skinned his arm playing basket-ball blood poisoning resulting - 
                    They finally took him to the hospital Friday night.
