         can try to finish them. What do you think? 
                
                    Since starting this about 9:30  Dr. Massy  has come in from a trip up 
                     - tired & muddy. Evelyn & the others had gone upstairs so I got the soup on the coals
                    in the fireplace until  came down & she fixed him some of Aunt Lizzie's !
                
                    When we got back from  tonight Evelyn had returned driving up with the doctor. The roads are
                    perfect awful as I've written so many times before but in places it is so deep it's nearly to the bed of a wagon - You know part of the time it
                    freezes - then it thaws out & rains & lumbering is very profitable so that hauling heavy loads of lumber has been continued fast & furiously
                     all winter. Well in some places the mud is so thick & deep that the doctor had to get out before the horse could get
                    through pulling only Evelyn in the light buggy.
                
                    Yesterday was rainy as usual & I gave my room and things in it an unusually  thorough cleaning and glad I am it's
                    done for who do you suppose may be here this next for a little visit? Blanche  of all people. A letter
                    came from her yesterday written from Texas - she is on her way to New York having been traveling with her father & mother since Christmas - They have
                    gone back &  while she was in Arkansas saw my article in the Arrow & it occured to her that she could stop & visit en route.
                
                    She expected to be in New Orleans today & hoped to find a letter from me telling her the way to Gatlinburg - which she said she could not find on the map.
                    I thought the matter over and decided to send a night letter which would reach her in time. She evidently has no idea of distance or the slowness of the mails - 
                    her letter was written last Monday & reached me about 1 p.m. Saturday. The Huffs & we are the only ones who have phones
                    & we have to help each other ring for Central. It's the regular country phone with a handle at the side to ring you know. Our Central is 
                     Pigeon Forge. Well we finally roused him - the regular Central
                    is sick & after I made him understand that I wanted to send a telegram he immediately began to be very hard of hearing & insisted on my being
                    connected with Sevierville whom I could not hear at all. Finally after much turning of the handle I got Pigeon Forge again & begged him to try to hear
                    me But no - "I have six cases of the flu here & they make such a fuss I can't hear you -" He was immovable & there it was - then we
                    heard of a man through Charlie at the store - who was going down to Pigeon Forge -  & who would take it. So I wrote it 
                    out neatly & thought that matter was settled. Next thing when I got home from Sunday School this morning Aunt Lizzie said Mrs. Huff had heard about my 
                    telegram which was not sent yet! So calling up Pigeon Forge I discovered that it was not sent because no street  had been
                    given for the hotel which Blanche had . It's one of the biggest & best known there &
                    perfectly ridiculous to ask the street - Anyway I said Canal Street & they seemed contented so here's hoping Blanche gets it today & comes!
                     Then Friday I had a letter from Marion Bowers - Do you remeber that she was one of the Spokane freshmen when I was a Senior?
                    She is now in Minneapolis & saw my Arrow article & so wrote & also enclosed ten dollars for the school - which I can use in anyway I wish! Friday is 
                    the debate - League of Nations - & spent a lot of time yesterday getting material for it & looking over my papers & magazines - also read a while to
                    Aunt Lizzie from "Little Lord Fauntleroy." Then this  Tom came over for quite a spell - he is on the debate &
                    wants material etc. He takes a good deal of time but is worth it & so glad to learn things & so anxious to be like people outside - am trying to 
                    persuade him to go away to school next year - it would be just the thing for him. After he left Abbie & I went up to the Oakley's who live on Mill 
                    Creek you know - Mrs.  has been sick again. Such a pitiful place! and nothing to  done for them
                    really.
                
                    Dearest family: It does seem as though your letter Sunday is put off till the last thing & then rushed through and I'm so ashamed of it - 
                    too far you know you all are the dearest & best! Wonder what you have been doing  today and what I'll hear from you tomorrow. Five more weeks
                     than decide  discovery  not
                    But all the time underneath has been the felling that another for  things this year and next year

                        Well it's late - due to the interruptions & I don't know how intelligent all this scribble sounds. I sent off Marie's letter that very night
                        to Aunt Carrie as I imagine I told you.
                        Goodnight with loads of love
                        Ruth.
