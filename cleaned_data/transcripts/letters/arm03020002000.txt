                    Dearest family - This is Friday night the end of my first week! Two letters only
                    have come from your end of the line since I left Evanston - both from Jane - one
                    Monday & the other yesterday - but not a thing from anyone else - or
                    literature! I wonder if you have gotten all my letters. I do not imagine I'm
                    going to get many for there is going to be very little time to write - myself
                    and if I don't write others won't I suppose - We really are awfully busy - of
                    course this week has been more so - for we have worked at school numbering the
                    books - cleaning up & mending - then last night Emily & I
                    cleaned out the closet for supplies & some dirty job - I just revelled
                    in throwing out the old trash & Emily ditto. Have not yet put my own
                    desk in order or started my register - The youngsters are awfully dear - but not quite so mountainous as I had expected - one of my
                    girls has the fashionable ear puffs & had rouge on her face yesterday -
                    I told her not to use it any more that she had lots of color already etc. - so
                    today she was clean & neat! Last week there was a "short course" in
                    connection with the home service or community work department at Sevierville -
                    The girls learned how to can fruit & vegetables. Three or four of mine
                    went - the dolled up lady above mentioned was one - Maud Clabo was another
                    & she told me that she had never been on a train before or to
                    Sevierville - I think she was the one who thought I must have gotten awfully
                    tired coming so far on the train! I have so far about 22 in my room - the big
                    room - 4 in freshman high - Latin Algebra &  Ancient History in which latter class I have put about 4 - 8 a's
                    and they  have arithmetic The 7's have  with  and
                    the 7's & 8 b's have  history together. (You see I got this rather
                    mixed & had to go back over it & straighten it out) Then I have
                    a separate class of 7 arithmetic - besides spelling & writing. There is
                    one vacant period the last 25 minutes in the morning & I shall probably
                    devote it to hygiene & general science or anything else that comes up -
                    The last hour from 2 to 3 will be given over to English that is sort of a
                    mixture of written & oral composition - technical grammar & some
                    reading - This will be only three afternoons for the other 2 will be used by my
                    girls' cooking & sewing - Abbie Runyan has that part & the
                    intermediate grades which will come in my room just
                    to study while my girls are gone. Just what will be done with my boys I don't
                    know yet - for there is no manual training for them as yet.Saturday morning - My pen was getting dry - the ink was downstairs &
                    besides I was sleepy so went to bed - Am now out on the front porch - it's just
                    8:10 a.m. - of a lovely coolness - The evenings & mornings are so lovely
                    & cool - but the middle of the day & afternoon are of the
                    temperature that your clothes become wet through from the skin out - so usually
                    I get into the tub as soon as I get home from school.Was so sorry to hear about Betty's sister and Victoria too - and shall write this
                    week-end surely - also to Lida. It will be quite an event if  
                    sells out & shall be wondering about it - Why the ship yard
                    strike again? Have not had time to look at the paper once - although one from
                    Knoxville arrives with the mail every morning - so feel quite out of the world.
                    Do not expect to be so busy after while - at least I hope not - The letter I
                    sent to the girls may have told you a little
                    more news - Our house faces the north west and across one end of the big porch
                    towards the west is a thickly growing vine and in space between porch supports
                    either side of the steps is a big flower box of myrtle nasturtiums and
                    chrysanthemums - then two rockers made of maple with seats of oak splints - and
                    some little straight backed chairs to match - a big rocker - a couch & two
                    built in seats - I want to tell you some more about the little straight backed
                    chairs - they are made here in the mountains - all by hand - no nails in them as
                    the pieces are all fitted together and the legs & everything shaped
                    without machinery - only $1.25 apiece - are very light & comfortable
                    though not large - would make fine bedroom chairs or porch chairs - they are
                    certainly attractive & unusual - we have them all over the house except
                    in the living room - & at school for the use of the teachers. Wouldn't
                    you and Arthur like half a dozen between you?The people here all go by the sun rather than  by
                    railroad time so we are about half an hour ahead of them now & will be
                    that much behind them later! We are in the Central Time district (2 hrs. ahead
                    of yours) but almost in Eastern Time - I would love to see the youngsters but
                    since I can't - hope to have some pictures soon - Have taken several kodaks here
                    & expect to take a lot today & get off at least two film packs
                    to Knoxville to be developed & printed & of course will send
                    some of each to you - The youngsters are awfully dear & think everything
                    is going to be all right as far as they are concerned - 3 of my girls sweep out
                    the building every night for which they are paid. We girls take turns a week at
                    the time about ringing the bell & conducting "assembly" (8:00-8:15) or
                    morning exercises every morning - Yesterday 3 of my girls sang a hymn - the
                    youngsters gave texts all around & sang. Miss Abbott - her father
                    & mother left Thursday morning -
                    after a visit of about 3  - part of the time they were in the small cottage
                    near the house. Abbie has moved over there now & is to have charge of
                    some girls who are to live there & come to school - as they live too far
                    to go back & forth - There will probably be four at first. A friend of
                    Abbie's Cora Ingle has been with her all week an awfully nice girl - she is
                    going to school at Maryville as soon as it opens. Have not made any visits -
                    real visits this week - Monday night did not go to church at all but strolled
                    with Emily & Miss Abbott (her first name is Mabel by the way) up a road
                    back of the house called Pi Phi lane - very lovely & woodsy which lead
                    to Baskin's Creek (Bearskin) a romantic spot - then across it by a little wooden
                    bridge or planking - As we were right by the Huff's we stopped & made a
                    call which I told about in my Pi Phi letter - Tuesday evening was the last of
                    the revival so we went to church - The heat
                    & odor about knocked me over at the door and it was so lovely &
                    cool outside! We sat down in the choir section by an open window which let in a
                    tiny breeze once in awhile. It became very emotional towards the last. Three
                    little boys went to the mourner's bench to weep as usual after shaking hands
                    with the revivalist to show that they were "to stand for Christ hereafter" -
                    then a little girl about the same age (12) came up & after speaking to
                    the minister was about to return to her seat somewhere at the back when a woman
                    presumably her mother dashed at her from the front section opposite us &
                    pushed her down in the mourning pew - then she went to the back &
                    brought forward her other small daughter & put her beside the first - a
                    couple of young fellows came forward too & then "all the Christians"
                    came forward to pray for them. The girls' mother burst forth into loud weeping
                    & shouting begging the Lord to wake them all up & save her girls
                    from hell - she kept this up for a long time and it soon became a duet (with accompanying chorus of sobs - groans
                    & amens -) for a man began praying in an equally loud key shaking his
                    right fist high in the air to emphasize his demands! Really it was awful
                    & pathetic too. After this was singing & in the midst of it -
                    one of the little boys got up suddenly from the mourner's bench & went
                    up to the minister - That meant he wanted to join the church & was saved
                    - His mother came crying and shouting to him and then jigged - actually jigged
                    all around in front among everyone waving her arms & shouting - "I'm so
                    happy - I'm so happy" - then she began shaking hands not in the ordinary way -
                    but seizing the hand she would proceed to sway back & forth pulling away
                    at the poor victim! Fortunately we were not within the radius of her grasp! Well
                    altogether four or five little boys & girls were ready for baptism as
                    the result of these services and it was decided to perform the ceremony up the river next  at 9. Evelyn looked at me -
                    for that meant we could have no school until the  So I studied &
                    finished my chapter letter - went to the school house & worked until
                    noon. The Abbotts were here for lunch & asked us to go to the hotel for
                    dinner that night. About 6:30 we started forth - Aunt Lizzie - we three teachers
                    - Cora & Evelyn (who had just come back from the day's visit at
                    Sevierville) The hotel is a moderate sized green frame building owned by the
                    Huffs - About seven or eight boarders were there - very ordinary & we
                    ate at two tables set in the big screened in porch at the back - I have an
                    enormous appetite all the time - and so ate some of nearly everything - fried
                    chicken - mutton - mashed potatoes - corn - string beans baked apple - black berry jelly - apple jelly &
                    last but not least - hot biscuits - There were tomatoes & honey but
                    didn't partake of them strange to say. We sat around awhile after this strenuous
                    meal and then strolled back of the house to a lovely cool spring and then to the
                    little white school house which is on a hill opposite us & where we sat
                    on the steps and gazed at the lovely hills in the moonlight with the usual
                    orchestra of insects & the dear little fireflies! Evelyn started with
                    Emily & me but went back when we came to the woodsy path leading from
                    the road to schoolhouse - for she cannot endure snakes - These are quite common
                    it seems - rattlers & copperheads both. Thursday as I said before we
                    cleaned out the closet at school - then came home -
                    got in the tub & cleaned up - dolling up in my gray dress &
                    coral beads - Evelyn & Cora had taken old Dan and gone up Baskin's Creek
                    for about three or four miles to Richard Ogle's - They make baskets - &
                    have to tell the Yakima people that I do not know when their order can be
                    filled. Aunt Lizzie seemed rather tired & didn't have much planned for
                    supper - so Emily & I who were awfully eager for food went out in the
                    kitchen & investigated the larder - Emily made some lemonade & I
                    scrambled eggs - so with that & biscuits & jelly &
                    apples that Evelyn & Cora brought back with them about this time made a
                    "nourishing" meal. I went to bed early
                    & got up about 5:15 & did my lessons & stayed after
                    school awhile last night & did some for Monday - a Miss Evans bobbed up
                    here yesterday a.m. a very pleasant girl a few years older than myself &
                    from Vassar - Don't know exactly what she is doing but is connected with the
                    M.E. Church & the department of agriculture & is going all
                    through the rural communities. She - Emily & I went for a walk up the
                    river Little Pigeon last night - not a wrap have I had on since lighting in this
                    spot - & most of the week have worn my ready made white dress from
                    McCormack's which I'm quite crazy about - & wish I had some more of them
                    - my black & white is a  but is a perfect rag these hot days - Mary Ogle who lives in the 3rd little cottage in this establishment did my
                    washing last week & is going to do it next - thought first I wouldn't
                    trust my gingham to her (which is now very dirty) but guess I'll risk it for I
                    haven't time to wash it - & do only my ! & silk stockings. It is about 9:15 now and as the man comes
                    after the mail about 10 think I'll start the closing of this epistle. Harrison
                    the man who works for us - has gone to get Dan & the buggy ready for
                    Emily & me - We are planning to take kodaks & food &
                    stay away all day - driving up to McCarter's place (I have  of them) & then on up past their house where one gets a
                    wonderful view - hope to get some good pictures too. Evelyn & Miss Evans left about 6:30 in Mr. Huff's car
                    this morning -We are planning to have a party for the older youngsters here next Friday night -
                    just games - no refreshments I believe - Hope to get some visiting done this
                    next week.Please don't mind if I don't write individual letters to you - for at present
                    it's impossible - but will later soon as time permits.This is my birthday & had almost forgotten about it - tell Bessie I'm
                    enjoying my Daylogue  immensely & keep it up-to-date. Started
                    my diary too and am at present a couple of days behind - but will get caught up this week-end. Enjoy the letters from home so
                    much even though I do not comment much. The Maxwell is not as nice as a Dodge -
                    much like a Ford - at least Art's is - 1916 model I believe & light
                    gray. He alone can drive & does not drive as fast as we do.Once more with loads of love to all as ever - Ruth.If bathing suits are not too expensive will you get me one & see if you
                    can find that green rubber cap I had last year - don't know where it is - unless
                    in one of my boxes - would prefer a green suit - The girls bathe in the river -
                    a nice pool about 1/4 of a mile from here -
                
                    Dearest family - This is Friday night the end of my first week! Two letters only
                    have come from your end of the line since I left Evanston - both from Jane - one
                    Monday & the other yesterday - but not a thing from anyone else - or
                    literature! I wonder if you have gotten all my letters. I do not imagine I'm
                    going to get many for there is going to be very little time to write - myself
                    and if I don't write others won't I suppose - We really are awfully busy - of
                    course this week has been more so - for we have worked at school numbering the
                    books - cleaning up & mending - then last night Emily & I
                    cleaned out the closet for supplies & some dirty job - I just revelled
                    in throwing out the old trash & Emily ditto. Have not yet put my own
                    desk in order or started my register - The youngsters 
        
        Page 03:  
        
        are awfully dear - but not quite so mountainous as I had expected - one of my
                    girls has the fashionable ear puffs & had rouge on her face yesterday -
                    I told her not to use it any more that she had lots of color already etc. - so
                    today she was clean & neat! Last week there was a "short course" in
                    connection with the home service or community work department at Sevierville -
                    The girls learned how to can fruit & vegetables. Three or four of mine
                    went - the dolled up lady above mentioned was one - Maud Clabo was another
                    & she told me that she had never been on a train before or to
                    Sevierville - I think she was the one who thought I must have gotten awfully
                    tired coming so far on the train! I have so far about 22 in my room - the big
                    room - 4 in freshman high - Latin Algebra & 
        
        Page 04:  
        
         Ancient History in which latter class I have put about 4 - 8 a's
                    and they (the latter) have arithmetic too& geographyThe 7's have geog. with themthe 8'bs and
                    the 7's & 8 b's have U.S. history together. (You see I got this rather
                    mixed & had to go back over it & straighten it out) Then I have
                    a separate class of 7 arithmetic - besides spelling & writing. There is
                    one vacant period the last 25 minutes in the morning & I shall probably
                    devote it to hygiene & general science or anything else that comes up -
                    The last hour from 2 to 3 will be given over to English that is sort of a
                    mixture of written & oral composition - technical grammar & some
                    reading - This will be only three afternoons for the other 2 will be used by my
                    girls' cooking & sewing - Abbie Runyan has that part & the
                    intermediate grades 
        
        Page 05:  
        
        which will come in my room just
                    to study while my girls are gone. Just what will be done with my boys I don't
                    know yet - for there is no manual training for them as yet.Aug. 9, 1919Saturday morning - My pen was getting dry - the ink was downstairs &
                    besides I was sleepy so went to bed - Am now out on the front porch - it's just
                    8:10 a.m. - of a lovely coolness - The evenings & mornings are so lovely
                    & cool - but the middle of the day & afternoon are of the
                    temperature that your clothes become wet through from the skin out - so usually
                    I get into the tub as soon as I get home from school.Was so sorry to hear about Betty's sister and Victoria too - and shall write this
                    week-end surely - also to Lida. It will be quite an event if J.W. 
                    sells out & shall be wondering about it - Why the ship yard
                    strike again? Have not had time to look at the paper once - although one from
                    Knoxville arrives with the mail every morning - so feel quite out of the world.
                    Do not expect to be so busy after while - at least I hope not - The letter I
                    sent to the girls may have 
        
        Page 06:  
        
        told you a little
                    more news - Our house faces the north west and across one end of the big porch
                    towards the west is a thickly growing vine and in space between porch supports
                    either side of the steps is a big flower box of myrtle nasturtiums and
                    chrysanthemums - then two rockers made of maple with seats of oak splints - and
                    some little straight backed chairs to match - a big rocker - a couch & two
                    built in seats - I want to tell you some more about the little straight backed
                    chairs - they are made here in the mountains - all by hand - no nails in them as
                    the pieces are all fitted together and the legs & everything shaped
                    without machinery - only $1.25 apiece - are very light & comfortable
                    though not large - would make fine bedroom chairs or porch chairs - they are
                    certainly attractive & unusual - we have them all over the house except
                    in the living room - & at school for the use of the teachers. Wouldn't
                    you and Arthur like half a dozen between you?Drawing of chair.The people here all go by the sun rather than

         by
                    railroad time so we are about half an hour ahead of them now & will be
                    that much behind them later! We are in the Central Time district (2 hrs. ahead
                    of yours) but almost in Eastern Time - I would love to see the youngsters but
                    since I can't - hope to have some pictures soon - Have taken several kodaks here
                    & expect to take a lot today & get off at least two film packs
                    to Knoxville to be developed & printed & of course will send
                    some of each to you - The youngsters are awfully dear & think everything
                    is going to be all right as far as they are concerned - 3 of my girls sweep out
                    the building every night for which they are paid. We girls take turns a week at
                    the time about ringing the bell & conducting "assembly" (8:00-8:15) or
                    morning exercises every morning - Yesterday 3 of my girls sang a hymn - the
                    youngsters gave texts all around & sang. Miss Abbott - her father
                    & mother 
        
        Page 08:  
        
        left Thursday morning -
                    after a visit of about 3 wks. - part of the time they were in the small cottage
                    near the house. Abbie has moved over there now & is to have charge of
                    some girls who are to live there & come to school - as they live too far
                    to go back & forth - There will probably be four at first. A friend of
                    Abbie's Cora Ingle has been with her all week an awfully nice girl - she is
                    going to school at Maryville as soon as it opens. Have not made any visits -
                    real visits this week - Monday night did not go to church at all but strolled
                    with Emily & Miss Abbott (her first name is Mabel by the way) up a road
                    back of the house called Pi Phi lane - very lovely & woodsy which lead
                    to Baskin's Creek (Bearskin) a romantic spot - then across it by a little wooden
                    bridge or planking - As we were right by the Huff's we stopped & made a
                    call which I told about in my Pi Phi letter - Tuesday evening was the last of
                    the revival 
        
        Page 09:  
        
        so we went to church - The heat
                    & odor about knocked me over at the door and it was so lovely &
                    cool outside! We sat down in the choir section by an open window which let in a
                    tiny breeze once in awhile. It became very emotional towards the last. Three
                    little boys went to the mourner's bench to weep as usual after shaking hands
                    with the revivalist to show that they were "to stand for Christ hereafter" -
                    then a little girl about the same age (12) came up & after speaking to
                    the minister was about to return to her seat somewhere at the back when a woman
                    presumably her mother dashed at her from the front section opposite us &
                    pushed her down in the mourning pew - then she went to the back &
                    brought forward her other small daughter & put her beside the first - a
                    couple of young fellows came forward too & then "all the Christians"
                    came forward to pray for them. The girls' mother burst forth into loud weeping
                    & shouting begging the Lord to wake them all up & save her girls
                    from hell - she kept this up for a long time and it 
        
        Page 10:  
        
        soon became a duet (with accompanying chorus of sobs - groans
                    & amens -) for a man began praying in an equally loud key shaking his
                    right fist high in the air to emphasize his demands! Really it was awful
                    & pathetic too. After this was singing & in the midst of it -
                    one of the little boys got up suddenly from the mourner's bench & went
                    up to the minister - That meant he wanted to join the church & was saved
                    - His mother came crying and shouting to him and then jigged - actually jigged
                    all around in front among everyone waving her arms & shouting - "I'm so
                    happy - I'm so happy" - then she began shaking hands not in the ordinary way -
                    but seizing the hand she would proceed to sway back & forth pulling away
                    at the poor victim! Fortunately we were not within the radius of her grasp! Well
                    altogether four or five little boys & girls were ready for baptism as
                    the result of these services and it was decided to perform 
        
        Page 11:  
        
        the ceremony up the river next a.m. at 9. Evelyn looked at me -
                    for that meant we could have no school until the p.m. So I studied &
                    finished my chapter letter - went to the school house & worked until
                    noon. The Abbotts were here for lunch & asked us to go to the hotel for
                    dinner that night. About 6:30 we started forth - Aunt Lizzie - we three teachers
                    - Cora & Evelyn (who had just come back from the day's visit at
                    Sevierville) The hotel is a moderate sized green frame building owned by the
                    Huffs - About seven or eight boarders were there - very ordinary & we
                    ate at two tables set in the big screened in porch at the back - I have an
                    enormous appetite all the time - and so ate some of nearly everything - fried
                    chicken - mutton - mashed potatoes - corn - string beans 
        
        Page 12:  
        
        baked apple - black berry jelly - apple jelly &
                    last but not least - hot biscuits - There were tomatoes & honey but
                    didn't partake of them strange to say. We sat around awhile after this strenuous
                    meal and then strolled back of the house to a lovely cool spring and then to the
                    little white school house which is on a hill opposite us & where we sat
                    on the steps and gazed at the lovely hills in the moonlight with the usual
                    orchestra of insects & the dear little fireflies! Evelyn started with
                    Emily & me but went back when we came to the woodsy path leading from
                    the road to schoolhouse - for she cannot endure snakes - These are quite common
                    it seems - rattlers & copperheads both. Thursday as I said before we
                    cleaned out the closet at school - then came 
        
        Page 13:  
        
        home -
                    got in the tub & cleaned up - dolling up in my gray dress &
                    coral beads - Evelyn & Cora had taken old Dan and gone up Baskin's Creek
                    for about three or four miles to Richard Ogle's - They make baskets - &
                    have to tell the Yakima people that I do not know when their order can be
                    filled. Aunt Lizzie seemed rather tired & didn't have much planned for
                    supper - so Emily & I who were awfully eager for food went out in the
                    kitchen & investigated the larder - Emily made some lemonade & I
                    scrambled eggs - so with that & biscuits & jelly &
                    apples that Evelyn & Cora brought back with them about this time made a
                    "nourishing" meal.

        I went to bed early
                    & got up about 5:15 & did my lessons & stayed after
                    school awhile last night & did some for Monday - a Miss Evans bobbed up
                    here yesterday a.m. a very pleasant girl a few years older than myself &
                    from Vassar - Don't know exactly what she is doing but is connected with the
                    M.E. Church & the department of agriculture & is going all
                    through the rural communities. She - Emily & I went for a walk up the
                    river Little Pigeon last night - not a wrap have I had on since lighting in this
                    spot - & most of the week have worn my ready made white dress from
                    McCormack's which I'm quite crazy about - & wish I had some more of them
                    - my black & white is a cool but is a perfect rag these hot days - Mary Ogle who 
        
        Page 15:  
        
        lives in the 3rd little cottage in this establishment did my
                    washing last week & is going to do it next - thought first I wouldn't
                    trust my gingham to her (which is now very dirty) but guess I'll risk it for I
                    haven't time to wash it - & do only my union
                        suits! & silk stockings. It is about 9:15 now and as the man comes
                    after the mail about 10 think I'll start the closing of this epistle. Harrison
                    the man who works for us - has gone to get Dan & the buggy ready for
                    Emily & me - We are planning to take kodaks & food &
                    stay away all day - driving up to McCarter's place (I have four of them) & then on up past their house where one gets a
                    wonderful view - hope to get some good 
        
        Page 16:  
        
        pictures too. Evelyn & Miss Evans left about 6:30 in Mr. Huff's car
                    this morning -We are planning to have a party for the older youngsters here next Friday night -
                    just games - no refreshments I believe - Hope to get some visiting done this
                    next week.Please don't mind if I don't write individual letters to you - for at present
                    it's impossible - but will later soon as time permits.This is my birthday & had almost forgotten about it - tell Bessie I'm
                    enjoying my Daylogue  immensely & keep it up-to-date. Started
                    my diary too and am at present a couple of days 
        
        Page 17:  
        
        behind - but will get caught up this week-end. Enjoy the letters from home so
                    much even though I do not comment much. The Maxwell is not as nice as a Dodge -
                    much like a Ford - at least Art's is - 1916 model I believe & light
                    gray. He alone can drive & does not drive as fast as we do.Once more with loads of love to all as ever - Ruth.If bathing suits are not too expensive will you get me one & see if you
                    can find that green rubber cap I had last year - don't know where it is - unless
                    in one of my boxes - would prefer a green suit - The girls bathe in the river -
                    a nice pool about 1/4 of a mile from here -
