        Dearest family - It's about 10 p.m. Friday and though I have to be ready by 6 in
                    the morning to go to Sevierville with Emily & Mr. Cresswell in the Huff
                    car - will dash off a brief account of the exciting events since I wrote you the
                    early part of the week - Just wait till you hear about the event!Our letters are so long in getting across - have sent two sets of kodak pictures
                    now & hope some in the second will charm & thrill you as I have
                    been! Yes the hills do look high - you know they are mountains - &
                    Gatlinburg itself is about 1700  elevation. As to
                    the discipline - well they all think I'm hard on them because I make them behave
                    & keep them in for lessons - all of which seems to be rather an unusual process - However in spite of the cross
                    looks & tears shall continue to try to get them to learn a few things.
                    They certainly do not compare favorably as to knowledge with our western
                    youngsters - and no wonder judging from the conditions that prevail in the
                    schools in these  - one consists of two
                    teachers & two hundred pupils - what do you think of that?Yes the laundry bag - which I presume is for handkerchiefs was in the package
                    & thought I had mentioned it - for I like it very much. The white dress
                    came & Mary Ogle will fix it for me - Am quite crazy about these dresses
                    - so comfortable and  are they!Mrs. Helmick is a Pi Phi - the wife of  Helmick
                    and has been all over the world with him I guess. She has lived among these people & they are all very devoted to her.
                    Through her efforts principally I believe the school was started & for
                    the first five years of its existence she was the main one to push things She
                    superintended the building of this house and built the little bungalow where
                    Mary Ogle lives & which she later sold to the Pi Phi's.What color did you paint the upstairs? Hope it was dry for the party! Tell me
                    about it & the visit of the Glasiers. Don't know what the Cavanagh's
                    thought of my going to Fannie but imagine it suited all around - for decorators
                    arrived the morning I left as the whole house inside & out is being done
                    over.Do hope pa takes a trip - you must pa - sure!You all sound as busy as I am - & busy is the word. And all these other
                    people here have so much time on hand oh just loads of it! Am so glad Victoria
                    is progressing & hope she is up & around soon!Lida sent me a nice letter not long ago - will have to get another letter written
                    next week for the girls - will you let them have the pictures - borrow them I
                    mean and would like the Seattle Pi Phis to see them too - either you or one of
                    them (Tacoma Pi Phi) could send them to Ruth D. as long as she is the president.
                    6554 18th Av. N.E.Will now proceed to tell of my doings beginning Wednesday as my last was written
                    Emily and I were alone as Evelyn did not get
                    back from Knoxville as she had expected - Aunt Lizzie was here of course - Right
                    after school we come home & get busy although it's a grand 
                    & we are anxious to walk. However I settle right down in my room (which
                    I shall describe some day as soon as these exciting thing that occupy my
                    attention cease) and correct papers - make out test questions & then
                    write a long & much delayed letter to Fannie. By that time supper was
                    ready for us which we enjoyed on the back porch. Then we took a little stroll up
                    Pi Phi lane & got back just in time to welcome three ladies from the
                    hotel who wanted to use the phone principally - Next
                    my Tom McCarter arrived for help with his Latin & thus the evening
                    flitted by -Thursday - was the day of days & you'll never guess how it ended - for
                    never in my wildest flights of fancy had I pictured myself in a  on a still! Now what have you to say? Well to
                    begin at the first - Since Institute was to occupy our Saturday & the
                    preparations for the party & the party itself most of our spare time
                     - Emily & I hustled home &
                    got busy doing the sweeping & dusting downstairs - in our bedrooms - the
                    halls & stairs. About 5:30 I roamed out on the porch where sat Evelyn
                    (who got home the day before) Abbie & Aunt Lizzie. My room was not yet
                    dusted & the dustcloth still in my hand but
                    I dropped down into one of our comfortable rockers & conversed. Pretty
                    soon Harrison (our man about the place you know & as I told you in one
                    letter a deputy sheriff) was seen driving Dan from the road up into the school
                    grounds &  (as a two seated buggy is
                    so designated) attached to him (Dan). This hack has been out of commission for
                    months & H. was just bringing it home. Evelyn said "Why don't you girls
                    get Harrison to take you for a little ride before dinner?" Of course we were
                    charmed & calling Emily - Abbie & I rushed across the grounds to
                    tell H. not to unhitch Dan. We coaxed him to take us & piling into the
                    dirty back seat we began chattering away & finally got to the subject of
                    stills by the time we were on the road - Well one remark brought forth another
                    & Harrison confided to us that he was going after a still about two
                    miles off the next night. Of course we wanted to go - but then there was our
                    party - Well why not go then & there if it was only two miles away? The
                    three of us were too much for him & he said "All right!" & then
                    added - "We'll stop & get Mr. Cresswell!" So we did tearing him away
                    from his dinner I imagine - We just told him to come on for a ride as the boys
                    were around - Then driving on a little farther to the store we stopped &
                    here were made preparations by dear Harrison. Really he simply convulsed us - he
                    was so mysterious & cautious through
                    the whole performance - "just perfect" as Emily said. He got out & went
                    in the store - while we gleefully told Mr. C. what was doing - he was quite
                    thrilled too as it was a new experience for him as well as us. H. then came back
                    with a huge flashlight & a bag of candy for us maidens. Then Mr. Huff
                    comes along in his machine whom H. stops - then climbs in & disappears
                    down the road with him. We meanwhile giggle & eat the giddy gum drops
                    and other kinds (name unknown but of gorgeous color) & Mr. C. has the
                    happy thought of buying a huge watermelon which is put in the back. We send word
                    to Evelyn by the small boy Rellie (Mary's) not to wait supper for us. H. now returns with a small covered basket
                    & goes in the store - comes out - puts basket on bench in front of store
                    - summons Mr. C. to a mysterious conference at one side of the road - after
                    which the two climb to the front seat & off we start down the road
                    towards Sevierville - When we get out of the burg a ways - H. gets out &
                    prowls along at the rear smoking cigarettes (I have a snap of him which I'll
                    send in due time) At last after about two miles of bumpy ups & downs we
                    turn around & drive close to one side of the road. Here we get out
                    & the men proceed to unhitch Dan. H. leads him off a ways & ties
                    him under a tree. While thus engaged two wagons drawn by mules come around the bend in the road & H. immediately
                    conceals himself in the undergrowth along the river bank. When this danger is
                    over we all scramble down to the river - which was quite shallow - rocky
                    & narrow. We are to cross it stepping lightly from stone to stone. Well
                    Abbie makes it beautifully - I'm in that old white dress & my white
                    pumps & before I get across slip in neatly to my ankles - Emily also
                    steps off - She is wearing French heels! Safely on the other side we scramble
                    through dense underbrush along the river H. in the lead peering intently hither
                    & yon & stopping occasionally. Then we strike right up the side
                    of a steep hill where the laurels are very thick - logs to climb over -
                    & all sorts of twigs catching at our hair & dress. H. now turns
                    & whispers to us to wait. So we stand in a little group expectant
                    &  for about ten minutes until he
                    stealthily returns & gives the word to start. Finally we strike a trail
                    through this dense underbrush a very new one too - which we follow to the edge
                    of a little patch of corn. Here we can see it dimly winding in & around
                    the stalks & on we go. It leads us to a  (a little little creek) Here we continue climbing over around
                    & under logs - branches - stones & trees - Part of the time we
                    walk in the creek itself. H. every little while
                    stops - listens & peers everywhere & points out places
                    occasionally where he says they have been "hidin' out" & sure enough you
                    can see remains of fires & flattened grass. It gets wilder &
                    wilder & darker for the branch is in a very narrow & thickly
                    overgrown "holler". I'm a perfect wreck as to my shoes - skirts - hair &
                    stockings but keep right after H. - we must have gone all of a mile up this
                    romantically wild spot when once more H. halts us & goes forward - By
                    this time we have had strong whiffs of whiskey & H. knows positively
                    he's on the trail - Yes & right ahead is a little semicircle where are
                    several barrels & the furnace - The still
                    itself however is gone - H. whispers all this to us - & that no doubt
                    it's hidden somewhere nearby - While they (the men) are pulling fodder. Pulling
                    fodder is stripping the leaves off the cornstalks for the cattle. Everyone is
                    doing that now - The stalks with the ears will stand until the frosts. "In about
                    two weeks" H. said "they'll be back at work again & then I'll come
                    & get them!" However he had expected to find  or  as I guess he had received pretty
                    good & reliable information as to their whereabouts. We girls were
                    disappointed not to have gotten the still itself but no doubt things turned out
                    for the best - as sometimes there's shooting & it's risky Evelyn told us
                    afterwards. It was rather dusky go - ing back down
                    that wild trail - mostly jumping over logs - & all the time going down
                    hill - Oh how hot & dirty & mussy we were - Finally after one
                    last wild dash through the undergrowth we got to the place to cross the river -
                    Here Mr. C. Emily & I performed several stunts on the rocks finally
                    getting wet to the knees! but we got over - back to the hack & our
                    lovely watermelon. As soon as Dan was hitched the feast began - What a picture
                    we must have made. Fortunately it was dark & no one cared for the
                    flashlight except to get watermelon. Dan was pretty impatient to be gone after
                    his long wait & went home quite briskly. We got H. to promise to take us
                    when he went after the still again & saying goodnight to the gents we
                    ran joyfully up the road to the house where Evelyn had saved us lovely cocoa,
                    salad - & cake. She thought it was a wonderful &  adventure but also thought we ought not to go
                    again as it didn't look well for the school nor was it very safe. Poor Mary -
                    when she washes my garments black as the ground half way up - what will she
                    think! for of course no one at the burg except Evelyn will ever know that we did
                    more than go for a ride & cooling our melon by the river got wet!! Such
                    is life!Well I must hasten on & stop - as its getting
                    late & 5 o'clock will soon be here. Have been just dying to tell you all
                    this before but just couldn't get it in last night for the trip was the most
                    strenuous thing I've done yet & bed seemed good!The chief event was our party - the Five Senses as I told you it was to be -
                    About thirty-five youngsters came - We began at 7:30 & by 9:30 all were
                    gone - The girls of the club - Evergreen Club - were supposed to be the
                    hostesses & 4 or 5 of them were here after school getting the stuff
                    ready & fixing tally cards - It went off beautifully & I think
                    was a novel & interesting occasion to them. They worked in pairs - Drew
                    partners thusly - Curtains hang be- tween hall
                    & living room & the girls on one side stuck their thumbs through
                    for the boys on the other side to choose - The first prize consisted of 2 little
                    pieces of apple pie all nicely done up in a box - white tissue paper etc. The
                    booby prize was a little green  done up in much
                    paper - Some songs finished the program & they all went home gayly - and
                    now I'm going to bid you all a fond goodnight & go to bed too -
                    Tell dear Mabel the list of plays & the book have come and I'm very much
                    indebted to her - To whom do I owe the money?With loads of love to you all as ever - Ruth-P.S. The papers have come - the social item was rich! R.S.Aug. 29.Dearest family - It's about 10 p.m. Friday and though I have to be ready by 6 in

        unusual process - However in spite of the cross

                    my Tom McCarter arrived for help with his Latin & thus the evening
                    flitted by -Thursday - was the day of days & you'll never guess how it ended - for
                    never in my wildest flights of fancy had I pictured myself in a raid on a still! Now what have you to say? Well to
                    begin at the first - Since Institute was to occupy our Saturday & the
                    preparations for the party & the party itself most of our spare time
                    Fri. - Emily & I hustled home &
                    got busy doing the sweeping & dusting downstairs - in our bedrooms - the
                    halls & stairs. About 5:30 I roamed out on the porch where sat Evelyn
                    (who got home the day before) Abbie & Aunt Lizzie. My room was not yet
                    dusted & the dustcloth still in 
        
        Page 07:  
        
        my hand but
                    I dropped down into one of our comfortable rockers & conversed. Pretty
                    soon Harrison (our man about the place you know & as I told you in one
                    letter a deputy sheriff) was seen driving Dan from the road up into the school
                    grounds & the hack (as a two seated buggy is
                    so designated) attached to him (Dan). This hack has been out of commission for
                    months & H. was just bringing it home. Evelyn said "Why don't you girls
                    get Harrison to take you for a little ride before dinner?" Of course we were
                    charmed & calling Emily - Abbie & I rushed across the grounds to
                    tell H. not to unhitch Dan. We coaxed him to take us & piling into the
                    dirty back seat we began chattering away & finally got to the subject of
                    stills by the time we were on the road - Well one remark brought forth another
                    & Harrison confided to us that he was going after a still about two
                    miles off the next night. Of course we wanted to go - but then there was our
                    party - Well why not go then & there if it was only two miles away? The
                    three of us were too much for him & he said "All right!" & then
                    added - "We'll stop & get Mr. Cresswell!" So we did tearing him away
                    from his dinner I imagine - We just told him to come on for a ride as the boys
                    were around - Then driving on a little farther to the store we stopped &
                    here were made preparations by dear Harrison. Really he simply convulsed us - he
                    was so mysterious & 
        
        Page 08:  
        
        cautious through
                    the whole performance - "just perfect" as Emily said. He got out & went
                    in the store - while we gleefully told Mr. C. what was doing - he was quite
                    thrilled too as it was a new experience for him as well as us. H. then came back
                    with a huge flashlight & a bag of candy for us maidens. Then Mr. Huff
                    comes along in his machine whom H. stops - then climbs in & disappears
                    down the road with him. We meanwhile giggle & eat the giddy gum drops
                    and other kinds (name unknown but of gorgeous color) & Mr. C. has the
                    happy thought of buying a huge watermelon which is put in the back. We send word
                    to Evelyn by the small boy Rellie (Mary's) not to wait supper for us. 
        
        Page 09:  
        
        H. now returns with a small covered basket
                    & goes in the store - comes out - puts basket on bench in front of store
                    - summons Mr. C. to a mysterious conference at one side of the road - after
                    which the two climb to the front seat & off we start down the road
                    towards Sevierville - When we get out of the burg a ways - H. gets out &
                    prowls along at the rear smoking cigarettes (I have a snap of him which I'll
                    send in due time) At last after about two miles of bumpy ups & downs we
                    turn around & drive close to one side of the road. Here we get out
                    & the men proceed to unhitch Dan. H. leads him off a ways & ties
                    him under a tree. While thus engaged two wagons 
        
        Page 10:  
        
        drawn by mules come around the bend in the road & H. immediately
                    conceals himself in the undergrowth along the river bank. When this danger is
                    over we all scramble down to the river - which was quite shallow - rocky
                    & narrow. We are to cross it stepping lightly from stone to stone. Well
                    Abbie makes it beautifully - I'm in that old white dress & my white
                    pumps & before I get across slip in neatly to my ankles - Emily also
                    steps off - She is wearing French heels! Safely on the other side we scramble
                    through dense underbrush along the river H. in the lead peering intently hither
                    & yon & stopping occasionally. Then we strike right up the side
                    of a steep hill where the laurels are very thick - logs to climb over -
                    & all sorts of twigs catching at our hair & dress. H. now turns
                    & whispers to us to wait. So we stand in a little group expectant
                    & atwitter for about ten minutes until he
                    stealthily returns & gives the word to start. Finally we strike a trail
                    through this dense underbrush a very new one too - which we follow to the edge
                    of a little patch of corn. Here we can see it dimly winding in & around
                    the stalks & on we go. It leads us to a branch (a little little creek) Here we continue climbing over around
                    & under logs - branches - stones & trees - Part of the time we
                    
        
        Page 11:  
        
        walk in the creek itself. H. every little while
                    stops - listens & peers everywhere & points out places
                    occasionally where he says they have been "hidin' out" & sure enough you
                    can see remains of fires & flattened grass. It gets wilder &
                    wilder & darker for the branch is in a very narrow & thickly
                    overgrown "holler". I'm a perfect wreck as to my shoes - skirts - hair &
                    stockings but keep right after H. - we must have gone all of a mile up this
                    romantically wild spot when once more H. halts us & goes forward - By
                    this time we have had strong whiffs of whiskey & H. knows positively
                    he's on the trail - Yes & right ahead is a little semicircle where are
                    several barrels & the furnace - 
        
        Page 12:  
        
        The still
                    itself however is gone - H. whispers all this to us - & that no doubt
                    it's hidden somewhere nearby - While they (the men) are pulling fodder. Pulling
                    fodder is stripping the leaves off the cornstalks for the cattle. Everyone is
                    doing that now - The stalks with the ears will stand until the frosts. "In about
                    two weeks" H. said "they'll be back at work again & then I'll come
                    & get them!" However he had expected to find it or them as I guess he had received pretty
                    good & reliable information as to their whereabouts. We girls were
                    disappointed not to have gotten the still itself but no doubt things turned out
                    for the best - as sometimes there's shooting & it's risky Evelyn told us
                    afterwards. It was rather dusky go - 
        
        Page 13:  
        
        ing back down
                    that wild trail - mostly jumping over logs - & all the time going down
                    hill - Oh how hot & dirty & mussy we were - Finally after one
                    last wild dash through the undergrowth we got to the place to cross the river -
                    Here Mr. C. Emily & I performed several stunts on the rocks finally
                    getting wet to the knees! but we got over - back to the hack & our
                    lovely watermelon. As soon as Dan was hitched the feast began - What a picture
                    we must have made. Fortunately it was dark & no one cared for the
                    flashlight except to get watermelon. Dan was pretty impatient to be gone after
                    his long wait & went home quite briskly. We got H. to promise to take us
                    when he went after the still again & saying goodnight to the gents we
                    ran joyfully up the road to the house where Evelyn had saved us lovely cocoa,
                    salad - & cake. She thought it was a wonderful & unusual adventure but also thought we ought not to go
                    again as it didn't look well for the school nor was it very safe. Poor Mary -
                    when she washes my garments black as the ground half way up - what will she
                    think! for of course no one at the burg except Evelyn will ever know that we did
                    more than go for a ride & cooling our melon by the river got wet!! Such
                    is life!Well I must hasten on & stop - 
        
        Page 14:  
        
        as its getting
                    late & 5 o'clock will soon be here. Have been just dying to tell you all
                    this before but just couldn't get it in last night for the trip was the most
                    strenuous thing I've done yet & bed seemed good!The chief event was our party - the Five Senses as I told you it was to be -
                    About thirty-five youngsters came - We began at 7:30 & by 9:30 all were
                    gone - The girls of the club - Evergreen Club - were supposed to be the
                    hostesses & 4 or 5 of them were here after school getting the stuff
                    ready & fixing tally cards - It went off beautifully & I think
                    was a novel & interesting occasion to them. They worked in pairs - Drew
                    partners thusly - Curtains hang be- 
        
        Page 15:  
        
        tween hall
                    & living room & the girls on one side stuck their thumbs through
                    for the boys on the other side to choose - The first prize consisted of 2 little
                    pieces of apple pie all nicely done up in a box - white tissue paper etc. The
                    booby prize was a little green tomatoe done up in much
                    paper - Some songs finished the program & they all went home gayly - and
                    now I'm going to bid you all a fond goodnight & go to bed too -
                    Tell dear Mabel the list of plays & the book have come and I'm very much
                    indebted to her - To whom do I owe the money?With loads of love to you all as ever - Ruth-P.S. The papers have come - the social item was rich! R.S.Aug. 29.
