                    Dearest family - My pen is upstairs & I am  to make a special trip after it - so please 
                    excuse this pencil which fortunately for me I found in the table drawers - though unfortunately for you isn't it? It is Sunday night again after a lovely day 
                    - warm & sunny for a wonder - though the weather prophets around here predict rain for tomorrow.

                    Such a storm of rain & wind as sprung up that night! The worst yet with thunder & lightning thrown in early in the morning - It tried to clear Friday 
                    but didn't succeed entirely but the debate came off in the evening just the same. Did I tell you the subject. Resolved that fire is more destructive than water. 
                    Such a useless thing but Mr.  choice.

                    things all day - mended & cleaned my wool dresses - darned in the evening - read some of my literature & spent a busy & peaceful day
