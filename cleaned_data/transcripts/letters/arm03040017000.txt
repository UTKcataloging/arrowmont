                    It is a wonderful morning & here I am writing you peacefully in my room - Don't you wonder why I'm
                    not at school? Well school closed yesterday for like you we have smallpox in our midst - Last Saturday it was
                    rumored that Ephraim Ogle (Charlie's father) had it but you know doctors are not always certain about the
                    disease - sometimes getting it confused with measles - so we just wondered about it & went along as usual - 
                    People went to see him - Charlie kept the store open until Monday night when he closed it & it was known for
                    certain that smallpox was the disease - So many have been exposed that we wondered about going on with school &
                    finally decided to do so. Then Dr. Massy came up yesterday  & thought we 
                    ought to close and not give the exercises to a crowd as  we had planned - He
                    thinks that smallpox may have been in the soldiers clothes that have been sold here. So at noon yesterday was
                    great excitement - We decided to go through the program just by ourselves & get together our stage properties 
                    etc. Decorated a little & by 2 the thing was in full swing - no guests of course - Had school magazine - songs
                    by Emily's primary class - Mother Goose Play by Abbie's - my Japanese lantern drill & then the play - 
                    Bunch of Roses - It went off well & we were pleased & so were the youngsters tho 
                    at first peeved - Emily & Mr.  left about four & Abby went down with Dr.
                    Massy last night - So Evelyn & I are left with Mrs.  & Aunt 
                     - a Pi Phi Miss Turnbull visited us arriving Tuesday noon and leaving after dinner 
                    today. Since I began this have taken a walk with her up to Tom 's - Last 
                    night we went up  - She thinks everything very picturesque & was quite
                    appalled with the inside of the  house - the way they live - their daughter etc.
                
                    Monday we all went over to the hotel where we had a wond-erfully grand dinner - 
                    chicken lemon pie etc. Mrs. Huff was there too. As to the smallpox Dr.  said it was
                    perfectly all right for me to stay here a week - I wondered if we would all be quarantined - He said he'd 
                    see that I got out all right if that were done. The days will just fly by I'm sure - am going to make some
                    combinations mend - pack - visit - 
                
                    Friday  Am so sorry I didn't get the chance to send this off by yesterday's
                    mail. The newspapers came yesterday & the clippings which were very interesting - Some of the churches are
                    beginning to realize that healing today should be as possible as 
                    A terrible wind & rainstorm descended on us last night but it is "brite & fair" this
                     Evelyn leaves this  Everyone is beginning to 
                    work outside in the fields now getting the ground ready for crops - 
                
                    Wonder isfthe smallpox excitement with you has subsided? I know you do not think much of vaccination but am 
                    going to send you this clipping anyway.
                
                    Dearest Family: A long letter from Jane Monday and another yesterday (Wednesday) so feel
                    quite pleased and especially glad to hear about the skirt - Bessie is a dear to do
                    it & hope she remembers that I've gained about 15lbs! Such a sadness comes over my spirits when I stand before a mirror or put on my
                    blue crepe dechine or that little gray wash dress - in fact everything fits very
                    snugly except my sweater & that fortunately can expand even as I do - It will take at least a week

         for the package to come through so perhaps you better mail it to Mrs. E. A. 
                    Helmick - 3750 Oliver St. N. W. Wash. D.C. That is if it won't have plenty of time to get here by 
                    Apr 3 - (Sat.) for I expect to leave Monday morning 
                    Apr 5 - before the mail gets in - But these directions are no doubt useless for perhaps
                    by this time the skirt is on its way - It is perfectly lovely of you Jane to make me a present of it & I will
                    accept it & hope to get even with you soon. Am glad I did not get it last year for now it will be nice

         and fresh & anyway would have been too tight. Am glad pa is so well & 
                    that you have both enjoyed your work. Hope my Sunday letter will stir you up to coming east. As to money I have 
                    about two hundred dollars which I hope will suffice until after the D.A.R. - If not will write to you for the 
                    loan of some but hope it won't be necessary - 
                    It is a wonderful morning & here I am writing you peacefully in my room - Don't you wonder why I'm

                    Monday we all went over to the hotel where we had a wond-

                    beginning to realize that healing today should be as possible as in the times of the writings
                    of the the Old & New Testament. As long as my movements seem so uncertain think I'll have my Science
                    literature sent home until I get settled in my mind just where I will be - Felt just like giving up everything
                    when Emily left Wednesday - Do you wonder?
                    A terrible wind & rainstorm descended on us last night but it is "brite & fair" this
                    a.m. Evelyn leaves this p.m. Everyone is beginning to
