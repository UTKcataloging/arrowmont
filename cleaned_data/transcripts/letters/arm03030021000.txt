                    Dearest Jane - As usual this is Sunday night & after  - Mabel said in 
                    her letter that I was always coming  or going to 
                    This has been a long day of  as you will see - when I tell you that I spent
                    three solid hours at the "church-house" this  & went to 
                    for over an hour tonight. Poor Emily did the same - only had her own particular  in the
                     besides - I really enjoyed the sermon this morning - it was by a Mr. Conner a man who used to preach here at
                    one time and a real character but  the most broad minded individual any of us know who is connected with the 
                    Baptist Church. The Southern Baptists are trying to raise 75 million by the 7th of next month & Gatlinburg's quota is !
                    $ 249 was pledged this morning  and the church was not more than a third full at that! It is rather hard work getting
                    them started but imagine that they will come through with the full amount eventually.
                
                    It's awfully windy this dark night but not very cold - Can you picture us all trailing over to the school single file each with an unlighted lamp in her
                    hand & back again - The schoolroom (mine) filled up before it was over & imagine about sixty were there as many sat two together. Betty Russell
                    one of the girls was leader - about half a dozen topics from the Quarterly were briefly discussed by different boys & girls - most of them in school - 
                    We sang several hymns - I read the Thanksgiving Proclamation & made a few remarks - quite the thing for us to get up & talk - you know - 
                    about every so often. 
                    After this we came home and had our lunch around the library table in front of the fireplace just as we do home - Emily & I got it for fun - cold biscuits - 
                     - roast pork - blackberry jam & tea - Evelyn's pig was killed yesterday - 273 ,
                    & perfectly wonderful pork as it makes - Aunt Lizzie & Mrs.  worked over it all day after the men killed it.
                
                    We were busy as usual doing the Saturday tasks & in the  made some calls - really looking for a rattlesnake skin
                    to use in the play - which we didn't get but found out where one can be - We also explored a perfect little "holler" with a deserted cabin in
                    the middle of it. Spent the evening making three Puritan hats of paper for the boys - 
                
                    Friday was a full day as I guess I told you it would be - dinner party & debate in the evening. 
                
                    It's over an hour since I started this epistle as Miss Langmaid who was writing also at the other end of the table has been telling me of some of the 
                    difficulties of the early days of the school - so have been rather incoherent in spots haven't I?

                    p.m. besides - I really enjoyed the sermon this morning - it was by a Mr. Conner a man who used to preach here at

                    Will cease for now & dash off a scribble to pa -
