                     Dearest family - I started a letter to you earlier in the evening & then was interrupted & later on coming to bed left it downstairs but do want to dash off a few lines to 
                    you  - hence the scribbling with pencil & this kind of paper. Everyone has gone to bed - its a cold night & 
                    the coldest day we've had yet - Yesterday was so warm a wrap was unnecessary Towards evening it began raining & grew quite windy & cold. As no letter has
                    come from you this week can make no comments. You were so good about writing Thanksgiving that I quite forgive the absence of the usual Monday letter. A grand long letter
                    from Mabel & also from "" have come & the newspapers - For all of which I thank the senders muchly & greatly 
                    enjoyed reading.
                
                     The last three days - Monday  & today have flown by on wings & do not know where they have gone. Monday
                     the girls made cocoa & ginger snap in cooking class which they brought over here for the club meeting. About twenty came. I
                    had the three officers serve immediately as some have so far to go home - a few brought sewing - We  talked about fixing baskets to 
                    take to several sick people & then dispersed about 4. I hustled over to school & mixed up the powdered paints until nearly dark - preparatory to painting toys
                    the next  Then Emily & I took a short walk up the river returning to a supper of hot chocolate & toast. Miss Langmaid &
                    Evelyn had gone up to Crocket Maples' on Fighting Creek (where we three stayed one night) with the two boys - 
                    & Ephraim. Tuesday was another busy-ness - painted toys the last three quarters of an hour - rehearsed tableaux & helped youngsters till about dark - Spent both
                    evenings looking over papers - Evelyn & Miss  were home last night & so it was not quite
                    so peaceful as the one before.
                
                     Tonight Evelyn drilled Abbie's class & then I want through tableaux again & mixed up paint. Just as I finished Emily arrived with the information that
                    she & Evelyn were going up to the Oakley's on Mill Creek - a distance of nearly two miles or more. It was a bright & sunny 
                    in spite of the cold - & rushing home for my big coat & gloves off I went & soon overtook them  on the road overlooking the 
                    Huff's - where Miss Langmaid was calling - Such a pitiful family as we visited. There are six children from two to about twelve years. The mother has been sick so much
                    & the father with the help of the two little girls just get along the best they can. They live in a two story frame house such a bare forlorn place as it is. The father was outside
                    when we arrived - the mother & youngest in bed & the others so dirty & yet such attractive children. They are the ones to whom Emily took a lot of clothes not long
                    ago & who last week sent three of the youngsters to school - Elmer who came to me wears an undershirt over his  - it's part of the clothing  took. They couldn't be nice enough to us! A 
                    Gottschalk who stayed at the hotel last summer & who became acquainted with them sent the girls each some dolls & a little tea set. What do you suppose they have 
                    done with those dolls? Each is in a case with a glass door & fastened to the wall & the note of presentation with  each also. The
                    dishes are carefully arranged on a table around a cup containing a handful of yellow chicken feathers! The children have such nice manners & gave us each a handful
                    of dried bachelor buttons. Mr.  showed us some pieces of pine wood just heavy with rosin & insisted on our 
                    taking a piece - also a large chunk of  from an alum cave up in the  which we hope to visit some
                    day.
                
                     Will add my farewells this  at 7:15 It's cold & frosty again & will be sunny too. The odor of coffee permeates from
                    below - we usually have hot biscuits & once in awhile hot cakes - but not like yours!
                
                    Hoping a letter comes today - In two weeks you all will be saying Merry  - 
                    away from home - think of that!! Where & how will you celebrate it?
                
                     With loads of love to each & all
