         is a big town rather than a city - population 80 or 90,000 - 
                    people all awfully ordinary looking - no culture or refinement - It's a university town too. We went down one street where all the 
                    mountain people who drive in with produce line up their wagons while all the  city - people buy - 
                    regular public market - chickens - fruit - vegetables - nuts molasses & flowers for sale. We felt quite at home among them - so 
                    many familiar types!
                
                    Well we had to be at the depot by 7 - but as it was the Sunday we turned back our watches - it wasn't so bad. The car company 
                    started their cars that morning using strike breakers - and  later in the day there was trouble & 
                    has been all week - state troops are there now as a general strike is set for Saturday -  1st -
                
                    The ride between   &  was lovely for it's in the mountains 
                    where the foliage is becoming gorgeous - its farther along than up here - where there is much greenness yet - our field of rye is fresh & green 
                    just right for the cows now. When we reached  again & had gotten into a jitney ready for the ride up the hill to the 
                    Bishop's Evelyn came climbing up with the information that if we so desired we would all leave for  
                    Valley where she wanted to find a basket woman. Of course we were all enthusiasm - so hastening home we had a hasty lunch & then set forth in 
                    the worst looking old Ford - we three girls & Mrs. B. - but the top was down - the day was lovely - too warm for wraps so we were all gay 
                    as larks - Wears Valley is in the mountains back of Pigeon Forge - It's a wild country - the people real mountaineers and the cabin where we 
                    went was typical - 4 double beds in one little room with small built in kitchen - walls covered with news paper - baskets & 
                    dried stuff hanging around - rocker table & straight chairs - Two half grown & very pretty girls were home - It seemed miles aways from 
                    civilization & so it is in more than one sense.
                
                    The people are so attractive & well featured in spite of the dirt & untidiness.
                
                    Well we got to Pigeon Forge about two where our same rigs met us and by 4:30 we were home again - Aunt Lizzie & Mrs. Profit waiting on 
                    the front porch for us & so pleased to see us as we had  been gone over the week end.
                
                    It took the rest of the day to clean up - put away cot & go to  where three of 
                    us teachers had to talk impromptu.
                
                    Monday I spent getting papers & report cards ready - Tuesday (yesterday) was spent in getting a letter  
                    for the Arrow about the school - Stopped a little while to go down to a corn husking in the Maples
                    barn at the foot of our lane - weather uncertain so not a large crowd -
                
                    Tonight was the debate - only two of us on a side & the other side won - However it was fun after all & no doubt I won't mind 
                    next time  really didn't mind it much tonight.
