                    My last was written Wednesday - started it in the  & then finished it that night - Well - after school Thursday - we girls - 
                    Abbey Emily & I went to Aunt Lydia's after some baskets. It was a perfectly beautiful day warm & bright (have been wearing my lovely sweater
                    & cap on walks lately as it's been so nice) and we had a very nice call & came  home loaded with baskets.
                
                     I sent Lida $18's worth Friday - and told her to bring to you what she couldn't sell among the girls - Jane - The money goes to Mrs. 
                    Richardson whose name is on the bill. Aunt Lydia has a number of willows growing on the bank of the "branch" just outside her cabin door that
                    she trims for making the baskets - "golden willow" she calls it & just the color of gold too.
                
                     Friday was the debate on suffrage - the whole community is against I guess - Several of those who were to take the part wouldn't the last minute - but
                    managed to fill in their  as we had discussed it quite thoroughly in school that afternoon. The negative side was given the 
                    decision of course - 
                
                     We were glad when the drill by my girls was over & could come home -  Two men representing the Delco - Light System 
                    were  here whom Miss Langmaid had asked to come up way before . They went over
                    things that night - showed their illustrations etc. & the next morning went over the place & will send in an estimate soon - it will be nearly $2000
                    including everything but the fixtures - all the buildings & the grounds lighted. However it's not definitely decided yet.
                
                    Saturday morning was busy as usual & in the  went up to the Forks of the River with Cora Ogle - Lucrettie Reagan &
                    her mother. The girls were going to stay for a sing that evening - but Martha Reagan & I just called at Ollie Carr's (one of my girls) & then came 
                    back & stopped & made another call on  - Charlie Ogle's wife - who is a Maples - the oldest daughter of Squire
                    Maples where we stayed for dinner last Sunday.
                
                    Dr. Massy was here for dinner & stayed all night making a pleasant break in things. He is dabbling in lumber and has made a good deal of 
                     money this  & winter I guess - 
                
                    As this was church Sunday we put in the three  usual  session - Poor Evelyn
                     three hours yesterday afternoon. (Guess I'm getting
                    sleepy - have made so many mistakes!) After dinner I dashed off some letters and did some reading - Then three of the little girls - who dropped in - Evelyn &
                    I went  the road to meet the girls as they drove back - Next was supper followed by 
                     & then we sat around the fire a little while before coming upstairs. The light  went out at
                    church tonight & finally the two lamps - so that we  had to send for our two faithful Rochesters to finish things. So endeth this 
                    day!

                    has been on the job a long time. Thank you for the papers.
                    It seems so funny to think of Jane working & pa home - it's surely a change for you both!
