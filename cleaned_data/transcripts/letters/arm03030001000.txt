                    Dearest pa - your note or rather card came today & was very glad to know that you are en route - 
                    Hope it is Pullman - If not  - that 
                    it is next time. Shall be interested in hearing your impressions of the Golden State and hope you 
                    like it as well as I did for California more than fulfilled my expectations. Tonight - Wednesday - am 
                    sitting in front of a happy blaze in the fireplace as tis cold & rainy outside. Emily is taking a piano 
                    lesson from Evelyn. I am going to start vocal with her as soon as my music books come from home. 
                    Think that will be loads of fun - Aunt Lizzie left for her daughter's yesterday. She lives about 
                    seven or eight miles from here up in the Sugar Fords. We girls are planning to go Friday to a place 
                    up in the mountains called Elkmont & quite a summer resort is it too. We will drive to the foot of 
                    the mountain about six miles or so & then climb to the top - stay all night at the hotel & next 
                    morning go in a logging train  way up 
                    the mountains to a lumber camp getting back to the burg same time Saturday evening. That sounds exciting 
                    doesn't it? The timber around here is the largest found east of the Mississippi but is not as large as some 
                    of ours.
                
                    The way people slide along about things is really remarkable - for instance Evelyn has been trying to find out since last 
                    April how much we owe at the store - and hasn't succeeded yet - The people are awfully honest too - I forgot my 
                    purse one day at school & left it on my desk & not a penny had been touched & they tell me that is 
                    always so.
                
                    Had a lovely ride last night after school of about four miles - A mile on these roads is you know  
                    much great consumer of time than the same distance on our good roads at home. 
                    Evelyn & Abbie decided to go in to a concert at Sevierville last evening and as Estel Huff said he would take 
                    them down about four miles on the way - Emily & I piled into the Ford too & came back with Estel. He is 
                    one of my high school youngsters you know. The girls walked about 3 miles on to Pigeon Forge where they found 
                    a car to take them the remaining seven miles to Sevierville. Then they came up early this 
                     in time for school - but had to pay $5 for the trip. Monday was a 
                    most peaceful day - Jane had sent me that funny story - "The Young Visitors" and after school where 
                    I stayed late however I sat on the porch & read & chuckled over it. Then in the evening I read it to the 
                    girls whom thoroughly enjoyed it too. My  four high school youngsters are 
                    beginning to work up a little play adapted from Courtship of Miles Standish for Thanksgiving. We went through 
                    it all after school tonight and had a great time doing it too - They are so funny - we all had the giggles.
                
                    There are going to be  evenings before many 
                    more days - in fact they have begun already & hope to get things done - just what I don't know yet - but shall 
                    keep busy - and then can't get homesick you know.
                
                    Write soon do -
                
                    With loads of love dear pa -
