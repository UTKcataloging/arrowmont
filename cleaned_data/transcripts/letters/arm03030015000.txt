                    Dearest pa - It's Sunday night about 9:30 and more than bedtime. Emily & I have done our duty & gone to 
                     and then visited with Mr. Cresswell & Tom McCarter - one of the 
                    boys in school and very nice too - he is quite discouraged as he has to stay out so much to help with the farming at home & in 
                    fact they all peg away for dear life & no more than make a living I guess. You see the land here in the  
                    is productive enough but the soil is very thin and washes away in the hard rains too.
                
                    You aught to hear the wind tonight it is tearing up everything for miles around. And the trees have turned so much today - the coloring is simply 
                    wonderful now - great masses of yellow with long lines of green from the evergreens which seem to grow in 
                    clumps together rather than scattered. Then every so often is a tree one mass of fiery red from top to bottom or copper color - you can't imagine 
                    how beautiful it is. Even the youngsters are stirred by it!
                
                    There has been great excitement here now today for yesterday noon a shooting occurred up in the Sugar lands. An old man Mr. Bracken shot down 
                    a young boy. It seems that  Mr.  reported this boy to be implicated in running 
                    a still the boy came down to his house to talk to him about it and was shot - killed instantly no witnesses & conflicting stories - so today 
                    Squire Maples had a trial or examination down here at his house at the foot of our lane - The upshot is that he is out on bail & the trial to be 
                    next month I believe. They say men are drunk up in the Sugar lands every Saturday night & I imagine it's not very safe - the very heart 
                    of the "still country." Some of the youngsters played truant from school to go  and guess I'll just 
                    have to keep them in tomorrow to make up their lessons - you can't blame them for being interested though - we wanted to go ourselves. 
                    I went down to the store about four p.m. to mail the baskets I'm sending home - just before the trial was over - There were a number of 
                    saddle horses and the big picturesque wagons outside. The mountain men are all so much alike - tall 
                    lean & shrewd looking - think I'll always be able to pick one out hereafter.
                
                    All the past week I've been pretty busy working at school till late over one thing and another. My room does look pretty though - and try to keep it 
                    orderly which is not easy for the boys & girls are not like those at home about helping & act as though they were doing a great favor thereby. 
                    However they are improving in that respect.
                
                    The red Cross meeting Friday night was poorly attended being made up of the school youngsters & the  
                    crowd. Don't know whether we got in our quota or not - nor how much it was. Evelyn talked  
                    also Miss Langmaid as the expected speaker from Sevierville failed to arrive.
                
                    Sunday after the usual session of Sunday School Emily & I walked up Baskin's Creek with the Ogle girls to their home - about a mile 
                    or so - crossing the creek exactly twelve times on the way - via footlogs. We didn't stay for dinner though urgently pressed to do so - There was 
                    a possibility of our going in the Ford up to the forks of the river & besides that we didn't feel like corn bread pork & potatoes. At home 
                    was a ground beef roast & fruit. Mrs. Ogle however brought forth a dish of baked sweet potatoes just out of 
                    the oven & insisted on our taking some - So we walked home peeling our "tater" & thoroughly enjoying it. But how funny to go away 
                    from the house where you call heaving a hot potato in your hand - yet it seemed quite natural & not a bit surprising. See how accustomed to things 
                    I'm becoming.
                
                    I must tell you about the names of two youngsters arrived here - at least they were when Miss Langmaid taught here about four years ago. One little 
                    girl & the niece of our Aunt Lizzie was Exy. short for  
                    and another Lar ce ny - Do you get that? examine & larceny!

                Your letter came the next day just as I had hoped - I mean the day after yours came
						I wrote you. Didn't finish last night after all - same interruption came along. A long letter came from 
                        Mabel this morning & also from Cousin Viva Glasier. She was quite surprised to learn of all the happenings in our family I guess.

                The folio you sent from Berkeley has not arrived and hope all your other letters have - Am so glad you are going south 
                    & having such a good time everywhere. While in Los Angeles you better hunt up the girl I taught with in Ilwaco 
                    - Mrs. J. R. Hawkins 1250 West 48th St. I visited her a couple of weeks when there - they were very nice to me. Call her up anyway over the phone - 
                    Was glad to get the kodaks & think them pretty good - Have just sent in another set to be developed & will send you some if good - Goodnight 
                    dear papa - & with much love
                    Ruth.
