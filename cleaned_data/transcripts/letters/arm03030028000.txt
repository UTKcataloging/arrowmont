                    Dearest family - Thursday night & I'm  to start for New Orleans at 1 p.m.
                    tomorrow - and now feel that we are really going - but I'd rather be  for 
                     than anything else! But since it's impossible there's no use thinking of it.  everything done for tomorrow. It seemed last week as though we never could do it all in the short time left but here it is all accomplished.
                
                    Yes I think Miss Langmaid  approves of me - they talk about my being
                    here next year! However shall wait awhile before anything definite is settled. If I do stay - don't suppose I'll get home do you? But am not going to think
                    about that for awhile! 
                    Monday I got home about 4 p.m. from school - washed - & shampooed - had supper & spent the 
                    doing up presents for youngsters in my class - Some of the clubs had sent things some were left over from last year & some bought by Evelyn for the school - games  - 
                     - handkerchiefs neckties & writing paper for mine - Abbie's & Emily's have more toys of course - something for
                    each child - in school - besides little bag of candy & oranges - We got everything spread out & sorted over in the  living room - 
                    Abbie & Mr.  were here to help too - & checked off our lists & tied & labelled - Tuesday was more practicing again
                    & then Miss  Evelyn Emily & I went over to Lawson Reagan's (our chorister) on 
                    for supper - We had a very nice time - Allie the married daughter whom I helped chivarari - is home - she & Flora one 
                    of my girls served - we four ate with Mrs. Reagan - It was very nicely done for  but rightly poor cooking at that. Then we sat around the 
                    fireplace & ate popcorn - perfectly delicious stuff - some of their own produce which they peeled right off the ears then & there. We got home after eight & with
                    Emily's help I made three trumpets - two helmets - three  bands for  - all for my tableaux. My 
                    millinery lessons have proved most useful - for they give my a foundation for these other ! I made the helmets 
                    this shape - of stiff paper covered with gold - trumpets ditto. Wednesday - (yesterday) Evelyn came over at 11:15 & we went through the tableaux - so that I left school early
                    & commenced getting things ready for packing & kept busy at it till supper - Mr. & Mrs. Steve Whaley arrived to call so we sat around & visited in the 
                    evening with them. I got out ! This morning we had regular classes until recess at 10 - when Evelyn came over
                    & we went through the program having a dress rehearsal - It lasted until noon. This  some of the boys helped get greens etc. but 
                    we had no school whatsoever - finished our list of  presents  - decorated the school - got the tree ready too. It's
                     about the same as usual - hemlock & holly everywhere - and hemlock for the tree. The stage is arranged as it was Thanksgiving - 
                    After the program (which begins at 10 tomorrow) we will put up the other panel & display the tree which is set up in Abbie's room - Tom is to be Santa Claus - said
                    tonight that he "took Fourth of July & Easter fairly well" but that  didn't mean much  to him - also fussed over
                    wearing the Santa Claus suit remarking that he didn't feel  like wearing anything much! He 
                    didn't think how it sounded so I overlooked it entirely!
                
                    By 4:20 everything was done as far as we girls could see so we came home & I made out our month's attendance - my sweet little job for the whole school you know - 
                    Then it was supper time & after that finished my packing and at 8:30 came down to the living room to write you all.
                
                    We four teachers go down to  tomorrow - Evelyn & Miss  plan to leave Saturday morning. Miss
                     bound for home & Evelyn expects to be home vacation too - her brother & sister with their families are coming a 
                     which she is looking  forward to as they have not all been together for a number of years.
                
                     The county schools all close this week - so that no doubt we will have more pupils next month - as ours is the only one except  other 
                    private schools - the nearest is at !
                
                    Am just so sleepy I can't make the pen journey any farther.

                    Dearest family - Thursday night & I'm allready to start for New Orleans at 1 p.m.
                    tomorrow - and now feel that we are really going - but I'd rather be cominghome for 
                    Xmas than anything else! But since it's impossible there's no use thinking of it. Wonder if
                    you have all your Xmas work done & where you will spend the day & how. Imagine my package is almost in your 
                    midst - It's so huge it will be quite exciting to have around unopened for a week or so won't it? All of our preparations have gone off very smoothly &
                    easily with everything done for tomorrow. It seemed last week as though we never could do it all in the short time left but here it is all accomplished.
                
                    The sweater is perfectlygrand
        
        Page 03:  
        
        a perfect fit and just all right - and am "plum"
                    tickled over it - It's locked up in my trunk until my return though I would take it if there were room - "sure enough," Papa - I did not find any almonds so 
                    suppose you concluded not to send any - People don't get them here - We would have enjoyed the fruit somuch
                    if you had sent it for there has been a great scarcity all fall & winter - even of the apples. At present we are reveling in Florida oranges - little brown things full of seeds &
                    tough skin but the juice is delicious!
                    Is Arthur moved yet - at home & in his office? Why did he give up the Chalmers? Is the Lizzie the same old girl or another?
                    Yes I think Miss Langmaid 
        
        Page 04:  
        
         approves of me - they talk about my cobeing
                    here next year! However shall wait awhile before anything definite is settled. If I do stay - don't suppose I'll get home do you? But am not going to think
                    about that for awhile! How are the prospects for California now? Hope I get a letter tomorrow before I leave & my Xmas
                    box whatever it may be for I do expect something! A lovely pair of black silk stockings arrived from sweet "Caz" for which I'm duly grateful & shall wear them on the most gala occasio day of my visit
                    in N.O whatever it may prove to be! Then Cousin Viva sent me a very pretty box of candy which shall save for
                    Xmas day as it's labeled not to be opened until then. Today a grand long letter came from Charlotte - the first I've had
                    since I was there - George is sick again but is recovering and she devotes all her time to him - the rest of the family seem well. Why not a ranch in Yakima - 
                    turkeyfarm! George is planning to raise even more next year he has been so successful with them. She sent
                    me a couple of kodaks of Viretta's  two youngsters - boy & girl - said they were darling - latter about the age of Nellie Jane &
                    the boy not quite so old as Weir I imagine.
                    The pastals & toys are very very pretty - Jane & are most welcome - am taking them south as I 
                    shall mail all my cards from there - am sending a little hearth broom to Aunt Carrie - basket to Maudie and if Fannie C. 
        
        Page 05:  
        
        Anderson ever writes to me have a little one for her - Shall get some little thing for each of the girls here - Emily - Abbie &
                    Evelyn also Mrs. Bishop - and that I think with Aunt Lizzie's & Mrs. Proffit's will prove the extent of my shopping.
                    Monday I got home about 4 p.m. from school - washed - & shampooed - had supper & spent the eve
                    doing up presents for youngsters in my class - Some of the clubs had sent things some were left over from last year & some bought by Evelyn for the school - games  - 
                    dolls - handkerchiefs neckties & writing paper for mine - Abbie's & Emily's have more toys of course - something for

                    Abbie & Mr. C. were here to help too - & checked off our lists & tied & labelled - Tuesday was more practicing again
                    & then Miss L. Evelyn Emily & I went over to Lawson Reagan's (our chorister) on Roaring Fork
