                    Dearest family - 
                
                    Wednesday night again though it seems no time at all since I wrote you Sunday . Pa's letter came today with Jane's
                    note enclosed & was pleased as usual to see the familiar handwriting again. The paints came yesterday for which I will send remittance and was charmed to get
                    them. We are going to begin painting next week - Think of that! Emily & I also wrote tonight about  our reservations for New Orleans
                    trip to the Christian Woman's Exchange (corresponding to ) & which a Pi Phi there
                    recommended to us in a letter to Evelyn as  & reasonable! It's hard to realize Christmas is so near. 
                
                    Monday the girls began making Christmas cards with great enthusiasm - something never done before - you can't buy postals of any description here 
                     seals nor any of those things. After this long session with them I took a walk up Pi Phi Lane & on up to the top of the hill
                    where one can now get a view as the foliage is gone from most of the trees. It  was lovely & the moon was very bright by the 
                    time I got back - We had an early supper with Aunt Lizzie after which I sat down at the piano & played Pi Phi &  songs - 
                    something I hadn't done for months! Tom  dropped in on his way home - having been up at Mr. Cresswell's where he
                    stays half the time anyway - He is a great character - likes to object to everything first & then goes ahead & meekly does as told!
                
                    Tuesday after school I went through the twelve tableaux for the  program giving the story of the Christ child - my girls only will be in 
                    it - as the boys did the Thanksgiving program mostly. They are quite enthusiastic over it - Think they will be better than boys - as shepherds wise men - King Herod - etc. for 
                    their long hair will be quite appropriate & the costumes will be robes - (kimonos - nightgowns for the angels - & if possible some of the 
                    gowns!) One of the older girls reads the story & at appropriate places old  hymns will be sung by Abbie's class - Maybe
                    I told you all this before! Well - Emily & I took a walk after this rehearsing - going up Mill Creek then down a long winding  named
                    Turkey's Nest & so home - Grand night again - we scuffled through some dead leaves nearly to our knees in places. Another early supper after which I looked 
                    over the papers a little while & then started  my monthly letter to the Pi Phis - retiring quite early! This noon Evelyn & Miss Langmaid returned after a very nice trip 
                    but were delighted to see the  & our  which are not so high & rugged as 
                     Carolina's. Another rehearsal after school - Emily & I stroll down the river  - I look over a lot of clippings for school tonight & talk
                    over  program with Evelyn & Miss  - a very nice evening too. Had a nice long letter from 
                    Mr. Snell today. He is surely an old dear. The clock tells me it's bedtime again - wish it wouldn't go around quite so fast as I would like to write more in detail - 
                    This is such a short letter but loads of love comes with it for you all - 
                
                    Ruth.
                
                    Thanks for stamps
                
                    How much exchange on my check?

                    trip to the Christian Woman's Exchange (corresponding to Y.W.) & which a Pi Phi there
                    recommended to us in a letter to Evelyn as nice & reasonable! It's hard to realize Christmas is so near. 
                
                    Isn't it nice to have pa home again - his jaunting in California always startled me when I got a letter from him & am glad he liked the southern part so well - He
					should have gone on down to Mexico - Tia Juana - & over to 
        
        Page 03:  
        
        Catalina Island first however. Wonder where
                    you will wind up - California or elsewhere? I do not believe you would like Reedley or Fresno as a permanent home - but it's not for me to decide.
                    I can just imagine what a grand dinner you had all together Thanksgiving day & how sweet the youngsters must be - and would love to be with you Xmas
                    - but am still glad I came here. Prices simply startle me when I hear them given. When my clothes are worn out wonder what I'll wear - So far they are lasting well &
                    I feel quite dressy even in the old red gown - challis ditto.
