                     Dearest family - 
                
                     It's six o'clock this dark cloudy morning & am sitting in bed done up in bathrobe & comforter. Harrison started the fire in the furnace some time ago
                    but things are not warmed up yet. I intended writing last night but was so sleepy just left my lessons & everything & was in bed by eight or before I guess. We
                    have all had a sleepy spell lately - the weather is warm & rainy again which may partly account for it.
                
                     No - Evelyn hasn't given me any singing lessons after all - her music lessons have dropped off - entirely - Stella Huff is the only one starting again - Miss Langmaid
                    stopped them by her absorbing visit.
                
                     Monday after school (a lovely day & the last one of this week) Emily & I went up Mill Creek with the Oakley children & made a little call at their cabin &
                    then went on to some cousins of theirs - Nicholas hasn't been in school lately & I wanted to find out why. They live in a frame house & are quite
                    comfortably fixed for these parts - It's about three miles from here right at the foot of the mountains which are higher than at the  - 
                    Le Conte the highest peak of  is just a short distance away. We had a very nice time and came home through Turkey's
                    Nest arriving just at dark - Evelyn & Abbie went to the hotel for the night to visit Josie Trentham & her mother - They have charge for the Huff's you know.
                
                     Tuesday Emily had her little tots over - twenty of them - they played games & were fed cookies & chocolate. It was such a rainy day & 
                     as ordinarily half of her youngsters stay out  such weather - she thought of postponing the party which
                    had been announced the day before - But do you know - every last one of them was at school - so the party came off as scheduled. The girls that stayed with Abbie are at
                    home as the father is away & the weather ill - so Abbie is here now - It's much pleasanter for her than having to be with them too!
                
                    Mr. Cresswell and about half a dozen men - here & in Sevierville have formed a company and are going  to build a dam & put 
                    up a factory for making furniture & coffins. - They have bought the machinery which we had intended using for the same purpose. Miss Langmaid gave up the scheme
                    as it seemed a pretty big undertaking & needed an experienced man at the head of it. This company is going into quite deeply & guess it will pay as the railroad
                    will be through soon. Evelyn is going to wait before putting in the Delco System of lighting as there will be enough power to furnish electricity to the whole
                     - (I mean  at the factory)  Work is to start this summer - 
                    Gatlinburg seems to have a future before it!
                
                     It's just time to call the family to arise so will cease my erratic pennings for now & high me hence - 
                
                     You see there is little news just now to write so fear my letters must seem quite a sameness - 
                
                     Oh yes - I wrote to the street car company in New Orleans in regard to lack of courtesy on the part of their  & got a reply
                    yesterday saying that was one of the things they tried to make the men understand & that they were surprised  - that my experience had been such - that they thanked
                    me for calling their attention to the matter & would increase their efforts!
                
                     Just lots & lots of love
                
                     Ruth.

                          Mabel's letter came Monday with a long one from Ruth Victoria  also has sent me another nice long letter & yours came. Feel real conscience stricken
                        about Vic - as I've not written her for months! 
        
        Page 03:  
        
        Didn't have her address part of the time
                        - and then forgot to take it with me to New Orleans & have just put it off from day to day - felt too that she probably read some of my letters home. But am really going
                            to write her. Have to get off my Pi Phi letter this week too.
                          Am glad you are getting along so well at home - you will miss Mabel & "her little ways" won't you? Shall send her a letter before she departs Friday
                        the 13th! If there is another in days - she has selected a good combination hasn't she?
                        
                        No my itinerary is not planned neither is anything else - shall just let things go along & see how they work out by the end of March - seven

        more weeks only. Everyone hopes that I see some of the East before starting home - that is several have so expressed themselves in
                        letters - and it does seem like a good opportunity even though my wardrobe is pitiful & my purse nigh empty! We will see!
