        Time for report cards -

         - Our snowstorm was so like winter but the last three days have been sunny & today was 
                    warm like spring exactly - a tree toad was singing away somewhere when I was dressing for supper tonight.  We surely have been fortunate in the burg - so far there has been little sickness except bad colds. Things have gone 
                    on as usual this week - drill & play take up lots of time - Went for a walk with Abbie up the road one evening - Tonight took a nap after school - & 
                    consequently have sat & written letters all evening.
                
                    Report cards should have been out today but I just couldn't get at them before & didn't feel like it tonight &  
                    tomorrow. Isn't that a thrilling state of affairs? Imagine going back to the iron clad rules of the regular school system after the fine & easy 
                    way of management here! I really enjoy looking at those cards here on the table & my register & then turning my back on them so careless like!
                Dearest family your letters came Monday and Tuesday respectively with a long one from Mabel - Nellie K. - Gail - and Mrs. Davis - 
                        also cards from Lida telling me that the baskets had arrived. That reminds me - in my reply to her I did not tell her that the package she had sent has 
                        not come - she wanted to know about it - Will you please tell her?I am glad you are all well and that things are going along as usual. I am very anxious to see you - and also wonder what you think 
                        about my staying here a

        nother year. Where is the money coming from for my going home & return if I do teach here next 
                            year? Katherine has been writing me again very enthusiastically about Oakland but I do not feel drawn toward it in spite of the large salary. It seems 
                            hard to find out & decide what is the best thing to do but I surely will know before long. Nellie Jane must be the cutest thing - am crazy to see all three 
                            of the youngsters - suppose the two scoots Weir & h. j. will have to get acquainted all over again with me. It doesn't seem as though it were 
                        time to garden yet - Our snowstorm was so like winter but the last three

        days have been sunny & today was 
                    warm like spring exactly - a tree toad was singing away somewhere when I was dressing for supper tonight. Am glad our Dodge 
                        is in trim again. Nellie K. says her is just fine & looks very gay in the new green license plates! Am sorry that John has been sick - Did the U. shut 
                        down because of the flu? We surely have been fortunate in the burg - so far there has been little sickness except bad colds. Things have gone 
                    on as usual this week - drill & play take up lots of time - Went for a walk with Abbie up the road one evening - Tonight took a nap after school - &

                Arthur is probably too busy & taken up with his own affairs to say very much of anything. As for my talking - after teaching all day 
                        my head is like an empty cistern! Am glad you liked the N. A. pictures. Thank
