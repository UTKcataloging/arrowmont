                     Dearest family - This is a dark & very rainy Friday afternoon - & I'm sitting by the window in the living room where I have a view of the muddy
                    road & drowned appearance everywhere outside. Aunt Lizzie is somewhere in the house while down below in the basement wood is being chopped - That
                    & the drip outside & the ticking of Aunt Lizzie's clock on the fireboard are the only sounds to be heard - Evelyn & Emily having gone for
                    a walk down the road!
                
                     Since my last epistle of Monday night nothing of particular note has happened.
                
                     Monday evening - My good intentions of Friday failed you see & yesterday spent most of the time calling & then decided that if I waited till tonight
                    I'd have your letter to comment on but  none came - except a very nice one from Lida - Only two or three 
                    times have I  failed to hear from home on Monday during the whole time of my stay - Suppose it was held up 
                    somewhere along the line - as occasionally will happen.
                
                     As I was commenting when I ceased Friday - there has seemed to be little to write - about the past two weeks - Emily said the same yesterday - no excitement in
                    particular - or perhaps after the  of New Orleans (or is it ) the mountains seem very quiet.
                
                     Well going back over the happenings of the past week - Tuesday after a late session at school. I went  for a walk with Stella & little Blanche Huff after a call there.
                    In the evening Tom came for help with Latin & history. He is a great boy and an exceedingly nice one - fine  sisters - all in our 
                    school but the youngest and she is coming.
                
                    Wednesday Emma Maples and I tramped over the muddy road - getting back about dark - Emma had supper with us - & eventually stayed all night - She is such
                    a dear girl - about eighteen. Told me that the Pi Phis had certainly done a lot for Gatlinburg & that the school just meant everything to her. She loves music so
                    Evelyn played & sang most of the evening - We all helped  more or less - I corrected two sets of history papers on the side meanwhile.
                
                    Thursday after school - help the various debaters with their subject of immigration - practice with the quartet - & finish showing them how to put together our
                    school magazine. Then coming home I started up Pi Phi lane branching off to the little house where Harrison lives & finding him doing up the dishes &
                    looking after the youngsters of which there are three. Two room cabin as usual - but such a nice big stone fireplace & grand fire - You find them in every house - 
                    no wonder they get in the habit of "settin'" Well I set awhile although the lady of the house was not home being on a visit at her
                     father's - I did not know she was gone however. He told me about capturing a still up in the Sugar Lands during
                    vacation - From here I journeyed on up  to Martha's & sat in the dusk over another big fire - She - her sister
                    and old mother live  in a two room cabin. She has three little girls - all in school - does our washing you know. Had an awfully good
                    time & stayed so long it was dark when I got home.
                
                     Friday after school I just didn't seem to have the energy to write or do much of anything & wound up by putting on a clean dress after a bath.
                
                     Dr. Massy blew in just as we had finished supper - and later Mr. Huff. They visited around the fire until about nine -  then Mr.
                     took the  home with him. They have a good many business dealings 
                    together - lumber - The  loves to talk and got started on the churches & ministers 
                    in the county. Too many of both altogether he says.
                
                     Saturday was a day of labor for us all as usual - & wound up washing my hair which always produces a cold spell and strong wind. The debate came off in the 
                    evening having been postponed from the night before because of the rain - Two of the girls & I were judges - not much of a crowd there as a "sing" was 
                    held  the Forks of the River. Mr. Cresswell - Stella & Amber Ogle (a new boy just started in the 
                    9th grade) were against immigration - Tom - Cora & Betty Russell for it - had helped the latter the most & really felt they did the best anyway - Mr
                     made some perfectly wild remarks - Anyway  I put my influence on Tom's side &
                    they got the decision. Sunday was the usual excitement of Sunday School - (I forgot to say that Evelyn went home with the  - back in the morning) a "burial" followed Sunday School for which Abbie &
                    I did not stay - Poor Emily had to as no one else was there who could play  It began to snow & was quite cold - just the
                    day for a brisk tramp - so put on my new  & sallied about three miles up Mill Creek to the 
                    Oakley family where I visited about an hour - such a nice family. We enjoyed it very much - (they & I) After dinner here I felt just like starting out again - so got Josie
                    Trentham at the hotel & we went up Roaring Fork branching off to a little creek. I wanted to see Maud Clabo one of my girls who hasn't come back yet - another
                    walk of about three miles - From here we went on to the Carr family's house about a quarter of a mile getting home just at dark in time for 
                     After that Aunt Lizzie & I visited over the fire as Emily went to bed early - Today - Cora McCarter &
                    I went up Little Dudley about 2  to see Mattie  one of my girls who hasn't come back since 
                     but expects to tomorrow. Just live to go around & visit this way & hope the weather stays clear this week so I can. Will 
                    not wait so long again - With loads of love to you all as ever
                
                     Ruth.
