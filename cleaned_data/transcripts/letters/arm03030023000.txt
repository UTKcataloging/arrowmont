                    As usual have been full of busy-ness since my last dashing scribble of Thanksgiving Day! We went to Huff's that night about dark in the light of Emily's big
                    flash arriving just before their dinner was served &  had to sit down & eat more chicken - potato - hot biscuits - jelly - coffee - etc.
                    Three of the men who work at their sawmill down the river were there - too. Mrs. Huff - Stella & Betty waited on the table. Estel & Jim had gone possum hunting 
                    having captured one the night before. We girls sat at the table while the feminine members ate & then went into the other room by the fireplace where I did some darning
                    in the light of the three lamps on the "fire board" - (can you guess what the  is or have I told you 
                    in another letter?)  Next morning we were awakened about six by Mrs. Huff's coming in to light a fire in the little heater so that we rose 
                    & dressed luxuriously . After breakfast Mr. Huff asked us if we wanted to go to Emmert's Cove and of course we did &
                    away we went in the Ford in short order - Blanche & Mattie with us. It's a drive of about an hour though I don't imagine it's more than six or 
                     miles at the most. A cove corresponds to a  as far as I can see - &
                    this one is more like a winding valley shut in by high mountains - There seemed to be no town just a house here & there until finally we came to a sawmill where we stopped 
                    for a half hour or more & while Mr. Huff talked business we girls watched some big oak log cut up into lumber. The largest was about 3 1/2 
                    in diameter &  such hard solid oak too! We got home about 10:30 & then I was busy the rest of the day - washing - shampooing my hair - 
                    catching up in my reading & eating my . You don't know how good it tasted! so much better than
                    all chocolates! I mended & darned all evening as nearly everything seemed to need a helping hand somewhere. Yesterday (Saturday) there was a very high wind so that 
                    we gave up our hike though Cora Ogle came over before we were up to see if we would go - We spent most of the day working at school - Fixing up our rooms & planning
                    work - also our Christmas programs - Cora went over with us & helped put up pictures writing papers, etc. You see every time the panels
                    go up everything has to come down that has been put on them. My writing papers had been up since Halloween so put up new ones in a different way.
                
                    Today was Sunday School - &  as usual - I spent the 
                    reading & tonight Mr.  was over & Emily & I went over our  plans with
                    him as he usually has to make something for such things! You'd never guess what I did after  School this 
                    Do you remember the little cards & bookmarks I used to make "when I was young" adorned with sprigs of holly? Well I got out my paints & made
                    three vanities to get the girls started making some tomorrow at their club meeting.
                
                    Dearest family - I picture you as a re-united group tonight having tea at some fireside together listening to pa's tales of the sunny south!

                    Today was Sunday School - & B.Y.P. as usual - I spent the p.m.
                    reading & tonight Mr. C. was over & Emily & I went over our Xmas plans with
                    him as he usually has to make something for such things! You'd never guess what I did after S. School this a.m.
                    Do you remember the little cards & bookmarks I used to make "when I was young" adorned with sprigs of holly? Well I got out my paints & made
                    three vanities to get the girls started making some tomorrow at their club meeting.
                
                     Have been wondering what to give the girls here - Emily Evelyn & Abbie - What do you think of handkerchiefs? Guess you'll have to get them &
                     send them to me. Evelyn likes Ned's song "Three Words" so well I wonder if I could get it for her? Three weeks from today we expect to reach
                     New Orleans (Emily & I) You all can send me some writing paper for a present as mine is about gone - like the thin foreign paper. It's so late must
                     cease & withdraw Had a grand long letter from Eliza Jane yesterday.
                     With loads of love to you all as ever
