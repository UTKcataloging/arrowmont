                    Dearest Jane -  It's been lovely these last three 
                    or four days - another cold frosty spell with lots of sunshine - Our milk has had chunks of ice in it every morning!
                
                    Miss Langmaid & Evelyn came back about 1:30 that afternoon quite pleased to return. After school we all went on a call about two miles away 
                    on Little Dudley Creek where a family of McCarters live (there are nearly as many of them as Ogles & Reagan's) Arlie the oldest boy 
                    whom I had in school a little while cut his hand badly as I think I told you in one my letters & is in the Knoxville General Hospital - There are six or 
                    seven boys in the family down to the baby and one little girl - None of them are in school as they should be - They help their mother about the place & 
                    two about twelve and nine work for Mr. Huff at his mill. We asked Mrs.  how old 
                    one of them was & she said she didn't know! We got home just in time of supper - Aunt Lizzie was quite impatient over it as we had kept 
                    her soup waiting. In the evening we sat around visiting & I darted off a letter to papa - Miss  & Evelyn 
                    went to Huffs on business.
                
                    Friday Evelyn came over after school & drilled the youngsters on some Thanksgiving songs - & I tried out some of my play as usual. 
                    Then later we made a little call on Squire Maples' family at the foot of the lane & then as Dr. Massey went by we rushed out & 
                    got in the buggy - all three of us & went about a mile down the road - as we were returning Mr. Huff overtook us in his Ford so we returned 
                    on four wheels to the burg even as we had left it.
                
                    The debate came off as soon as we could get over after supper &  quite heated it proved to be - we all 
                    enjoyed it very much. Saturday I was so busy sweeping & fussing around all day it seemed until just before dark when Emily & I 
                    went over to Huff's for dinner & the night - Had a very nice time - but was glad to return here this  
                    about 9 & just in time for Sunday School - After that we had a hasty  & then went  
                    via Lillard Mables' Ford about five miles up into the Sugar Lands to the home of the Pricketts who used to teach here you know. They live in a 
                    two room house which is rather small quarters for them & their two babies - Of course we had to have dinner with them so that it was all three & 
                    nearer four when we left - We walked most of the way home missing connections with Lillard who overtook us about a mile from the burg - Then it was 
                    a bowl of potato soup &  - However was spared the quartet this time Mr. Cresswell 
                    having a very bad cold - Well we all sat around the fire until about nine - then I did some studying & started up here to bed after first writing my 
                    dear Jane - Hope you won't mind this scrappy letter but just can't elaborate on things tonight - all this visiting is strenuous & rather 
                    tiresome at times It's hard to listen to one person talk so much!
                
                    We are all going to be up to our eyes with Thanksgiving festivities this week but will no doubt emerge in the end!
                
                    With more love than I can tell you - Ruth.
                
                    Dearest Jane - Wrote you a long letter Wed.eve. so as 
                        it's late anyway will not write very much tonight - Wonder what all you have been doing today! It's been lovely these last three 
                    or four days - another cold frosty spell with lots of sunshine - Our milk has had chunks of ice in it every morning!
