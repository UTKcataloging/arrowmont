                    Dearest family - It seems a long time since last Wednesday evening when I wrote you and yet only three days & part of another have passed. Gatlinburg
                    tonight as they say is wrapped in a blanket of snow. It was snowing when I woke up this  & has continued without
                    ceasing all day so that there are several inches over Mother Earth. None of us have gone forth except Aunt Lizzie to milk & Emily to tramp. She didn't
                    go far however as the ground underneath is not frozen & the mud consequently a little worse than usual being concealed by a fa
                    white covering & deceitful.
                
                    Things have gone along in the usual routine the last few days - It has been my week of assembly - we finished the "Merchant of Venice" for which I
                    gave the class of four the exam Friday - Estel Huff failed - but the others did  fairly well considering. We  our 
                    Japanese drill Friday after school & cleaned up things fairly well - neatness & order  not
                    taught here in these homes you know & one has to almost stand over the girls every so often to make them do the sweeping as they should.
                
                    We had the reading of the "Applachian News" the last half hour & the last looking over of speeches before the debate. The cover of the magazine
                    this time was made of course gray paper in the center of which was a large shield of red & white stripes with the blue field across the top - the printing
                    was in blue & the binding of red string - quite patriotic.
                
                    One contribution was by Elmer Oakley who told how he earned his first dollar - thusly: A man gave him eight dollars with instructions
                     to go after two gallons of corn whiskey about 3 1/2 miles away & permission to keep a dollar if he could get the 
                    moonshine for seven dollars - He wound up his story with the words "And it was so!" Other articles were - "If I had Aladdin's Lamp" - 
                    "A Dog's Opinion of a Cat" - "Why I go to School" - "A Poem" -(spring & flowers) "Adventure of a Penny"
                    "Amusement for a Rainy Day" - "My First Day in School - " Current Events - Jokes - Questions & Answers - continuation of the 
                     which is to be finished in the next number.
                
                    The debate regarding the League of Nations was very long - there were seven or eight on a side - The affirmative got the decision I'm glad to say - Tom
                    was first speaker on that side & had worked awfully hard. Some wild things were said - The general sentiment here is against it - After this long
                    argument were several recitations & then the reading of the magazine - each contributor reading his own part. So ended that day. I wrote Charlotte A.
                     yesterday urging her to come here for the closing of school & then visiting & seeing the sights of the
                     for a week afterwards or as long as she wished. I do not think or rather expect to be ready to leave the day school 
                    closes - would rather wind up things & my packing the next week instead of being so awfully rushed. I may change my mind but doubt it - anyway if Charlotte
                    would come I'd be willing to wait a few days for her so we could go on to Washington together. Have written Mrs. Helmich about a place to stay. Well - 
                    Mrs. Huff  came in just after we had gotten through with lunch so we sat around the fireplace & visited. Then she Evelyn &
                    Emily went for a walk - Abbie went upstairs for a nap & after reading a little I followed & had one till supper time. Haven't napped before for weeks
                    & weeks!! In the evening we sat around read & embroidered - I wrote letters -  - Aunt Lizzie has been embroidering a baby dress for a grandson - 
                    her first attempt at embroidering - She just loves to do it too & does remarkably well considering her age & poor eyesight - 
                
                    It has been so nice today not to have Sunday School or  - a real holiday! No one has
                    been here except two of the small boys from Maples at the foot of the lane to get some games - and Mr. Creswell who came over a little while but didn't
                    stay long - I have done a lot of school work today - corrected my English papers - looked over ancient history & read Ivanhoe, which is the next book
                    I'm going to take up -  with the high school class. I had absolutely forgotten it - and had to read it carefully. The
                    girls have read most of the day & went to bed about seven p.m. We played a game for awhile just before supper - very
                    instructive & interesting about insects birds & animals - questions given which you try to answer - 
                
                    P.S. no word from Blanche all week -

                    Beebe finally - Her letter was forwarded to me from home way last December. Her husband is a Captain &
                    she wrote me from Brest France where she had gone very unexpectedly with the little boy from Oregon - Was living in officer's quarters - a maid did all
                        the work - ate at mess - had a Cadillac sedan at their disposal 
        
        Page 06:  
        
        & expected to be sent to Belgium or Germany. She doesn't
                        know I'm here so wrote quite a lengthy epistle - also wrote Nellie & Katherine - Aunt Lizzie has been embroidering a baby dress for a grandson - 
                    her first attempt at embroidering - She just loves to do it too & does remarkably well considering her age & poor eyesight - 
                
                    It has been so nice today not to have Sunday School or B.Y. - a real holiday! No one has
                    been here except two of the small boys from Maples at the foot of the lane to get some games - and Mr. Creswell who came over a little while but didn't
                    stay long - I have done a lot of school work today - corrected my English papers - looked over ancient history & read Ivanhoe, which is the next book

         with the high school class. I had absolutely forgotten it - and had to read it carefully. The
                    girls have read most of the day & went to bed about seven p.m. We played a game for awhile just before supper - very
                    instructive & interesting about insects birds & animals - questions given which you try to answer - 
                
                        What do you think of my coming back here next year? Shall I plan to come home from Washington D.C. or borrow some money & go north to New York &
                        then home? Couldn't one of you or both come east & visit me in Gatlinburg? Am crazy to see you all - everyone of you - but as to Tacoma - somehow
                        don't seem to care much about seeing it yet nor going around & visiting everyone & talking about the school &
                        mts. & people as no doubt I'd do & have to do. Do not feel like asking the fraternity to pay my
                        expenses home & back & in fact do not think they would do it - nor 
                            can they afford it - Please write & tell me just what you think about things.
                        Must cease & think of bed as the hands of Aunt Lizzie's old clock on the fireboard are approaching ten. 
                        Don't imagine there will be many at school tomorrow - probably just enough to keep us there.
                        Hope the mail gets up allright Just oceans of love as ever
