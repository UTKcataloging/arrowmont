        THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 37 Workshops, 1971, are filled and we are turning down applications for lack of housing space. Financial support from clubs, chapters, and other Pi Phi members continues to strengthen our national philanthropy and to help us in our growth. Every Pi Phi who visits or attends school leaves with pride and determination to spread the word of our work and our needs. The former Emma Harper Turner building was leased to Community Tectonics as of December 1970. They restored the building and it is a beautiful addition to our Pi Beta Phi Compound. . . . Other additional income comes from renting the Red Barn every weekend when school is not in session to religious groups, college groups including Pi Phis from University of Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Memphis, South Carolina, craftsmen from Craftsman's Fair, Wild-flower Pilgrimage leaders, and on and on. We have permanent winter boarders, teachers from Pi Beta Phi Elementary School plus many paying guests at Staff House. Our honors have been numerous, Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, was named this year's Alumni Distinguished Service Professor at the President's Honors Banquet at University of Tennessee. Tennessee Art Commission awarded Pi Beta Phi a commendation for our work. They also have given us $2000 to hold a workshop for Craftsmen of State of Tennessee this next year. Arrowmont has been chosen for meeting place of National Council of Education for Ceramic Arts in March 1972 . . . 500 to 600 potters will attend. Persis Grayson, one of our teachers, has been made president of Handweavers Guild of America. (Note new wrap in Arrowcraft catalog called "The Gray-son" which she designed.) Harland Bartholomew and Associates has just submitted new comprehensive plan for City of Gatlinburg. In the let-ter of transmittal for the plan is the following statement: "The cultural center of the city should be Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. Continued construction of motels, shops and `attractions' may soon reach a point in which congestion and commercialism might begin to out-weigh the things that have made the town so attractive to visitors in the past. This tremendous economic pressure might be counterbalanced by a strong cultural force in the community." Many local groups use our facilities for meetings and are interested and enthused about our program. Bus tours bring visitors to Arrowcraft and now some are asking to see Arrowmont. This year the representatives of Junior Colleges of Southeast were in Gatlinburg for convention and asked to tour and hear about our work. We are always proud to extend exposure to the work of philanthropy of Pi Beta Phi. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as part of corporation of Pi Beta Phi is proud to give members continuing and lifetime objectives for support of their philanthropy. The dedication of Board of Governors has been due to vision each has. It has been a cohesive group. We salute them, as well as members of staff here at school at the closing this year. The combined support of Board, staff and members of Pi Beta Phi has kept inspiration high. We are looking for-ward to the coming year which promises to be another year of growth and contribution to society.

Standing ~o~n~vc~ttee~ CANADIAN PHILANTHROPIES COMMITTEE As the great Northland of Canada is developing, so are the library facilities. There are now seventeen member libraries servicing almost all of the vast North West Territories. With our $1000.00 donation in the summer of 1970, the eight branch libraries of the Yukon profited by an excellent collection of books on Canadiana, while the N.W.T. further expanded their stock of Northern Canadian items. There has been much interest and enthusiasm engendered from Canadian chapters and clubs over the possibility of providing audio-visual aids with future donations. This would require greater financial support from all, as the equipment for media services is very expensive. Let us aim high with our "Arrow in the Arctic" Project. The Schools of Social Work foresee an ever-greater need in the future for the kind of financing the Pi Beta Phi loans provide, namely short-term, interest-free, and quickly negotiated loans. The support of all Pi Phi clubs, chapters, and individuals is asked for, and the committee wishes to thank all those whO have contributed so generously. PAT FOSTER WEIR THE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Twenty-five years ago, at the Swampscott Convention which followed World War II, Pi Beta Phi created the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds by assigning $50,000 for the principal of the funds, taking that amount from the General Fund. They were to be available to chapters for loans for chapter house building purposes and the interest, paid by the chapters, was to be used to assist Pi Phi alumnae in times of crisis or continuing hardship. The Fraternity has fulfilled these assigned objects faithfully and has brought comfort and aid to many alumnae, young and old. One cannot estimate the blessing this has been. In the current biennium the committee has processed seven new gifts and continued aid to six others, previously authorized. Of the seven new gifts, four are granted to young alumnae who have the responsibility of young or teenage children and three of these have heavy medical bills to pay, following tragic illnesses. We were saddened to be called upon in a first drug addiction case and are supplying a small monthly check so that this Pi Phi adult may have change for snacks and personal needs, in a state institution where she is receiving rehabilitation treatment. Two, on this list, are older Pi Phis whose grave physical condition has made Pi Beta Phi's checks a blessing. Pi Beta Phi is continuing to assist three Golden Arrow Pi Phis, two by monthly checks and the third, who was initiated seventy years ago, as those who keep in touch with her see the need. A fourth one missed the Golden Arrow status by five years, at the time when she met a tragic death. She had been assisted by monthly checks throughout the biennium. Only one younger member receives continuing monthly checks as she works and strives alone to hold together a large family. The sixth of these is one of Pi Phi's finest and most loyal members who, through no fault of her own, has reached retirement years with inadequate income and has been receiving monthly checks throughout the biennium. It is important that you understand that when you sense a need which we can fulfill, you should contact the commit-tee to find out whether aid is possible. This is the special service which the individual can render in this particular project of Pi Beta Phi. Remember, too, that this Pi Phigiving is limited to aid to our alumnae in the way that many scholarships assist our actives. No monthly check which we can offer is adequate for living expenses and no single check, in emergency situations, covers the emergency. The funds of this committee can provide only a lifting of the burden. But, in an hour of need, Pi Beta Phi is there with a comforting and helpful gift which says, "We care because you are enduring so much." It seems important, also, to recognize always that this service of Pi Beta Phi to her alumnae is a sweet and intimate one, beyond the somewhat impersonal one which public welfare seems to be, and, that it is designed to support the dignity of the receiver and to build morale within the circle of lives touched by each gift. It is never charity. It is the act of love which is a part of Pi Beta Phi's traditional relationship and idealism. This ends the period of service of the present chairman, the third in the history of the committee. A notebook is being prepared which will contain a confidential record of every recipient found in the file and which will offer items of historical interest, of policy, and of procedure. It has been a joy to work in this compassionate endeavor of Pi Beta Phi and the privilege will be one of my happiest memories. I would pay tribute to Lillian Farrington Mc-Naught, who was a wonderful coach when I began nine years ago; to Lillian Beck Holton, Nenabelle Green Dame, and Ruth Williams Hansen who have been wonderful teammates; and to each member of the Grand Council, in its changing pattern over these years, for her prompt and deeply interested response to every question and request. Tribute is due, also, to the many fine Pi Phis who have given time and earnest attention, as sponsors of those who have been assisted. It has been a privilege to work with them. The impact all the way through is very rewarding and evidence of the worth of this project. I am sure that we all feel what one of the current recipients expressed when she wrote, "I knew the words `whole life through' but they never had the meaning they have now." LUCILE DOUGLASS CARSON, Chairman NENABELLE GREEN DAME RUTH WILLIAMS HANSEN DIRECTOR Of EXTENSION Prime considerations in our present extension policy should be caliber of the school, caliber of the students, attitude of the administration toward fraternities, number of interested alumnae in the area and housing requirements. During the current year 28 inquiries have been received by the Director of Extension. There were 18 local groups, 4 from alumnae, 2 from Dean of Women and 4 from Stu--dent Coordinators and Panhellenic Advisors. The followingare the extension requests received in the past year: Quinnipiac College, Hamden, Connecticut Wisconsin State University, Eau Claire, Wisconsin LaGrange College, La Grange, Georgia Madison College, Harrisonburg, Virginia University of Hawaii, Honolulu University of West Florida, Pensacola, Florida Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 41

Standing ~o~n~vc~ttee~ CANADIAN PHILANTHROPIES COMMITTEE As the great Northland of Canada is developing, so are the library facilities. There are now seventeen member libraries servicing almost all of the vast North West Territories. With our $1000.00 donation in the summer of 1970, the eight branch libraries of the Yukon profited by an excellent collection of books on Canadiana, while the N.W.T. further expanded their stock of Northern Canadian items. There has been much interest and enthusiasm engendered from Canadian chapters and clubs over the possibility of providing audio-visual aids with future donations. This would require greater financial support from all, as the equipment for media services is very expensive. Let us aim high with our "Arrow in the Arctic" Project. The Schools of Social Work foresee an ever-greater need in the future for the kind of financing the Pi Beta Phi loans provide, namely short-term, interest-free, and quickly negotiated loans. The support of all Pi Phi clubs, chapters, and individuals is asked for, and the committee wishes to thank all those whO have contributed so generously. PAT FOSTER WEIR THE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Twenty-five years ago, at the Swampscott Convention which followed World War II, Pi Beta Phi created the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds by assigning $50,000 for the principal of the funds, taking that amount from the General Fund. They were to be available to chapters for loans for chapter house building purposes and the interest, paid by the chapters, was to be used to assist Pi Phi alumnae in times of crisis or continuing hardship. The Fraternity has fulfilled these assigned objects faithfully and has brought comfort and aid to many alumnae, young and old. One cannot estimate the blessing this has been. In the current biennium the committee has processed seven new gifts and continued aid to six others, previously authorized. Of the seven new gifts, four are granted to young alumnae who have the responsibility of young or teenage children and three of these have heavy medical bills to pay, following tragic illnesses. We were saddened to be called upon in a first drug addiction case and are supplying a small monthly check so that this Pi Phi adult may have change for snacks and personal needs, in a state institution where she is receiving rehabilitation treatment. Two, on this list, are older Pi Phis whose grave physical condition has made Pi Beta Phi's checks a blessing. Pi Beta Phi is continuing to assist three Golden Arrow Pi Phis, two by monthly checks and the third, who was initiated seventy years ago, as those who keep in touch with her see the need. A fourth one missed the Golden Arrow status by five years, at the time when she met a tragic death. She had been assisted by monthly checks throughout the biennium. Only one younger member receives continuing monthly checks as she works and strives alone to hold together a large family. The sixth of these is one of Pi Phi's finest and most loyal members who, through no fault of her own, has reached retirement years with inadequate income and has been receiving monthly checks throughout the biennium. It is important that you understand that when you sense a need which we can fulfill, you should contact the commit-tee to find out whether aid is possible. This is the special service which the individual can render in this particular project of Pi Beta Phi. Remember, too, that this Pi Phigiving is limited to aid to our alumnae in the way that many scholarships assist our actives. No monthly check which we can offer is adequate for living expenses and no single check, in emergency situations, covers the emergency. The funds of this committee can provide only a lifting of the burden. But, in an hour of need, Pi Beta Phi is there with a comforting and helpful gift which says, "We care because you are enduring so much." It seems important, also, to recognize always that this service of Pi Beta Phi to her alumnae is a sweet and intimate one, beyond the somewhat impersonal one which public welfare seems to be, and, that it is designed to support the dignity of the receiver and to build morale within the circle of lives touched by each gift. It is never charity. It is the act of love which is a part of Pi Beta Phi's traditional relationship and idealism. This ends the period of service of the present chairman, the third in the history of the committee. A notebook is being prepared which will contain a confidential record of every recipient found in the file and which will offer items of historical interest, of policy, and of procedure. It has been a joy to work in this compassionate endeavor of Pi Beta Phi and the privilege will be one of my happiest memories. I would pay tribute to Lillian Farrington Mc-Naught, who was a wonderful coach when I began nine years ago; to Lillian Beck Holton, Nenabelle Green Dame, and Ruth Williams Hansen who have been wonderful teammates; and to each member of the Grand Council, in its changing pattern over these years, for her prompt and deeply interested response to every question and request. Tribute is due, also, to the many fine Pi Phis who have given time and earnest attention, as sponsors of those who have been assisted. It has been a privilege to work with them. The impact all the way through is very rewarding and evidence of the worth of this project. I am sure that we all feel what one of the current recipients expressed when she wrote, "I knew the words `whole life through' but they never had the meaning they have now." LUCILE DOUGLASS CARSON, Chairman NENABELLE GREEN DAME RUTH WILLIAMS HANSEN DIRECTOR Of EXTENSION Prime considerations in our present extension policy should be caliber of the school, caliber of the students, attitude of the administration toward fraternities, number of interested alumnae in the area and housing requirements. During the current year 28 inquiries have been received by the Director of Extension. There were 18 local groups, 4 from alumnae, 2 from Dean of Women and 4 from Stu--dent Coordinators and Panhellenic Advisors. The followingare the extension requests received in the past year: Quinnipiac College, Hamden, Connecticut Wisconsin State University, Eau Claire, Wisconsin LaGrange College, La Grange, Georgia Madison College, Harrisonburg, Virginia University of Hawaii, Honolulu University of West Florida, Pensacola, Florida Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 41

Financial support from clubs, chapters, and other Pi Phi members continues to strengthen our national philanthropy and to help us in our growth. Every Pi Phi who visits or attends school leaves with pride and determination to spread the word of our work and our needs. The former Emma Harper Turner building was leased to Community Tectonics as of December 1970. They restored the building and it is a beautiful addition to our Pi Beta Phi Compound. . . . Other additional income comes from renting the Red Barn every weekend when school is not in session to religious groups, college groups including Pi Phis from University of Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Memphis, South Carolina, craftsmen from Craftsman's Fair, Wild-flower Pilgrimage leaders, and on and on. We have permanent winter boarders, teachers from Pi Beta Phi Elementary School plus many paying guests at Staff House. Our honors have been numerous, Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, was named this year's Alumni Distinguished Service Professor at the President's Honors Banquet at University of Tennessee. Tennessee Art Commission awarded Pi Beta Phi a commendation for our work. They also have given us $2000 to hold a workshop for Craftsmen of State of Tennessee this next year. Arrowmont has been chosen for meeting place of National Council of Education for Ceramic Arts in March 1972 . . . 500 to 600 potters will attend. Persis Grayson, one of our teachers, has been made president of Handweavers Guild of America. (Note new wrap in Arrowcraft catalog called "The Gray-son" which she designed.) Harland Bartholomew and Associates has just submitted new comprehensive plan for City of Gatlinburg. In the let-ter of transmittal for the plan is the following statement: "The cultural center of the city should be Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. Continued construction of motels, shops and `attractions' may soon reach a point in which congestion and commercialism might begin to out-weigh the things that have made the town so attractive to visitors in the past. This tremendous economic pressure might be counterbalanced by a strong cultural force in the community." Many local groups use our facilities for meetings and are interested and enthused about our program. Bus tours bring visitors to Arrowcraft and now some are asking to see Arrowmont. This year the representatives of Junior Colleges of Southeast were in Gatlinburg for convention and asked to tour and hear about our work. We are always proud to extend exposure to the work of philanthropy of Pi Beta Phi. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as part of corporation of Pi Beta Phi is proud to give members continuing and lifetime objectives for support of their philanthropy. The dedication of Board of Governors has been due to vision each has. It has been a cohesive group. We salute them, as well as members of staff here at school at the closing this year. The combined support of Board, staff and members of Pi Beta Phi has kept inspiration high. We are looking for-ward to the coming year which promises to be another year of growth and contribution to society.

Standing ~o~n~vc~ttee~ CANADIAN PHILANTHROPIES COMMITTEE As the great Northland of Canada is developing, so are the library facilities. There are now seventeen member libraries servicing almost all of the vast North West Territories. With our $1000.00 donation in the summer of 1970, the eight branch libraries of the Yukon profited by an excellent collection of books on Canadiana, while the N.W.T. further expanded their stock of Northern Canadian items. There has been much interest and enthusiasm engendered from Canadian chapters and clubs over the possibility of providing audio-visual aids with future donations. This would require greater financial support from all, as the equipment for media services is very expensive. Let us aim high with our "Arrow in the Arctic" Project. The Schools of Social Work foresee an ever-greater need in the future for the kind of financing the Pi Beta Phi loans provide, namely short-term, interest-free, and quickly negotiated loans. The support of all Pi Phi clubs, chapters, and individuals is asked for, and the committee wishes to thank all those whO have contributed so generously. PAT FOSTER WEIR THE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Twenty-five years ago, at the Swampscott Convention which followed World War II, Pi Beta Phi created the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds by assigning $50,000 for the principal of the funds, taking that amount from the General Fund. They were to be available to chapters for loans for chapter house building purposes and the interest, paid by the chapters, was to be used to assist Pi Phi alumnae in times of crisis or continuing hardship. The Fraternity has fulfilled these assigned objects faithfully and has brought comfort and aid to many alumnae, young and old. One cannot estimate the blessing this has been. In the current biennium the committee has processed seven new gifts and continued aid to six others, previously authorized. Of the seven new gifts, four are granted to young alumnae who have the responsibility of young or teenage children and three of these have heavy medical bills to pay, following tragic illnesses. We were saddened to be called upon in a first drug addiction case and are supplying a small monthly check so that this Pi Phi adult may have change for snacks and personal needs, in a state institution where she is receiving rehabilitation treatment. Two, on this list, are older Pi Phis whose grave physical condition has made Pi Beta Phi's checks a blessing. Pi Beta Phi is continuing to assist three Golden Arrow Pi Phis, two by monthly checks and the third, who was initiated seventy years ago, as those who keep in touch with her see the need. A fourth one missed the Golden Arrow status by five years, at the time when she met a tragic death. She had been assisted by monthly checks throughout the biennium. Only one younger member receives continuing monthly checks as she works and strives alone to hold together a large family. The sixth of these is one of Pi Phi's finest and most loyal members who, through no fault of her own, has reached retirement years with inadequate income and has been receiving monthly checks throughout the biennium. It is important that you understand that when you sense a need which we can fulfill, you should contact the commit-tee to find out whether aid is possible. This is the special service which the individual can render in this particular project of Pi Beta Phi. Remember, too, that this Pi Phigiving is limited to aid to our alumnae in the way that many scholarships assist our actives. No monthly check which we can offer is adequate for living expenses and no single check, in emergency situations, covers the emergency. The funds of this committee can provide only a lifting of the burden. But, in an hour of need, Pi Beta Phi is there with a comforting and helpful gift which says, "We care because you are enduring so much." It seems important, also, to recognize always that this service of Pi Beta Phi to her alumnae is a sweet and intimate one, beyond the somewhat impersonal one which public welfare seems to be, and, that it is designed to support the dignity of the receiver and to build morale within the circle of lives touched by each gift. It is never charity. It is the act of love which is a part of Pi Beta Phi's traditional relationship and idealism. This ends the period of service of the present chairman, the third in the history of the committee. A notebook is being prepared which will contain a confidential record of every recipient found in the file and which will offer items of historical interest, of policy, and of procedure. It has been a joy to work in this compassionate endeavor of Pi Beta Phi and the privilege will be one of my happiest memories. I would pay tribute to Lillian Farrington Mc-Naught, who was a wonderful coach when I began nine years ago; to Lillian Beck Holton, Nenabelle Green Dame, and Ruth Williams Hansen who have been wonderful teammates; and to each member of the Grand Council, in its changing pattern over these years, for her prompt and deeply interested response to every question and request. Tribute is due, also, to the many fine Pi Phis who have given time and earnest attention, as sponsors of those who have been assisted. It has been a privilege to work with them. The impact all the way through is very rewarding and evidence of the worth of this project. I am sure that we all feel what one of the current recipients expressed when she wrote, "I knew the words `whole life through' but they never had the meaning they have now." LUCILE DOUGLASS CARSON, Chairman NENABELLE GREEN DAME RUTH WILLIAMS HANSEN DIRECTOR Of EXTENSION Prime considerations in our present extension policy should be caliber of the school, caliber of the students, attitude of the administration toward fraternities, number of interested alumnae in the area and housing requirements. During the current year 28 inquiries have been received by the Director of Extension. There were 18 local groups, 4 from alumnae, 2 from Dean of Women and 4 from Stu--dent Coordinators and Panhellenic Advisors. The followingare the extension requests received in the past year: Quinnipiac College, Hamden, Connecticut Wisconsin State University, Eau Claire, Wisconsin LaGrange College, La Grange, Georgia Madison College, Harrisonburg, Virginia University of Hawaii, Honolulu University of West Florida, Pensacola, Florida Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 41
