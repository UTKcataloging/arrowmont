A Gold-en Arrow Pi Phi, through the years she has set an example of living according to her initiation vows. "Her loyalty and devotion to the Fraternity's ideals has been apparent in every respect. Small or large, every call of Pi Phi service has been answered by her and carried beyond the call of duty. Her five years on the Settlement School 'Committee; her six years as Grand Treasurer; her four years as Counselor for Chapter House Corporation and her twenty years on the Board of Trustee Funds have been of immeasurable benefit to Pi Beta Phi. "It can truly be said of her that every Pi Phi has her sympathy; that all times she has given any aid within her power; and that she has used her influence to make our Fraternity a potent factor in the society of educated women. "Today all of us, her three Pi Phi daughters, her Pi Phi granddaughters, her close friends from Colorado, those of ,us who have served with her, and all members of this Convention share the happiness of this fitting tribute to a great lady of Pi Beta Phi. "Thus it is with great pride that we dedicate the Ceramic Wing of this Craft 'Center in the name of Lolita Snell Prouty."

Mrs. Prouty Responds Mrs. Prouty spoke briefly in response to the tributes paid to her and said in part, "My heart is filled with emotion as I stand here among so many Pi Phis on ground hallowed over the years by those dedicated to the principles of the Fraternity and working toward the fulfillment of the dreams they had for this great memorial to our Founders .. . "I am especially humble to think my name on a building will be among those illustrious Pi Phis who have given so much greater service to the Fraternity . . . it is only in my deep love for the Fraternity and my devotion to the Settlement School that I can deserve in any way the honor this occasion brings to me . "So, again I thank my loving daughters and all those helping them achieve their wishes to honor me . . . and with deep humility of spirit and great love in my heart, I hope this building will help in the training of craftsmen and fulfill its purposes in furthering the plans for a wonderful Arts and Crafts Center as our Pi Beta Phi Centennial Project honoring the memory of our Founders." Settlement School Chairman Settlement School Chairman Dorothy Coleman Thorman had opened the dedication program with an expression of appreciation to "the devoted service of so many Pi Beta Phi members," and words of appreciation to "all Pi Beta Phi chapters and clubs who have supported this memorial to our Founders." Mrs. Thorman singled out two capable and dedicated individuals for their contributions in the development of the Craft Center, Dr. Marian Heard, Professor of Craft Design at the University of Tennessee and long time Director of the Craft Work-shop and Marian Mueller, Settlement School Director. She noted that "Pi Beta Phi is indebted to Dr. Heard for giving us the best designed ceramic workshop in the nation today" and called attention to Mrs. Mueller's capable supervision "of all operations involved in its completion." As golden rays of late afternoon sunlight slanted across the majestic Great Smoky Mountains, the ceremony at the Ceramic Wing was closed with a benediction by Helen Moffeet Russell, Centennial Committees Coordinator, that concluded with those moving words from the psalmist, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help, my help cometh from the Lord, which made Heaven and earth." 27 The Craft Center-the Lolita Snell Prouty Ceramic Wing is at the right.
