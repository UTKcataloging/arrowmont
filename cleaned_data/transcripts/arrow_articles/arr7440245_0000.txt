        244 ~ecv~ FROM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by Louise Wheelock Nobler, Washington B It is timely that the spotlight should be turned on the work of the Pi Beta Phi Health Center in Gatlinburg, Tennessee where Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers has served as our Pi Phi registered nurse for twenty-one years. In the following article Marjorie looks at the past, present and future of the health program at the Settlement School. "What a blessing are these black top country roads. Don't talk to me about the good old days. How did we ever get places up to Big Ridge, for instance. We straddled the foot-deep ruts, inched across the corner of Pink's bean patch, crept down a shale hill between the creek and a stake-and-rider fence, and climbed the steep slope to the ridge. And the looks of that rural school! Cracks between the wide boards of the floor gave a view of bare ground four feet below. Long, pew-like benches were all adult size. There were no desks, and but one table on which to learn to write. Dark walls were almost the color of the piece of blackboard. A pail held water from a spring at the bottom of the hill. How the children loved a change in routine, whether it was the teacher's fiddle-tunes on special days or the nurse's inspections ! Getting to the school was bad enough. But, oh, the coming back. The steep grades and the sharp turns where one took the road on faith. The road, itself sometimes on the creek bank, sometimes far above it on a ledge, sometimes in the creek bed for fifty or a hundred feet, bouncing over rocks and scratching through close-growing bushes. And the log "corduroy" road that was the cut-off to Boogertown! It's a blessing so many of those rude little schools are closed now and the students brought to consolidated buildings. But we still have some. And we still have many problems of the under-privileged. Driving rapidly along this good road, I count my blessings. We have doctors to care for our people ; town officials in sympathy with our health program, the friendly co-operation of the Department of Public Health, and the County Medical Association, and school authorities and teachers in full accord with what we try to do. We have the blessing of a civic water and sewer system, recently installed and unpaid for, but at least in operation. And we have the great blessing of friends from near and far to give so many things we need. Yesterday, for example, there were blue jeans and two knit shirts for Wade. His sister gives him homeand food, but there's little left for clothes. Thanks to a gift, there was money for stout shoes and sox. Wade never asks for himself just for something for "Mary's young-uns." And the first thing this morning, there was Edna, who looks like the child in the "Broken Pitcher." A second grader, she had burned herself "makin' th' bread for breakfast." She had only shabby panties under the thin dress and only a jacket over. There were some lined levis on the shelf, and a woolly shirt for her. And we went to Ogle's store and bought sox and shoes to replace the torn canvas slip pers. What a blessing to us are our generous friends! No time, now, to think of anything but getting up the narrow, rutted road to the ledge where stands Glades School. Before the top is reached, the door bursts open and several children rush out to carry ATTENTION! All Pi Phis When you visit Settlement School this summer, be sure to reserve one evening to see "Chucky jack," the story of Tennessee, written by Kermit Hunter and produced by the Great Smoky Mountain Historical Association, Incorporated. The saga of John Sevier, known as the "father of Tennessee," is enacted nightly, except Sunday, from the third week of June until Labor Day, in Hunter Hills Theatre one of the finest of popular outdoor drama settings in the green hills on the outskirts of Gatlinburg. Mr. Hunter, author of the University Theatre section ,of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and a professor at Hollins College, has joined his talents with those of Mr. Jack Frederick Kilpatrick, whose field is music, to produce a highly entertaining and informative production. Knowing that Mr. Kilpatrick is professor of composition at Southern Methodist University, a music critic for a Dallas newspaper, author of more than 125 separate works whose music has been performed by more than fifty of the world's great symphony orchestras is enough to assure one of an evening's neverto-be-forgotten pleasure. Add to that the beauty of the natural setting, the colorful costumes and the fascinating dances, and the play be-comes a MUST! J 245 246 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI equipment. Last week there was only the audiometer to test hearing. This week, there is the projector and the screen, the box of films and the long curtains to darken the windows. We have electricity in this school now, and there is no need to borrow the heavy car battery from the garage to show the pictures. This is another of our many blessings. Today the lesson is on cleanliness and personal care. We call it looking pretty. After the study films and the fairy story, there is a surprise more blessings from Pi Phi friends. A table is cleared and on it are arranged tooth paste, and brushes, combs and soap. The children are invited to choose a gift, and Mrs. Ogle and I watch the agony of indecision, and the happy faces of the youngsters as they go back to their seats. A gift of tooth paste, you say? If you only knew how little some of them have. If you could see the rural school where they are expected to get education and inspiration for living. The dirty, once-white building stands on a small patch of bare leveled ground with a cemetery just beyond. There is a rickety pole with a torn basket for basket-ball when they have a ball. A pump which spews water from holes in a pipe set over a cement trough, is their sanitary drinking fountain. But that's better than a pail of spring water. There's no knob just a rope end to pull the door open and shut. Gaping holes mark the window openings in the little hall. Inside, the partition that divided the room has been ripped out, leaving rough 4 by 4 uprights. Two tall, rather rusty stoves stand on opposite sides of the room with stove pipes hung on loops of wire. Beauty is represented by a calendar, a poster or two and some crayon drawings. It is no wonder the children love the picture shows and gifts of combs and soap. No wonder they welcome even the "Inoculation Parties" as a brightness to the days, and say good-bye with a shy wave or a quick hug. The Health Center has a very definite place in the lives of the people. Its services, day after day, are important in the community. It is an integral part of the state and county health programs. It is a focal point of Civil Defense for the area and is designated as the Command Post by the state. The work has changed some since the not-so-good old days. But the children and grandchildren of our first patients come back to us from distant places, for it is part of home coming. Truly, the Health Center is as important as ever. And that's a blessing."JUE!N STUDY TOUR --- PI BETA PHI and the Related Art and Craft Department of the College of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee are sponsoring the second Foreign Craft Study Tour July 14-August 29, 1958.
