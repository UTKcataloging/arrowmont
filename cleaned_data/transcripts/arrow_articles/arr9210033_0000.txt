The new high-rise Sheridan Hotel perched atop one of the high hills surrounding Gatlinburg seems to flaunt an urban-like sophistication over our busy little town and sets forth another new era for it. Pi Beta Phi, however, continues to retain its place of prominence in both civic and cultural affairs of Gatlinburg and enjoys the respect of the community. The Gatlinburg Rotary Club again gave a scholarship to Arrowmont for the summer of 1975. Our facilities have been used by local groups and during the spring of 1975 a ten week Community Workshop was held for local citizens. An autograph session was held at the Arrowcraft Shop for Majorie 'Chalmer's book "Better I Stay." It can be ordered through Arrowcraft. The 1974 Summer Session at Arrowmont was again successful with 1043 students from 40 states and two foreign countries. The use of the refurbished Watson Cottage as housing for assistants proved successful and the new commercial dishwasher proved a great asset. Mr. Paul Rossiteur again operated the bookstore donating the profits to Arrowmont. Housing continues to be inadequate requiring some off-campus housing. Four specialized workshops were held during the year. The rental of the Red Barn by many groups continues to be a good source of income. The summer session of 1975 represents the 30th consecutive one under the direction of Miss Marian Heard. She will retire within the next few years and a search committee has been established to seek her successor. With her excellent guidance the right person will be found. Caroline Riddle, Administrator, continues to serve in her efficient and innovative manner as reflected in her report in this ARROW issue. The annual Board of Governors meeting was held at Gatlinburg, October 3-6, 1974. As of the 1974 meeting full expenses for members of the Board will be paid by the Fraternity. Deep gratitude is hereby expressed to all who in the past paid their own expenses to attend meetings to help achieve the present success of Arrowmont and Arrow-craft. Arrowmont and Arrowcraft Awards were again given to clubs contributing the largest financial donation according to size category. The May L. Keller Award was given to the chapter presenting the best year round program regarding Arrowmont. Arrowmont -student lists by provinces will again be sent to APPs for use for clubs' programs. Their use is urged. A new Arrowmont slides series was made during the year and will be available from the APPs for the new club year 1975-76. A set of slides depicting the Arrowcraft operation is planned. The Betty Crocker coupon project had great response. The Chairman thanks everyone who sent coupons. The In Memoriam acknowledgements have been redesigned incorporating a sketch of Arrowmont done by a local artist. Sending a memorial gift to Arrowmont is a very thoughtful way in which to honor the memory of a deceased Pi Phi or her loved one. The International Ceramics Symposium will be held atArrowmont during September. This group represents out-standing potters from many foreign countries and it is a great honor for Arrowmont to host them. The members of the Little Pigeon Club, along with Arrowcraft employees of over ten years, were entertained for luncheon by the Board during their three day meeting. Following the luncheon the Watson House was dedicated. This little cottage housed the Watson family, two generations of Settlement School employees, for many years. It also housed the health center. The story of Settlement School, Arrowmont, and Arrow-craft has been beautifully printed in three parts and is now exhibited in the three glass enclosed cases on the sidewalk mall in front of our property on the Parkway. Many passers by stop and learn of Pi Phi's work in Gatlinburg. Arrowcraft employees continue to serve with great devotion. Arrowcraft has enjoyed a good year financially. The financial report of both Arrowmont and Arrowcraft are included in this issue of The ARROW. Additional space is desperately needed for both Arrowcraft shipping and storage departments. This will necessitate an enlargement for the present structure and is one of the goals of this Board. Potters wheels and looms were purchased during the year to abolish the need of borrowing them each summer from the University of Tennessee at considerable cost for transportation, plus the inconvenience. Additional ones as still needed. Plans for the Edythe Brack Photographic Studio, estal lished through the very generous gift of the Dallas Clu in 1974, are being prepared by Dr. Lauer of the Universii of Tennessee. Because of necessary structural changes, ac ditional funds were found to be needed and have been sul plied by the St. Louis Club with their most gracious gi of $9,190. When completed, it will be a great asset fc Arrowmont. In connection with the U.S. Bicentennial, an historic room is to be created in which will be exhibited Settlemei School memorabilia. It will be dedicated in the spring u 1976. Contact Caroline Riddle if you have anything of historical value to donate. Plans for the Arrowmont program for the 1975 Convention included an afternoon of craft demonstration by past Arrowmont students. A talk about Arrowmont was given by Sarah Ruth (Sis) Mullis, a member of the Board of Governors, with additional talks and comments by some of the participating craftspeople. The theme was "The Art of the Craftsman is the Bond between the Peoples of the World." One bond between Pi Phis is expressed in their support of both Arrowmont and Arrowcraft. Through the increased knowledge of each, the desire to strengthen that bond be-comes ever more greatly reflected in great pride in their philanthropies at Gatlinburg. The Chairman wishes to express her gratitude to the members of the Board of Governors, Grand Council, Central Office, and the Staff, of Arrowmont and Arrowcraft for their assistance and cooperation during the past year. HELEN DEPPE VOLLMAR ADMINISTRATOR OF ARROWMONT AND ARROWCRAFT Another busy summer is almost upon us. It seems most helps to make this report. If at any time there are con-fitting to take stock of progress over the past year. Since structive ideas or questions related to the Settlement School evaluating and reporting are aspects of management, it and its operation, I should be happy to hear of them. 33 iNoKaOi v To Win krrowcraft ys at Convention in Miami and Arrowcraft and Arrowmont in m on a Pi Phi high. While on vel, I'd like to share the Hawaii :oming from nothing to every-years of hard work and belief [ropy. I have a story I read to ,t]. Millions of Cats in which a cat and because there are s, thousands of cats, millions of lot choose and so they take e each is prettier than the next. eel about Pi Phi purses. If you ou can sell Arrowcraft. the basic and true premise that uality, you need not apologize nd that its durability and hand-.e something you can sell with that your belief that Arrow-riot philanthropy and that you igh to support it. Now you're nd sell millions of cats. aft chairperson must believe in ae must be willing to carry a all times, preferably using all senior tote for work, a junior a shoulder bag for sports aini for evening. Use no other use Pi Phi coasters, hot pads, in her home and believe that asion gift is Arrowcraft. g possible to order economically someone is ordering for a gift cess, offer to mail direct from i the customer paying the post-bill comes, charge your price of ostage, and you've made a sale own price list. Type and make e of your own prices with your none number at the top. Raise he traffic will allow. We're here , not to give away Arrowcraft. Lrket and price accordingly. If it stores sell good pot holders Gerry Senner, Honolulu A.C. displays her club's well-earned award for being first in the nation for Arrow-craft gross sales, 1974-75. for $1, charge $1 for Pi Phi potholders. Ours are just as good, if not better. Keep a box of samples in your car, and if anyone asks, "what's in the box ?," show them. Having an item on hand means a quick sale. At least be able to show all four sizes of the purses and some representative colors. When you get checks from customers, write down the ae dress from the check to start a mailing list. Satisfied customers will brag to their friends. When you have a sale, display your items imaginatively. Set your dining table with mats, napkins, napkin rings, coasters, and hot pads. Use your own china and sterling to create a smashing impression. Be agreeable. If someone wants a black bag with purple knots, order it for them. After visiting the Arrowcraft shop and talking to our beautiful Faye and Nella and Ruby, we now understand what "warp" means. As long as the colors are available, if the warp is set up with the basic color, you can plug in any normally stocked color or knot. Satisfy your customers. If they want a long place mat, just ask Arrowcraft to make one. We recently ordered a Daisy mat 100 inches long to go down the center of a long table. The customer doesn't care what it costs, she's getting exactly what she wants. She'll have to wait, but you'll have that satisfied customer. Remember, "they" is you. Four years agowe wondered why they didn't make a coaster. So we asked and last year they sold 17,000 Hawaiian coasters. How about asking they to name something after your club? From now on Arrowcraft is the gift for out-going presidents (junk those silver trays give a revival bag), pledges, new initiates, for Panhellenic auctions, and Christmas bazaars. Create a Pi Phi Purse for a drawing at your meetings. Ours is a wine and blue junior tote. Inside is a roll of drawing tickets and a surprise gift. For 10 each or 3 for 25 you buy tickets and drop the stub in the tote with the money. At the end of the meeting draw the winning ticket. The lucky member gets the surprise gift, the Pi Phi purse to hold 'til the next meeting, and must replace the gift. The money goes to the treasury. If you regularly donate to a Christmas bazaar, make this year's contribution "Mrs. Santa's Purse." Take a red junior tote, fill with some tissue and on top place two green potholders, six red and white coasters, a white hot pad, and a cookbook. It makes an attractive, artistic donation for ally bazaar. Our Panhellenic has a meeting each fall when every alumnae club may bring its fund raising projects to show and tell. Take Arrow-craft. If your Panhellenic doesn't do this type of thing, suggest it, and get to that fantastic group of sorority women who will appreciate Arrowcraft. The most cost saving item of all DO NOT MAIL ANYTHING BACK. You are only paying postage twice and you don't have to sell it all before summer or before changing chair-persons. Keep it and have,an early sale at some-body's September bridge club to generate Christmas orders. If you end up with a real loser, hang in there it will sell eventually, or you can always put it in the Pi Phi Purse for a door prize. Create your own miracles. Aloha. Recipe Is Winner Jill Shiner Hayward of the Philadelphia Main Line Alumni Club picked up an extra $25 last spring when she submitted a winning recipe to the Pantry Planner, publication of a grocery chain. The recipe for Reuben Casserole appears on page 56 of the Arrowmont Cook-book. Jill submitted her recipe to the Consumer Panel and it was selected as a winner. ONE DEBENEDETTI SENNER Honolulu A.G. 34 Watch For Pi Phis In Old Williamsburg by SARA LEWIS, Virginia Gamma Last summer, if you vacationed in historic Colonial Williamsburg or visited the Old Country at Busch Gardens that just opened this year, you may have been greeted by a Virginia Gamma Pi Phi ! Because of the many employment opportunities offered by these two corporations, many of the Pi Phis at William and Mary found that it would be profitable to spend their summer in Williamsburg. In Colonial Williamsburg, Pi Phis Diane Hanretty and Sara Lewis worked as interpreters in 18th century shops along Duke of Gloucester Street in the restored area. In Busch Gardens Pi Phis Sandy Jeter, Melissa Locke, Pam Cutler, Vanessa Popa, Nancy Tienken, Sue Shank, Sue Hanna, and alum Sarah Talis worked at every kind of job from toy store clerk and bank teller to monorail and roller coaster operators. Every-one agrees it was a fun summer, especially those instances when another Pi Phi was discovered. One day at Busch Gardens, a Virginia Gamma met a lady who was a Golden Arrow Pi Phi, as she was boarding the "Eagle One" monorail. In Colonial Williamsburg, a Virginia Gamma noticed a Pi Phi ring that a visitor wore, as she was looking at the display of hand crafted silver. It makes Pi Phi take on more of a national meaning when you meet someone you've never seen before, from across the United States, who shares that same Pi Phi "specialness." Many Virginia Gammas have already decided to stay in Williamsburg again next summer. So if you're traveling our way keep a sharp eye out for the details that tell you who's a Pi Phi. Virginia Gammas will be looking for you too. Diane Hanretty and Sara Lewis enjoy their summer jobs in historic Williamsburg. 36 over 150 1. St. Louis, MO, $9,190.00 2. Houston, TX, $3,012.50 3.

HELEN ANDERSON LEWIS Board of Governors Awards Committee AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE May 31. 1975 and 1974 ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Gatlinburg, Tennessee We have examined the statements of financial condition as of May 31, 1975 and 1974 and the related statements of revenues and expenditures and changes in fund balances for the years then ended of the following funds of Pi Beta ?hi Settlement School (a division of Pi Beta Phi Fra-:ernity): Current Funds Endowment Funds Invested in Plant Special Fund-Wisconsin Alpha Trust )ur examinations were made in accordance with gently accepted auditing standards and, accordingly, inded such tests of the accounting records and such other citing procedures as we considered necessary in the cirnstances. is discussed in Note D to the financial statements, the :clement School has received notice of income tax deiencies from the Internal Revenue Service for years ided May 31, 1961 through May 31, 1968. The Internal evenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop is of related to the tax exempt purposes of Settlement school and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree and plans to pursue the matter in court. No provision has been made in the financial statements for any liability that may result. In our opinion, subject to the effects, if any, on the financial statements of the ultimate resolution of the mat-ter discussed in the preceding paragraph, the financial statements referred to above present fairly the financial position of the funds (as described above) of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at May 31, 1975 and 1974, and the results of their operations and changes in fund balances for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Years Ended May 31, 1975 and 1974 NOTE A Significant Accounting Policies The accounts of the Settlement School are maintained on a fund basis of accounting appropriate to not-for-profit organizations. The current funds are used to account for transactions related to the instructional programs of the School and the auxiliary activities which provide services to the students, faculty and public. The Endowment Funds are used to account for gifts which allow only the income thereon to be expended. The Invested In Plant Fund contains the transactions relating to investment in property and equipment. The Special Fund is described in Note C. The format of the financial statements displaying these funds is presented in a manner which is appropriate for colleges and universities. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for colleges and universities. no prviosion has been made for depreciation of buildings and equigment. THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Certain expenses paid from other funds of Pi Beta Phi are allocable to Settlement School and are included as income and expenses in these financial statements. NoTE B Due to Pi Beta Phi Grand Treasurer Advances to Settlement School were made as a loan for the purpose of paying a portion of the construction costs of a classroom building to be known as Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. The loan hears interest at 5% due annually. Subsequent to year end, a payment of $19,675 was expended on this loan and a repayment schedule adopted for the remaining $250,000 which calls for $25.000 payments plus interest annually beginning July, 1976 until loan is fully paid. NOTE C Wisconsin Alpha Trust The Wisconsin Alpha Trust agreement dated December 5, 1972, provides that Arrowmont School Division of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School hold certain properties in trust and distribute income from those properties in the following manner. At the end of the first year, 80% of the net income was paid to the Elvehjem Art Center and 20% to Arrowmont. In subsequent years, 80% of the net income is being paid to Arrowmont and 20% used for purposes of continuing education of Pi Beta Phi alumnae. Assets of the Trust at May 31, 1975 and 1974, consisted of a $233 savings account and $142,000 of 7.35% Federal Farm Loan Bonds. The initial term of the Trust is for five years and one month. Four additional periods of five years each may be extended by Wisconsin Alpha. The trust agreement provides that all assets he fully paid over to Wisconsin Alpha or its successor immediately upon establishment of an undergraduate chap-ter of Pi Beta Phi on the campus of the University of Wisconsin. Madison, Wisconsin. NoTE D--Contingent Liability The Settlement School has received a notice of income tax deficiencies from the Internal Revenue Service for years ended May 31, 1961 through May 31, which amounted to approximately $60,000, including penalties. The Internal Revenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop income is not related to the tax exempt purpose of Settlement School and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree with this position and plans to pursue the matter in court. A court hearing is scheduled for October, 1975 relating to this matter, the out-come of which cannot be determined at this time and no provision has been made for any liability in connection with this matter. In the past year, this committee has happily achieved its six objectives: to prepare a definitive application form, to prepare an article for The ARROW, to issue a newsletter to each club, to send applications to all interested members, to evaluate the applications returned, and finally to select the winners. 'Considerable mail has crossed each of our desks as all decisions were being made by letter. By April 30, the winners were selected. These were announced at Convention. The other applicants were notified by letter of the results. The committee read with great care the applications and the recommendations. Each member kept in mind our two major criteria: need and goal. After careful delibera Thanks to the continued support of Pi Phis in both Canada and the United States, the library systems in Canada's vast northland have once again been able to under-take innovative programs with money donated through our "Arrow in the Arctic" project. In 1974, the library systems of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory each received $450 from the project. Both intend to use the money for audio equipment. The Northwest Territories will purchase stereo cassette equipment and tapes to start a basic collection of northern material such as legends, music, and reminiscences geared primarily for the young people. The Yukon has ordered two stereo record players for use in outlying branch libraries where there has been no opportunity for the people to listen to recorded material. Pi Phi money is the only money these libraries receive outside of their government allotment.tion Katherine Elbirg and Jane Bradbury were selected for the coming year to receive continuing education scholarships. The committee of Polly Hackett Burns, Illinois Eta; Lindsey Farnham Siegfried, Ohio Beta; and this chairman, Alberta Alpha, sincerely hope that more alumnR will avail themselves of this scholarship opportunity in the coming year. Seeing the first full cycle of the ACCE completed with the two winners being announced at Convention has proved a most fulfilling experience. Each committee member felt the excitement and the responsibility of being involved in this new worthwhile project for Pi Beta Phi. AILEEN AYLSWORTH WELGAN The librarians are grateful for our donations which en-able them to start projects for which no other funds are available. "Arrow in the Arctic" is the current on-going project of the Canadian Philanthropies Committee. The loan funds for social work students at nine Canadian universities which was the previous project are still of concern to the committee. The funds, though self-supporting and ad-ministered by the universities, are currently under study to see if the money could be used more effectively in other ways. We are grateful for the support of the many chapters and clubs who contributed to "Arrow in the Arctic" making it possible for the libraries in the Canadian north to preserve the culture of her native people and to bring the outside world to the isolated outposts. CAROL CHILDERHOSE MCGONIGAL CANADIAN PHILANTHROPIES COMMITTEE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Although the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds project is now twenty-nine years old, a surprising number of members seem in doubt about its purposes and scope. It was established by vote of the 1946 Convention when $50,000 were set aside from general Fraternity funds to launch a new project, to be named in honor of Emma Harper Turner, former Grand President, Grand Vice President, and organizer of the alumna; department. The principal of the Fund has been augmented each year largely by contributions from alumnae clubs, but also from chapters and individual members. This project has dual purposes and it benefits both active chapters and individual alumnm. The entire principal is used for loans to chapters for building and re-modeling purposes. Older chapter houses need to be periodically renovated, repaired, and enlarged; new houses must be built. This very vital part of this project is ad-ministered by the National Board of Trustee Funds. The interest which chapters pay on these loans is put into a special fund which is used for gifts to alumnae who are in special need of assistance. Through various scholarships, the Loan Fund and the Fellowships have been set up to aid collegiate members; this has been the only project which aided alumnm. These grants to alumnm are processed by the Emma Harper Memorial Funds Commit-tee which consists of three alumnm appointed by Grand Council. Every grant must have the unanimous vote of this committee and must be approved by the Grand Vice President of Philanthropies. Grants to alumnae are of two types: (1) emergenccy grants, usually given in one check and not often giver more than once. This type of grant is usually, thougl not always, given to younger alumnm facing tragic emer gencies; (2) monthly grants, which are usually given to older alumnm. Most of these less fortunate alumnm have a slender income which covers the bare necessities, but with nothing left for the unexpected, the extras, the small things which add to comfort. One alumna expressed it well when she wrote, "My monthly check from the Fraternity makes the difference for me from merely existing to living with a little dignity." During the past year eight alumnR received monthly checks, ranging from $25 to $50. One young alumna, tragically stricken, was given an emergency grant of $500.00, the maximum allowed for any one year. Six of the alumnE currently receiving monthly grants are Golden Arrows. All are past eighty years old; the oldest is eighty-seven., Three are in nursing homes, bedfast. One is hos pitalized, seriously ill. Every recipient is grateful for her "gift of love" from Pi Beta Phi. They invariably seem surprised when they learn that the Fraternity still cares about them in their loneliness and old age and wants to lighten their burdens. Over the years many have written that the lift to their hearts and their spirits meant almost more than the some-times desperately needed financial assistance. This year for the first time small checks were sent at Christmas time to four alumnm who were in need of spe 39 onor Initiate is Gatlinburg Link by LINDA LANE JOHNSON Charlottesville A.C. The initiation of Edna McCarter McFall provides Pi Phi with a rare personal link to Gatlinburg. From birth, Mrs. McFall's life was shaped by her association with Pi Beta Phi and the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, not as a member of the Fraternity but as one of the school's first and finest students. Mrs. McFall became an honorary initiate at the University of Virginia in April when Virginia Epsilon was installed.. She had been recommended to, the Charlottesville Alumni Club by the Richmond Club and was enthusiastically approved. Soon after, she was visited in her home near Richmond by Ruth Williams Hansen .and Micki Leef Stout, and she was overwhelmed. She had never dreamed that she would be a Pi Phi, an "insider" at last to that sisterhood that had so shaped her life. Mrs. McFall was born about the same time Pi Phi chose her home town of Gatlinburg as the site for their Settlement School. The Mc-Carter's lived next door to the school, and Edna attended both grade and high school there. In fact, her entire family of five sisters and four brothers attended, and her mother worked for the craft shop. When Edna was 14, she talked her way into the first weaving class offered by the school. Weaving was fast becoming a lost art, and Pi Phi had hopes of reviving that art. Edna soon became their means of publicizing weaving. As the finest weaver in the school and the top student in her class, she was invited to weave material for a dress and coat for Mrs. Grace Coolidge, wife of the President and herself a Pi Phi. The outfit was presented to Mrs. Coolidge at the 1924 Eastern Conference of Pi Beta Phi. Ironically, that conference was held April 11-12, fifty years ago to the day that Mrs. McFall became a Pi Phi. Her training as a weaver opened doors for Edna McCarter all over the United States. She attended the Minnesota State Fair and the Boston Gardens to demonstrate weaving, and she demonstrated her skills at other exhibitions closer to Gatlinburg. Virginia Epsilon's. honor initiates are, from the left, Pam Paramore Chamberlain, Edna McCarter McFall, and Roberta Sibold Hunt During World War II, Edna served in France for three years and then returned to marry her sweetheart of 17 years. They established their home in Powhatan County. outside of Richmond. For the past 15 years, Mrs. McFall was director of handicraft at the Virginia Correctional Center for Women, once again using skills acquired from her early training in weaving. This time she taught weaving not only as art but as therapy for the incarcerated women. On Friday, April 11, Edna McCarter McFall was pledged to Pi Phi with two other honorary initiates, and she attended her first Cooky-Shine. The next day she was initiated, and at the banquet was seated at the head table. She was introduced to the 75 Pi Phis as their "link to Gatlinburg" and responded in a moving speech, "I never cease to be thankful for what you, Pi Beta Phi, have done for me. I am a product of that school, an example of what you did for those people in that remote area of the country. I thank you from a loving heart." How proud we are to have initiated her into Pi Phi.

Now you're nd sell millions of cats. aft chairperson must believe in ae must be willing to carry a all times, preferably using all senior tote for work, a junior a shoulder bag for sports aini for evening. Use no other use Pi Phi coasters, hot pads, in her home and believe that asion gift is Arrowcraft. g possible to order economically someone is ordering for a gift cess, offer to mail direct from i the customer paying the post-bill comes, charge your price of ostage, and you've made a sale own price list. Type and make e of your own prices with your none number at the top. Raise he traffic will allow. We're here , not to give away Arrowcraft. Lrket and price accordingly. If it stores sell good pot holders Gerry Senner, Honolulu A.C. displays her club's well-earned award for being first in the nation for Arrow-craft gross sales, 1974-75. for $1, charge $1 for Pi Phi potholders. Ours are just as good, if not better. Keep a box of samples in your car, and if anyone asks, "what's in the box ?," show them. Having an item on hand means a quick sale. At least be able to show all four sizes of the purses and some representative colors. When you get checks from customers, write down the ae dress from the check to start a mailing list. Satisfied customers will brag to their friends. When you have a sale, display your items imaginatively. Set your dining table with mats, napkins, napkin rings, coasters, and hot pads. Use your own china and sterling to create a smashing impression. Be agreeable. If someone wants a black bag with purple knots, order it for them. After visiting the Arrowcraft shop and talking to our beautiful Faye and Nella and Ruby, we now understand what "warp" means. As long as the colors are available, if the warp is set up with the basic color, you can plug in any normally stocked color or knot. Satisfy your customers. If they want a long place mat, just ask Arrowcraft to make one. We recently ordered a Daisy mat 100 inches long to go down the center of a long table. The customer doesn't care what it costs, she's getting exactly what she wants. She'll have to wait, but you'll have that satisfied customer. Remember, "they" is you. Four years agowe wondered why they didn't make a coaster. So we asked and last year they sold 17,000 Hawaiian coasters. How about asking they to name something after your club? From now on Arrowcraft is the gift for out-going presidents (junk those silver trays give a revival bag), pledges, new initiates, for Panhellenic auctions, and Christmas bazaars. Create a Pi Phi Purse for a drawing at your meetings. Ours is a wine and blue junior tote. Inside is a roll of drawing tickets and a surprise gift. For 10 each or 3 for 25 you buy tickets and drop the stub in the tote with the money. At the end of the meeting draw the winning ticket. The lucky member gets the surprise gift, the Pi Phi purse to hold 'til the next meeting, and must replace the gift. The money goes to the treasury. If you regularly donate to a Christmas bazaar, make this year's contribution "Mrs. Santa's Purse." Take a red junior tote, fill with some tissue and on top place two green potholders, six red and white coasters, a white hot pad, and a cookbook. It makes an attractive, artistic donation for ally bazaar. Our Panhellenic has a meeting each fall when every alumnae club may bring its fund raising projects to show and tell. Take Arrow-craft. If your Panhellenic doesn't do this type of thing, suggest it, and get to that fantastic group of sorority women who will appreciate Arrowcraft. The most cost saving item of all DO NOT MAIL ANYTHING BACK. You are only paying postage twice and you don't have to sell it all before summer or before changing chair-persons. Keep it and have,an early sale at some-body's September bridge club to generate Christmas orders. If you end up with a real loser, hang in there it will sell eventually, or you can always put it in the Pi Phi Purse for a door prize. Create your own miracles. Aloha. Recipe Is Winner Jill Shiner Hayward of the Philadelphia Main Line Alumni Club picked up an extra $25 last spring when she submitted a winning recipe to the Pantry Planner, publication of a grocery chain. The recipe for Reuben Casserole appears on page 56 of the Arrowmont Cook-book. Jill submitted her recipe to the Consumer Panel and it was selected as a winner. ONE DEBENEDETTI SENNER Honolulu A.G. 34 Watch For Pi Phis In Old Williamsburg by SARA LEWIS, Virginia Gamma Last summer, if you vacationed in historic Colonial Williamsburg or visited the Old Country at Busch Gardens that just opened this year, you may have been greeted by a Virginia Gamma Pi Phi ! Because of the many employment opportunities offered by these two corporations, many of the Pi Phis at William and Mary found that it would be profitable to spend their summer in Williamsburg. In Colonial Williamsburg, Pi Phis Diane Hanretty and Sara Lewis worked as interpreters in 18th century shops along Duke of Gloucester Street in the restored area. In Busch Gardens Pi Phis Sandy Jeter, Melissa Locke, Pam Cutler, Vanessa Popa, Nancy Tienken, Sue Shank, Sue Hanna, and alum Sarah Talis worked at every kind of job from toy store clerk and bank teller to monorail and roller coaster operators. Every-one agrees it was a fun summer, especially those instances when another Pi Phi was discovered. One day at Busch Gardens, a Virginia Gamma met a lady who was a Golden Arrow Pi Phi, as she was boarding the "Eagle One" monorail. In Colonial Williamsburg, a Virginia Gamma noticed a Pi Phi ring that a visitor wore, as she was looking at the display of hand crafted silver. It makes Pi Phi take on more of a national meaning when you meet someone you've never seen before, from across the United States, who shares that same Pi Phi "specialness." Many Virginia Gammas have already decided to stay in Williamsburg again next summer. So if you're traveling our way keep a sharp eye out for the details that tell you who's a Pi Phi. Virginia Gammas will be looking for you too. Diane Hanretty and Sara Lewis enjoy their summer jobs in historic Williamsburg. 36 over 150 1. St. Louis, MO, $9,190.00 2. Houston, TX, $3,012.50 3.

The Internal evenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop is of related to the tax exempt purposes of Settlement school and is, therefore, subject to income taxation.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Years Ended May 31, 1975 and 1974 NOTE A Significant Accounting Policies The accounts of the Settlement School are maintained on a fund basis of accounting appropriate to not-for-profit organizations. The current funds are used to account for transactions related to the instructional programs of the School and the auxiliary activities which provide services to the students, faculty and public. The Endowment Funds are used to account for gifts which allow only the income thereon to be expended. The Invested In Plant Fund contains the transactions relating to investment in property and equipment. The Special Fund is described in Note C. The format of the financial statements displaying these funds is presented in a manner which is appropriate for colleges and universities. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for colleges and universities. no prviosion has been made for depreciation of buildings and equigment. THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Certain expenses paid from other funds of Pi Beta Phi are allocable to Settlement School and are included as income and expenses in these financial statements. NoTE B Due to Pi Beta Phi Grand Treasurer Advances to Settlement School were made as a loan for the purpose of paying a portion of the construction costs of a classroom building to be known as Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. The loan hears interest at 5% due annually. Subsequent to year end, a payment of $19,675 was expended on this loan and a repayment schedule adopted for the remaining $250,000 which calls for $25.000 payments plus interest annually beginning July, 1976 until loan is fully paid. NOTE C Wisconsin Alpha Trust The Wisconsin Alpha Trust agreement dated December 5, 1972, provides that Arrowmont School Division of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School hold certain properties in trust and distribute income from those properties in the following manner. At the end of the first year, 80% of the net income was paid to the Elvehjem Art Center and 20% to Arrowmont. In subsequent years, 80% of the net income is being paid to Arrowmont and 20% used for purposes of continuing education of Pi Beta Phi alumnae. Assets of the Trust at May 31, 1975 and 1974, consisted of a $233 savings account and $142,000 of 7.35% Federal Farm Loan Bonds. The initial term of the Trust is for five years and one month. Four additional periods of five years each may be extended by Wisconsin Alpha. The trust agreement provides that all assets he fully paid over to Wisconsin Alpha or its successor immediately upon establishment of an undergraduate chap-ter of Pi Beta Phi on the campus of the University of Wisconsin. Madison, Wisconsin. NoTE D--Contingent Liability The Settlement School has received a notice of income tax deficiencies from the Internal Revenue Service for years ended May 31, 1961 through May 31, which amounted to approximately $60,000, including penalties. The Internal Revenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop income is not related to the tax exempt purpose of Settlement School and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree with this position and plans to pursue the matter in court. A court hearing is scheduled for October, 1975 relating to this matter, the out-come of which cannot be determined at this time and no provision has been made for any liability in connection with this matter. In the past year, this committee has happily achieved its six objectives: to prepare a definitive application form, to prepare an article for The ARROW, to issue a newsletter to each club, to send applications to all interested members, to evaluate the applications returned, and finally to select the winners. 'Considerable mail has crossed each of our desks as all decisions were being made by letter. By April 30, the winners were selected. These were announced at Convention. The other applicants were notified by letter of the results. The committee read with great care the applications and the recommendations. Each member kept in mind our two major criteria: need and goal. After careful delibera Thanks to the continued support of Pi Phis in both Canada and the United States, the library systems in Canada's vast northland have once again been able to under-take innovative programs with money donated through our "Arrow in the Arctic" project. In 1974, the library systems of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory each received $450 from the project. Both intend to use the money for audio equipment. The Northwest Territories will purchase stereo cassette equipment and tapes to start a basic collection of northern material such as legends, music, and reminiscences geared primarily for the young people. The Yukon has ordered two stereo record players for use in outlying branch libraries where there has been no opportunity for the people to listen to recorded material. Pi Phi money is the only money these libraries receive outside of their government allotment.tion Katherine Elbirg and Jane Bradbury were selected for the coming year to receive continuing education scholarships. The committee of Polly Hackett Burns, Illinois Eta; Lindsey Farnham Siegfried, Ohio Beta; and this chairman, Alberta Alpha, sincerely hope that more alumnR will avail themselves of this scholarship opportunity in the coming year.

CAROL CHILDERHOSE MCGONIGAL CANADIAN PHILANTHROPIES COMMITTEE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Although the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds project is now twenty-nine years old, a surprising number of members seem in doubt about its purposes and scope. It was established by vote of the 1946 Convention when $50,000 were set aside from general Fraternity funds to launch a new project, to be named in honor of Emma Harper Turner, former Grand President, Grand Vice President, and organizer of the alumna; department. The principal of the Fund has been augmented each year largely by contributions from alumnae clubs, but also from chapters and individual members. This project has dual purposes and it benefits both active chapters and individual alumnm. The entire principal is used for loans to chapters for building and re-modeling purposes. Older chapter houses need to be periodically renovated, repaired, and enlarged; new houses must be built. This very vital part of this project is ad-ministered by the National Board of Trustee Funds. The interest which chapters pay on these loans is put into a special fund which is used for gifts to alumnae who are in special need of assistance. Through various scholarships, the Loan Fund and the Fellowships have been set up to aid collegiate members; this has been the only project which aided alumnm. These grants to alumnm are processed by the Emma Harper Memorial Funds Commit-tee which consists of three alumnm appointed by Grand Council. Every grant must have the unanimous vote of this committee and must be approved by the Grand Vice President of Philanthropies. Grants to alumnae are of two types: (1) emergenccy grants, usually given in one check and not often giver more than once. This type of grant is usually, thougl not always, given to younger alumnm facing tragic emer gencies; (2) monthly grants, which are usually given to older alumnm. Most of these less fortunate alumnm have a slender income which covers the bare necessities, but with nothing left for the unexpected, the extras, the small things which add to comfort. One alumna expressed it well when she wrote, "My monthly check from the Fraternity makes the difference for me from merely existing to living with a little dignity." During the past year eight alumnR received monthly checks, ranging from $25 to $50. One young alumna, tragically stricken, was given an emergency grant of $500.00, the maximum allowed for any one year. Six of the alumnE currently receiving monthly grants are Golden Arrows. All are past eighty years old; the oldest is eighty-seven., Three are in nursing homes, bedfast. One is hos pitalized, seriously ill. Every recipient is grateful for her "gift of love" from Pi Beta Phi. They invariably seem surprised when they learn that the Fraternity still cares about them in their loneliness and old age and wants to lighten their burdens. Over the years many have written that the lift to their hearts and their spirits meant almost more than the some-times desperately needed financial assistance. This year for the first time small checks were sent at Christmas time to four alumnm who were in need of spe 39 onor Initiate is Gatlinburg Link by LINDA LANE JOHNSON Charlottesville A.C. The initiation of Edna McCarter McFall provides Pi Phi with a rare personal link to Gatlinburg. From birth, Mrs. McFall's life was shaped by her association with Pi Beta Phi and the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, not as a member of the Fraternity but as one of the school's first and finest students. Mrs. McFall became an honorary initiate at the University of Virginia in April when Virginia Epsilon was installed.. She had been recommended to, the Charlottesville Alumni Club by the Richmond Club and was enthusiastically approved. Soon after, she was visited in her home near Richmond by Ruth Williams Hansen .and Micki Leef Stout, and she was overwhelmed. She had never dreamed that she would be a Pi Phi, an "insider" at last to that sisterhood that had so shaped her life. Mrs. McFall was born about the same time Pi Phi chose her home town of Gatlinburg as the site for their Settlement School. The Mc-Carter's lived next door to the school, and Edna attended both grade and high school there. In fact, her entire family of five sisters and four brothers attended, and her mother worked for the craft shop. When Edna was 14, she talked her way into the first weaving class offered by the school. Weaving was fast becoming a lost art, and Pi Phi had hopes of reviving that art. Edna soon became their means of publicizing weaving. As the finest weaver in the school and the top student in her class, she was invited to weave material for a dress and coat for Mrs. Grace Coolidge, wife of the President and herself a Pi Phi. The outfit was presented to Mrs. Coolidge at the 1924 Eastern Conference of Pi Beta Phi. Ironically, that conference was held April 11-12, fifty years ago to the day that Mrs. McFall became a Pi Phi. Her training as a weaver opened doors for Edna McCarter all over the United States. She attended the Minnesota State Fair and the Boston Gardens to demonstrate weaving, and she demonstrated her skills at other exhibitions closer to Gatlinburg. Virginia Epsilon's. honor initiates are, from the left, Pam Paramore Chamberlain, Edna McCarter McFall, and Roberta Sibold Hunt During World War II, Edna served in France for three years and then returned to marry her sweetheart of 17 years. They established their home in Powhatan County. outside of Richmond. For the past 15 years, Mrs. McFall was director of handicraft at the Virginia Correctional Center for Women, once again using skills acquired from her early training in weaving. This time she taught weaving not only as art but as therapy for the incarcerated women. On Friday, April 11, Edna McCarter McFall was pledged to Pi Phi with two other honorary initiates, and she attended her first Cooky-Shine. The next day she was initiated, and at the banquet was seated at the head table. She was introduced to the 75 Pi Phis as their "link to Gatlinburg" and responded in a moving speech, "I never cease to be thankful for what you, Pi Beta Phi, have done for me. I am a product of that school, an example of what you did for those people in that remote area of the country. I thank you from a loving heart." How proud we are to have initiated her into Pi Phi.

The Internal evenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop is of related to the tax exempt purposes of Settlement school and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree and plans to pursue the matter in court. No provision has been made in the financial statements for any liability that may result. In our opinion, subject to the effects, if any, on the financial statements of the ultimate resolution of the mat-ter discussed in the preceding paragraph, the financial statements referred to above present fairly the financial position of the funds (as described above) of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at May 31, 1975 and 1974, and the results of their operations and changes in fund balances for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Years Ended May 31, 1975 and 1974 NOTE A Significant Accounting Policies The accounts of the Settlement School are maintained on a fund basis of accounting appropriate to not-for-profit organizations. The current funds are used to account for transactions related to the instructional programs of the School and the auxiliary activities which provide services to the students, faculty and public. The Endowment Funds are used to account for gifts which allow only the income thereon to be expended. The Invested In Plant Fund contains the transactions relating to investment in property and equipment. The Special Fund is described in Note C. The format of the financial statements displaying these funds is presented in a manner which is appropriate for colleges and universities. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for colleges and universities. no prviosion has been made for depreciation of buildings and equigment. THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Certain expenses paid from other funds of Pi Beta Phi are allocable to Settlement School and are included as income and expenses in these financial statements. NoTE B Due to Pi Beta Phi Grand Treasurer Advances to Settlement School were made as a loan for the purpose of paying a portion of the construction costs of a classroom building to be known as Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. The loan hears interest at 5% due annually. Subsequent to year end, a payment of $19,675 was expended on this loan and a repayment schedule adopted for the remaining $250,000 which calls for $25.000 payments plus interest annually beginning July, 1976 until loan is fully paid. NOTE C Wisconsin Alpha Trust The Wisconsin Alpha Trust agreement dated December 5, 1972, provides that Arrowmont School Division of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School hold certain properties in trust and distribute income from those properties in the following manner. At the end of the first year, 80% of the net income was paid to the Elvehjem Art Center and 20% to Arrowmont. In subsequent years, 80% of the net income is being paid to Arrowmont and 20% used for purposes of continuing education of Pi Beta Phi alumnae. Assets of the Trust at May 31, 1975 and 1974, consisted of a $233 savings account and $142,000 of 7.35% Federal Farm Loan Bonds. The initial term of the Trust is for five years and one month. Four additional periods of five years each may be extended by Wisconsin Alpha. The trust agreement provides that all assets he fully paid over to Wisconsin Alpha or its successor immediately upon establishment of an undergraduate chap-ter of Pi Beta Phi on the campus of the University of Wisconsin. Madison, Wisconsin. NoTE D--Contingent Liability The Settlement School has received a notice of income tax deficiencies from the Internal Revenue Service for years ended May 31, 1961 through May 31, which amounted to approximately $60,000, including penalties. The Internal Revenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop income is not related to the tax exempt purpose of Settlement School and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree with this position and plans to pursue the matter in court. A court hearing is scheduled for October, 1975 relating to this matter, the out-come of which cannot be determined at this time and no provision has been made for any liability in connection with this matter. In the past year, this committee has happily achieved its six objectives: to prepare a definitive application form, to prepare an article for The ARROW, to issue a newsletter to each club, to send applications to all interested members, to evaluate the applications returned, and finally to select the winners. 'Considerable mail has crossed each of our desks as all decisions were being made by letter. By April 30, the winners were selected. These were announced at Convention. The other applicants were notified by letter of the results. The committee read with great care the applications and the recommendations. Each member kept in mind our two major criteria: need and goal. After careful delibera Thanks to the continued support of Pi Phis in both Canada and the United States, the library systems in Canada's vast northland have once again been able to under-take innovative programs with money donated through our "Arrow in the Arctic" project. In 1974, the library systems of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory each received $450 from the project. Both intend to use the money for audio equipment. The Northwest Territories will purchase stereo cassette equipment and tapes to start a basic collection of northern material such as legends, music, and reminiscences geared primarily for the young people. The Yukon has ordered two stereo record players for use in outlying branch libraries where there has been no opportunity for the people to listen to recorded material. Pi Phi money is the only money these libraries receive outside of their government allotment.tion Katherine Elbirg and Jane Bradbury were selected for the coming year to receive continuing education scholarships. The committee of Polly Hackett Burns, Illinois Eta; Lindsey Farnham Siegfried, Ohio Beta; and this chairman, Alberta Alpha, sincerely hope that more alumnR will avail themselves of this scholarship opportunity in the coming year. Seeing the first full cycle of the ACCE completed with the two winners being announced at Convention has proved a most fulfilling experience. Each committee member felt the excitement and the responsibility of being involved in this new worthwhile project for Pi Beta Phi.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Years Ended May 31, 1975 and 1974 NOTE A Significant Accounting Policies The accounts of the Settlement School are maintained on a fund basis of accounting appropriate to not-for-profit organizations. The current funds are used to account for transactions related to the instructional programs of the School and the auxiliary activities which provide services to the students, faculty and public. The Endowment Funds are used to account for gifts which allow only the income thereon to be expended. The Invested In Plant Fund contains the transactions relating to investment in property and equipment. The Special Fund is described in Note C. The format of the financial statements displaying these funds is presented in a manner which is appropriate for colleges and universities. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for colleges and universities. no prviosion has been made for depreciation of buildings and equigment. THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Certain expenses paid from other funds of Pi Beta Phi are allocable to Settlement School and are included as income and expenses in these financial statements. NoTE B Due to Pi Beta Phi Grand Treasurer Advances to Settlement School were made as a loan for the purpose of paying a portion of the construction costs of a classroom building to be known as Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. The loan hears interest at 5% due annually. Subsequent to year end, a payment of $19,675 was expended on this loan and a repayment schedule adopted for the remaining $250,000 which calls for $25.000 payments plus interest annually beginning July, 1976 until loan is fully paid. NOTE C Wisconsin Alpha Trust The Wisconsin Alpha Trust agreement dated December 5, 1972, provides that Arrowmont School Division of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School hold certain properties in trust and distribute income from those properties in the following manner. At the end of the first year, 80% of the net income was paid to the Elvehjem Art Center and 20% to Arrowmont. In subsequent years, 80% of the net income is being paid to Arrowmont and 20% used for purposes of continuing education of Pi Beta Phi alumnae. Assets of the Trust at May 31, 1975 and 1974, consisted of a $233 savings account and $142,000 of 7.35% Federal Farm Loan Bonds. The initial term of the Trust is for five years and one month. Four additional periods of five years each may be extended by Wisconsin Alpha. The trust agreement provides that all assets he fully paid over to Wisconsin Alpha or its successor immediately upon establishment of an undergraduate chap-ter of Pi Beta Phi on the campus of the University of Wisconsin. Madison, Wisconsin. NoTE D--Contingent Liability The Settlement School has received a notice of income tax deficiencies from the Internal Revenue Service for years ended May 31, 1961 through May 31, which amounted to approximately $60,000, including penalties. The Internal Revenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop income is not related to the tax exempt purpose of Settlement School and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree with this position and plans to pursue the matter in court. A court hearing is scheduled for October, 1975 relating to this matter, the out-come of which cannot be determined at this time and no provision has been made for any liability in connection with this matter. In the past year, this committee has happily achieved its six objectives: to prepare a definitive application form, to prepare an article for The ARROW, to issue a newsletter to each club, to send applications to all interested members, to evaluate the applications returned, and finally to select the winners. 'Considerable mail has crossed each of our desks as all decisions were being made by letter. By April 30, the winners were selected. These were announced at Convention. The other applicants were notified by letter of the results. The committee read with great care the applications and the recommendations. Each member kept in mind our two major criteria: need and goal. After careful delibera Thanks to the continued support of Pi Phis in both Canada and the United States, the library systems in Canada's vast northland have once again been able to under-take innovative programs with money donated through our "Arrow in the Arctic" project. In 1974, the library systems of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory each received $450 from the project. Both intend to use the money for audio equipment. The Northwest Territories will purchase stereo cassette equipment and tapes to start a basic collection of northern material such as legends, music, and reminiscences geared primarily for the young people. The Yukon has ordered two stereo record players for use in outlying branch libraries where there has been no opportunity for the people to listen to recorded material. Pi Phi money is the only money these libraries receive outside of their government allotment.tion Katherine Elbirg and Jane Bradbury were selected for the coming year to receive continuing education scholarships. The committee of Polly Hackett Burns, Illinois Eta; Lindsey Farnham Siegfried, Ohio Beta; and this chairman, Alberta Alpha, sincerely hope that more alumnR will avail themselves of this scholarship opportunity in the coming year. Seeing the first full cycle of the ACCE completed with the two winners being announced at Convention has proved a most fulfilling experience. Each committee member felt the excitement and the responsibility of being involved in this new worthwhile project for Pi Beta Phi. AILEEN AYLSWORTH WELGAN The librarians are grateful for our donations which en-able them to start projects for which no other funds are available. "Arrow in the Arctic" is the current on-going project of the Canadian Philanthropies Committee. The loan funds for social work students at nine Canadian universities which was the previous project are still of concern to the committee. The funds, though self-supporting and ad-ministered by the universities, are currently under study to see if the money could be used more effectively in other ways. We are grateful for the support of the many chapters and clubs who contributed to "Arrow in the Arctic" making it possible for the libraries in the Canadian north to preserve the culture of her native people and to bring the outside world to the isolated outposts. CAROL CHILDERHOSE MCGONIGAL CANADIAN PHILANTHROPIES COMMITTEE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Although the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds project is now twenty-nine years old, a surprising number of members seem in doubt about its purposes and scope. It was established by vote of the 1946 Convention when $50,000 were set aside from general Fraternity funds to launch a new project, to be named in honor of Emma Harper Turner, former Grand President, Grand Vice President, and organizer of the alumna; department. The principal of the Fund has been augmented each year largely by contributions from alumnae clubs, but also from chapters and individual members. This project has dual purposes and it benefits both active chapters and individual alumnm. The entire principal is used for loans to chapters for building and re-modeling purposes. Older chapter houses need to be periodically renovated, repaired, and enlarged; new houses must be built. This very vital part of this project is ad-ministered by the National Board of Trustee Funds. The interest which chapters pay on these loans is put into a special fund which is used for gifts to alumnae who are in special need of assistance. Through various scholarships, the Loan Fund and the Fellowships have been set up to aid collegiate members; this has been the only project which aided alumnm. These grants to alumnm are processed by the Emma Harper Memorial Funds Commit-tee which consists of three alumnm appointed by Grand Council. Every grant must have the unanimous vote of this committee and must be approved by the Grand Vice President of Philanthropies. Grants to alumnae are of two types: (1) emergenccy grants, usually given in one check and not often giver more than once. This type of grant is usually, thougl not always, given to younger alumnm facing tragic emer gencies; (2) monthly grants, which are usually given to older alumnm. Most of these less fortunate alumnm have a slender income which covers the bare necessities, but with nothing left for the unexpected, the extras, the small things which add to comfort. One alumna expressed it well when she wrote, "My monthly check from the Fraternity makes the difference for me from merely existing to living with a little dignity." During the past year eight alumnR received monthly checks, ranging from $25 to $50. One young alumna, tragically stricken, was given an emergency grant of $500.00, the maximum allowed for any one year. Six of the alumnE currently receiving monthly grants are Golden Arrows. All are past eighty years old; the oldest is eighty-seven., Three are in nursing homes, bedfast. One is hos pitalized, seriously ill. Every recipient is grateful for her "gift of love" from Pi Beta Phi. They invariably seem surprised when they learn that the Fraternity still cares about them in their loneliness and old age and wants to lighten their burdens. Over the years many have written that the lift to their hearts and their spirits meant almost more than the some-times desperately needed financial assistance. This year for the first time small checks were sent at Christmas time to four alumnm who were in need of spe 39 onor Initiate is Gatlinburg Link by LINDA LANE JOHNSON Charlottesville A.C. The initiation of Edna McCarter McFall provides Pi Phi with a rare personal link to Gatlinburg. From birth, Mrs. McFall's life was shaped by her association with Pi Beta Phi and the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, not as a member of the Fraternity but as one of the school's first and finest students. Mrs. McFall became an honorary initiate at the University of Virginia in April when Virginia Epsilon was installed.. She had been recommended to, the Charlottesville Alumni Club by the Richmond Club and was enthusiastically approved. Soon after, she was visited in her home near Richmond by Ruth Williams Hansen .and Micki Leef Stout, and she was overwhelmed. She had never dreamed that she would be a Pi Phi, an "insider" at last to that sisterhood that had so shaped her life. Mrs. McFall was born about the same time Pi Phi chose her home town of Gatlinburg as the site for their Settlement School. The Mc-Carter's lived next door to the school, and Edna attended both grade and high school there. In fact, her entire family of five sisters and four brothers attended, and her mother worked for the craft shop. When Edna was 14, she talked her way into the first weaving class offered by the school. Weaving was fast becoming a lost art, and Pi Phi had hopes of reviving that art. Edna soon became their means of publicizing weaving. As the finest weaver in the school and the top student in her class, she was invited to weave material for a dress and coat for Mrs. Grace Coolidge, wife of the President and herself a Pi Phi. The outfit was presented to Mrs. Coolidge at the 1924 Eastern Conference of Pi Beta Phi. Ironically, that conference was held April 11-12, fifty years ago to the day that Mrs. McFall became a Pi Phi. Her training as a weaver opened doors for Edna McCarter all over the United States. She attended the Minnesota State Fair and the Boston Gardens to demonstrate weaving, and she demonstrated her skills at other exhibitions closer to Gatlinburg. Virginia Epsilon's. honor initiates are, from the left, Pam Paramore Chamberlain, Edna McCarter McFall, and Roberta Sibold Hunt During World War II, Edna served in France for three years and then returned to marry her sweetheart of 17 years. They established their home in Powhatan County. outside of Richmond. For the past 15 years, Mrs. McFall was director of handicraft at the Virginia Correctional Center for Women, once again using skills acquired from her early training in weaving. This time she taught weaving not only as art but as therapy for the incarcerated women. On Friday, April 11, Edna McCarter McFall was pledged to Pi Phi with two other honorary initiates, and she attended her first Cooky-Shine. The next day she was initiated, and at the banquet was seated at the head table. She was introduced to the 75 Pi Phis as their "link to Gatlinburg" and responded in a moving speech, "I never cease to be thankful for what you, Pi Beta Phi, have done for me. I am a product of that school, an example of what you did for those people in that remote area of the country. I thank you from a loving heart." How proud we are to have initiated her into Pi Phi.

The new high-rise Sheridan Hotel perched atop one of the high hills surrounding Gatlinburg seems to flaunt an urban-like sophistication over our busy little town and sets forth another new era for it. Pi Beta Phi, however, continues to retain its place of prominence in both civic and cultural affairs of Gatlinburg and enjoys the respect of the community. The Gatlinburg Rotary Club again gave a scholarship to Arrowmont for the summer of 1975. Our facilities have been used by local groups and during the spring of 1975 a ten week Community Workshop was held for local citizens. An autograph session was held at the Arrowcraft Shop for Majorie 'Chalmer's book "Better I Stay." It can be ordered through Arrowcraft. The 1974 Summer Session at Arrowmont was again successful with 1043 students from 40 states and two foreign countries. The use of the refurbished Watson Cottage as housing for assistants proved successful and the new commercial dishwasher proved a great asset. Mr. Paul Rossiteur again operated the bookstore donating the profits to Arrowmont. Housing continues to be inadequate requiring some off-campus housing. Four specialized workshops were held during the year. The rental of the Red Barn by many groups continues to be a good source of income. The summer session of 1975 represents the 30th consecutive one under the direction of Miss Marian Heard. She will retire within the next few years and a search committee has been established to seek her successor. With her excellent guidance the right person will be found. Caroline Riddle, Administrator, continues to serve in her efficient and innovative manner as reflected in her report in this ARROW issue. The annual Board of Governors meeting was held at Gatlinburg, October 3-6, 1974. As of the 1974 meeting full expenses for members of the Board will be paid by the Fraternity. Deep gratitude is hereby expressed to all who in the past paid their own expenses to attend meetings to help achieve the present success of Arrowmont and Arrow-craft. Arrowmont and Arrowcraft Awards were again given to clubs contributing the largest financial donation according to size category. The May L. Keller Award was given to the chapter presenting the best year round program regarding Arrowmont. Arrowmont -student lists by provinces will again be sent to APPs for use for clubs' programs. Their use is urged. A new Arrowmont slides series was made during the year and will be available from the APPs for the new club year 1975-76. A set of slides depicting the Arrowcraft operation is planned. The Betty Crocker coupon project had great response. The Chairman thanks everyone who sent coupons. The In Memoriam acknowledgements have been redesigned incorporating a sketch of Arrowmont done by a local artist. Sending a memorial gift to Arrowmont is a very thoughtful way in which to honor the memory of a deceased Pi Phi or her loved one. The International Ceramics Symposium will be held atArrowmont during September. This group represents out-standing potters from many foreign countries and it is a great honor for Arrowmont to host them. The members of the Little Pigeon Club, along with Arrowcraft employees of over ten years, were entertained for luncheon by the Board during their three day meeting. Following the luncheon the Watson House was dedicated. This little cottage housed the Watson family, two generations of Settlement School employees, for many years. It also housed the health center. The story of Settlement School, Arrowmont, and Arrow-craft has been beautifully printed in three parts and is now exhibited in the three glass enclosed cases on the sidewalk mall in front of our property on the Parkway. Many passers by stop and learn of Pi Phi's work in Gatlinburg. Arrowcraft employees continue to serve with great devotion. Arrowcraft has enjoyed a good year financially. The financial report of both Arrowmont and Arrowcraft are included in this issue of The ARROW. Additional space is desperately needed for both Arrowcraft shipping and storage departments. This will necessitate an enlargement for the present structure and is one of the goals of this Board. Potters wheels and looms were purchased during the year to abolish the need of borrowing them each summer from the University of Tennessee at considerable cost for transportation, plus the inconvenience. Additional ones as still needed. Plans for the Edythe Brack Photographic Studio, estal lished through the very generous gift of the Dallas Clu in 1974, are being prepared by Dr. Lauer of the Universii of Tennessee. Because of necessary structural changes, ac ditional funds were found to be needed and have been sul plied by the St. Louis Club with their most gracious gi of $9,190. When completed, it will be a great asset fc Arrowmont. In connection with the U.S. Bicentennial, an historic room is to be created in which will be exhibited Settlemei School memorabilia. It will be dedicated in the spring u 1976. Contact Caroline Riddle if you have anything of historical value to donate. Plans for the Arrowmont program for the 1975 Convention included an afternoon of craft demonstration by past Arrowmont students. A talk about Arrowmont was given by Sarah Ruth (Sis) Mullis, a member of the Board of Governors, with additional talks and comments by some of the participating craftspeople. The theme was "The Art of the Craftsman is the Bond between the Peoples of the World." One bond between Pi Phis is expressed in their support of both Arrowmont and Arrowcraft. Through the increased knowledge of each, the desire to strengthen that bond be-comes ever more greatly reflected in great pride in their philanthropies at Gatlinburg. The Chairman wishes to express her gratitude to the members of the Board of Governors, Grand Council, Central Office, and the Staff, of Arrowmont and Arrowcraft for their assistance and cooperation during the past year. HELEN DEPPE VOLLMAR ADMINISTRATOR OF ARROWMONT AND ARROWCRAFT Another busy summer is almost upon us. It seems most helps to make this report. If at any time there are con-fitting to take stock of progress over the past year. Since structive ideas or questions related to the Settlement School evaluating and reporting are aspects of management, it and its operation, I should be happy to hear of them. 33 iNoKaOi v To Win krrowcraft ys at Convention in Miami and Arrowcraft and Arrowmont in m on a Pi Phi high.

Type and make e of your own prices with your none number at the top. Raise he traffic will allow. We're here , not to give away Arrowcraft. Lrket and price accordingly. If it stores sell good pot holders Gerry Senner, Honolulu A.C. displays her club's well-earned award for being first in the nation for Arrow-craft gross sales, 1974-75. for $1, charge $1 for Pi Phi potholders. Ours are just as good, if not better. Keep a box of samples in your car, and if anyone asks, "what's in the box ?," show them. Having an item on hand means a quick sale. At least be able to show all four sizes of the purses and some representative colors. When you get checks from customers, write down the ae dress from the check to start a mailing list. Satisfied customers will brag to their friends. When you have a sale, display your items imaginatively. Set your dining table with mats, napkins, napkin rings, coasters, and hot pads. Use your own china and sterling to create a smashing impression. Be agreeable. If someone wants a black bag with purple knots, order it for them. After visiting the Arrowcraft shop and talking to our beautiful Faye and Nella and Ruby, we now understand what "warp" means. As long as the colors are available, if the warp is set up with the basic color, you can plug in any normally stocked color or knot. Satisfy your customers. If they want a long place mat, just ask Arrowcraft to make one. We recently ordered a Daisy mat 100 inches long to go down the center of a long table. The customer doesn't care what it costs, she's getting exactly what she wants. She'll have to wait, but you'll have that satisfied customer. Remember, "they" is you. Four years agowe wondered why they didn't make a coaster. So we asked and last year they sold 17,000 Hawaiian coasters. How about asking they to name something after your club? From now on Arrowcraft is the gift for out-going presidents (junk those silver trays give a revival bag), pledges, new initiates, for Panhellenic auctions, and Christmas bazaars. Create a Pi Phi Purse for a drawing at your meetings. Ours is a wine and blue junior tote. Inside is a roll of drawing tickets and a surprise gift. For 10 each or 3 for 25 you buy tickets and drop the stub in the tote with the money. At the end of the meeting draw the winning ticket. The lucky member gets the surprise gift, the Pi Phi purse to hold 'til the next meeting, and must replace the gift. The money goes to the treasury. If you regularly donate to a Christmas bazaar, make this year's contribution "Mrs. Santa's Purse." Take a red junior tote, fill with some tissue and on top place two green potholders, six red and white coasters, a white hot pad, and a cookbook. It makes an attractive, artistic donation for ally bazaar. Our Panhellenic has a meeting each fall when every alumnae club may bring its fund raising projects to show and tell. Take Arrow-craft. If your Panhellenic doesn't do this type of thing, suggest it, and get to that fantastic group of sorority women who will appreciate Arrowcraft. The most cost saving item of all DO NOT MAIL ANYTHING BACK. You are only paying postage twice and you don't have to sell it all before summer or before changing chair-persons. Keep it and have,an early sale at some-body's September bridge club to generate Christmas orders. If you end up with a real loser, hang in there it will sell eventually, or you can always put it in the Pi Phi Purse for a door prize. Create your own miracles. Aloha. Recipe Is Winner Jill Shiner Hayward of the Philadelphia Main Line Alumni Club picked up an extra $25 last spring when she submitted a winning recipe to the Pantry Planner, publication of a grocery chain. The recipe for Reuben Casserole appears on page 56 of the Arrowmont Cook-book. Jill submitted her recipe to the Consumer Panel and it was selected as a winner. ONE DEBENEDETTI SENNER Honolulu A.G. 34 Watch For Pi Phis In Old Williamsburg by SARA LEWIS, Virginia Gamma Last summer, if you vacationed in historic Colonial Williamsburg or visited the Old Country at Busch Gardens that just opened this year, you may have been greeted by a Virginia Gamma Pi Phi ! Because of the many employment opportunities offered by these two corporations, many of the Pi Phis at William and Mary found that it would be profitable to spend their summer in Williamsburg. In Colonial Williamsburg, Pi Phis Diane Hanretty and Sara Lewis worked as interpreters in 18th century shops along Duke of Gloucester Street in the restored area. In Busch Gardens Pi Phis Sandy Jeter, Melissa Locke, Pam Cutler, Vanessa Popa, Nancy Tienken, Sue Shank, Sue Hanna, and alum Sarah Talis worked at every kind of job from toy store clerk and bank teller to monorail and roller coaster operators. Every-one agrees it was a fun summer, especially those instances when another Pi Phi was discovered. One day at Busch Gardens, a Virginia Gamma met a lady who was a Golden Arrow Pi Phi, as she was boarding the "Eagle One" monorail. In Colonial Williamsburg, a Virginia Gamma noticed a Pi Phi ring that a visitor wore, as she was looking at the display of hand crafted silver. It makes Pi Phi take on more of a national meaning when you meet someone you've never seen before, from across the United States, who shares that same Pi Phi "specialness."

HELEN ANDERSON LEWIS Board of Governors Awards Committee AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE May 31. 1975 and 1974 ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Gatlinburg, Tennessee We have examined the statements of financial condition as of May 31, 1975 and 1974 and the related statements of revenues and expenditures and changes in fund balances for the years then ended of the following funds of Pi Beta ?hi Settlement School (a division of Pi Beta Phi Fra-:ernity): Current Funds Endowment Funds Invested in Plant Special Fund-Wisconsin Alpha Trust )ur examinations were made in accordance with gently accepted auditing standards and, accordingly, inded such tests of the accounting records and such other citing procedures as we considered necessary in the cirnstances. is discussed in Note D to the financial statements, the :clement School has received notice of income tax deiencies from the Internal Revenue Service for years ided May 31, 1961 through May 31, 1968. The Internal evenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop is of related to the tax exempt purposes of Settlement school and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree and plans to pursue the matter in court. No provision has been made in the financial statements for any liability that may result. In our opinion, subject to the effects, if any, on the financial statements of the ultimate resolution of the mat-ter discussed in the preceding paragraph, the financial statements referred to above present fairly the financial position of the funds (as described above) of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at May 31, 1975 and 1974, and the results of their operations and changes in fund balances for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Years Ended May 31, 1975 and 1974 NOTE A Significant Accounting Policies The accounts of the Settlement School are maintained on a fund basis of accounting appropriate to not-for-profit organizations. The current funds are used to account for transactions related to the instructional programs of the School and the auxiliary activities which provide services to the students, faculty and public. The Endowment Funds are used to account for gifts which allow only the income thereon to be expended. The Invested In Plant Fund contains the transactions relating to investment in property and equipment. The Special Fund is described in Note C. The format of the financial statements displaying these funds is presented in a manner which is appropriate for colleges and universities. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for colleges and universities. no prviosion has been made for depreciation of buildings and equigment. THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Certain expenses paid from other funds of Pi Beta Phi are allocable to Settlement School and are included as income and expenses in these financial statements. NoTE B Due to Pi Beta Phi Grand Treasurer Advances to Settlement School were made as a loan for the purpose of paying a portion of the construction costs of a classroom building to be known as Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. The loan hears interest at 5% due annually. Subsequent to year end, a payment of $19,675 was expended on this loan and a repayment schedule adopted for the remaining $250,000 which calls for $25.000 payments plus interest annually beginning July, 1976 until loan is fully paid. NOTE C Wisconsin Alpha Trust The Wisconsin Alpha Trust agreement dated December 5, 1972, provides that Arrowmont School Division of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School hold certain properties in trust and distribute income from those properties in the following manner. At the end of the first year, 80% of the net income was paid to the Elvehjem Art Center and 20% to Arrowmont. In subsequent years, 80% of the net income is being paid to Arrowmont and 20% used for purposes of continuing education of Pi Beta Phi alumnae. Assets of the Trust at May 31, 1975 and 1974, consisted of a $233 savings account and $142,000 of 7.35% Federal Farm Loan Bonds. The initial term of the Trust is for five years and one month. Four additional periods of five years each may be extended by Wisconsin Alpha. The trust agreement provides that all assets he fully paid over to Wisconsin Alpha or its successor immediately upon establishment of an undergraduate chap-ter of Pi Beta Phi on the campus of the University of Wisconsin. Madison, Wisconsin. NoTE D--Contingent Liability The Settlement School has received a notice of income tax deficiencies from the Internal Revenue Service for years ended May 31, 1961 through May 31, which amounted to approximately $60,000, including penalties. The Internal Revenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop income is not related to the tax exempt purpose of Settlement School and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree with this position and plans to pursue the matter in court. A court hearing is scheduled for October, 1975 relating to this matter, the out-come of which cannot be determined at this time and no provision has been made for any liability in connection with this matter. In the past year, this committee has happily achieved its six objectives: to prepare a definitive application form, to prepare an article for The ARROW, to issue a newsletter to each club, to send applications to all interested members, to evaluate the applications returned, and finally to select the winners. 'Considerable mail has crossed each of our desks as all decisions were being made by letter. By April 30, the winners were selected. These were announced at Convention. The other applicants were notified by letter of the results. The committee read with great care the applications and the recommendations. Each member kept in mind our two major criteria: need and goal. After careful delibera Thanks to the continued support of Pi Phis in both Canada and the United States, the library systems in Canada's vast northland have once again been able to under-take innovative programs with money donated through our "Arrow in the Arctic" project. In 1974, the library systems of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory each received $450 from the project. Both intend to use the money for audio equipment. The Northwest Territories will purchase stereo cassette equipment and tapes to start a basic collection of northern material such as legends, music, and reminiscences geared primarily for the young people. The Yukon has ordered two stereo record players for use in outlying branch libraries where there has been no opportunity for the people to listen to recorded material. Pi Phi money is the only money these libraries receive outside of their government allotment.tion Katherine Elbirg and Jane Bradbury were selected for the coming year to receive continuing education scholarships. The committee of Polly Hackett Burns, Illinois Eta; Lindsey Farnham Siegfried, Ohio Beta; and this chairman, Alberta Alpha, sincerely hope that more alumnR will avail themselves of this scholarship opportunity in the coming year. Seeing the first full cycle of the ACCE completed with the two winners being announced at Convention has proved a most fulfilling experience. Each committee member felt the excitement and the responsibility of being involved in this new worthwhile project for Pi Beta Phi. AILEEN AYLSWORTH WELGAN The librarians are grateful for our donations which en-able them to start projects for which no other funds are available. "Arrow in the Arctic" is the current on-going project of the Canadian Philanthropies Committee. The loan funds for social work students at nine Canadian universities which was the previous project are still of concern to the committee. The funds, though self-supporting and ad-ministered by the universities, are currently under study to see if the money could be used more effectively in other ways. We are grateful for the support of the many chapters and clubs who contributed to "Arrow in the Arctic" making it possible for the libraries in the Canadian north to preserve the culture of her native people and to bring the outside world to the isolated outposts. CAROL CHILDERHOSE MCGONIGAL CANADIAN PHILANTHROPIES COMMITTEE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Although the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds project is now twenty-nine years old, a surprising number of members seem in doubt about its purposes and scope. It was established by vote of the 1946 Convention when $50,000 were set aside from general Fraternity funds to launch a new project, to be named in honor of Emma Harper Turner, former Grand President, Grand Vice President, and organizer of the alumna; department. The principal of the Fund has been augmented each year largely by contributions from alumnae clubs, but also from chapters and individual members. This project has dual purposes and it benefits both active chapters and individual alumnm. The entire principal is used for loans to chapters for building and re-modeling purposes. Older chapter houses need to be periodically renovated, repaired, and enlarged; new houses must be built. This very vital part of this project is ad-ministered by the National Board of Trustee Funds. The interest which chapters pay on these loans is put into a special fund which is used for gifts to alumnae who are in special need of assistance. Through various scholarships, the Loan Fund and the Fellowships have been set up to aid collegiate members; this has been the only project which aided alumnm. These grants to alumnm are processed by the Emma Harper Memorial Funds Commit-tee which consists of three alumnm appointed by Grand Council. Every grant must have the unanimous vote of this committee and must be approved by the Grand Vice President of Philanthropies. Grants to alumnae are of two types: (1) emergenccy grants, usually given in one check and not often giver more than once. This type of grant is usually, thougl not always, given to younger alumnm facing tragic emer gencies; (2) monthly grants, which are usually given to older alumnm. Most of these less fortunate alumnm have a slender income which covers the bare necessities, but with nothing left for the unexpected, the extras, the small things which add to comfort. One alumna expressed it well when she wrote, "My monthly check from the Fraternity makes the difference for me from merely existing to living with a little dignity." During the past year eight alumnR received monthly checks, ranging from $25 to $50. One young alumna, tragically stricken, was given an emergency grant of $500.00, the maximum allowed for any one year. Six of the alumnE currently receiving monthly grants are Golden Arrows. All are past eighty years old; the oldest is eighty-seven., Three are in nursing homes, bedfast. One is hos pitalized, seriously ill. Every recipient is grateful for her "gift of love" from Pi Beta Phi. They invariably seem surprised when they learn that the Fraternity still cares about them in their loneliness and old age and wants to lighten their burdens. Over the years many have written that the lift to their hearts and their spirits meant almost more than the some-times desperately needed financial assistance. This year for the first time small checks were sent at Christmas time to four alumnm who were in need of spe 39 onor Initiate is Gatlinburg Link by LINDA LANE JOHNSON Charlottesville A.C. The initiation of Edna McCarter McFall provides Pi Phi with a rare personal link to Gatlinburg. From birth, Mrs. McFall's life was shaped by her association with Pi Beta Phi and the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, not as a member of the Fraternity but as one of the school's first and finest students. Mrs. McFall became an honorary initiate at the University of Virginia in April when Virginia Epsilon was installed.. She had been recommended to, the Charlottesville Alumni Club by the Richmond Club and was enthusiastically approved. Soon after, she was visited in her home near Richmond by Ruth Williams Hansen .and Micki Leef Stout, and she was overwhelmed. She had never dreamed that she would be a Pi Phi, an "insider" at last to that sisterhood that had so shaped her life. Mrs. McFall was born about the same time Pi Phi chose her home town of Gatlinburg as the site for their Settlement School. The Mc-Carter's lived next door to the school, and Edna attended both grade and high school there. In fact, her entire family of five sisters and four brothers attended, and her mother worked for the craft shop. When Edna was 14, she talked her way into the first weaving class offered by the school. Weaving was fast becoming a lost art, and Pi Phi had hopes of reviving that art. Edna soon became their means of publicizing weaving. As the finest weaver in the school and the top student in her class, she was invited to weave material for a dress and coat for Mrs. Grace Coolidge, wife of the President and herself a Pi Phi. The outfit was presented to Mrs. Coolidge at the 1924 Eastern Conference of Pi Beta Phi. Ironically, that conference was held April 11-12, fifty years ago to the day that Mrs. McFall became a Pi Phi. Her training as a weaver opened doors for Edna McCarter all over the United States. She attended the Minnesota State Fair and the Boston Gardens to demonstrate weaving, and she demonstrated her skills at other exhibitions closer to Gatlinburg. Virginia Epsilon's. honor initiates are, from the left, Pam Paramore Chamberlain, Edna McCarter McFall, and Roberta Sibold Hunt During World War II, Edna served in France for three years and then returned to marry her sweetheart of 17 years. They established their home in Powhatan County. outside of Richmond. For the past 15 years, Mrs. McFall was director of handicraft at the Virginia Correctional Center for Women, once again using skills acquired from her early training in weaving. This time she taught weaving not only as art but as therapy for the incarcerated women. On Friday, April 11, Edna McCarter McFall was pledged to Pi Phi with two other honorary initiates, and she attended her first Cooky-Shine. The next day she was initiated, and at the banquet was seated at the head table. She was introduced to the 75 Pi Phis as their "link to Gatlinburg" and responded in a moving speech, "I never cease to be thankful for what you, Pi Beta Phi, have done for me. I am a product of that school, an example of what you did for those people in that remote area of the country. I thank you from a loving heart." How proud we are to have initiated her into Pi Phi.
