        7ewe FROM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by Louise Wheelock Dobler, Washington Beta "SUMMER WORKSHOP"! Do you know what it is, where it is, and why? Do you know that for !n years it has been the "open sesame" for Ireds of men and women in search of knowland training in Arts and Crafts ? Do you know although it is another Pi Beta Phi success in .eering, that it is open to everyone? . . . that the of is planned for those who want to learn "just fun" as well as for those who must learn to e a livelihood, earn college credit, or assist in tal or physical re-habilitation ? But perhaps you would prefer to hear, first-hand, from some of the students who have been enchanted by the Craft Workshop in the Smokies. In the sessions for the summer of 1955 there were six active Pi Phis included in the largest enrollment to date an enrollment that brought students from 27 states, from Canada, and from Lebanon; and taxed to the limit, our capacity to house students. Three of those Pi Phis served as graduate assistants. One of them, Mary Jean Stoddard of Iowa Gamma, writes from her experience of two years at Workshop: PI PHIS IN ATTENDANCE AT THE 1955 SUMMER WORKSHOP 'ding, left to right: Mary Jean Stoddard, Iowa Gamma; Sally Johnson, Iowa Gamma; Jane Bass Culpepper, New York ha. led, left to right: Janet Kirk, Washington Beta; Hannah Norwood, New York Delta; Janet Inman, California Delta; na Oliver, Washington Alpha. 158 THE ARROW OF Pi BETA PHI "I am so happy to give information about Summer Workshop at Gatlinburg. I have been there for the past two summers, and I can't understand why more Pi Phis don't attend! One of the questions I am asked most often is, "Can people other than Pi Phis go ?" And yet, most of the people are not Pi Phis! "The first summer I went just as a student because I am an Applied Arts Major and a Pi Phi. With such a combination, I thought I should not pass up an opportunity like this! I found that Gatlinburg was worth far more than just an opportunity to me. The twelve college credits I earned are minor in relationship to my other experiences. For instance, just this last summer Grand Council, Settlement School Committee, and all the Province Officers met in Gatlinburg during the month of June. We had several opportunities to meet and to get to know these women. One night Grand Council invited all the Pi Phis in Workshop to dinner at the Inn. We also met them at a tea in the Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House, at luncheons, and as they toured the Workshop. Now I feel as if they are my personal friends not just names in the front of the ARROW, and I will always cherish these friendships. "During the two summers I was there, I got to know and to understand the workings of the Settlement School itself. It's good to know the people who manage it. We even took a field trip to the homes of some of the weavers who make the lovely things that are sold at Settlement School teas. We saw Mary Owenby, the woman who weaves the beautiful stoles. Her log house is on top of a hill. There are pegs in the posts of her front porch which she uses as her warping frame. Her loom is over 100 years old, and she has been weaving for Pi Phi for more than twenty-five years. "Workshop was all I could ask it to be. The atmosphere was very casual. We learned to know our teachers each an excellent craftsman in his or her own right not only in classes, but also as friends. We ate and talked with them. The Labs were open from 8-12, 1-5, and 7-9. Whenever there was no scheduled labs in the classroom we could go in and work. And everyone went in and worked! As a graduate assistant last summer, the hardest thing I had to do was to "shoo" people out of the labs at closing time! And in the free time the instructors were there the labs ready to help not because of any-thing in their contract, but because they wanted to be helpful. The general atmosphere was wonderful. As Graduate Assistants we went to Gatlinburg a few days early and helped to organize the labs. During the school term we kept charge of the `Office,' opened the labs at night, and did other jobs that would lighten the burden for the staff . For this we received room and board, had time to take one three-hour course and were paid $125." Another interesting first-hand report comes from Ileana Oliver, an active from the University of Washington in Seattle, who was enrolled ju student. Of her experience she says, "My major at the University is textiles, cl and art. Since crafts are my main interest, I wa to attend the Workshop in Gatlinburg and to my time exclusively to pottery and weaving had a background in those two crafts. It was a: hoped for, as we had little reading and stud: do since we devoted every moment possible craft. The enthusiasm and interest everyone her work was an inspiration and a challenge There were no loafers, and we all had fun we enjoyed our work. "Of course I think our inspiring teacher the secret to our unwavering interest. Empha placed on our creativeness and design. In w Miss Redding assigned each of us to find a a rock, or any object of nature with coloring we would plan a warp in the same colors an proportions as they were distributed in the Sara Young, my pottery instructor, emphasize( our imagination in making ceramics, as I und other instructors did in the classes for meta] jewelry, design, and enameling. It wasn't try to think up something entirely origin at least we were taught not to copy someon work. "There was a warm, friendly, informal atm( in the school, and to be comfortable in the 'c% dress was very casual. All the young girls wor( and blouses most of the time, while the older wore cotton dresses. The friendly feeling school made it easy to become acquainted, seemed to be interested to find in what w differed from one another comparing accer figures of speech were immediate topics c versation. In the evenings we had happy, ark times hilarious times, in the "dorm" and N about the "burg" buying candy at any of the candy kitchens, or just watching the tourists of whom were honeymooners, and having i or other cool soft drinks at the `Copper Still "Our trips to the workshops in the area, the homes of the hill people where articles t sold by Arrowcraft are made, gave me a better standing and appreciation of the altruistic v our fraternity and the skill and simplicity o people. "My Tennessee summer was one of the fit cations I will ever hope to have. It offere( chance to see another beautiful section of or country, at the same time giving me a chance i at crafts with interesting girls and women fro] parts of the United States and foreign cour wove eight yards of woolen material and rr pieces of pottery ; and every time I wear the made from this material, or look at the potte shelf in my room, I thank Pi Beta Phi for pr such a wonderful spot for advancement throe and work in arts and crafts." FIRST FOREIGN CRAFT STUDY TOUR .,.J/'ttge Sttcce6J * ON JULY 20, 1955 the first Foreign Craft Study Tour, jointly sponsored by the University of Tennessee and Pi Beta Phi, left for Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, France and England with Miss Viarian Heard as the instructor. Miss Heard, Profes-;or of Craft Design at U.T., Director of the Summer :raft Workshop, and a Pi Beta Phi, in the following Irtide reports to the fraternity on the successful venture. "Little did I think that the University of Tenaessee Pi Beta Phi Foreign Craft Study Tour would De a reality so soon just one year after I told you Df my dream at the Miami Convention. What a wonderful dream come true, thanks to Mrs. Virginia Green and Dean Jessie W. Harris, two people who :an put the wheels of progress into action in a mighty big hurry. "I had twenty-four people with me, we had planned on a group of twenty but the last four to apply wished so much to go, we gave in. They came from fourteen different states: New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Arkansas, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. The group came from varied professions elementary school teachers, high school teachers, college teachers, occupational therapist, child guidance specialist, business woman, teachers of crafts in mountain settlement schools, teachers of arts and crafts in adult classes and a manager of a very fine gift shop. We thought the husband of the latter was courageous to want her to go leaving three children, the youngest of which was three years. Our range of ages was from two university co-eds to one person over sixty. The fact that we came from different parts of the country, that we had a wide age range and that our art and craft experiences were in different areas, all added to the interest of the group. We traveled by plane, boat, train and bus; also let me add we discovered the lost art of walking! Some were a bit timid of the flying, but the weather was kind to us or the navigator was wise ; we never did get a good scarey bump. All came back confirmed believers in plane travel. We saw well-known craftsmen at work, visited famous schools, museums, and craft factories, and studied craft organizations of each country. We had the opportunity of seeing one international exhibit Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Tour of Europe. 160 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI held only once every twenty-five years. We did plenty of just-for-fun sight seeing in London and Paris. We observed how the people lived; we visited homes; we ate too much of the wonderful but fattening Scandinavian food. People seemed to go out of their way to be helpful to us ; they were so eager that we get a good impression of their countries. I was very proud of our study group ; they were so thoughtful and interested. The guides would tell me how kind, considerate and attentive a group we were and that it was a pleasure to be with us. The owner of our hotel in Paris got up to eat breakfast with us at 5:30 the morning we left for the States. Our guide told me he had never seen that before! We got back without one small accident, without one bag or passport lost, without any lessening of the enthusiasm of the group. We are now all showered with requests to make speeches about the tour. I guess they all feel as I do: we had such a rich experience, we want to share it with others. Now we all want to go again. A new world was opened up to twenty-five people, thanks to the University of Tennessee Pi Beta Phi Foreign Craft Study Tour." We are glad to announce at this early date that those who missed this first Craft Study Tour may look forward to a second one in 1957 when the University and Pi Beta Phi will again unite in the pro-motion of such a project.
