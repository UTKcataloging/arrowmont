Committee gporb CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn." Pi Beta Phi has proven the truth of this statement. Back in 1912 the fraternity was awakened to the opportunity for service in an isolated section of the Smoky Mountains and through the Settlement School, during the following years, has been able to give impetus to the dawning of a new day for that area. The organization has had the rare privilege of helping to build a town! In the 44 years of Settlement School, over 16,000 days have dawned but this report is concerned with the last 366 days. How has the Settlement School Committee, working on behalf of Pi Phi, met the challenge of these days? Through Education After a careful check with the County Superintendent of Education as well as the local chairman of the Board of Education, it was decided that it would be an injustice to the school children if Pi Phi were to discontinue the practice of furnishing teachers for Music, Arts and Crafts, Woodworking, Physical Education and Journalism. Pi Phi first went to Gatlinburg with the desire to offer educational opportunities and the first school grew to a fully accredited school system including four years of high school. Ever since 1943, the County has supplied the minimum basic educational requirements but with such a meager curriculum, there continues to be a real need for the extra Pi Phi teachers. Nancy Jo Hayes, the Assistant to the Director, taught the Journalism Class which published the school paper, The Highland Echo. For the third year the paper was awarded a "Superior" rating and was the only school in East Tennessee in the mimeographed class to achieve this honor. The paper also won a "Second Class Honor Rating" from the National Scholastic Press Association. Nancy Jo wrote the syllabus for the Journalism Course which resulted in its approval by the State Department of Education for Business as well as English credit. Working as co-sponsor of the Student Council, she saw many worth-while projects originate such as Clean-up Campaign, Smoking Rules, Student Elections and Field Day. Nancy Jo also served as secretary of the P.T.A. Marion Mueller, the Director, also had a place on the board of the P.T.A. and led a study course. At various times Mrs. Mueller has been asked for suggestions for possible teachers and last year it was fortunate that Sabra Hansen, just graduated from DePauw, was secured as English teacher. It is hoped that any Pi Phi interested in teaching at Gatlinburg will make it known. The Physical Education teacher, furnished by the Fraternity, made a valuable contribution through the promotion of sports. In a community where early marriages and the desire to start earning are common, the chance to participate in football and basketball has served to maintain interest in finishing school. A junior Varsity in both foot-ball and basketball was added this year and that gave twice as many people a chance to compete. Pi Beta Phi (for that is what the school is popularly called) also won a county tournament which was a first. The new County gym was a wonderful addition for the Pi Phi auditorium never was built to house a modern athletic department. Boys and girls living too far to commute, lived in the dormitories. This again opened a new day for the experience in group living and working offered an extra dividend in addition to the privilege of completing a high school education. Mrs. Mueller and her assistant supervised a study table which helped the dorm children keep up their grades. Early in the school year, the girls elected dormofficers and held meetings throughout the year. The Con mittee offered small cash Dorm Awards based on grade, activities and contribution to dormitory life. This er couraged pride in work and a good spirit both in schot and the dorm. Before school ended former dormitory sti dents brought their children to seek a place in the data next year. Education covers a lot of ground but doesn always cultivate it. In the dormitory program, Pi Phi di some extra cultivation through the supervised work i kitchen, dining room and grounds. The training prepare the young people to take summer jobs or, at least, to 1 better future homemakers. Not only did the buildings house elementary and hig school but as in previous years, when school was di: missed, Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee unite to bring instruction on the college level to Gatlinburg Under the direction of Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamin the Summer Craft Workshop was held for the twelfth yea: As usual the work and enthusiasm of those who came froi all over the country were an inspiration to both staff an Committee. Teachers, therapists, workers in youth organ nation and with the handicapped, as well as those inter ested in creative use of leisure time, returned home bett( prepared to face the days to come with increased skill an zeal. Only a few years ago, the Ruth Barrett Smith Sta House made it possible, with its enlarged lodging an dining-room facilities, to accept more Workshop student Once again in 1955 the Director was pressed to find spa( for those who wished to register. It was difficult to refu! students when the instructors could care for them in clas Tourist rates in surrounding accommodations were pp hibitive for most. The Committee was challenged to me the housing problem. The Graham legacy, which had bet kept for a special use, provided finances with which convert the old kitchen and porch at Pollard Cottage additional, inviting living quarters for 1956 Worksho The problem of housing still is only partially solve When the Workshop was started twelve years ago, the Phi white grade school building, as a temporary means caring for students at low cost, was converted into, a doff itory and then back into school rooms. This practice h continued through the years at a waste of man-power ar money which could be used for more comfortable, perm vent facilities. Craft Workshops have demonstrated tl tremendous effectiveness of such in meeting some of tl urgent needs of modern life. Past experience should be guidepost rather than a hitching post. Progress begi: with the getting a clear view of the obstacles. Also it wise economy to make the best use of what one has. N P Settlement School has the uninhabited red barn strategical located near the staff house dining-room. The barn 1 longer shelters the cows and mules of days gone by; hoi ever it could have a useful future as a dormitory. In November plans were discussed with the Universi of Tennessee and for the second time Pi Beta Phi and t] University will promote a Foreign Study Craft Tour. Ti first one in 1955 was most successful. If interested in d tails about the 1957 Tour, write to Foreign Study Cis Tour, College of Home Economics, University of Tenn( see, Knoxville. Through Health Services "THANK YOU, WIZ CHARMER' " was the headi: of an article in the Gatlinburg Press in December f twenty years ago on December 1, Mrs. Marjorie Chaim( came to the Burg to serve as the resident nurse for t fraternity. 51 52 THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI "Miz Charmer," as the Pi Beta Phi grade children refer to her, has donated generously of her time and efforts not only in the schools in this area but also in many civic projects. It would be difficult to list the numerous activities in which she is engaged. No doubt her twenty years in Gatlinburg have included labor, joys, sorrow, however that indomitable spirit holds forth. For the many years of fruitful service, thank you "Miz Charmer." We bask in reflected glory! Some 7,300 days have dawned at Settlement School for Nurse Marjorie and each have brought new problems, new solutions and em-phases. This last year can best be reported by quoting from the annual report of the Nurse. "The scope of activities for the Pi Beta Phi Health Center has broadened during the past year to include a more extended service to the community. Chief of these added responsibilities was the allotment to us of the Salk vaccine on the same basis as their own units. Response has been gratifying 89% have had one inoculation and 80% have had two. The preschool children are steadily seeking the protection. Our percentage is much higher than the rest of the County. "Another innovation has been the use of the state loaned audiometers for the testing of student hearing. This was done at a clinic set up at the Health Center and pupils were brought in by parents. The Pi Beta Phi and five rural schools were tested. "The Corrective Fund provided for eye examinations for more than a dozen children and glasses were purchased for six. The Lions Club paid for five more in addition to some bought by parents, The Elks Club paid for seven pairs of shoes and the loan closet supplied large amounts of clothing for children and adults. "The Preschool Round-up was held in July with the assistance of Dr. Shilling and half a dozen P.T.A. members. Conferences were held with most of the parents. After school started a clinic for all boys reporting for football was set up. Dr. Shilling gave each the regulation army physical. With the new supply of vaccine, public health nurses were permitted to give the inoculations and consequently since that time inoculations were given at Health Center without imposing on the busy doctors. "The schools weathered several minor epidemics: flu, three day measles, and pink eye. One seventh grade girl had a light case of polio. The Friday Baby Clinic has in-creased weekly. The preventive inoculations were given each student in the four schools as always. Health talks and picture shows were given. There were many conferences with teachers and parents. We have co-operated with the County Welfare Department, Red Cross and Shriners. We have recently been appointed on the Board for Charitable Solicitations. The County Medical Association continues to hold mothly meetings at Health Center for which we are grateful. Such contacts with doctors of the County and State keeps us in constant touch with the newest in medical education. It keeps the doctors in touch, too, with the services given by Pi Beta Phi. The year has been a heavy one but there is a deeper feeling of accomplishment than for any other year. The spirit of appreciation shown by the community and the co-operation we have received assures us that Pi Beta Phi still holds an honored place in the area and is upholding the ideals of the Fraternity established a quarter of a century ago."

Thanks to the energetic, philanthropic alumni, 85 weavers and other craftsmen brought their handcrafts to Arrowcraft with confidence. Elizabeth Rue, Manager, and Tina McMorran, Designer and Weaving Supervisor, with the loyal staff worked happily with the local craftsmen and the far-away alumna clubs. Tina designed special articles for Convention. The new Guild Shop at Rich's asked her to design a panel for the keynote color in their big front window. Several publications have featured her work. Again plans were made to co-operate at the Craftsman's Fair. Betty Lewelling, bookkeeper, resigned, but our disappointment in losing her was tempered with the pleasure of welcoming back Eunice Cole to this position which she so efficiently handled previously. It was deemed wise to discontinue the 2% discount for prompt payment of bills since confusion on the part of a number of chairmen added additional work for the bookkeeper and many times resulted in misunderstanding. After all it is not necessary to reward Pi Phis for paying their honest debts especially when the money supports the national project. One of the best things to do behind a person's back is to pat it. There are 22 Settlement School chairmen whose industry resulted in their club buying and PAYING for $1,000 or more of Arrowcraft products in the 1955-56 year. Those deserving a pat are Northern New jersey $3125.57 Coos County $1405.45 Pittsburgh 2912.95 Milwaukee 1346.98 Champaign-Urbana 2592.30 Seattle 1321.07 Cleveland 2314.06 Lubbock 1144.97 Fort Worth 2146.59 Southwestern Michigan 1140.26 South Bend 2060.08 North Shore, Ill 1138.60 Dallas 1877.25 Oklahoma City 1111.05 Houston 1817.19 Everett, Wash 1096.05 Lincoln 1768.97 Marin County, Calif. 1077.94 San Jose 1574.00 Sacramento 1050.00 Portland, Oregon 1562.01 Kansas City, Mo 1007.92 May their tribe increase! Because Arrowcraft has bills to meet promptly, it has been decided to send quarterly statements to all clubs in hopes that they will make payments throughout the year rather than to wait until May 31. With the loyal co-operation of the membership, Arrow-craft Shop can continue to encourage home industries and to help the people improve their economic situation. Through Staff Marion Mueller, the Director, had a busy year supervising the buildings, staff and program besides representing Pi Beta Phi in Gatlinburg. As she said, when asked what the Director does, "If there is something to do and no one to do it, I do it." Through her diligence and the co-operation of both school principal and chairman of the board, the Pi Phi buildings, used by the County, are in much better condition this year. Fresh paint and repairs have made a great improvement. Her two-year program of renovation of the other buildings shows up in many places. Aided and abetted by Orlie Watson and his son, Neal, Marion has worked hard to make the fraternity proud of its Settlement School. There is a desperate bunt to find a new assistant to the Director for in early June Nancy Jo Hayes became Mrs. Henry. While we do not promise anything, two out of the last three assistants found their future husbands while at Settlement School. Persons interested in rendering service at Settlement School, should contact the chairman. Through the Members Money doesn't talk these days it goes without saying and it was only because of the support of active chapters and alumni clubs that the Committee could meet the demands of the last year. There were 257 clubs that contributed $8,461.73 of which $760 was for staff house furnishings. This was 15 more clubs than last year and an SUMMARY OF WORK THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI increase of $102.66. There were 9 Provinces which were i00% in support of Settlement School. They were Iota Mu Lambda Xi Kappa Pi The following nine clubs contributed $150 or more. Those marked (C) gave extra gifts to Staff House in addition to the annual gift. St. Louis $800.00 Indianapolis 210.00 Northern New Jersey 450.00. Milwaukee 200.00 Champaign-Urbana .. 300.00* Cleveland, East 172.00 Colorado Springs ... 275.00* Denver 150.22 Philadelphia 250.00 The Staff House was also remembered by gifts from the Province Officers, Guy J. Chaffee in memory of his wife, and the Chicago South Club. Many individuals and clubs sent Christmas gifts to Settlement School and the Health Center, A lovely surprise in the form of a silver coffee urn came from Pasadena Club. The staff was very appreciative of the television set given by the late Charlotte Alspaugh. Individuals sent contributions to the Memorial Fund in memory of friends instead of the usual flowers. These should be sent to the Settlement School treasurer. From 98 chapters came $2,376.21 which was an in-crease of $177.66 and an additional 11 chapters participating. There were 12 Provinces 100% in support of the project. Alpha Epsilon Mu Beta Theta Nu Gamma Lambda Xi Zeta Kappa Pi Three chapters gave $100 or more for the annual gift. Texas I' $150 Missouri B ....$125 Texas A $100 These contributions were augmented by $9,108.59 from the magazine agency. Elsewhere will appear a report where due credit will be given to hard-working chairmen but an expression of gratitude here is not out of place. The extra $1,130.28 was needed. With assistance from the Arrow-craft profits and a few other small sums, the above funds had to pay staff, insurance, maintenance, repairs and utilities just to mention a few of the large items. The ping Turtle, a power mower, was a necessity this y( Success can be due to will power especially if wil] some generous Pi Phi. The thoughtfulness of two P. who left legacies to the Settlement School, has nu possible for the Committee to meet several unusui mands on the purse. As mentioned before, the Gi legacy supplied funds for the greater part of the P renovations. Since the work was done in the late ) during the dull season, the money went farther. Seta School started in May to hook on to the new sewer sewer system is a long-awaited improvement in Gatli but will be a drain on the pocket-book for some tii come. Most of the installation cost will be covered legacy of Ethel Curryer, a former treasurer of Settl( School. What a blessing these gifts have been! The me payments on the sewer are 85% to 135% of the bill. This leads us to hope many groups will rethink allocation of funds from their earnings. Since the first of the year, three legacies have be( ported to Settlement School. Charlotte Alspaugh's gif be used for scholarships according to her request. Brendel's and Mrs. Hempsted's bequests, when reo will be kept for some special need. Mrs. Brendel ws mother of Pi Phi Eleanor Miller of Indianapolis. Many alumnae will remember the wonderful Cook published by the Los Angeles Club twenty years a4 has been voted to print a new one and the goal is to 5 choice recipes submitted from each club. Advertising be sold to cover the original cost and the co-operati clubs is solicited. The book will sell at a popular pric it is hoped that it can be ready by next fall. This s be an additional source of funds for the Settlement S( At Convention, it will be my pleasure to tell some of the people who have benefited from Pi Beta efforts and about the town which grew with the Seta School as well as the people who still live up the mountain roads. There are several challenging fiel endeavor which need attention and would mean a deal to the mountain people. "Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn." VIRGINIA BRACKETT GREEN, Chair?, Alpha Eta Zeta SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT Our Settlement School moves on toward its goal and the ideal of its Founders. Almost forty-five years of growth but with many changes. Our problem is to meet these changes wisely as they arise. We trust that we shall be guided in the right path toward Tomorrowland. Many Pi Phis and friends have visited us within the last year. It is my wish that I could take each Pi Phi on a personal tour, because if one is not aware of the Burg's mushroom growth in the last ten years, one might wonder about our Settlement School. Gatlinburg with its approximate two thousand population is S-0 B-I-G, yet so s-m-a-l-1 in many ways. The Burg is still growing up not so much in population as in ways of doing things. Yes, growing to the extent that it can be classified both as a tourist and a convention town. The new city hall with its large auditorium (sponsored by the American Legion), skylift, motels (many with swimming pools), numerous restaurants, two new pageants all contribute toward a BIG Impression. The Great Smoky Mountains Historical Association, Inc., is sponsoring Chucky jack, the pageant which is based on the Founding of the State of Tennessee. Incidentally, I have had the privilege of serving on the Honorary Advisory Council for this project. It is not surprising that so many come to the area with the national interest shown in many ways many articles in various publications, one of the most recent in June is-sue of Holiday Magazine. Tourists come to see the beautyof these horizons. Gatlinburg must provide facilitit tourists before they enter the Smoky National Paid cause there are only camping facilities in the park. With all this I sincerely believe our area is best lc for its handcrafts unquestionably pioneered by Pi Phi. There are still many natives who depend upon part of the Settlement School program because the not a part of these newer enterprises; contrarily, s native families are the leading citizens who in turn ea other natives. Arrowcraft The love for crafts is inborn with many. More sixty weavers each month bring their weaving for A craft to buy. Weavers are specialists not everyon weave; some weave wool only, some linen only, cotton. Many are dependent upon Arrowcraft, this undeniably being their biggest outlet for their cr woodcraft, basketry, brooms, jewelry making. We folks here at Settlement School realize and are grateful for the loyalty and volunteer service o Alumnae Clubs in the promotion of their Arrowcraft Elizabeth Rue, manager of Arrowcraft, and I wool, to thank you individually. At Pi Phi Convention oh( izes the national scope of our work; likewise at Settl School where Pi Phis come from every state. 54 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Health Center Our Health Center is next door to Arrowcraft on the main street of Gatlinburg. Our nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, has seen many changes during her twenty years with Settlement School, yet our Health Center has a valuable and varied service to the community. More than half of the students at Pi Beta Phi School are from the rural and suburban area. Tennessee provides the vaccines. All of the extra services of the state are also given to us among them Dental Clinics, Nutritional Clinics, Chest x-ray, Audiometers. For extra services at the Health Center or in the home, Health Center makes a small charge, the people paying as they can. Marjorie's calendar is filled with field visits, office calls, first aid, inoculations, health talks, conferences, chest x-rays, and clinics. At Christmas individual gifts are given to the children from the three County schools for which Marjorie gives services. The many boxes of clothing and Christmas presents from Alumni Clubs and Active Chapters are most welcome and helpful. When one sees the meagerness of these schools, one cannot keep from wishing we could share a bit more. In every way East Tennessee ranks low in its education system, a fact which is forgotten by many when they see the bright lights of Gatlinburg's main street. Dormitories Our dormitories are a vital part of our program, thus making far-reaching results. In the years I have been at Settlement School, several instances could be sighted where assistance was needed and provided. I might add, deeply appreciated in most instances. This system, established a number of years ago, is not to "hand out" but to help others help themselves. All our dormitory children live considerable distances from the bus line, or have some unusual problem which makes it necessary to "live in." This last school year there were many honors won by our dormitory children: Pat Trentham vice-president of the Senior class; Clyde Davenport annual editor and lead in Senior play; Kate Wright, captain-elect of Girls' Basket-ball Team; Dwight Davenport winner of Christmas poem award; members on both football and basketball squads. Three sophomore dormitory girls were married within the year. This will affect the upper classes. No doubt a small junior and senior class is in the making not too unusual, however, because there are many early marriages. The County provides the academic teachers, but Pi Phi again provided several extra teachers Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft (two classes), Music, Physical Education, Nurse (and Health Center). Nancy Jo Hayes Henry (Mrs. Jack Henry as of June 2) had a Journalism Class in addition to her duties as assistant to the director. For the third consecutive year the publication of the Journalism class, Highland Echo, received the only "superior" rating in its class in East Tennessee. Nancy Jo and I both served on the P.T.A Board. Staff House will again house a large "family" of regular staff and teachers, a full staff including the "unknown" (as of now) assistant to the director. The house also has been the scene of several large functions: Open House for Pi Beta Phi teaching staff ; P.T.A. Study Groups; Tennessee Division of Southern Highland Guild; Tennessee Gamma Tour; and Eta Province Tour sponsored by Mary Frances Pirkey for their workshop. We are so glad to have these contacts with Pi Phi groups one more way of helping make your Settlement School a living reality and not just a dream. Farm Richard Watson is still our farm man during the week, his avocation serving as minister for a Baptist congregation. With the deep freeze--a gift of a year ago we wonder how we managed previously. Many more farm products have found their way to our table via the deep freeze. Orlie Watson, at Settlement School twenty-eight years,and his son, Neal, still are able assistants in whatever problem arises on the premises plumbing, carpentering, repairing, mowing lawn, shipping at Arrowcraft. Mrs. Adams is completing her third year as cook spoiling us a bit with her home cooking. Workshop Workshop for 1956 was most successful, with twenty-four states represented in staff and student personnel. This was again conducted by Marian Heard, our initiate at Miami Convention. The excellent workmanship of the students was an outstanding achievement. If you ever plan to come to Gatlinburg during Workshop, it would be worth while to arrange to be here during Workshop Open House. It is amazing how such excellent crafts can be produced in a few weeks. The friendships are evidenced through the years, many coming several summers. Our Pollard kitchen which was abandoned four years ago when staff moved to Ruth Barrett Smith House (Staff House) has been converted into two shower and lavatory units and a bedroom. The porch was remodeled to sleep four, thus adding six beds to our capacity of last year. Nineteen girls were housed in our Big Dorm (three grade-school rooms converted to a dormitory). This is make-shift, and satisfactory only to a point. We cannot help dreaming of a new dormitory perhaps our red barn. Of course, we hope the dream will become a reality somehow, sometime! Gifts The numerous gifts to Settlement School will be listed elsewhere; however, I wish to thank each donor. It is gratifying to be here and to witness the many remembrances, gifts, and legacies from Pi Phis from far and near. Settlement School is presenting to our library two books of the area in memory of our former director, Ruth Dyer, who was deceased this last May. The books are: The French Broad by Wilma Dykes Stokely and the new edition of The Great Smoky Mountains by Laura Thornburgh. Summary It is indeed a privilege and a challenge to represent Pi Beta Phi at Settlement School. One cannot help feeling humble to work for this worthy cause, this national memorial to our Founders. My deepest appreciation and sincere thanks extend to each Pi Phi who has contributed to Settlement School in any way, with time or money, to help in this project. My wish: That each tomorrow will bring to you higher and broader horizons, and that your path will come this way SOMETIME. MARION W.

At the 1954 Convention, a fund was started for a marker to be placed on the lawn at Holt House. The marker is finished, black wrought iron, beautifully scrolled, the plate bearing, in gold lettering: HOLT HOUSE BIRTHPLACE OF PI BETA PHI APRIL 28, 1867 The marker was installed May 22. It is truly a thrill to compare each year's rentals with those of preceding years, for there is no doubt that Holt House is the center of social activity in Monmouth. From June 1955 to June 1956, the house was used 110 times as against 96 times last year and 72 times the previous year. Seven clubs hold their monthly meetings at Holt House; D.A.R., Home Bureau, Business and Professional Women, Newcomers Club, Women's Club, New Century Club, and P.E.O. Eleven showers have been given there, two wedding receptions, two 50th wedding anniversary parties and one 40th wedding reception. Other groups have used the house once or twice-Girl Scout Board, 0 G M, AAUW, Beta Sigma, Nu Phi Mu. The Arrow Mothers have held four meetings and of course we are always pleased when the actives and the alumni can enjoy the use of the house. Four private Teas and two private luncheons were held this year. The Holt House films and colored slides continue to be popular with clubs and chapters and indeed make a wonderful program. Both should be reserved during the sum-mer so that a traveling schedule can be made out. Thy film is ordered from the Holt House Film Chairman, an( the slides from the Holt House Chairman, both Iiste( under the Holt House Committee in all issues of tit ARROW. Special gifts aside from the annual donations have been gratefully received. On Parents' Day last fall, a Pi Ph mother gave our hostess $25.00 to buy something for th house, and three greatly needed card tables were purchased A disbanding evening group of Northern New Jersey sen $5.50 for the marker fund. A special gift of $5.00 cam from the Avon, Illinois Club for the purchase of silver o a lace tablecloth. A special gift of $5.00 from S.W. Indi ana Club in honor of Jane Wyrich, Province Vice Presi dent. A special gift came from the New Orleans Club-$15.00 in memory of three past members, Susan Mathew Butler, Lilah Phillips Leak, and Elizabeth Cooper Wallacl A most generous gift came from three sisters of Louisian Alpha, Juanita Bass Trumbo, Corinne Bass, Ernestine Bas Hopkins a check for $150.00, which is to be used for pair of silver candelabra and a silver bowl for flowers. Fc all these gifts, the Holt House committee and Pi Pi extend sincere thanks. Regular donations continue to come in, so many c them too late for this report, consequently, please, a, readers, study the financial report below. To the clubs an chapters which have been so generous with regular dons tions, may we express deep appreciation, for without then contributions, Holt House could not be maintained. As i every home, repairs must be kept up and decorating don, This summer the first floor is to be redecorated. The Chairman gratefully acknowledges the guidance an assistance of Alice Mansfield and Marianne Wild is gnat, ful to Grand Council for the privilege of serving on th committee. The co-operation of the committee has made ti work enjoyable. MAURINE COOK, Ch.

        52 THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI "Miz Charmer," as the Pi Beta Phi grade children refer to her, has donated generously of her time and efforts not only in the schools in this area but also in many civic projects. It would be difficult to list the numerous activities in which she is engaged. No doubt her twenty years in Gatlinburg have included labor, joys, sorrow, however that indomitable spirit holds forth. For the many years of fruitful service, thank you "Miz Charmer." We bask in reflected glory! Some 7,300 days have dawned at Settlement School for Nurse Marjorie and each have brought new problems, new solutions and em-phases. This last year can best be reported by quoting from the annual report of the Nurse. "The scope of activities for the Pi Beta Phi Health Center has broadened during the past year to include a more extended service to the community. Chief of these added responsibilities was the allotment to us of the Salk vaccine on the same basis as their own units. Response has been gratifying 89% have had one inoculation and 80% have had two. The preschool children are steadily seeking the protection. Our percentage is much higher than the rest of the County. "Another innovation has been the use of the state loaned audiometers for the testing of student hearing. This was done at a clinic set up at the Health Center and pupils were brought in by parents. The Pi Beta Phi and five rural schools were tested. "The Corrective Fund provided for eye examinations for more than a dozen children and glasses were purchased for six. The Lions Club paid for five more in addition to some bought by parents, The Elks Club paid for seven pairs of shoes and the loan closet supplied large amounts of clothing for children and adults. "The Preschool Round-up was held in July with the assistance of Dr. Shilling and half a dozen P.T.A. members. Conferences were held with most of the parents. After school started a clinic for all boys reporting for football was set up. Dr. Shilling gave each the regulation army physical. With the new supply of vaccine, public health nurses were permitted to give the inoculations and consequently since that time inoculations were given at Health Center without imposing on the busy doctors. "The schools weathered several minor epidemics: flu, three day measles, and pink eye. One seventh grade girl had a light case of polio. The Friday Baby Clinic has in-creased weekly. The preventive inoculations were given each student in the four schools as always. Health talks and picture shows were given. There were many conferences with teachers and parents. We have co-operated with the County Welfare Department, Red Cross and Shriners. We have recently been appointed on the Board for Charitable Solicitations. The County Medical Association continues to hold mothly meetings at Health Center for which we are grateful. Such contacts with doctors of the County and State keeps us in constant touch with the newest in medical education. It keeps the doctors in touch, too, with the services given by Pi Beta Phi. The year has been a heavy one but there is a deeper feeling of accomplishment than for any other year. The spirit of appreciation shown by the community and the co-operation we have received assures us that Pi Beta Phi still holds an honored place in the area and is upholding the ideals of the Fraternity established a quarter of a century ago."

Thanks to the energetic, philanthropic alumni, 85 weavers and other craftsmen brought their handcrafts to Arrowcraft with confidence. Elizabeth Rue, Manager, and Tina McMorran, Designer and Weaving Supervisor, with the loyal staff worked happily with the local craftsmen and the far-away alumna clubs. Tina designed special articles for Convention. The new Guild Shop at Rich's asked her to design a panel for the keynote color in their big front window. Several publications have featured her work. Again plans were made to co-operate at the Craftsman's Fair. Betty Lewelling, bookkeeper, resigned, but our disappointment in losing her was tempered with the pleasure of welcoming back Eunice Cole to this position which she so efficiently handled previously. It was deemed wise to discontinue the 2% discount for prompt payment of bills since confusion on the part of a number of chairmen added additional work for the bookkeeper and many times resulted in misunderstanding. After all it is not necessary to reward Pi Phis for paying their honest debts especially when the money supports the national project. One of the best things to do behind a person's back is to pat it. There are 22 Settlement School chairmen whose industry resulted in their club buying and PAYING for $1,000 or more of Arrowcraft products in the 1955-56 year. Those deserving a pat are Northern New jersey $3125.57 Coos County $1405.45 Pittsburgh 2912.95 Milwaukee 1346.98 Champaign-Urbana 2592.30 Seattle 1321.07 Cleveland 2314.06 Lubbock 1144.97 Fort Worth 2146.59 Southwestern Michigan 1140.26 South Bend 2060.08 North Shore, Ill 1138.60 Dallas 1877.25 Oklahoma City 1111.05 Houston 1817.19 Everett, Wash 1096.05 Lincoln 1768.97 Marin County, Calif. 1077.94 San Jose 1574.00 Sacramento 1050.00 Portland, Oregon 1562.01 Kansas City, Mo 1007.92 May their tribe increase! Because Arrowcraft has bills to meet promptly, it has been decided to send quarterly statements to all clubs in hopes that they will make payments throughout the year rather than to wait until May 31. With the loyal co-operation of the membership, Arrow-craft Shop can continue to encourage home industries and to help the people improve their economic situation. Through Staff Marion Mueller, the Director, had a busy year supervising the buildings, staff and program besides representing Pi Beta Phi in Gatlinburg. As she said, when asked what the Director does, "If there is something to do and no one to do it, I do it." Through her diligence and the co-operation of both school principal and chairman of the board, the Pi Phi buildings, used by the County, are in much better condition this year. Fresh paint and repairs have made a great improvement. Her two-year program of renovation of the other buildings shows up in many places. Aided and abetted by Orlie Watson and his son, Neal, Marion has worked hard to make the fraternity proud of its Settlement School. There is a desperate bunt to find a new assistant to the Director for in early June Nancy Jo Hayes became Mrs. Henry. While we do not promise anything, two out of the last three assistants found their future husbands while at Settlement School. Persons interested in rendering service at Settlement School, should contact the chairman. Through the Members Money doesn't talk these days it goes without saying and it was only because of the support of active chapters and alumni clubs that the Committee could meet the demands of the last year. There were 257 clubs that contributed $8,461.73 of which $760 was for staff house furnishings. This was 15 more clubs than last year and an SUMMARY OF WORK THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI increase of $102.66. There were 9 Provinces which were i00% in support of Settlement School. They were Iota Mu Lambda Xi Kappa Pi The following nine clubs contributed $150 or more. Those marked (C) gave extra gifts to Staff House in addition to the annual gift. St. Louis $800.00 Indianapolis 210.00 Northern New Jersey 450.00. Milwaukee 200.00 Champaign-Urbana .. 300.00* Cleveland, East 172.00 Colorado Springs ... 275.00* Denver 150.22 Philadelphia 250.00 The Staff House was also remembered by gifts from the Province Officers, Guy J. Chaffee in memory of his wife, and the Chicago South Club. Many individuals and clubs sent Christmas gifts to Settlement School and the Health Center, A lovely surprise in the form of a silver coffee urn came from Pasadena Club. The staff was very appreciative of the television set given by the late Charlotte Alspaugh. Individuals sent contributions to the Memorial Fund in memory of friends instead of the usual flowers. These should be sent to the Settlement School treasurer. From 98 chapters came $2,376.21 which was an in-crease of $177.66 and an additional 11 chapters participating. There were 12 Provinces 100% in support of the project. Alpha Epsilon Mu Beta Theta Nu Gamma Lambda Xi Zeta Kappa Pi Three chapters gave $100 or more for the annual gift. Texas I' $150 Missouri B ....$125 Texas A $100 These contributions were augmented by $9,108.59 from the magazine agency. Elsewhere will appear a report where due credit will be given to hard-working chairmen but an expression of gratitude here is not out of place. The extra $1,130.28 was needed. With assistance from the Arrow-craft profits and a few other small sums, the above funds had to pay staff, insurance, maintenance, repairs and utilities just to mention a few of the large items. The ping Turtle, a power mower, was a necessity this y( Success can be due to will power especially if wil] some generous Pi Phi. The thoughtfulness of two P. who left legacies to the Settlement School, has nu possible for the Committee to meet several unusui mands on the purse. As mentioned before, the Gi legacy supplied funds for the greater part of the P renovations. Since the work was done in the late ) during the dull season, the money went farther. Seta School started in May to hook on to the new sewer sewer system is a long-awaited improvement in Gatli but will be a drain on the pocket-book for some tii come. Most of the installation cost will be covered legacy of Ethel Curryer, a former treasurer of Settl( School. What a blessing these gifts have been! The me payments on the sewer are 85% to 135% of the bill. This leads us to hope many groups will rethink allocation of funds from their earnings. Since the first of the year, three legacies have be( ported to Settlement School. Charlotte Alspaugh's gif be used for scholarships according to her request. Brendel's and Mrs. Hempsted's bequests, when reo will be kept for some special need. Mrs. Brendel ws mother of Pi Phi Eleanor Miller of Indianapolis. Many alumnae will remember the wonderful Cook published by the Los Angeles Club twenty years a4 has been voted to print a new one and the goal is to 5 choice recipes submitted from each club. Advertising be sold to cover the original cost and the co-operati clubs is solicited. The book will sell at a popular pric it is hoped that it can be ready by next fall. This s be an additional source of funds for the Settlement S( At Convention, it will be my pleasure to tell some of the people who have benefited from Pi Beta efforts and about the town which grew with the Seta School as well as the people who still live up the mountain roads. There are several challenging fiel endeavor which need attention and would mean a deal to the mountain people. "Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn." VIRGINIA BRACKETT GREEN, Chair?, Alpha Eta Zeta SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT Our Settlement School moves on toward its goal and the ideal of its Founders. Almost forty-five years of growth but with many changes. Our problem is to meet these changes wisely as they arise. We trust that we shall be guided in the right path toward Tomorrowland. Many Pi Phis and friends have visited us within the last year. It is my wish that I could take each Pi Phi on a personal tour, because if one is not aware of the Burg's mushroom growth in the last ten years, one might wonder about our Settlement School. Gatlinburg with its approximate two thousand population is S-0 B-I-G, yet so s-m-a-l-1 in many ways. The Burg is still growing up not so much in population as in ways of doing things. Yes, growing to the extent that it can be classified both as a tourist and a convention town. The new city hall with its large auditorium (sponsored by the American Legion), skylift, motels (many with swimming pools), numerous restaurants, two new pageants all contribute toward a BIG Impression. The Great Smoky Mountains Historical Association, Inc., is sponsoring Chucky jack, the pageant which is based on the Founding of the State of Tennessee. Incidentally, I have had the privilege of serving on the Honorary Advisory Council for this project. It is not surprising that so many come to the area with the national interest shown in many ways many articles in various publications, one of the most recent in June is-sue of Holiday Magazine. Tourists come to see the beautyof these horizons. Gatlinburg must provide facilitit tourists before they enter the Smoky National Paid cause there are only camping facilities in the park. With all this I sincerely believe our area is best lc for its handcrafts unquestionably pioneered by Pi Phi. There are still many natives who depend upon part of the Settlement School program because the not a part of these newer enterprises; contrarily, s native families are the leading citizens who in turn ea other natives. Arrowcraft The love for crafts is inborn with many. More sixty weavers each month bring their weaving for A craft to buy. Weavers are specialists not everyon weave; some weave wool only, some linen only, cotton. Many are dependent upon Arrowcraft, this undeniably being their biggest outlet for their cr woodcraft, basketry, brooms, jewelry making. We folks here at Settlement School realize and are grateful for the loyalty and volunteer service o Alumnae Clubs in the promotion of their Arrowcraft Elizabeth Rue, manager of Arrowcraft, and I wool, to thank you individually. At Pi Phi Convention oh( izes the national scope of our work; likewise at Settl School where Pi Phis come from every state. 54 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Health Center Our Health Center is next door to Arrowcraft on the main street of Gatlinburg. Our nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, has seen many changes during her twenty years with Settlement School, yet our Health Center has a valuable and varied service to the community. More than half of the students at Pi Beta Phi School are from the rural and suburban area. Tennessee provides the vaccines. All of the extra services of the state are also given to us among them Dental Clinics, Nutritional Clinics, Chest x-ray, Audiometers. For extra services at the Health Center or in the home, Health Center makes a small charge, the people paying as they can. Marjorie's calendar is filled with field visits, office calls, first aid, inoculations, health talks, conferences, chest x-rays, and clinics. At Christmas individual gifts are given to the children from the three County schools for which Marjorie gives services. The many boxes of clothing and Christmas presents from Alumni Clubs and Active Chapters are most welcome and helpful. When one sees the meagerness of these schools, one cannot keep from wishing we could share a bit more. In every way East Tennessee ranks low in its education system, a fact which is forgotten by many when they see the bright lights of Gatlinburg's main street. Dormitories Our dormitories are a vital part of our program, thus making far-reaching results. In the years I have been at Settlement School, several instances could be sighted where assistance was needed and provided. I might add, deeply appreciated in most instances. This system, established a number of years ago, is not to "hand out" but to help others help themselves. All our dormitory children live considerable distances from the bus line, or have some unusual problem which makes it necessary to "live in." This last school year there were many honors won by our dormitory children: Pat Trentham vice-president of the Senior class; Clyde Davenport annual editor and lead in Senior play; Kate Wright, captain-elect of Girls' Basket-ball Team; Dwight Davenport winner of Christmas poem award; members on both football and basketball squads. Three sophomore dormitory girls were married within the year. This will affect the upper classes. No doubt a small junior and senior class is in the making not too unusual, however, because there are many early marriages. The County provides the academic teachers, but Pi Phi again provided several extra teachers Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft (two classes), Music, Physical Education, Nurse (and Health Center). Nancy Jo Hayes Henry (Mrs. Jack Henry as of June 2) had a Journalism Class in addition to her duties as assistant to the director. For the third consecutive year the publication of the Journalism class, Highland Echo, received the only "superior" rating in its class in East Tennessee. Nancy Jo and I both served on the P.T.A Board. Staff House will again house a large "family" of regular staff and teachers, a full staff including the "unknown" (as of now) assistant to the director. The house also has been the scene of several large functions: Open House for Pi Beta Phi teaching staff ; P.T.A. Study Groups; Tennessee Division of Southern Highland Guild; Tennessee Gamma Tour; and Eta Province Tour sponsored by Mary Frances Pirkey for their workshop. We are so glad to have these contacts with Pi Phi groups one more way of helping make your Settlement School a living reality and not just a dream. Farm Richard Watson is still our farm man during the week, his avocation serving as minister for a Baptist congregation. With the deep freeze--a gift of a year ago we wonder how we managed previously. Many more farm products have found their way to our table via the deep freeze. Orlie Watson, at Settlement School twenty-eight years,and his son, Neal, still are able assistants in whatever problem arises on the premises plumbing, carpentering, repairing, mowing lawn, shipping at Arrowcraft. Mrs. Adams is completing her third year as cook spoiling us a bit with her home cooking. Workshop Workshop for 1956 was most successful, with twenty-four states represented in staff and student personnel. This was again conducted by Marian Heard, our initiate at Miami Convention. The excellent workmanship of the students was an outstanding achievement. If you ever plan to come to Gatlinburg during Workshop, it would be worth while to arrange to be here during Workshop Open House. It is amazing how such excellent crafts can be produced in a few weeks. The friendships are evidenced through the years, many coming several summers. Our Pollard kitchen which was abandoned four years ago when staff moved to Ruth Barrett Smith House (Staff House) has been converted into two shower and lavatory units and a bedroom. The porch was remodeled to sleep four, thus adding six beds to our capacity of last year. Nineteen girls were housed in our Big Dorm (three grade-school rooms converted to a dormitory). This is make-shift, and satisfactory only to a point. We cannot help dreaming of a new dormitory perhaps our red barn. Of course, we hope the dream will become a reality somehow, sometime! Gifts The numerous gifts to Settlement School will be listed elsewhere; however, I wish to thank each donor. It is gratifying to be here and to witness the many remembrances, gifts, and legacies from Pi Phis from far and near. Settlement School is presenting to our library two books of the area in memory of our former director, Ruth Dyer, who was deceased this last May. The books are: The French Broad by Wilma Dykes Stokely and the new edition of The Great Smoky Mountains by Laura Thornburgh. Summary It is indeed a privilege and a challenge to represent Pi Beta Phi at Settlement School. One cannot help feeling humble to work for this worthy cause, this national memorial to our Founders. My deepest appreciation and sincere thanks extend to each Pi Phi who has contributed to Settlement School in any way, with time or money, to help in this project. My wish: That each tomorrow will bring to you higher and broader horizons, and that your path will come this way SOMETIME. MARION W.

At the 1954 Convention, a fund was started for a marker to be placed on the lawn at Holt House. The marker is finished, black wrought iron, beautifully scrolled, the plate bearing, in gold lettering: HOLT HOUSE BIRTHPLACE OF PI BETA PHI APRIL 28, 1867 The marker was installed May 22. It is truly a thrill to compare each year's rentals with those of preceding years, for there is no doubt that Holt House is the center of social activity in Monmouth. From June 1955 to June 1956, the house was used 110 times as against 96 times last year and 72 times the previous year. Seven clubs hold their monthly meetings at Holt House; D.A.R., Home Bureau, Business and Professional Women, Newcomers Club, Women's Club, New Century Club, and P.E.O. Eleven showers have been given there, two wedding receptions, two 50th wedding anniversary parties and one 40th wedding reception. Other groups have used the house once or twice-Girl Scout Board, 0 G M, AAUW, Beta Sigma, Nu Phi Mu. The Arrow Mothers have held four meetings and of course we are always pleased when the actives and the alumni can enjoy the use of the house. Four private Teas and two private luncheons were held this year. The Holt House films and colored slides continue to be popular with clubs and chapters and indeed make a wonderful program. Both should be reserved during the sum-mer so that a traveling schedule can be made out. Thy film is ordered from the Holt House Film Chairman, an( the slides from the Holt House Chairman, both Iiste( under the Holt House Committee in all issues of tit ARROW. Special gifts aside from the annual donations have been gratefully received. On Parents' Day last fall, a Pi Ph mother gave our hostess $25.00 to buy something for th house, and three greatly needed card tables were purchased A disbanding evening group of Northern New Jersey sen $5.50 for the marker fund. A special gift of $5.00 cam from the Avon, Illinois Club for the purchase of silver o a lace tablecloth. A special gift of $5.00 from S.W. Indi ana Club in honor of Jane Wyrich, Province Vice Presi dent. A special gift came from the New Orleans Club-$15.00 in memory of three past members, Susan Mathew Butler, Lilah Phillips Leak, and Elizabeth Cooper Wallacl A most generous gift came from three sisters of Louisian Alpha, Juanita Bass Trumbo, Corinne Bass, Ernestine Bas Hopkins a check for $150.00, which is to be used for pair of silver candelabra and a silver bowl for flowers. Fc all these gifts, the Holt House committee and Pi Pi extend sincere thanks. Regular donations continue to come in, so many c them too late for this report, consequently, please, a, readers, study the financial report below. To the clubs an chapters which have been so generous with regular dons tions, may we express deep appreciation, for without then contributions, Holt House could not be maintained. As i every home, repairs must be kept up and decorating don, This summer the first floor is to be redecorated. The Chairman gratefully acknowledges the guidance an assistance of Alice Mansfield and Marianne Wild is gnat, ful to Grand Council for the privilege of serving on th committee. The co-operation of the committee has made ti work enjoyable. MAURINE COOK, Ch.

At the 1954 Convention, a fund was started for a marker to be placed on the lawn at Holt House. The marker is finished, black wrought iron, beautifully scrolled, the plate bearing, in gold lettering: HOLT HOUSE BIRTHPLACE OF PI BETA PHI APRIL 28, 1867 The marker was installed May 22. It is truly a thrill to compare each year's rentals with those of preceding years, for there is no doubt that Holt House is the center of social activity in Monmouth. From June 1955 to June 1956, the house was used 110 times as against 96 times last year and 72 times the previous year. Seven clubs hold their monthly meetings at Holt House; D.A.R., Home Bureau, Business and Professional Women, Newcomers Club, Women's Club, New Century Club, and P.E.O. Eleven showers have been given there, two wedding receptions, two 50th wedding anniversary parties and one 40th wedding reception. Other groups have used the house once or twice-Girl Scout Board, 0 G M, AAUW, Beta Sigma, Nu Phi Mu. The Arrow Mothers have held four meetings and of course we are always pleased when the actives and the alumni can enjoy the use of the house. Four private Teas and two private luncheons were held this year. The Holt House films and colored slides continue to be popular with clubs and chapters and indeed make a wonderful program. Both should be reserved during the sum-mer so that a traveling schedule can be made out. Thy film is ordered from the Holt House Film Chairman, an( the slides from the Holt House Chairman, both Iiste( under the Holt House Committee in all issues of tit ARROW. Special gifts aside from the annual donations have been gratefully received.

Committee gporb CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn." Pi Beta Phi has proven the truth of this statement. Back in 1912 the fraternity was awakened to the opportunity for service in an isolated section of the Smoky Mountains and through the Settlement School, during the following years, has been able to give impetus to the dawning of a new day for that area. The organization has had the rare privilege of helping to build a town! In the 44 years of Settlement School, over 16,000 days have dawned but this report is concerned with the last 366 days. How has the Settlement School Committee, working on behalf of Pi Phi, met the challenge of these days? Through Education After a careful check with the County Superintendent of Education as well as the local chairman of the Board of Education, it was decided that it would be an injustice to the school children if Pi Phi were to discontinue the practice of furnishing teachers for Music, Arts and Crafts, Woodworking, Physical Education and Journalism. Pi Phi first went to Gatlinburg with the desire to offer educational opportunities and the first school grew to a fully accredited school system including four years of high school. Ever since 1943, the County has supplied the minimum basic educational requirements but with such a meager curriculum, there continues to be a real need for the extra Pi Phi teachers. Nancy Jo Hayes, the Assistant to the Director, taught the Journalism Class which published the school paper, The Highland Echo. For the third year the paper was awarded a "Superior" rating and was the only school in East Tennessee in the mimeographed class to achieve this honor. The paper also won a "Second Class Honor Rating" from the National Scholastic Press Association. Nancy Jo wrote the syllabus for the Journalism Course which resulted in its approval by the State Department of Education for Business as well as English credit. Working as co-sponsor of the Student Council, she saw many worth-while projects originate such as Clean-up Campaign, Smoking Rules, Student Elections and Field Day. Nancy Jo also served as secretary of the P.T.A. Marion Mueller, the Director, also had a place on the board of the P.T.A. and led a study course. At various times Mrs. Mueller has been asked for suggestions for possible teachers and last year it was fortunate that Sabra Hansen, just graduated from DePauw, was secured as English teacher. It is hoped that any Pi Phi interested in teaching at Gatlinburg will make it known. The Physical Education teacher, furnished by the Fraternity, made a valuable contribution through the promotion of sports. In a community where early marriages and the desire to start earning are common, the chance to participate in football and basketball has served to maintain interest in finishing school. A junior Varsity in both foot-ball and basketball was added this year and that gave twice as many people a chance to compete. Pi Beta Phi (for that is what the school is popularly called) also won a county tournament which was a first. The new County gym was a wonderful addition for the Pi Phi auditorium never was built to house a modern athletic department. Boys and girls living too far to commute, lived in the dormitories. This again opened a new day for the experience in group living and working offered an extra dividend in addition to the privilege of completing a high school education. Mrs. Mueller and her assistant supervised a study table which helped the dorm children keep up their grades. Early in the school year, the girls elected dormofficers and held meetings throughout the year. The Con mittee offered small cash Dorm Awards based on grade, activities and contribution to dormitory life. This er couraged pride in work and a good spirit both in schot and the dorm. Before school ended former dormitory sti dents brought their children to seek a place in the data next year. Education covers a lot of ground but doesn always cultivate it. In the dormitory program, Pi Phi di some extra cultivation through the supervised work i kitchen, dining room and grounds. The training prepare the young people to take summer jobs or, at least, to 1 better future homemakers. Not only did the buildings house elementary and hig school but as in previous years, when school was di: missed, Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee unite to bring instruction on the college level to Gatlinburg Under the direction of Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamin the Summer Craft Workshop was held for the twelfth yea: As usual the work and enthusiasm of those who came froi all over the country were an inspiration to both staff an Committee. Teachers, therapists, workers in youth organ nation and with the handicapped, as well as those inter ested in creative use of leisure time, returned home bett( prepared to face the days to come with increased skill an zeal. Only a few years ago, the Ruth Barrett Smith Sta House made it possible, with its enlarged lodging an dining-room facilities, to accept more Workshop student Once again in 1955 the Director was pressed to find spa( for those who wished to register. It was difficult to refu! students when the instructors could care for them in clas Tourist rates in surrounding accommodations were pp hibitive for most. The Committee was challenged to me the housing problem. The Graham legacy, which had bet kept for a special use, provided finances with which convert the old kitchen and porch at Pollard Cottage additional, inviting living quarters for 1956 Worksho The problem of housing still is only partially solve When the Workshop was started twelve years ago, the Phi white grade school building, as a temporary means caring for students at low cost, was converted into, a doff itory and then back into school rooms. This practice h continued through the years at a waste of man-power ar money which could be used for more comfortable, perm vent facilities. Craft Workshops have demonstrated tl tremendous effectiveness of such in meeting some of tl urgent needs of modern life. Past experience should be guidepost rather than a hitching post. Progress begi: with the getting a clear view of the obstacles. Also it wise economy to make the best use of what one has. N P Settlement School has the uninhabited red barn strategical located near the staff house dining-room. The barn 1 longer shelters the cows and mules of days gone by; hoi ever it could have a useful future as a dormitory. In November plans were discussed with the Universi of Tennessee and for the second time Pi Beta Phi and t] University will promote a Foreign Study Craft Tour. Ti first one in 1955 was most successful. If interested in d tails about the 1957 Tour, write to Foreign Study Cis Tour, College of Home Economics, University of Tenn( see, Knoxville. Through Health Services "THANK YOU, WIZ CHARMER' " was the headi: of an article in the Gatlinburg Press in December f twenty years ago on December 1, Mrs. Marjorie Chaim( came to the Burg to serve as the resident nurse for t fraternity. 51 52 THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI "Miz Charmer," as the Pi Beta Phi grade children refer to her, has donated generously of her time and efforts not only in the schools in this area but also in many civic projects. It would be difficult to list the numerous activities in which she is engaged. No doubt her twenty years in Gatlinburg have included labor, joys, sorrow, however that indomitable spirit holds forth. For the many years of fruitful service, thank you "Miz Charmer." We bask in reflected glory! Some 7,300 days have dawned at Settlement School for Nurse Marjorie and each have brought new problems, new solutions and em-phases. This last year can best be reported by quoting from the annual report of the Nurse. "The scope of activities for the Pi Beta Phi Health Center has broadened during the past year to include a more extended service to the community. Chief of these added responsibilities was the allotment to us of the Salk vaccine on the same basis as their own units. Response has been gratifying 89% have had one inoculation and 80% have had two. The preschool children are steadily seeking the protection. Our percentage is much higher than the rest of the County. "Another innovation has been the use of the state loaned audiometers for the testing of student hearing. This was done at a clinic set up at the Health Center and pupils were brought in by parents. The Pi Beta Phi and five rural schools were tested. "The Corrective Fund provided for eye examinations for more than a dozen children and glasses were purchased for six. The Lions Club paid for five more in addition to some bought by parents, The Elks Club paid for seven pairs of shoes and the loan closet supplied large amounts of clothing for children and adults. "The Preschool Round-up was held in July with the assistance of Dr. Shilling and half a dozen P.T.A. members. Conferences were held with most of the parents. After school started a clinic for all boys reporting for football was set up. Dr. Shilling gave each the regulation army physical. With the new supply of vaccine, public health nurses were permitted to give the inoculations and consequently since that time inoculations were given at Health Center without imposing on the busy doctors. "The schools weathered several minor epidemics: flu, three day measles, and pink eye. One seventh grade girl had a light case of polio. The Friday Baby Clinic has in-creased weekly. The preventive inoculations were given each student in the four schools as always. Health talks and picture shows were given. There were many conferences with teachers and parents. We have co-operated with the County Welfare Department, Red Cross and Shriners. We have recently been appointed on the Board for Charitable Solicitations. The County Medical Association continues to hold mothly meetings at Health Center for which we are grateful. Such contacts with doctors of the County and State keeps us in constant touch with the newest in medical education. It keeps the doctors in touch, too, with the services given by Pi Beta Phi. The year has been a heavy one but there is a deeper feeling of accomplishment than for any other year. The spirit of appreciation shown by the community and the co-operation we have received assures us that Pi Beta Phi still holds an honored place in the area and is upholding the ideals of the Fraternity established a quarter of a century ago."

Thanks to the energetic, philanthropic alumni, 85 weavers and other craftsmen brought their handcrafts to Arrowcraft with confidence. Elizabeth Rue, Manager, and Tina McMorran, Designer and Weaving Supervisor, with the loyal staff worked happily with the local craftsmen and the far-away alumna clubs. Tina designed special articles for Convention. The new Guild Shop at Rich's asked her to design a panel for the keynote color in their big front window. Several publications have featured her work. Again plans were made to co-operate at the Craftsman's Fair. Betty Lewelling, bookkeeper, resigned, but our disappointment in losing her was tempered with the pleasure of welcoming back Eunice Cole to this position which she so efficiently handled previously. It was deemed wise to discontinue the 2% discount for prompt payment of bills since confusion on the part of a number of chairmen added additional work for the bookkeeper and many times resulted in misunderstanding. After all it is not necessary to reward Pi Phis for paying their honest debts especially when the money supports the national project. One of the best things to do behind a person's back is to pat it. There are 22 Settlement School chairmen whose industry resulted in their club buying and PAYING for $1,000 or more of Arrowcraft products in the 1955-56 year. Those deserving a pat are Northern New jersey $3125.57 Coos County $1405.45 Pittsburgh 2912.95 Milwaukee 1346.98 Champaign-Urbana 2592.30 Seattle 1321.07 Cleveland 2314.06 Lubbock 1144.97 Fort Worth 2146.59 Southwestern Michigan 1140.26 South Bend 2060.08 North Shore, Ill 1138.60 Dallas 1877.25 Oklahoma City 1111.05 Houston 1817.19 Everett, Wash 1096.05 Lincoln 1768.97 Marin County, Calif. 1077.94 San Jose 1574.00 Sacramento 1050.00 Portland, Oregon 1562.01 Kansas City, Mo 1007.92 May their tribe increase! Because Arrowcraft has bills to meet promptly, it has been decided to send quarterly statements to all clubs in hopes that they will make payments throughout the year rather than to wait until May 31. With the loyal co-operation of the membership, Arrow-craft Shop can continue to encourage home industries and to help the people improve their economic situation. Through Staff Marion Mueller, the Director, had a busy year supervising the buildings, staff and program besides representing Pi Beta Phi in Gatlinburg. As she said, when asked what the Director does, "If there is something to do and no one to do it, I do it." Through her diligence and the co-operation of both school principal and chairman of the board, the Pi Phi buildings, used by the County, are in much better condition this year. Fresh paint and repairs have made a great improvement. Her two-year program of renovation of the other buildings shows up in many places. Aided and abetted by Orlie Watson and his son, Neal, Marion has worked hard to make the fraternity proud of its Settlement School. There is a desperate bunt to find a new assistant to the Director for in early June Nancy Jo Hayes became Mrs. Henry. While we do not promise anything, two out of the last three assistants found their future husbands while at Settlement School. Persons interested in rendering service at Settlement School, should contact the chairman. Through the Members Money doesn't talk these days it goes without saying and it was only because of the support of active chapters and alumni clubs that the Committee could meet the demands of the last year. There were 257 clubs that contributed $8,461.73 of which $760 was for staff house furnishings. This was 15 more clubs than last year and an SUMMARY OF WORK THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI increase of $102.66. There were 9 Provinces which were i00% in support of Settlement School. They were Iota Mu Lambda Xi Kappa Pi The following nine clubs contributed $150 or more. Those marked (C) gave extra gifts to Staff House in addition to the annual gift. St. Louis $800.00 Indianapolis 210.00 Northern New Jersey 450.00. Milwaukee 200.00 Champaign-Urbana .. 300.00* Cleveland, East 172.00 Colorado Springs ... 275.00* Denver 150.22 Philadelphia 250.00 The Staff House was also remembered by gifts from the Province Officers, Guy J. Chaffee in memory of his wife, and the Chicago South Club. Many individuals and clubs sent Christmas gifts to Settlement School and the Health Center, A lovely surprise in the form of a silver coffee urn came from Pasadena Club. The staff was very appreciative of the television set given by the late Charlotte Alspaugh. Individuals sent contributions to the Memorial Fund in memory of friends instead of the usual flowers. These should be sent to the Settlement School treasurer. From 98 chapters came $2,376.21 which was an in-crease of $177.66 and an additional 11 chapters participating. There were 12 Provinces 100% in support of the project. Alpha Epsilon Mu Beta Theta Nu Gamma Lambda Xi Zeta Kappa Pi Three chapters gave $100 or more for the annual gift. Texas I' $150 Missouri B ....$125 Texas A $100 These contributions were augmented by $9,108.59 from the magazine agency. Elsewhere will appear a report where due credit will be given to hard-working chairmen but an expression of gratitude here is not out of place. The extra $1,130.28 was needed. With assistance from the Arrow-craft profits and a few other small sums, the above funds had to pay staff, insurance, maintenance, repairs and utilities just to mention a few of the large items. The ping Turtle, a power mower, was a necessity this y( Success can be due to will power especially if wil] some generous Pi Phi. The thoughtfulness of two P. who left legacies to the Settlement School, has nu possible for the Committee to meet several unusui mands on the purse. As mentioned before, the Gi legacy supplied funds for the greater part of the P renovations. Since the work was done in the late ) during the dull season, the money went farther. Seta School started in May to hook on to the new sewer sewer system is a long-awaited improvement in Gatli but will be a drain on the pocket-book for some tii come. Most of the installation cost will be covered legacy of Ethel Curryer, a former treasurer of Settl( School. What a blessing these gifts have been! The me payments on the sewer are 85% to 135% of the bill. This leads us to hope many groups will rethink allocation of funds from their earnings. Since the first of the year, three legacies have be( ported to Settlement School. Charlotte Alspaugh's gif be used for scholarships according to her request. Brendel's and Mrs. Hempsted's bequests, when reo will be kept for some special need. Mrs. Brendel ws mother of Pi Phi Eleanor Miller of Indianapolis. Many alumnae will remember the wonderful Cook published by the Los Angeles Club twenty years a4 has been voted to print a new one and the goal is to 5 choice recipes submitted from each club. Advertising be sold to cover the original cost and the co-operati clubs is solicited. The book will sell at a popular pric it is hoped that it can be ready by next fall. This s be an additional source of funds for the Settlement S( At Convention, it will be my pleasure to tell some of the people who have benefited from Pi Beta efforts and about the town which grew with the Seta School as well as the people who still live up the mountain roads. There are several challenging fiel endeavor which need attention and would mean a deal to the mountain people. "Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn." VIRGINIA BRACKETT GREEN, Chair?, Alpha Eta Zeta SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT Our Settlement School moves on toward its goal and the ideal of its Founders. Almost forty-five years of growth but with many changes. Our problem is to meet these changes wisely as they arise. We trust that we shall be guided in the right path toward Tomorrowland. Many Pi Phis and friends have visited us within the last year. It is my wish that I could take each Pi Phi on a personal tour, because if one is not aware of the Burg's mushroom growth in the last ten years, one might wonder about our Settlement School. Gatlinburg with its approximate two thousand population is S-0 B-I-G, yet so s-m-a-l-1 in many ways. The Burg is still growing up not so much in population as in ways of doing things. Yes, growing to the extent that it can be classified both as a tourist and a convention town. The new city hall with its large auditorium (sponsored by the American Legion), skylift, motels (many with swimming pools), numerous restaurants, two new pageants all contribute toward a BIG Impression. The Great Smoky Mountains Historical Association, Inc., is sponsoring Chucky jack, the pageant which is based on the Founding of the State of Tennessee. Incidentally, I have had the privilege of serving on the Honorary Advisory Council for this project. It is not surprising that so many come to the area with the national interest shown in many ways many articles in various publications, one of the most recent in June is-sue of Holiday Magazine. Tourists come to see the beautyof these horizons. Gatlinburg must provide facilitit tourists before they enter the Smoky National Paid cause there are only camping facilities in the park. With all this I sincerely believe our area is best lc for its handcrafts unquestionably pioneered by Pi Phi. There are still many natives who depend upon part of the Settlement School program because the not a part of these newer enterprises; contrarily, s native families are the leading citizens who in turn ea other natives. Arrowcraft The love for crafts is inborn with many. More sixty weavers each month bring their weaving for A craft to buy. Weavers are specialists not everyon weave; some weave wool only, some linen only, cotton. Many are dependent upon Arrowcraft, this undeniably being their biggest outlet for their cr woodcraft, basketry, brooms, jewelry making. We folks here at Settlement School realize and are grateful for the loyalty and volunteer service o Alumnae Clubs in the promotion of their Arrowcraft Elizabeth Rue, manager of Arrowcraft, and I wool, to thank you individually. At Pi Phi Convention oh( izes the national scope of our work; likewise at Settl School where Pi Phis come from every state. 54 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Health Center Our Health Center is next door to Arrowcraft on the main street of Gatlinburg. Our nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, has seen many changes during her twenty years with Settlement School, yet our Health Center has a valuable and varied service to the community. More than half of the students at Pi Beta Phi School are from the rural and suburban area. Tennessee provides the vaccines. All of the extra services of the state are also given to us among them Dental Clinics, Nutritional Clinics, Chest x-ray, Audiometers. For extra services at the Health Center or in the home, Health Center makes a small charge, the people paying as they can. Marjorie's calendar is filled with field visits, office calls, first aid, inoculations, health talks, conferences, chest x-rays, and clinics. At Christmas individual gifts are given to the children from the three County schools for which Marjorie gives services. The many boxes of clothing and Christmas presents from Alumni Clubs and Active Chapters are most welcome and helpful. When one sees the meagerness of these schools, one cannot keep from wishing we could share a bit more. In every way East Tennessee ranks low in its education system, a fact which is forgotten by many when they see the bright lights of Gatlinburg's main street. Dormitories Our dormitories are a vital part of our program, thus making far-reaching results. In the years I have been at Settlement School, several instances could be sighted where assistance was needed and provided. I might add, deeply appreciated in most instances. This system, established a number of years ago, is not to "hand out" but to help others help themselves. All our dormitory children live considerable distances from the bus line, or have some unusual problem which makes it necessary to "live in." This last school year there were many honors won by our dormitory children: Pat Trentham vice-president of the Senior class; Clyde Davenport annual editor and lead in Senior play; Kate Wright, captain-elect of Girls' Basket-ball Team; Dwight Davenport winner of Christmas poem award; members on both football and basketball squads. Three sophomore dormitory girls were married within the year. This will affect the upper classes. No doubt a small junior and senior class is in the making not too unusual, however, because there are many early marriages. The County provides the academic teachers, but Pi Phi again provided several extra teachers Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft (two classes), Music, Physical Education, Nurse (and Health Center). Nancy Jo Hayes Henry (Mrs. Jack Henry as of June 2) had a Journalism Class in addition to her duties as assistant to the director. For the third consecutive year the publication of the Journalism class, Highland Echo, received the only "superior" rating in its class in East Tennessee. Nancy Jo and I both served on the P.T.A Board. Staff House will again house a large "family" of regular staff and teachers, a full staff including the "unknown" (as of now) assistant to the director. The house also has been the scene of several large functions: Open House for Pi Beta Phi teaching staff ; P.T.A. Study Groups; Tennessee Division of Southern Highland Guild; Tennessee Gamma Tour; and Eta Province Tour sponsored by Mary Frances Pirkey for their workshop. We are so glad to have these contacts with Pi Phi groups one more way of helping make your Settlement School a living reality and not just a dream. Farm Richard Watson is still our farm man during the week, his avocation serving as minister for a Baptist congregation. With the deep freeze--a gift of a year ago we wonder how we managed previously. Many more farm products have found their way to our table via the deep freeze. Orlie Watson, at Settlement School twenty-eight years,and his son, Neal, still are able assistants in whatever problem arises on the premises plumbing, carpentering, repairing, mowing lawn, shipping at Arrowcraft. Mrs. Adams is completing her third year as cook spoiling us a bit with her home cooking. Workshop Workshop for 1956 was most successful, with twenty-four states represented in staff and student personnel. This was again conducted by Marian Heard, our initiate at Miami Convention. The excellent workmanship of the students was an outstanding achievement. If you ever plan to come to Gatlinburg during Workshop, it would be worth while to arrange to be here during Workshop Open House. It is amazing how such excellent crafts can be produced in a few weeks. The friendships are evidenced through the years, many coming several summers. Our Pollard kitchen which was abandoned four years ago when staff moved to Ruth Barrett Smith House (Staff House) has been converted into two shower and lavatory units and a bedroom. The porch was remodeled to sleep four, thus adding six beds to our capacity of last year. Nineteen girls were housed in our Big Dorm (three grade-school rooms converted to a dormitory). This is make-shift, and satisfactory only to a point. We cannot help dreaming of a new dormitory perhaps our red barn. Of course, we hope the dream will become a reality somehow, sometime! Gifts The numerous gifts to Settlement School will be listed elsewhere; however, I wish to thank each donor. It is gratifying to be here and to witness the many remembrances, gifts, and legacies from Pi Phis from far and near. Settlement School is presenting to our library two books of the area in memory of our former director, Ruth Dyer, who was deceased this last May. The books are: The French Broad by Wilma Dykes Stokely and the new edition of The Great Smoky Mountains by Laura Thornburgh. Summary It is indeed a privilege and a challenge to represent Pi Beta Phi at Settlement School. One cannot help feeling humble to work for this worthy cause, this national memorial to our Founders. My deepest appreciation and sincere thanks extend to each Pi Phi who has contributed to Settlement School in any way, with time or money, to help in this project. My wish: That each tomorrow will bring to you higher and broader horizons, and that your path will come this way SOMETIME. MARION W.

At the 1954 Convention, a fund was started for a marker to be placed on the lawn at Holt House. The marker is finished, black wrought iron, beautifully scrolled, the plate bearing, in gold lettering: HOLT HOUSE BIRTHPLACE OF PI BETA PHI APRIL 28, 1867 The marker was installed May 22. It is truly a thrill to compare each year's rentals with those of preceding years, for there is no doubt that Holt House is the center of social activity in Monmouth. From June 1955 to June 1956, the house was used 110 times as against 96 times last year and 72 times the previous year. Seven clubs hold their monthly meetings at Holt House; D.A.R., Home Bureau, Business and Professional Women, Newcomers Club, Women's Club, New Century Club, and P.E.O. Eleven showers have been given there, two wedding receptions, two 50th wedding anniversary parties and one 40th wedding reception. Other groups have used the house once or twice-Girl Scout Board, 0 G M, AAUW, Beta Sigma, Nu Phi Mu. The Arrow Mothers have held four meetings and of course we are always pleased when the actives and the alumni can enjoy the use of the house. Four private Teas and two private luncheons were held this year. The Holt House films and colored slides continue to be popular with clubs and chapters and indeed make a wonderful program. Both should be reserved during the sum-mer so that a traveling schedule can be made out. Thy film is ordered from the Holt House Film Chairman, an( the slides from the Holt House Chairman, both Iiste( under the Holt House Committee in all issues of tit ARROW. Special gifts aside from the annual donations have been gratefully received. On Parents' Day last fall, a Pi Ph mother gave our hostess $25.00 to buy something for th house, and three greatly needed card tables were purchased A disbanding evening group of Northern New Jersey sen $5.50 for the marker fund. A special gift of $5.00 cam from the Avon, Illinois Club for the purchase of silver o a lace tablecloth. A special gift of $5.00 from S.W. Indi ana Club in honor of Jane Wyrich, Province Vice Presi dent.

Fc all these gifts, the Holt House committee and Pi Pi extend sincere thanks. Regular donations continue to come in, so many c them too late for this report, consequently, please, a, readers, study the financial report below. To the clubs an chapters which have been so generous with regular dons tions, may we express deep appreciation, for without then contributions, Holt House could not be maintained. As i every home, repairs must be kept up and decorating don, This summer the first floor is to be redecorated. The Chairman gratefully acknowledges the guidance an assistance of Alice Mansfield and Marianne Wild is gnat, ful to Grand Council for the privilege of serving on th committee. The co-operation of the committee has made ti work enjoyable. MAURINE COOK, Ch.
