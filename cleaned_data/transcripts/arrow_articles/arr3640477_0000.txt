        476 THE ARR Q OF RI BETA PHI GATLINBURG IN 1920 GAT IN G IN 1920 THE TWO-FOLD PROBLEM OF THE PRESET BY EVELYN BISHOP, NEW YORK A, HEAD RESIDENT Often encouragement and renewed energy and enthusiast from looking back over a period of labor. Ten years ago th mer the desire for an interest outside of ourselves was born hearts of some of our noble Pi Phis and it is almost amazilN how that idea has developed in such a comparatively shot Wisdom and guidance were manifest, I am sure, when the ( of a place of location was considered for do not believe ther GROUP OF PUPILS IN UPPER GRADES, 1919-20 be a people of finer mind and blood than these of the southern tains. With the first coming of Pi Phis there was a suspicion am people that a new church was to be established or something accord with their strict religious doctrine. When the isola the mountain folks is taken into consideration it is easy to and the narrow prejudice against what they believe other denom 478 THE :ARROW OF PI BETA PHI stand for. No doubt the longest, hardest pull was to convince them of what we really were here for. All that only worked out through demonstration. Although progress has seemed slow at times it really is a far cry from the first year when Miss Hill stood almost alone, some even afraid to take her into their homes and only two or three places suitable for her to the time when the teachers are helping in the church and Sunday school, conducting the Sunday night service in the school house and when the people come freely to ask help and advice, whether how to make light bread or to know how best to care for their sick ones. Many times it does seem our lot is to be "all things to all people" and it is an inspiring one too. In eight years the school has developed from the little one room building and thirteen pupils into quite a modern and efficient place. If you all could hear some of our Friday night debates I think you would be surprised at the big questions discussed. Relative advantages of pike and railroad for a community like this, compulsory education law, farming and grazing in the mountains, even the league of nations has not escaped. The large school room is nearly always well filled for many come who are not in school. The children are proud of their school and all they have. The building is very well equipped and they take splendid care of everything. When I tell you that not one pane of glass has been broken out through carelessness in the two years I have been here, I believe you will have some appreciation of how the children feel toward their school. Furnaces and bath room are still wonders to many but no one comes now to enquire if we have something in the basement to blow up everything, if we want to, and so many now see how much more convenient it is to have water in the house than to carry it from the river or spring. I can count a number who have piped water from their springs either into the kitchens or near the door, many rude devices are used but the good idea is developing. As for cooking and housekeeping the day has gone far by when there were only two or three places where we could spend the night or enjoy a well prepared meal. Many times this year we have been visiting where we knew the girls had prepared the supper, set the table and done practically everything after school,, in the afternoon and let me assure you it was well done. There is also more effort on the part of children and parents to plan work so the children can be in school more regularly and through the entire school year. GATLINBURG IN 1920 47'9 Other communities turn to Gatlinburg as an example in many ways. The young people are well dressed, refined in their ways and really show a great deal of good training. Could all of this come any way but through the school? This winter the people voted to build a new church. Each one who spoke on the subject said he would give freely if he could be sure of a modern building, one that would meet the needs for some years to come. Why had they come to be 'dissatisfied with their present inadequate building? The school now has a two-fold problem, that of the people back on the creeks who have not yet been reached, who are miles from the school, and of the ones right here in the "Burg" who have taken "BASE...INS" (A typical mountain school house in use today which Pi Phi hopes to eliminate by providing for transportation of the present pupils to the Pi Phi School.) advantage of every opportunity we have given them. They furnish the usual small town problems. How much social life and how best to carry it on, how much we can do in the summer when so many are in the "Burg" Saturday afternoons and Sundays, how much guidance and also how much inspiration we can give? These are some of the questions facing us and we must always be on the alert to meet every new need for with development come new questions to be solved. There is no doubt but the school has already far out grown the first dreams of many Pi Phis but let us take that very fact as the challenge of the future and respond to every call our school makes for greater service from year to year. 480 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI GLIMPSES OF THE LIFE OF. TODAY BY EMILY BURTON January 5, 1920. Dear Pi Phis: The New Year has just come in and as I am to write to you I believe it is a very good time to contrast the new with the old. Life here in the mountains is changing rapidly, and though there is plenty of local color here still, I am sure you would be surprised at some of the changes in the country and the people. I am sure you have all heard of the hard trip that lay between Sevierville and Gatlinburg. Not more than four or five years ago it meant fourteen miles of travel in a buggy or hack, through mud holes and over rocks, across fords and up hill and down hill. Though the. hills and mud holes of the last seven miles still remain, there is now a stretch of seven miles of good pike road and in the spring and summer months one can come through with Mr. Huff, Lilliard Maples or Salt, the mail man, in one of those marvelous little ma-chines, ' No longer would a mountaineer living along the Gatlinbag road:-ay, as I read a Tennessee mountaineer did say when a horseman drew irem on the deeply rutted road in front of his cabin, "Them roads is *le with them automobyles." Why, do many come up here," asked' th 'surprised visitor. "Many? Why, stranger, I don't believe there air a week but what one goes by." You remember too, doubtless, how a few years ago 'strangers were regarded with curiosity and distrust. Many people come to Gatlin-burg now for business purposes, for the approach of the railroad has increased interest in the lumbering projects here. Also the advent of the automobile, feasible roads, and Mr. Huff's hotel have brought summer visitors and they no longer are considered by the people as strange "fetched ons." Again, we no longer teach in a little one room school house but have our splendid four room, steam heated school house, with large library and manual training and domestic science equipment. The teachers, too, have been benefited as much as the school by the improvements made in the last few years. We are very "comfy" now in .our steam heated house, we no longer have to get up before day-break to wash the dishes and sweep up before school. We have a dear Aunt Lizzie who looks after us and we are free to do our best for the kiddies at school. GATLINBURG IN 1920 481 We are beginning the new year very happily, with three new students in the dormitories. This first day of school was extremely cold with snow on the ground and everything frozen up yet two children, brother and sister, walked from Little River, nine miles away, to enter school. We are very glad to have won another new family to the school. It happened this way. One Saturday we were visiting way up one of the creeks. We had gone until we were close to big Smokey. On our way back we stopped at a house we never had GOING HOME FROM SCHOOL, 1919-20 visited before. The front part seemed deserted so we went around to the back door and knocked. A voice said, "Come in," and we entered. By a huge fire place sat an old man, hob-nailing a shoe. We sat, and talked to him for a few minutes when he told us that his family was in trouble, his son's wife was away from home and very ill with a disease from which he was sure she must die. No doctor could help her he thought, for a woman in the Bible had been afflicted with the same sickness and doctors had not been able to heal her, it was the 482 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Christ who brought her relief. The faith of the old man was wonderful. Some of the children then came in. There were six for the grandfather and father to care for. Such a pitiful sight those children were. They were unwashed and uncombed and the "least one," just two years old, had but a dress on, not another bit of clothing. A week later Aunt Lizzie and I went back. The mother had been brought home on a stretcher. She looked very frail and was incapable of doing more than sit by the fire a while each day. Clothes had been sent us for the family and Aunt Lizzie took the baby, "stripped" her, gave her a bath and put the clean clothes on. The mother and father were very pleased with the warm clothes and accepted them in a nice way. Early the next morning three of the children appeared at the cottage each with a big apple. for us. They had come to start in school. One of the little girls was wearing a kimona that had been given, as a wrap, and the boy had an undershirt on over his shirt. You can see how much they needed the help and how appreciative they were. It is' in the young people that the change comes. We do not see a great difference in the home life of the mountaineer, for the older people cling to the old customs. Miss Ann Cobb, of the Hindman School in Kentucky Mountains has written a little poem, telling of the coming of the new ways in the mountains. I quote it for its true on Little Pigeon too. "The ways of the world will be holding up Cyarr Sorry ways, the old ways, They've a call to go. Only when you're grave-bound Changing's allus slow. Old folks will bide by the old ways up Cyarr." Faithfully yours, EMILY BURTON. FRIDAY AFTERNOON IN THE SCHOOLROOM By RUTH STURLEY, Washington A Two o'clock and an expectant stir goes through the "big room" for it is Friday afternoon and the day for the reading of the school magazine. "Books" are over for the week and school itself will "break" when teacher asks someone to ring the bell at two-thirty. GATLINBURG IN 1920 483 itWho will put away the ink wells?". and "Who will clean the boards and erasers ?" "Let's get our desks in order." While these things are being done will the Pi Phis please try to realize that this is their school, and that these attractive girls and boys who look more as if they came from homes in a small town than from mountain cabins are the results of the school's existence among them for the past eight years. Some of the twenty-five present have never been to any other school and are now in the seventh and eighth grades. Those four in the corner at the back of the room are doing first year high school work. What do they all think of the school? What are their ambitions? Is the school meeting their needs? Do the results justify a more expansive opening of Pi Phi purses and a spring freshet of sympathy and understanding from Pi Phi hearts all over the United States to this little corner of the world shut in by creeks and the mountains? Perhaps if we listen very quietly and carefully to the reading of the magazine we will be able to answer these questions ourselves. Let us hear from Jim Huff first whose contribution explains the gaily decorated book from which he reads the'following : OUR SCHOOL MAGAZINE I am going to tell you about our school magazine which is called the Appalachian News. The first thing done in the making of our magazine is Cora and Tom McCarter, Rose Carr and Estel Huff (our ninth graders) get together and make out the subjects for us to write about. When we have them written we give them our papers and .they correct them and then they return them to be copied in ink. After we have them copied we give them to Estel Huff and he puts them all in order and sews them together. Every other Friday each boy and girl reads his own topic. Jim is a very practical and hard working boy, as brief in his speech as in his writing and a great contrast to his dreamer brother, Estel. But he is reading something more: I expect to be a lumberman and when I want to build me a house or a barn I will have the timber to build them. If I ever am a saw miller I will not quit it until I have sawed every tree in Sevier County that I can get hold of. The third member of the Huff family in the big room is Stella, one of the brightest and most active girls in school and unlike her two older brothers always eager to take part in the debates. Although only twelve years old next month, she, with the help of another girl, 484 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI looked after the household nearly all summer as her mother had to be in charge of the hotel. She reads her plans for the future. I expect to go through school here, then go to Jefferson City to school, then to college. After this I expect to teach school at Stoneham, Mass. I want to teach in the primary and domestic science departments. Then I think I want to go to Europe in an aeroplane and see the ruins of France and Belgium, also the Kaiser if he is there. While I am there I want to, see England's large navy. Then I am coming back to Gatlinburg, Tenn. Elmer Oakley is from one of the poorest families around here. This is his ambition: In the future I expect to make a teacher for school and further on in the future I expect to make a book-keeper and build me a library of my own. Of the three sisters, Rose, Lithia, and Ethel Carr, two express the desire to go on to college and become teachers while the third is going to be a foreign missionary in China. Little Maud Clabo who lives nearly three miles away with a grand-father and step grandmother, as her mother is dead and she has no father, reads this: I expect to be a nurse and go to Belgium and take care of some little Belgian children that have no father nor mother. Then I will bring one or two home with me and let them see the place, then take them back to their native land and find them a nice home to live in and then go and take care of some more children. We have more plans for high school, college, teaching, and travel expressed by the others. Levator Whaley who is unusually slow and quiet surprises us all by varying his teaching with a year of running a street car followed by three years in the aerial mail service between South America and Europe. The "Question Box" consists of questions handed in by the boys and girls and answered by Tom McCarter. He is a real farmer but like his three sisters, is most eager for an education and willing to do anything to get it. Let's listen to some of them: Q. How would electric lights help Gatlinburg? A. It would help her in many different ways, give better lights for the people to have societies by night and save lots of coal oil, etc. Q. What is the best thing that can be done? A. Obey the ten commandments of the Bible and obey your school teacher. Q. Can we do wrong that good may come? GATLINBURG IN 1 920 485 A. No, we cannot for the ten commandments teach us what ought to be done. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." "Whatsoever ye sow ye shall also reap." Q. Which is worth the most, education or a long life? A. Both put together is worth the most. You can't be well educated without-having a long life because a woman or man never gets too far but they can learn new ideas. Q. What do you think ought to be done to the Kaiser and his son? A. I don't believe there ought to be anything done with them for when they die the Devil will take care of them. I do believe if the other nations try to do anything with them Germany will declare war against them again. That we may see ourselves as others see us hear dear white headed Arlena Maples read a description of the school house. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is located in the 1 1th civil district of Sevier County of Tennessee, southeast side of the Little Pigeon River. The building is constructed on a piece of land containing about thirty-five acres and about one hundred yards from the river on an elevated piece of land near a beautiful pine grove very pleasantly and conveniently located with roads leading from all points. The surroundings are grandstand, cottage, flagpole, and the play ground in front. It has been built over three years. It is oblong and is made of wood, the top covered with tin and the foundation is made of brick. It is a very plain building. Without comment let us pass on from the reading of "How to Make Molasses," "Origin of St. Valentine's Day," "Jokes," "Current Events," "Our Debates" and listen to Arlie McCarter read: Morals of Gatlinburg "The morals of Gatlinburg are good. One can only judge by what he sees. Traveling around through the vicinity is the best way to judge the conduct of its .people. Everyone who lives here tries to do the right thing as far as he knows and understands. The young men conduct themselves in such a manner that they are due a good name and have brought honor to their community. Not only are the men good but the women as well. Most of the good things we have here were brought about by the influence of our women. The church of Gatlinburg is a working body for the betterment of the people. 486 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Our school is a live wire in this community. Now in conclusion I give to the people of the community the name of being true citizens who stand ready to share their burdens in all undertakings for the betterment of our country." GOOD MOUNTAIN STOCK It is just 2 :30 as Arlie finishes but before we ring the bell let me whisper something in your ears that ought to warm "the cockles of your hearts." The other day when the question was asked in com'-munity history class, "What do you learn at home that you do not learn at school ?' ' a great discussion arose which resulted in the verdict expressed by Ethel Carr. "Well, I declare, I just can't think of nary a thing I haven't learned here at school." Is it worth while? GATLINBURG IN 1920 487 LETTERS FROM MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL ADVISORY BOARD Gatlinburg, Tennessee. December 12, 1919. Pi Beta Phi School: I take this pleasure to congratulate you for what your school has done for our community and theadvancement and improvement on our boys and girls. I think it is wonderful how they can perform on the stage, debate subjects and recite recitations. A great number of them could not read or write, in fact many of them did not know anything when you came to us with your Blessed School. I can't express the gratitude of my heart for what you have already done for our children. My good wife and I are working hard on our little mountain farm to clothe and feed our little ones. Was it not for your school we never could educate them in the world. I feel very glad that I helped you with a little mite of money to establish vour school. I wish I was able to help with more. Your good work is just begun. There are many boys, girls, and children yet that must be brought into your school. Many of them are poor and with-out much clothes, yet these precious minds must be developed by somebody, or else they will grow to the stature of ignorant manhood and womanhood. I feel you all need help in a financial way but wherever is it to come from? Probably somebody will get a vision of the great work you are doing and lend a helping hand to develop our boys and girls. Yours truly, STEVE WHALEY. Sevierville, Tenn., January 6, 1920. My dear Miss Langmaid: I was very sorry indeed not to have seen you again before you took your final departure. I did not expect you to leave so soon for I wanted to express my appreciation of your personal work and also the work of your society in the community in which your school is located. The school does not affect only the community in which it is located but all Sev'ier County and will make its way into all the country. When I go into the community now on professional trips I find the food is better prepared, the houses are better kept and the children 488 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI are better cared for. This shows me that the seed being sown there will be gathered up in sheaves many days hence. I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. . I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the school. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated. I. think, by the wise course pursued by those in power, this idea has been done' away with. The people now seem to be working together for the advancement of the school and community. I want to say that in no part of the country in which I have been, have I ever found people with more natural ability and people who were more susceptible to good influences and knowledge than the people of Gatlinburg. From this community came John H. Reagan, Ex. U. S. Senator and Postmaster General under Grover Cleveland. When a young man leaving Gatlinburg, he could neither read or write but when he landed in Houston, Texas, with his great brain he was elected sheriff of that county. He saw the great need of knowing how to write his name and keep his accounts so he immediately went to work and before his term had expired he had a fairly good education. He was then elected to the State Legislature and in turn was elected Speaker of the House. After this he was elected to Congress, Governor of the State, U. S. Senator and appointed to Cleveland's Cabinet. In fact, he was in his day a national character of distinction. Probably all the people of this community are his relatives by blood and many young men of this section have fully as much gray matter as did this distinguished man. 'I feel like your work here has just begun and I. know God will prosper and ,bless the donors of this great institution. I want to take this method of thanking you and the people who are behind this institution in the name of Gatlinburg and Sevier County for the great good you are doing for the world through Sevier County people. Believe me to be, Very sincerely, Z. D. MASSEY. GATLINBURG IN 1920 489 LETTERS FROM OUR PUPILS Gatlinburg, Tenn., January 6, 1920. Dear Friends: I am a girl of thirteen years of age and go to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. I am in the 8th grade. I like it fine and hope the other boys and girls do. I have been going to school ever since I was six years of age. I am going through school here and then go to some high school and get my education, then teach school. I think we have the best school in Sevier County. Yours as ever, ARLENA MAPLES. Gatlinburg, Tenn., January 6, 1920. 11f, dear Friends: I'm in school and enjoying a nice time. My studies include gram-mar, spelling, agriculture, writing, ancient history and algebra. I like them all fine. I also take cooking and sewing. We certainly are having good school this year. I think it is the best school we have had for a year or two. I have such a nice teacher and when we don't have good lessons she don't seem to enjoy it very much. I sure did have a nice time Christmas vacation. Did you? I went to church at Huskey's Grove Christmas day. Near the church house is lots of spruce pines, it is a very beautiful place. It is very cold here, some snow on the ground and the river frozen over with ice and some of the boys have been skating. From your friend, POLLY MCCARTER. Gatlinburg, Tenn., March 11, 1920. Dear Pi Beta Phis: How I wish each of you IT B ,l knew just how much the dear old II B (I) school has meat to our community and the many girls and boys of this mountainous section of the Great Smokies. In the year 1912 the school was first started with one teacher, Miss Martha Hill from Nashville. 490 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI The II B 41 purchased their land from Mr. E. E. Ogle which had a three roomed cottage, a barn and a store house. I lived in this little cottage with Miss Martha hill for a year. Soon the barn was torn away and used for wood. The II B 4 repaired the store house for the purpose of using as a school building which was used for the kindergarten. Our county school house which was a one roomed house with eight windows, four on each side, one door in the back with two rows of long benches with no desks. The floor was made of spruce pine and had seasoned out till there was great cracks in the floor. This county house happened to be located on the II B cl, property. The II B (I) then bought this building and the store house and old county school house was where the II B T school first started their school. By this time the county had built a two roomed building which was not far away. The next year the county ran their school as usual but they were now in the new building and the II B (I) in the old ones. Soon the dear little II B I school begain to grow the people saw what the school was doing for the boys and girls who attended. The girls and boys walked for many miles away leaving the county schools till our little building would hold them no longer. When in 1914 the II B (I went to work and built a six roomed school house with all the desks necessary, and running water, good heating system and were equiped for manuel training and domestic sience and year by year we have more teachers till now we have four. In 1916 they finished up an eleven roomed house for the teachers. The girls and boys of this community enjoy open house in this building on Friday nights we sometimes sing and play games. The II B 1 now use the old cottage for a girl's dormitory and recently have remodeled the Stuart cottage for which they use as a boy's dormitory. The school has not only inthused the people to build good roads in our community so the children can come to school in more ease, but inthused the girls and boys to look forward in life to bigger and better things. We sincerely hope with the help of the II B I we can some day have a high school and we wish there could be some plane to light up the building. We sometimes have our B. Y. P. U. in the school GATLINBURG IN 1920 491 building on Sunday nights. And we have open society every other Friday night, the teachers are compelled to carry lamps from the cottage. Yours sincerely, EMMA MAPLES. The Development of Agricultural Resources [TIrE ARROW is indebted to Mary Keown, Florida A, '14, for the cut and comment given below which appeared originally in the Tennessee Extension Review for October 25, 1919. From the early days of the Settlement School, our workers have been deeply interested in the agricultural problems of the community and, as stated elsewhere, the first canning club in the county was organized in Gatlinburg in 1914 through the efforts of Miss Pollard. Our present school staff is working in close cooperation with Miss Whittle. It is a pleasure to introduce her to ARROW readers for she is constantly helping to advance our work.--EDITOR.] A WOMAN LEAD THEM The outstanding county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair this year was from Sevier County. Sevier is strictly an agricultural county. Everything produced is of the soil. The lumber interest is large, and there are good flour 492 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI mills, but these depend directly on the soil for their raw material. It is a land of farmers who only need leadership to awaken in them community pride and consciousness, to realize the possibilities of their soils. They have found a leader in the person of their county home demonstration agent, Miss Annie Whittle. Through the effective cooperation of efficient committees, all working hard, and working as one, the people of Sevier County put on the first prize exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fairs It was an inspiring sight during the opening hours of the fair to see the busy committee men and women working together, planning and installing -the exhibit. 'Every agricultural phase of the county was represented. The products exhibited were excellent in quality and variety, and the installation was attractive, without being too prominent a feature. Miss Whittle was everywhere; her advice was constantly sought, and her executive ability was equal to all demands made upon her. Sevier is fortunate in her leader.

TODAY BY EMILY BURTON January 5, 1920. Dear Pi Phis: The New Year has just come in and as I am to write to you I believe it is a very good time to contrast the new with the old. Life here in the mountains is changing rapidly, and though there is plenty of local color here still, I am sure you would be surprised at some of the changes in the country and the people. I am sure you have all heard of the hard trip that lay between Sevierville and Gatlinburg. Not more than four or five years ago it meant fourteen miles of travel in a buggy or hack, through mud holes and over rocks, across fords and up hill and down hill. Though the. hills and mud holes of the last seven miles still remain, there is now a stretch of seven miles of good pike road and in the spring and summer months one can come through with Mr. Huff, Lilliard Maples or Salt, the mail man, in one of those marvelous little ma-chines, ' No longer would a mountaineer living along the Gatlinbag road:-ay, as I read a Tennessee mountaineer did say when a horseman drew irem on the deeply rutted road in front of his cabin, "Them roads is *le with them automobyles." Why, do many come up here," asked' th 'surprised visitor. "Many? Why, stranger, I don't believe there air a week but what one goes by." You remember too, doubtless, how a few years ago 'strangers were regarded with curiosity and distrust. Many people come to Gatlin-burg now for business purposes, for the approach of the railroad has increased interest in the lumbering projects here. Also the advent of the automobile, feasible roads, and Mr. Huff's hotel have brought summer visitors and they no longer are considered by the people as strange "fetched ons." Again, we no longer teach in a little one room school house but have our splendid four room, steam heated school house, with large library and manual training and domestic science equipment. The teachers, too, have been benefited as much as the school by the improvements made in the last few years. We are very "comfy" now in .our steam heated house, we no longer have to get up before day-break to wash the dishes and sweep up before school. We have a dear Aunt Lizzie who looks after us and we are free to do our best for the kiddies at school. GATLINBURG IN 1920 481 We are beginning the new year very happily, with three new students in the dormitories. This first day of school was extremely cold with snow on the ground and everything frozen up yet two children, brother and sister, walked from Little River, nine miles away, to enter school. We are very glad to have won another new family to the school. It happened this way. One Saturday we were visiting way up one of the creeks. We had gone until we were close to big Smokey. On our way back we stopped at a house we never had GOING HOME FROM SCHOOL, 1919-20 visited before. The front part seemed deserted so we went around to the back door and knocked. A voice said, "Come in," and we entered. By a huge fire place sat an old man, hob-nailing a shoe. We sat, and talked to him for a few minutes when he told us that his family was in trouble, his son's wife was away from home and very ill with a disease from which he was sure she must die. No doctor could help her he thought, for a woman in the Bible had been afflicted with the same sickness and doctors had not been able to heal her, it was the 482 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Christ who brought her relief. The faith of the old man was wonderful. Some of the children then came in. There were six for the grandfather and father to care for. Such a pitiful sight those children were. They were unwashed and uncombed and the "least one," just two years old, had but a dress on, not another bit of clothing. A week later Aunt Lizzie and I went back. The mother had been brought home on a stretcher. She looked very frail and was incapable of doing more than sit by the fire a while each day. Clothes had been sent us for the family and Aunt Lizzie took the baby, "stripped" her, gave her a bath and put the clean clothes on. The mother and father were very pleased with the warm clothes and accepted them in a nice way. Early the next morning three of the children appeared at the cottage each with a big apple. for us. They had come to start in school. One of the little girls was wearing a kimona that had been given, as a wrap, and the boy had an undershirt on over his shirt. You can see how much they needed the help and how appreciative they were. It is' in the young people that the change comes. We do not see a great difference in the home life of the mountaineer, for the older people cling to the old customs. Miss Ann Cobb, of the Hindman School in Kentucky Mountains has written a little poem, telling of the coming of the new ways in the mountains. I quote it for its true on Little Pigeon too. "The ways of the world will be holding up Cyarr Sorry ways, the old ways, They've a call to go. Only when you're grave-bound Changing's allus slow. Old folks will bide by the old ways up Cyarr." Faithfully yours, EMILY BURTON. FRIDAY AFTERNOON IN THE SCHOOLROOM By RUTH STURLEY, Washington A Two o'clock and an expectant stir goes through the "big room" for it is Friday afternoon and the day for the reading of the school magazine. "Books" are over for the week and school itself will "break" when teacher asks someone to ring the bell at two-thirty. GATLINBURG IN 1920 483 itWho will put away the ink wells?". and "Who will clean the boards and erasers ?" "Let's get our desks in order." While these things are being done will the Pi Phis please try to realize that this is their school, and that these attractive girls and boys who look more as if they came from homes in a small town than from mountain cabins are the results of the school's existence among them for the past eight years. Some of the twenty-five present have never been to any other school and are now in the seventh and eighth grades. Those four in the corner at the back of the room are doing first year high school work. What do they all think of the school? What are their ambitions? Is the school meeting their needs? Do the results justify a more expansive opening of Pi Phi purses and a spring freshet of sympathy and understanding from Pi Phi hearts all over the United States to this little corner of the world shut in by creeks and the mountains? Perhaps if we listen very quietly and carefully to the reading of the magazine we will be able to answer these questions ourselves. Let us hear from Jim Huff first whose contribution explains the gaily decorated book from which he reads the'following : OUR SCHOOL MAGAZINE I am going to tell you about our school magazine which is called the Appalachian News. The first thing done in the making of our magazine is Cora and Tom McCarter, Rose Carr and Estel Huff (our ninth graders) get together and make out the subjects for us to write about. When we have them written we give them our papers and .they correct them and then they return them to be copied in ink. After we have them copied we give them to Estel Huff and he puts them all in order and sews them together. Every other Friday each boy and girl reads his own topic. Jim is a very practical and hard working boy, as brief in his speech as in his writing and a great contrast to his dreamer brother, Estel. But he is reading something more: I expect to be a lumberman and when I want to build me a house or a barn I will have the timber to build them. If I ever am a saw miller I will not quit it until I have sawed every tree in Sevier County that I can get hold of. The third member of the Huff family in the big room is Stella, one of the brightest and most active girls in school and unlike her two older brothers always eager to take part in the debates. Although only twelve years old next month, she, with the help of another girl, 484 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI looked after the household nearly all summer as her mother had to be in charge of the hotel. She reads her plans for the future. I expect to go through school here, then go to Jefferson City to school, then to college. After this I expect to teach school at Stoneham, Mass. I want to teach in the primary and domestic science departments. Then I think I want to go to Europe in an aeroplane and see the ruins of France and Belgium, also the Kaiser if he is there. While I am there I want to, see England's large navy. Then I am coming back to Gatlinburg, Tenn. Elmer Oakley is from one of the poorest families around here. This is his ambition: In the future I expect to make a teacher for school and further on in the future I expect to make a book-keeper and build me a library of my own. Of the three sisters, Rose, Lithia, and Ethel Carr, two express the desire to go on to college and become teachers while the third is going to be a foreign missionary in China. Little Maud Clabo who lives nearly three miles away with a grand-father and step grandmother, as her mother is dead and she has no father, reads this: I expect to be a nurse and go to Belgium and take care of some little Belgian children that have no father nor mother. Then I will bring one or two home with me and let them see the place, then take them back to their native land and find them a nice home to live in and then go and take care of some more children. We have more plans for high school, college, teaching, and travel expressed by the others. Levator Whaley who is unusually slow and quiet surprises us all by varying his teaching with a year of running a street car followed by three years in the aerial mail service between South America and Europe. The "Question Box" consists of questions handed in by the boys and girls and answered by Tom McCarter. He is a real farmer but like his three sisters, is most eager for an education and willing to do anything to get it. Let's listen to some of them: Q. How would electric lights help Gatlinburg? A. It would help her in many different ways, give better lights for the people to have societies by night and save lots of coal oil, etc. Q. What is the best thing that can be done? A. Obey the ten commandments of the Bible and obey your school teacher. Q. Can we do wrong that good may come? GATLINBURG IN 1 920 485 A. No, we cannot for the ten commandments teach us what ought to be done. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." "Whatsoever ye sow ye shall also reap." Q. Which is worth the most, education or a long life? A. Both put together is worth the most. You can't be well educated without-having a long life because a woman or man never gets too far but they can learn new ideas. Q. What do you think ought to be done to the Kaiser and his son? A. I don't believe there ought to be anything done with them for when they die the Devil will take care of them. I do believe if the other nations try to do anything with them Germany will declare war against them again. That we may see ourselves as others see us hear dear white headed Arlena Maples read a description of the school house. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is located in the 1 1th civil district of Sevier County of Tennessee, southeast side of the Little Pigeon River. The building is constructed on a piece of land containing about thirty-five acres and about one hundred yards from the river on an elevated piece of land near a beautiful pine grove very pleasantly and conveniently located with roads leading from all points. The surroundings are grandstand, cottage, flagpole, and the play ground in front. It has been built over three years. It is oblong and is made of wood, the top covered with tin and the foundation is made of brick. It is a very plain building. Without comment let us pass on from the reading of "How to Make Molasses," "Origin of St. Valentine's Day," "Jokes," "Current Events," "Our Debates" and listen to Arlie McCarter read: Morals of Gatlinburg "The morals of Gatlinburg are good. One can only judge by what he sees. Traveling around through the vicinity is the best way to judge the conduct of its .people. Everyone who lives here tries to do the right thing as far as he knows and understands. The young men conduct themselves in such a manner that they are due a good name and have brought honor to their community. Not only are the men good but the women as well. Most of the good things we have here were brought about by the influence of our women. The church of Gatlinburg is a working body for the betterment of the people. 486 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Our school is a live wire in this community. Now in conclusion I give to the people of the community the name of being true citizens who stand ready to share their burdens in all undertakings for the betterment of our country." GOOD MOUNTAIN STOCK It is just 2 :30 as Arlie finishes but before we ring the bell let me whisper something in your ears that ought to warm "the cockles of your hearts." The other day when the question was asked in com'-munity history class, "What do you learn at home that you do not learn at school ?' ' a great discussion arose which resulted in the verdict expressed by Ethel Carr. "Well, I declare, I just can't think of nary a thing I haven't learned here at school." Is it worth while? GATLINBURG IN 1920 487 LETTERS FROM MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL ADVISORY BOARD Gatlinburg, Tennessee. December 12, 1919. Pi Beta Phi School: I take this pleasure to congratulate you for what your school has done for our community and theadvancement and improvement on our boys and girls. I think it is wonderful how they can perform on the stage, debate subjects and recite recitations. A great number of them could not read or write, in fact many of them did not know anything when you came to us with your Blessed School. I can't express the gratitude of my heart for what you have already done for our children. My good wife and I are working hard on our little mountain farm to clothe and feed our little ones. Was it not for your school we never could educate them in the world. I feel very glad that I helped you with a little mite of money to establish vour school. I wish I was able to help with more. Your good work is just begun. There are many boys, girls, and children yet that must be brought into your school. Many of them are poor and with-out much clothes, yet these precious minds must be developed by somebody, or else they will grow to the stature of ignorant manhood and womanhood. I feel you all need help in a financial way but wherever is it to come from? Probably somebody will get a vision of the great work you are doing and lend a helping hand to develop our boys and girls. Yours truly, STEVE WHALEY. Sevierville, Tenn., January 6, 1920. My dear Miss Langmaid: I was very sorry indeed not to have seen you again before you took your final departure. I did not expect you to leave so soon for I wanted to express my appreciation of your personal work and also the work of your society in the community in which your school is located. The school does not affect only the community in which it is located but all Sev'ier County and will make its way into all the country. When I go into the community now on professional trips I find the food is better prepared, the houses are better kept and the children 488 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI are better cared for. This shows me that the seed being sown there will be gathered up in sheaves many days hence. I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. . I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the school. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated. I. think, by the wise course pursued by those in power, this idea has been done' away with. The people now seem to be working together for the advancement of the school and community. I want to say that in no part of the country in which I have been, have I ever found people with more natural ability and people who were more susceptible to good influences and knowledge than the people of Gatlinburg. From this community came John H. Reagan, Ex. U. S. Senator and Postmaster General under Grover Cleveland. When a young man leaving Gatlinburg, he could neither read or write but when he landed in Houston, Texas, with his great brain he was elected sheriff of that county. He saw the great need of knowing how to write his name and keep his accounts so he immediately went to work and before his term had expired he had a fairly good education. He was then elected to the State Legislature and in turn was elected Speaker of the House. After this he was elected to Congress, Governor of the State, U. S. Senator and appointed to Cleveland's Cabinet. In fact, he was in his day a national character of distinction. Probably all the people of this community are his relatives by blood and many young men of this section have fully as much gray matter as did this distinguished man. 'I feel like your work here has just begun and I. know God will prosper and ,bless the donors of this great institution. I want to take this method of thanking you and the people who are behind this institution in the name of Gatlinburg and Sevier County for the great good you are doing for the world through Sevier County people. Believe me to be, Very sincerely, Z. D. MASSEY. GATLINBURG IN 1920 489 LETTERS FROM OUR PUPILS Gatlinburg, Tenn., January 6, 1920. Dear Friends: I am a girl of thirteen years of age and go to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. I am in the 8th grade. I like it fine and hope the other boys and girls do. I have been going to school ever since I was six years of age. I am going through school here and then go to some high school and get my education, then teach school. I think we have the best school in Sevier County. Yours as ever, ARLENA MAPLES. Gatlinburg, Tenn., January 6, 1920. 11f, dear Friends: I'm in school and enjoying a nice time. My studies include gram-mar, spelling, agriculture, writing, ancient history and algebra. I like them all fine. I also take cooking and sewing. We certainly are having good school this year. I think it is the best school we have had for a year or two. I have such a nice teacher and when we don't have good lessons she don't seem to enjoy it very much. I sure did have a nice time Christmas vacation. Did you? I went to church at Huskey's Grove Christmas day. Near the church house is lots of spruce pines, it is a very beautiful place. It is very cold here, some snow on the ground and the river frozen over with ice and some of the boys have been skating. From your friend, POLLY MCCARTER. Gatlinburg, Tenn., March 11, 1920. Dear Pi Beta Phis: How I wish each of you IT B ,l knew just how much the dear old II B (I) school has meat to our community and the many girls and boys of this mountainous section of the Great Smokies. In the year 1912 the school was first started with one teacher, Miss Martha Hill from Nashville. 490 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI The II B 41 purchased their land from Mr. E. E. Ogle which had a three roomed cottage, a barn and a store house. I lived in this little cottage with Miss Martha hill for a year. Soon the barn was torn away and used for wood. The II B 4 repaired the store house for the purpose of using as a school building which was used for the kindergarten. Our county school house which was a one roomed house with eight windows, four on each side, one door in the back with two rows of long benches with no desks. The floor was made of spruce pine and had seasoned out till there was great cracks in the floor. This county house happened to be located on the II B cl, property. The II B (I) then bought this building and the store house and old county school house was where the II B T school first started their school. By this time the county had built a two roomed building which was not far away. The next year the county ran their school as usual but they were now in the new building and the II B (I) in the old ones. Soon the dear little II B I school begain to grow the people saw what the school was doing for the boys and girls who attended. The girls and boys walked for many miles away leaving the county schools till our little building would hold them no longer. When in 1914 the II B (I went to work and built a six roomed school house with all the desks necessary, and running water, good heating system and were equiped for manuel training and domestic sience and year by year we have more teachers till now we have four. In 1916 they finished up an eleven roomed house for the teachers. The girls and boys of this community enjoy open house in this building on Friday nights we sometimes sing and play games. The II B 1 now use the old cottage for a girl's dormitory and recently have remodeled the Stuart cottage for which they use as a boy's dormitory. The school has not only inthused the people to build good roads in our community so the children can come to school in more ease, but inthused the girls and boys to look forward in life to bigger and better things. We sincerely hope with the help of the II B I we can some day have a high school and we wish there could be some plane to light up the building. We sometimes have our B. Y. P. U. in the school GATLINBURG IN 1920 491 building on Sunday nights. And we have open society every other Friday night, the teachers are compelled to carry lamps from the cottage. Yours sincerely, EMMA MAPLES. The Development of Agricultural Resources [TIrE ARROW is indebted to Mary Keown, Florida A, '14, for the cut and comment given below which appeared originally in the Tennessee Extension Review for October 25, 1919. From the early days of the Settlement School, our workers have been deeply interested in the agricultural problems of the community and, as stated elsewhere, the first canning club in the county was organized in Gatlinburg in 1914 through the efforts of Miss Pollard. Our present school staff is working in close cooperation with Miss Whittle. It is a pleasure to introduce her to ARROW readers for she is constantly helping to advance our work.--EDITOR.] A WOMAN LEAD THEM The outstanding county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair this year was from Sevier County. Sevier is strictly an agricultural county. Everything produced is of the soil. The lumber interest is large, and there are good flour 492 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI mills, but these depend directly on the soil for their raw material. It is a land of farmers who only need leadership to awaken in them community pride and consciousness, to realize the possibilities of their soils. They have found a leader in the person of their county home demonstration agent, Miss Annie Whittle. Through the effective cooperation of efficient committees, all working hard, and working as one, the people of Sevier County put on the first prize exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fairs It was an inspiring sight during the opening hours of the fair to see the busy committee men and women working together, planning and installing -the exhibit. 'Every agricultural phase of the county was represented. The products exhibited were excellent in quality and variety, and the installation was attractive, without being too prominent a feature. Miss Whittle was everywhere; her advice was constantly sought, and her executive ability was equal to all demands made upon her. Sevier is fortunate in her leader.

        480 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI GLIMPSES OF THE LIFE OF. TODAY BY EMILY BURTON January 5, 1920. Dear Pi Phis: The New Year has just come in and as I am to write to you I believe it is a very good time to contrast the new with the old. Life here in the mountains is changing rapidly, and though there is plenty of local color here still, I am sure you would be surprised at some of the changes in the country and the people. I am sure you have all heard of the hard trip that lay between Sevierville and Gatlinburg. Not more than four or five years ago it meant fourteen miles of travel in a buggy or hack, through mud holes and over rocks, across fords and up hill and down hill. Though the. hills and mud holes of the last seven miles still remain, there is now a stretch of seven miles of good pike road and in the spring and summer months one can come through with Mr. Huff, Lilliard Maples or Salt, the mail man, in one of those marvelous little ma-chines, ' No longer would a mountaineer living along the Gatlinbag road:-ay, as I read a Tennessee mountaineer did say when a horseman drew irem on the deeply rutted road in front of his cabin, "Them roads is *le with them automobyles." Why, do many come up here," asked' th 'surprised visitor. "Many? Why, stranger, I don't believe there air a week but what one goes by." You remember too, doubtless, how a few years ago 'strangers were regarded with curiosity and distrust. Many people come to Gatlin-burg now for business purposes, for the approach of the railroad has increased interest in the lumbering projects here. Also the advent of the automobile, feasible roads, and Mr. Huff's hotel have brought summer visitors and they no longer are considered by the people as strange "fetched ons." Again, we no longer teach in a little one room school house but have our splendid four room, steam heated school house, with large library and manual training and domestic science equipment. The teachers, too, have been benefited as much as the school by the improvements made in the last few years. We are very "comfy" now in .our steam heated house, we no longer have to get up before day-break to wash the dishes and sweep up before school. We have a dear Aunt Lizzie who looks after us and we are free to do our best for the kiddies at school. GATLINBURG IN 1920 481 We are beginning the new year very happily, with three new students in the dormitories. This first day of school was extremely cold with snow on the ground and everything frozen up yet two children, brother and sister, walked from Little River, nine miles away, to enter school. We are very glad to have won another new family to the school. It happened this way. One Saturday we were visiting way up one of the creeks. We had gone until we were close to big Smokey.

FRIDAY AFTERNOON IN THE SCHOOLROOM By RUTH STURLEY, Washington A Two o'clock and an expectant stir goes through the "big room" for it is Friday afternoon and the day for the reading of the school magazine. "Books" are over for the week and school itself will "break" when teacher asks someone to ring the bell at two-thirty.

Without comment let us pass on from the reading of "How to Make Molasses," "Origin of St. Valentine's Day," "Jokes," "Current Events," "Our Debates" and listen to Arlie McCarter read: Morals of Gatlinburg "The morals of Gatlinburg are good. One can only judge by what he sees. Traveling around through the vicinity is the best way to judge the conduct of its .people. Everyone who lives here tries to do the right thing as far as he knows and understands. The young men conduct themselves in such a manner that they are due a good name and have brought honor to their community. Not only are the men good but the women as well. Most of the good things we have here were brought about by the influence of our women. The church of Gatlinburg is a working body for the betterment of the people. 486 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Our school is a live wire in this community. Now in conclusion I give to the people of the community the name of being true citizens who stand ready to share their burdens in all undertakings for the betterment of our country." GOOD MOUNTAIN STOCK It is just 2 :30 as Arlie finishes but before we ring the bell let me whisper something in your ears that ought to warm "the cockles of your hearts." The other day when the question was asked in com'-munity history class, "What do you learn at home that you do not learn at school ?' ' a great discussion arose which resulted in the verdict expressed by Ethel Carr. "Well, I declare, I just can't think of nary a thing I haven't learned here at school." Is it worth while? GATLINBURG IN 1920 487 LETTERS FROM MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL ADVISORY BOARD Gatlinburg, Tennessee. December 12, 1919. Pi Beta Phi School: I take this pleasure to congratulate you for what your school has done for our community and theadvancement and improvement on our boys and girls. I think it is wonderful how they can perform on the stage, debate subjects and recite recitations. A great number of them could not read or write, in fact many of them did not know anything when you came to us with your Blessed School. I can't express the gratitude of my heart for what you have already done for our children. My good wife and I are working hard on our little mountain farm to clothe and feed our little ones. Was it not for your school we never could educate them in the world. I feel very glad that I helped you with a little mite of money to establish vour school. I wish I was able to help with more. Your good work is just begun. There are many boys, girls, and children yet that must be brought into your school. Many of them are poor and with-out much clothes, yet these precious minds must be developed by somebody, or else they will grow to the stature of ignorant manhood and womanhood. I feel you all need help in a financial way but wherever is it to come from? Probably somebody will get a vision of the great work you are doing and lend a helping hand to develop our boys and girls. Yours truly, STEVE WHALEY. Sevierville, Tenn., January 6, 1920. My dear Miss Langmaid: I was very sorry indeed not to have seen you again before you took your final departure. I did not expect you to leave so soon for I wanted to express my appreciation of your personal work and also the work of your society in the community in which your school is located. The school does not affect only the community in which it is located but all Sev'ier County and will make its way into all the country. When I go into the community now on professional trips I find the food is better prepared, the houses are better kept and the children 488 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI are better cared for. This shows me that the seed being sown there will be gathered up in sheaves many days hence. I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. . I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the school. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated. I. think, by the wise course pursued by those in power, this idea has been done' away with. The people now seem to be working together for the advancement of the school and community. I want to say that in no part of the country in which I have been, have I ever found people with more natural ability and people who were more susceptible to good influences and knowledge than the people of Gatlinburg. From this community came John H. Reagan, Ex. U. S. Senator and Postmaster General under Grover Cleveland. When a young man leaving Gatlinburg, he could neither read or write but when he landed in Houston, Texas, with his great brain he was elected sheriff of that county. He saw the great need of knowing how to write his name and keep his accounts so he immediately went to work and before his term had expired he had a fairly good education. He was then elected to the State Legislature and in turn was elected Speaker of the House. After this he was elected to Congress, Governor of the State, U. S. Senator and appointed to Cleveland's Cabinet. In fact, he was in his day a national character of distinction. Probably all the people of this community are his relatives by blood and many young men of this section have fully as much gray matter as did this distinguished man. 'I feel like your work here has just begun and I. know God will prosper and ,bless the donors of this great institution. I want to take this method of thanking you and the people who are behind this institution in the name of Gatlinburg and Sevier County for the great good you are doing for the world through Sevier County people. Believe me to be, Very sincerely, Z. D. MASSEY. GATLINBURG IN 1920 489 LETTERS FROM OUR PUPILS Gatlinburg, Tenn., January 6, 1920. Dear Friends: I am a girl of thirteen years of age and go to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. I am in the 8th grade. I like it fine and hope the other boys and girls do. I have been going to school ever since I was six years of age. I am going through school here and then go to some high school and get my education, then teach school. I think we have the best school in Sevier County. Yours as ever, ARLENA MAPLES. Gatlinburg, Tenn., January 6, 1920. 11f, dear Friends: I'm in school and enjoying a nice time. My studies include gram-mar, spelling, agriculture, writing, ancient history and algebra. I like them all fine. I also take cooking and sewing. We certainly are having good school this year. I think it is the best school we have had for a year or two. I have such a nice teacher and when we don't have good lessons she don't seem to enjoy it very much. I sure did have a nice time Christmas vacation. Did you? I went to church at Huskey's Grove Christmas day. Near the church house is lots of spruce pines, it is a very beautiful place. It is very cold here, some snow on the ground and the river frozen over with ice and some of the boys have been skating. From your friend, POLLY MCCARTER. Gatlinburg, Tenn., March 11, 1920. Dear Pi Beta Phis: How I wish each of you IT B ,l knew just how much the dear old II B (I) school has meat to our community and the many girls and boys of this mountainous section of the Great Smokies. In the year 1912 the school was first started with one teacher, Miss Martha Hill from Nashville. 490 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI The II B 41 purchased their land from Mr. E. E. Ogle which had a three roomed cottage, a barn and a store house. I lived in this little cottage with Miss Martha hill for a year. Soon the barn was torn away and used for wood. The II B 4 repaired the store house for the purpose of using as a school building which was used for the kindergarten. Our county school house which was a one roomed house with eight windows, four on each side, one door in the back with two rows of long benches with no desks. The floor was made of spruce pine and had seasoned out till there was great cracks in the floor. This county house happened to be located on the II B cl, property. The II B (I) then bought this building and the store house and old county school house was where the II B T school first started their school. By this time the county had built a two roomed building which was not far away. The next year the county ran their school as usual but they were now in the new building and the II B (I) in the old ones. Soon the dear little II B I school begain to grow the people saw what the school was doing for the boys and girls who attended. The girls and boys walked for many miles away leaving the county schools till our little building would hold them no longer. When in 1914 the II B (I went to work and built a six roomed school house with all the desks necessary, and running water, good heating system and were equiped for manuel training and domestic sience and year by year we have more teachers till now we have four. In 1916 they finished up an eleven roomed house for the teachers. The girls and boys of this community enjoy open house in this building on Friday nights we sometimes sing and play games. The II B 1 now use the old cottage for a girl's dormitory and recently have remodeled the Stuart cottage for which they use as a boy's dormitory. The school has not only inthused the people to build good roads in our community so the children can come to school in more ease, but inthused the girls and boys to look forward in life to bigger and better things. We sincerely hope with the help of the II B I we can some day have a high school and we wish there could be some plane to light up the building. We sometimes have our B. Y. P. U. in the school GATLINBURG IN 1920 491 building on Sunday nights. And we have open society every other Friday night, the teachers are compelled to carry lamps from the cottage. Yours sincerely, EMMA MAPLES. The Development of Agricultural Resources [TIrE ARROW is indebted to Mary Keown, Florida A, '14, for the cut and comment given below which appeared originally in the Tennessee Extension Review for October 25, 1919. From the early days of the Settlement School, our workers have been deeply interested in the agricultural problems of the community and, as stated elsewhere, the first canning club in the county was organized in Gatlinburg in 1914 through the efforts of Miss Pollard. Our present school staff is working in close cooperation with Miss Whittle. It is a pleasure to introduce her to ARROW readers for she is constantly helping to advance our work.--EDITOR.] A WOMAN LEAD THEM The outstanding county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair this year was from Sevier County. Sevier is strictly an agricultural county. Everything produced is of the soil. The lumber interest is large, and there are good flour 492 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI mills, but these depend directly on the soil for their raw material. It is a land of farmers who only need leadership to awaken in them community pride and consciousness, to realize the possibilities of their soils. They have found a leader in the person of their county home demonstration agent, Miss Annie Whittle. Through the effective cooperation of efficient committees, all working hard, and working as one, the people of Sevier County put on the first prize exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fairs It was an inspiring sight during the opening hours of the fair to see the busy committee men and women working together, planning and installing -the exhibit. 'Every agricultural phase of the county was represented. The products exhibited were excellent in quality and variety, and the installation was attractive, without being too prominent a feature. Miss Whittle was everywhere; her advice was constantly sought, and her executive ability was equal to all demands made upon her. Sevier is fortunate in her leader.

        482 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Christ who brought her relief. The faith of the old man was wonderful. Some of the children then came in. There were six for the grandfather and father to care for. Such a pitiful sight those children were. They were unwashed and uncombed and the "least one," just two years old, had but a dress on, not another bit of clothing. A week later Aunt Lizzie and I went back. The mother had been brought home on a stretcher. She looked very frail and was incapable of doing more than sit by the fire a while each day. Clothes had been sent us for the family and Aunt Lizzie took the baby, "stripped" her, gave her a bath and put the clean clothes on. The mother and father were very pleased with the warm clothes and accepted them in a nice way. Early the next morning three of the children appeared at the cottage each with a big apple. for us. They had come to start in school. One of the little girls was wearing a kimona that had been given, as a wrap, and the boy had an undershirt on over his shirt. You can see how much they needed the help and how appreciative they were. It is' in the young people that the change comes. We do not see a great difference in the home life of the mountaineer, for the older people cling to the old customs. Miss Ann Cobb, of the Hindman School in Kentucky Mountains has written a little poem, telling of the coming of the new ways in the mountains. I quote it for its true on Little Pigeon too. "The ways of the world will be holding up Cyarr Sorry ways, the old ways, They've a call to go. Only when you're grave-bound Changing's allus slow. Old folks will bide by the old ways up Cyarr." Faithfully yours, EMILY BURTON. FRIDAY AFTERNOON IN THE SCHOOLROOM By RUTH STURLEY, Washington A Two o'clock and an expectant stir goes through the "big room" for it is Friday afternoon and the day for the reading of the school magazine. "Books" are over for the week and school itself will "break" when teacher asks someone to ring the bell at two-thirty. GATLINBURG IN 1920 483 itWho will put away the ink wells?". and "Who will clean the boards and erasers ?" "Let's get our desks in order." While these things are being done will the Pi Phis please try to realize that this is their school, and that these attractive girls and boys who look more as if they came from homes in a small town than from mountain cabins are the results of the school's existence among them for the past eight years. Some of the twenty-five present have never been to any other school and are now in the seventh and eighth grades. Those four in the corner at the back of the room are doing first year high school work. What do they all think of the school? What are their ambitions? Is the school meeting their needs? Do the results justify a more expansive opening of Pi Phi purses and a spring freshet of sympathy and understanding from Pi Phi hearts all over the United States to this little corner of the world shut in by creeks and the mountains? Perhaps if we listen very quietly and carefully to the reading of the magazine we will be able to answer these questions ourselves. Let us hear from Jim Huff first whose contribution explains the gaily decorated book from which he reads the'following : OUR SCHOOL MAGAZINE I am going to tell you about our school magazine which is called the Appalachian News. The first thing done in the making of our magazine is Cora and Tom McCarter, Rose Carr and Estel Huff (our ninth graders) get together and make out the subjects for us to write about. When we have them written we give them our papers and .they correct them and then they return them to be copied in ink. After we have them copied we give them to Estel Huff and he puts them all in order and sews them together. Every other Friday each boy and girl reads his own topic. Jim is a very practical and hard working boy, as brief in his speech as in his writing and a great contrast to his dreamer brother, Estel. But he is reading something more: I expect to be a lumberman and when I want to build me a house or a barn I will have the timber to build them. If I ever am a saw miller I will not quit it until I have sawed every tree in Sevier County that I can get hold of. The third member of the Huff family in the big room is Stella, one of the brightest and most active girls in school and unlike her two older brothers always eager to take part in the debates. Although only twelve years old next month, she, with the help of another girl, 484 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI looked after the household nearly all summer as her mother had to be in charge of the hotel. She reads her plans for the future. I expect to go through school here, then go to Jefferson City to school, then to college. After this I expect to teach school at Stoneham, Mass. I want to teach in the primary and domestic science departments. Then I think I want to go to Europe in an aeroplane and see the ruins of France and Belgium, also the Kaiser if he is there. While I am there I want to, see England's large navy. Then I am coming back to Gatlinburg, Tenn. Elmer Oakley is from one of the poorest families around here. This is his ambition: In the future I expect to make a teacher for school and further on in the future I expect to make a book-keeper and build me a library of my own. Of the three sisters, Rose, Lithia, and Ethel Carr, two express the desire to go on to college and become teachers while the third is going to be a foreign missionary in China. Little Maud Clabo who lives nearly three miles away with a grand-father and step grandmother, as her mother is dead and she has no father, reads this: I expect to be a nurse and go to Belgium and take care of some little Belgian children that have no father nor mother. Then I will bring one or two home with me and let them see the place, then take them back to their native land and find them a nice home to live in and then go and take care of some more children. We have more plans for high school, college, teaching, and travel expressed by the others. Levator Whaley who is unusually slow and quiet surprises us all by varying his teaching with a year of running a street car followed by three years in the aerial mail service between South America and Europe. The "Question Box" consists of questions handed in by the boys and girls and answered by Tom McCarter. He is a real farmer but like his three sisters, is most eager for an education and willing to do anything to get it. Let's listen to some of them: Q. How would electric lights help Gatlinburg? A. It would help her in many different ways, give better lights for the people to have societies by night and save lots of coal oil, etc. Q. What is the best thing that can be done? A. Obey the ten commandments of the Bible and obey your school teacher. Q. Can we do wrong that good may come? GATLINBURG IN 1 920 485 A. No, we cannot for the ten commandments teach us what ought to be done. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." "Whatsoever ye sow ye shall also reap." Q. Which is worth the most, education or a long life? A. Both put together is worth the most. You can't be well educated without-having a long life because a woman or man never gets too far but they can learn new ideas. Q. What do you think ought to be done to the Kaiser and his son? A. I don't believe there ought to be anything done with them for when they die the Devil will take care of them. I do believe if the other nations try to do anything with them Germany will declare war against them again. That we may see ourselves as others see us hear dear white headed Arlena Maples read a description of the school house. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is located in the 1 1th civil district of Sevier County of Tennessee, southeast side of the Little Pigeon River. The building is constructed on a piece of land containing about thirty-five acres and about one hundred yards from the river on an elevated piece of land near a beautiful pine grove very pleasantly and conveniently located with roads leading from all points. The surroundings are grandstand, cottage, flagpole, and the play ground in front. It has been built over three years. It is oblong and is made of wood, the top covered with tin and the foundation is made of brick. It is a very plain building. Without comment let us pass on from the reading of "How to Make Molasses," "Origin of St. Valentine's Day," "Jokes," "Current Events," "Our Debates" and listen to Arlie McCarter read: Morals of Gatlinburg "The morals of Gatlinburg are good.

The "Question Box" consists of questions handed in by the boys and girls and answered by Tom McCarter. He is a real farmer but like his three sisters, is most eager for an education and willing to do anything to get it. Let's listen to some of them: Q. How would electric lights help Gatlinburg? A. It would help her in many different ways, give better lights for the people to have societies by night and save lots of coal oil, etc. Q. What is the best thing that can be done? A. Obey the ten commandments of the Bible and obey your school teacher. Q. Can we do wrong that good may come? GATLINBURG IN 1 920 485 A. No, we cannot for the ten commandments teach us what ought to be done. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." "Whatsoever ye sow ye shall also reap." Q. Which is worth the most, education or a long life? A. Both put together is worth the most. You can't be well educated without-having a long life because a woman or man never gets too far but they can learn new ideas. Q. What do you think ought to be done to the Kaiser and his son? A. I don't believe there ought to be anything done with them for when they die the Devil will take care of them. I do believe if the other nations try to do anything with them Germany will declare war against them again. That we may see ourselves as others see us hear dear white headed Arlena Maples read a description of the school house. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is located in the 1 1th civil district of Sevier County of Tennessee, southeast side of the Little Pigeon River. The building is constructed on a piece of land containing about thirty-five acres and about one hundred yards from the river on an elevated piece of land near a beautiful pine grove very pleasantly and conveniently located with roads leading from all points. The surroundings are grandstand, cottage, flagpole, and the play ground in front. It has been built over three years. It is oblong and is made of wood, the top covered with tin and the foundation is made of brick. It is a very plain building. Without comment let us pass on from the reading of "How to Make Molasses," "Origin of St. Valentine's Day," "Jokes," "Current Events," "Our Debates" and listen to Arlie McCarter read: Morals of Gatlinburg "The morals of Gatlinburg are good. One can only judge by what he sees. Traveling around through the vicinity is the best way to judge the conduct of its .people. Everyone who lives here tries to do the right thing as far as he knows and understands. The young men conduct themselves in such a manner that they are due a good name and have brought honor to their community. Not only are the men good but the women as well. Most of the good things we have here were brought about by the influence of our women. The church of Gatlinburg is a working body for the betterment of the people. 486 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Our school is a live wire in this community. Now in conclusion I give to the people of the community the name of being true citizens who stand ready to share their burdens in all undertakings for the betterment of our country." GOOD MOUNTAIN STOCK It is just 2 :30 as Arlie finishes but before we ring the bell let me whisper something in your ears that ought to warm "the cockles of your hearts." The other day when the question was asked in com'-munity history class, "What do you learn at home that you do not learn at school ?' ' a great discussion arose which resulted in the verdict expressed by Ethel Carr. "Well, I declare, I just can't think of nary a thing I haven't learned here at school." Is it worth while? GATLINBURG IN 1920 487 LETTERS FROM MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL ADVISORY BOARD Gatlinburg, Tennessee. December 12, 1919. Pi Beta Phi School: I take this pleasure to congratulate you for what your school has done for our community and theadvancement and improvement on our boys and girls. I think it is wonderful how they can perform on the stage, debate subjects and recite recitations. A great number of them could not read or write, in fact many of them did not know anything when you came to us with your Blessed School. I can't express the gratitude of my heart for what you have already done for our children. My good wife and I are working hard on our little mountain farm to clothe and feed our little ones. Was it not for your school we never could educate them in the world. I feel very glad that I helped you with a little mite of money to establish vour school. I wish I was able to help with more. Your good work is just begun. There are many boys, girls, and children yet that must be brought into your school. Many of them are poor and with-out much clothes, yet these precious minds must be developed by somebody, or else they will grow to the stature of ignorant manhood and womanhood. I feel you all need help in a financial way but wherever is it to come from? Probably somebody will get a vision of the great work you are doing and lend a helping hand to develop our boys and girls. Yours truly, STEVE WHALEY. Sevierville, Tenn., January 6, 1920. My dear Miss Langmaid: I was very sorry indeed not to have seen you again before you took your final departure. I did not expect you to leave so soon for I wanted to express my appreciation of your personal work and also the work of your society in the community in which your school is located. The school does not affect only the community in which it is located but all Sev'ier County and will make its way into all the country. When I go into the community now on professional trips I find the food is better prepared, the houses are better kept and the children 488 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI are better cared for. This shows me that the seed being sown there will be gathered up in sheaves many days hence. I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. . I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the school. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated. I. think, by the wise course pursued by those in power, this idea has been done' away with. The people now seem to be working together for the advancement of the school and community. I want to say that in no part of the country in which I have been, have I ever found people with more natural ability and people who were more susceptible to good influences and knowledge than the people of Gatlinburg. From this community came John H. Reagan, Ex. U. S. Senator and Postmaster General under Grover Cleveland. When a young man leaving Gatlinburg, he could neither read or write but when he landed in Houston, Texas, with his great brain he was elected sheriff of that county. He saw the great need of knowing how to write his name and keep his accounts so he immediately went to work and before his term had expired he had a fairly good education. He was then elected to the State Legislature and in turn was elected Speaker of the House. After this he was elected to Congress, Governor of the State, U. S. Senator and appointed to Cleveland's Cabinet. In fact, he was in his day a national character of distinction. Probably all the people of this community are his relatives by blood and many young men of this section have fully as much gray matter as did this distinguished man. 'I feel like your work here has just begun and I. know God will prosper and ,bless the donors of this great institution. I want to take this method of thanking you and the people who are behind this institution in the name of Gatlinburg and Sevier County for the great good you are doing for the world through Sevier County people. Believe me to be, Very sincerely, Z. D. MASSEY. GATLINBURG IN 1920 489 LETTERS FROM OUR PUPILS Gatlinburg, Tenn., January 6, 1920. Dear Friends: I am a girl of thirteen years of age and go to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. I am in the 8th grade. I like it fine and hope the other boys and girls do. I have been going to school ever since I was six years of age. I am going through school here and then go to some high school and get my education, then teach school. I think we have the best school in Sevier County. Yours as ever, ARLENA MAPLES. Gatlinburg, Tenn., January 6, 1920. 11f, dear Friends: I'm in school and enjoying a nice time. My studies include gram-mar, spelling, agriculture, writing, ancient history and algebra. I like them all fine. I also take cooking and sewing. We certainly are having good school this year. I think it is the best school we have had for a year or two. I have such a nice teacher and when we don't have good lessons she don't seem to enjoy it very much. I sure did have a nice time Christmas vacation. Did you? I went to church at Huskey's Grove Christmas day. Near the church house is lots of spruce pines, it is a very beautiful place. It is very cold here, some snow on the ground and the river frozen over with ice and some of the boys have been skating. From your friend, POLLY MCCARTER. Gatlinburg, Tenn., March 11, 1920. Dear Pi Beta Phis: How I wish each of you IT B ,l knew just how much the dear old II B (I) school has meat to our community and the many girls and boys of this mountainous section of the Great Smokies. In the year 1912 the school was first started with one teacher, Miss Martha Hill from Nashville. 490 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI The II B 41 purchased their land from Mr. E. E. Ogle which had a three roomed cottage, a barn and a store house. I lived in this little cottage with Miss Martha hill for a year. Soon the barn was torn away and used for wood. The II B 4 repaired the store house for the purpose of using as a school building which was used for the kindergarten. Our county school house which was a one roomed house with eight windows, four on each side, one door in the back with two rows of long benches with no desks. The floor was made of spruce pine and had seasoned out till there was great cracks in the floor. This county house happened to be located on the II B cl, property. The II B (I) then bought this building and the store house and old county school house was where the II B T school first started their school. By this time the county had built a two roomed building which was not far away. The next year the county ran their school as usual but they were now in the new building and the II B (I) in the old ones. Soon the dear little II B I school begain to grow the people saw what the school was doing for the boys and girls who attended. The girls and boys walked for many miles away leaving the county schools till our little building would hold them no longer. When in 1914 the II B (I went to work and built a six roomed school house with all the desks necessary, and running water, good heating system and were equiped for manuel training and domestic sience and year by year we have more teachers till now we have four. In 1916 they finished up an eleven roomed house for the teachers. The girls and boys of this community enjoy open house in this building on Friday nights we sometimes sing and play games. The II B 1 now use the old cottage for a girl's dormitory and recently have remodeled the Stuart cottage for which they use as a boy's dormitory. The school has not only inthused the people to build good roads in our community so the children can come to school in more ease, but inthused the girls and boys to look forward in life to bigger and better things. We sincerely hope with the help of the II B I we can some day have a high school and we wish there could be some plane to light up the building. We sometimes have our B. Y. P. U. in the school GATLINBURG IN 1920 491 building on Sunday nights. And we have open society every other Friday night, the teachers are compelled to carry lamps from the cottage.

I lived in this little cottage with Miss Martha hill for a year. Soon the barn was torn away and used for wood. The II B 4 repaired the store house for the purpose of using as a school building which was used for the kindergarten. Our county school house which was a one roomed house with eight windows, four on each side, one door in the back with two rows of long benches with no desks. The floor was made of spruce pine and had seasoned out till there was great cracks in the floor. This county house happened to be located on the II B cl, property. The II B (I) then bought this building and the store house and old county school house was where the II B T school first started their school. By this time the county had built a two roomed building which was not far away. The next year the county ran their school as usual but they were now in the new building and the II B (I) in the old ones. Soon the dear little II B I school begain to grow the people saw what the school was doing for the boys and girls who attended. The girls and boys walked for many miles away leaving the county schools till our little building would hold them no longer. When in 1914 the II B (I went to work and built a six roomed school house with all the desks necessary, and running water, good heating system and were equiped for manuel training and domestic sience and year by year we have more teachers till now we have four. In 1916 they finished up an eleven roomed house for the teachers. The girls and boys of this community enjoy open house in this building on Friday nights we sometimes sing and play games. The II B 1 now use the old cottage for a girl's dormitory and recently have remodeled the Stuart cottage for which they use as a boy's dormitory. The school has not only inthused the people to build good roads in our community so the children can come to school in more ease, but inthused the girls and boys to look forward in life to bigger and better things. We sincerely hope with the help of the II B I we can some day have a high school and we wish there could be some plane to light up the building. We sometimes have our B. Y. P. U. in the school GATLINBURG IN 1920 491 building on Sunday nights. And we have open society every other Friday night, the teachers are compelled to carry lamps from the cottage.

Ten years ago th mer the desire for an interest outside of ourselves was born hearts of some of our noble Pi Phis and it is almost amazilN how that idea has developed in such a comparatively shot Wisdom and guidance were manifest, I am sure, when the ( of a place of location was considered for do not believe ther GROUP OF PUPILS IN UPPER GRADES, 1919-20 be a people of finer mind and blood than these of the southern tains. With the first coming of Pi Phis there was a suspicion am people that a new church was to be established or something accord with their strict religious doctrine. When the isola the mountain folks is taken into consideration it is easy to and the narrow prejudice against what they believe other denom 478 THE :ARROW OF PI BETA PHI stand for. No doubt the longest, hardest pull was to convince them of what we really were here for. All that only worked out through demonstration. Although progress has seemed slow at times it really is a far cry from the first year when Miss Hill stood almost alone, some even afraid to take her into their homes and only two or three places suitable for her to the time when the teachers are helping in the church and Sunday school, conducting the Sunday night service in the school house and when the people come freely to ask help and advice, whether how to make light bread or to know how best to care for their sick ones. Many times it does seem our lot is to be "all things to all people" and it is an inspiring one too. In eight years the school has developed from the little one room building and thirteen pupils into quite a modern and efficient place. If you all could hear some of our Friday night debates I think you would be surprised at the big questions discussed. Relative advantages of pike and railroad for a community like this, compulsory education law, farming and grazing in the mountains, even the league of nations has not escaped. The large school room is nearly always well filled for many come who are not in school. The children are proud of their school and all they have. The building is very well equipped and they take splendid care of everything. When I tell you that not one pane of glass has been broken out through carelessness in the two years I have been here, I believe you will have some appreciation of how the children feel toward their school. Furnaces and bath room are still wonders to many but no one comes now to enquire if we have something in the basement to blow up everything, if we want to, and so many now see how much more convenient it is to have water in the house than to carry it from the river or spring. I can count a number who have piped water from their springs either into the kitchens or near the door, many rude devices are used but the good idea is developing. As for cooking and housekeeping the day has gone far by when there were only two or three places where we could spend the night or enjoy a well prepared meal. Many times this year we have been visiting where we knew the girls had prepared the supper, set the table and done practically everything after school,, in the afternoon and let me assure you it was well done. There is also more effort on the part of children and parents to plan work so the children can be in school more regularly and through the entire school year. GATLINBURG IN 1920 47'9 Other communities turn to Gatlinburg as an example in many ways. The young people are well dressed, refined in their ways and really show a great deal of good training. Could all of this come any way but through the school? This winter the people voted to build a new church. Each one who spoke on the subject said he would give freely if he could be sure of a modern building, one that would meet the needs for some years to come. Why had they come to be 'dissatisfied with their present inadequate building? The school now has a two-fold problem, that of the people back on the creeks who have not yet been reached, who are miles from the school, and of the ones right here in the "Burg" who have taken "BASE...INS" (A typical mountain school house in use today which Pi Phi hopes to eliminate by providing for transportation of the present pupils to the Pi Phi School.) advantage of every opportunity we have given them. They furnish the usual small town problems. How much social life and how best to carry it on, how much we can do in the summer when so many are in the "Burg" Saturday afternoons and Sundays, how much guidance and also how much inspiration we can give? These are some of the questions facing us and we must always be on the alert to meet every new need for with development come new questions to be solved. There is no doubt but the school has already far out grown the first dreams of many Pi Phis but let us take that very fact as the challenge of the future and respond to every call our school makes for greater service from year to year. 480 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI GLIMPSES OF THE LIFE OF. TODAY BY EMILY BURTON January 5, 1920. Dear Pi Phis: The New Year has just come in and as I am to write to you I believe it is a very good time to contrast the new with the old. Life here in the mountains is changing rapidly, and though there is plenty of local color here still, I am sure you would be surprised at some of the changes in the country and the people. I am sure you have all heard of the hard trip that lay between Sevierville and Gatlinburg. Not more than four or five years ago it meant fourteen miles of travel in a buggy or hack, through mud holes and over rocks, across fords and up hill and down hill. Though the. hills and mud holes of the last seven miles still remain, there is now a stretch of seven miles of good pike road and in the spring and summer months one can come through with Mr. Huff, Lilliard Maples or Salt, the mail man, in one of those marvelous little ma-chines, ' No longer would a mountaineer living along the Gatlinbag road:-ay, as I read a Tennessee mountaineer did say when a horseman drew irem on the deeply rutted road in front of his cabin, "Them roads is *le with them automobyles." Why, do many come up here," asked' th 'surprised visitor. "Many? Why, stranger, I don't believe there air a week but what one goes by." You remember too, doubtless, how a few years ago 'strangers were regarded with curiosity and distrust. Many people come to Gatlin-burg now for business purposes, for the approach of the railroad has increased interest in the lumbering projects here. Also the advent of the automobile, feasible roads, and Mr. Huff's hotel have brought summer visitors and they no longer are considered by the people as strange "fetched ons." Again, we no longer teach in a little one room school house but have our splendid four room, steam heated school house, with large library and manual training and domestic science equipment. The teachers, too, have been benefited as much as the school by the improvements made in the last few years. We are very "comfy" now in .our steam heated house, we no longer have to get up before day-break to wash the dishes and sweep up before school. We have a dear Aunt Lizzie who looks after us and we are free to do our best for the kiddies at school. GATLINBURG IN 1920 481 We are beginning the new year very happily, with three new students in the dormitories. This first day of school was extremely cold with snow on the ground and everything frozen up yet two children, brother and sister, walked from Little River, nine miles away, to enter school. We are very glad to have won another new family to the school. It happened this way. One Saturday we were visiting way up one of the creeks. We had gone until we were close to big Smokey. On our way back we stopped at a house we never had GOING HOME FROM SCHOOL, 1919-20 visited before. The front part seemed deserted so we went around to the back door and knocked. A voice said, "Come in," and we entered. By a huge fire place sat an old man, hob-nailing a shoe. We sat, and talked to him for a few minutes when he told us that his family was in trouble, his son's wife was away from home and very ill with a disease from which he was sure she must die. No doctor could help her he thought, for a woman in the Bible had been afflicted with the same sickness and doctors had not been able to heal her, it was the 482 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Christ who brought her relief. The faith of the old man was wonderful. Some of the children then came in. There were six for the grandfather and father to care for. Such a pitiful sight those children were. They were unwashed and uncombed and the "least one," just two years old, had but a dress on, not another bit of clothing. A week later Aunt Lizzie and I went back. The mother had been brought home on a stretcher. She looked very frail and was incapable of doing more than sit by the fire a while each day. Clothes had been sent us for the family and Aunt Lizzie took the baby, "stripped" her, gave her a bath and put the clean clothes on. The mother and father were very pleased with the warm clothes and accepted them in a nice way. Early the next morning three of the children appeared at the cottage each with a big apple. for us. They had come to start in school. One of the little girls was wearing a kimona that had been given, as a wrap, and the boy had an undershirt on over his shirt. You can see how much they needed the help and how appreciative they were. It is' in the young people that the change comes. We do not see a great difference in the home life of the mountaineer, for the older people cling to the old customs. Miss Ann Cobb, of the Hindman School in Kentucky Mountains has written a little poem, telling of the coming of the new ways in the mountains. I quote it for its true on Little Pigeon too. "The ways of the world will be holding up Cyarr Sorry ways, the old ways, They've a call to go. Only when you're grave-bound Changing's allus slow. Old folks will bide by the old ways up Cyarr." Faithfully yours, EMILY BURTON. FRIDAY AFTERNOON IN THE SCHOOLROOM By RUTH STURLEY, Washington A Two o'clock and an expectant stir goes through the "big room" for it is Friday afternoon and the day for the reading of the school magazine. "Books" are over for the week and school itself will "break" when teacher asks someone to ring the bell at two-thirty. GATLINBURG IN 1920 483 itWho will put away the ink wells?". and "Who will clean the boards and erasers ?" "Let's get our desks in order." While these things are being done will the Pi Phis please try to realize that this is their school, and that these attractive girls and boys who look more as if they came from homes in a small town than from mountain cabins are the results of the school's existence among them for the past eight years. Some of the twenty-five present have never been to any other school and are now in the seventh and eighth grades. Those four in the corner at the back of the room are doing first year high school work. What do they all think of the school? What are their ambitions? Is the school meeting their needs? Do the results justify a more expansive opening of Pi Phi purses and a spring freshet of sympathy and understanding from Pi Phi hearts all over the United States to this little corner of the world shut in by creeks and the mountains? Perhaps if we listen very quietly and carefully to the reading of the magazine we will be able to answer these questions ourselves. Let us hear from Jim Huff first whose contribution explains the gaily decorated book from which he reads the'following : OUR SCHOOL MAGAZINE I am going to tell you about our school magazine which is called the Appalachian News. The first thing done in the making of our magazine is Cora and Tom McCarter, Rose Carr and Estel Huff (our ninth graders) get together and make out the subjects for us to write about. When we have them written we give them our papers and .they correct them and then they return them to be copied in ink. After we have them copied we give them to Estel Huff and he puts them all in order and sews them together. Every other Friday each boy and girl reads his own topic. Jim is a very practical and hard working boy, as brief in his speech as in his writing and a great contrast to his dreamer brother, Estel. But he is reading something more: I expect to be a lumberman and when I want to build me a house or a barn I will have the timber to build them. If I ever am a saw miller I will not quit it until I have sawed every tree in Sevier County that I can get hold of. The third member of the Huff family in the big room is Stella, one of the brightest and most active girls in school and unlike her two older brothers always eager to take part in the debates. Although only twelve years old next month, she, with the help of another girl, 484 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI looked after the household nearly all summer as her mother had to be in charge of the hotel. She reads her plans for the future. I expect to go through school here, then go to Jefferson City to school, then to college. After this I expect to teach school at Stoneham, Mass. I want to teach in the primary and domestic science departments. Then I think I want to go to Europe in an aeroplane and see the ruins of France and Belgium, also the Kaiser if he is there. While I am there I want to, see England's large navy. Then I am coming back to Gatlinburg, Tenn. Elmer Oakley is from one of the poorest families around here. This is his ambition: In the future I expect to make a teacher for school and further on in the future I expect to make a book-keeper and build me a library of my own. Of the three sisters, Rose, Lithia, and Ethel Carr, two express the desire to go on to college and become teachers while the third is going to be a foreign missionary in China. Little Maud Clabo who lives nearly three miles away with a grand-father and step grandmother, as her mother is dead and she has no father, reads this: I expect to be a nurse and go to Belgium and take care of some little Belgian children that have no father nor mother. Then I will bring one or two home with me and let them see the place, then take them back to their native land and find them a nice home to live in and then go and take care of some more children. We have more plans for high school, college, teaching, and travel expressed by the others. Levator Whaley who is unusually slow and quiet surprises us all by varying his teaching with a year of running a street car followed by three years in the aerial mail service between South America and Europe. The "Question Box" consists of questions handed in by the boys and girls and answered by Tom McCarter. He is a real farmer but like his three sisters, is most eager for an education and willing to do anything to get it. Let's listen to some of them: Q. How would electric lights help Gatlinburg? A. It would help her in many different ways, give better lights for the people to have societies by night and save lots of coal oil, etc. Q. What is the best thing that can be done? A. Obey the ten commandments of the Bible and obey your school teacher. Q. Can we do wrong that good may come? GATLINBURG IN 1 920 485 A. No, we cannot for the ten commandments teach us what ought to be done. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." "Whatsoever ye sow ye shall also reap." Q. Which is worth the most, education or a long life? A. Both put together is worth the most. You can't be well educated without-having a long life because a woman or man never gets too far but they can learn new ideas. Q. What do you think ought to be done to the Kaiser and his son? A. I don't believe there ought to be anything done with them for when they die the Devil will take care of them. I do believe if the other nations try to do anything with them Germany will declare war against them again. That we may see ourselves as others see us hear dear white headed Arlena Maples read a description of the school house. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is located in the 1 1th civil district of Sevier County of Tennessee, southeast side of the Little Pigeon River. The building is constructed on a piece of land containing about thirty-five acres and about one hundred yards from the river on an elevated piece of land near a beautiful pine grove very pleasantly and conveniently located with roads leading from all points. The surroundings are grandstand, cottage, flagpole, and the play ground in front. It has been built over three years. It is oblong and is made of wood, the top covered with tin and the foundation is made of brick. It is a very plain building. Without comment let us pass on from the reading of "How to Make Molasses," "Origin of St. Valentine's Day," "Jokes," "Current Events," "Our Debates" and listen to Arlie McCarter read: Morals of Gatlinburg "The morals of Gatlinburg are good. One can only judge by what he sees. Traveling around through the vicinity is the best way to judge the conduct of its .people. Everyone who lives here tries to do the right thing as far as he knows and understands. The young men conduct themselves in such a manner that they are due a good name and have brought honor to their community. Not only are the men good but the women as well. Most of the good things we have here were brought about by the influence of our women. The church of Gatlinburg is a working body for the betterment of the people. 486 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Our school is a live wire in this community. Now in conclusion I give to the people of the community the name of being true citizens who stand ready to share their burdens in all undertakings for the betterment of our country." GOOD MOUNTAIN STOCK It is just 2 :30 as Arlie finishes but before we ring the bell let me whisper something in your ears that ought to warm "the cockles of your hearts." The other day when the question was asked in com'-munity history class, "What do you learn at home that you do not learn at school ?' ' a great discussion arose which resulted in the verdict expressed by Ethel Carr. "Well, I declare, I just can't think of nary a thing I haven't learned here at school." Is it worth while? GATLINBURG IN 1920 487 LETTERS FROM MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL ADVISORY BOARD Gatlinburg, Tennessee. December 12, 1919. Pi Beta Phi School: I take this pleasure to congratulate you for what your school has done for our community and theadvancement and improvement on our boys and girls. I think it is wonderful how they can perform on the stage, debate subjects and recite recitations. A great number of them could not read or write, in fact many of them did not know anything when you came to us with your Blessed School. I can't express the gratitude of my heart for what you have already done for our children. My good wife and I are working hard on our little mountain farm to clothe and feed our little ones. Was it not for your school we never could educate them in the world. I feel very glad that I helped you with a little mite of money to establish vour school. I wish I was able to help with more. Your good work is just begun. There are many boys, girls, and children yet that must be brought into your school. Many of them are poor and with-out much clothes, yet these precious minds must be developed by somebody, or else they will grow to the stature of ignorant manhood and womanhood. I feel you all need help in a financial way but wherever is it to come from? Probably somebody will get a vision of the great work you are doing and lend a helping hand to develop our boys and girls. Yours truly, STEVE WHALEY. Sevierville, Tenn., January 6, 1920. My dear Miss Langmaid: I was very sorry indeed not to have seen you again before you took your final departure. I did not expect you to leave so soon for I wanted to express my appreciation of your personal work and also the work of your society in the community in which your school is located. The school does not affect only the community in which it is located but all Sev'ier County and will make its way into all the country. When I go into the community now on professional trips I find the food is better prepared, the houses are better kept and the children 488 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI are better cared for. This shows me that the seed being sown there will be gathered up in sheaves many days hence. I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. . I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the school. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated. I. think, by the wise course pursued by those in power, this idea has been done' away with. The people now seem to be working together for the advancement of the school and community. I want to say that in no part of the country in which I have been, have I ever found people with more natural ability and people who were more susceptible to good influences and knowledge than the people of Gatlinburg. From this community came John H. Reagan, Ex. U. S. Senator and Postmaster General under Grover Cleveland. When a young man leaving Gatlinburg, he could neither read or write but when he landed in Houston, Texas, with his great brain he was elected sheriff of that county. He saw the great need of knowing how to write his name and keep his accounts so he immediately went to work and before his term had expired he had a fairly good education. He was then elected to the State Legislature and in turn was elected Speaker of the House. After this he was elected to Congress, Governor of the State, U. S. Senator and appointed to Cleveland's Cabinet. In fact, he was in his day a national character of distinction. Probably all the people of this community are his relatives by blood and many young men of this section have fully as much gray matter as did this distinguished man. 'I feel like your work here has just begun and I. know God will prosper and ,bless the donors of this great institution. I want to take this method of thanking you and the people who are behind this institution in the name of Gatlinburg and Sevier County for the great good you are doing for the world through Sevier County people. Believe me to be, Very sincerely, Z. D. MASSEY. GATLINBURG IN 1920 489 LETTERS FROM OUR PUPILS Gatlinburg, Tenn., January 6, 1920. Dear Friends: I am a girl of thirteen years of age and go to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. I am in the 8th grade. I like it fine and hope the other boys and girls do. I have been going to school ever since I was six years of age. I am going through school here and then go to some high school and get my education, then teach school. I think we have the best school in Sevier County. Yours as ever, ARLENA MAPLES. Gatlinburg, Tenn., January 6, 1920. 11f, dear Friends: I'm in school and enjoying a nice time. My studies include gram-mar, spelling, agriculture, writing, ancient history and algebra. I like them all fine. I also take cooking and sewing. We certainly are having good school this year. I think it is the best school we have had for a year or two. I have such a nice teacher and when we don't have good lessons she don't seem to enjoy it very much. I sure did have a nice time Christmas vacation. Did you? I went to church at Huskey's Grove Christmas day. Near the church house is lots of spruce pines, it is a very beautiful place. It is very cold here, some snow on the ground and the river frozen over with ice and some of the boys have been skating. From your friend, POLLY MCCARTER. Gatlinburg, Tenn., March 11, 1920. Dear Pi Beta Phis: How I wish each of you IT B ,l knew just how much the dear old II B (I) school has meat to our community and the many girls and boys of this mountainous section of the Great Smokies. In the year 1912 the school was first started with one teacher, Miss Martha Hill from Nashville. 490 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI The II B 41 purchased their land from Mr. E. E. Ogle which had a three roomed cottage, a barn and a store house. I lived in this little cottage with Miss Martha hill for a year. Soon the barn was torn away and used for wood. The II B 4 repaired the store house for the purpose of using as a school building which was used for the kindergarten. Our county school house which was a one roomed house with eight windows, four on each side, one door in the back with two rows of long benches with no desks. The floor was made of spruce pine and had seasoned out till there was great cracks in the floor. This county house happened to be located on the II B cl, property. The II B (I) then bought this building and the store house and old county school house was where the II B T school first started their school. By this time the county had built a two roomed building which was not far away. The next year the county ran their school as usual but they were now in the new building and the II B (I) in the old ones. Soon the dear little II B I school begain to grow the people saw what the school was doing for the boys and girls who attended. The girls and boys walked for many miles away leaving the county schools till our little building would hold them no longer. When in 1914 the II B (I went to work and built a six roomed school house with all the desks necessary, and running water, good heating system and were equiped for manuel training and domestic sience and year by year we have more teachers till now we have four. In 1916 they finished up an eleven roomed house for the teachers. The girls and boys of this community enjoy open house in this building on Friday nights we sometimes sing and play games. The II B 1 now use the old cottage for a girl's dormitory and recently have remodeled the Stuart cottage for which they use as a boy's dormitory. The school has not only inthused the people to build good roads in our community so the children can come to school in more ease, but inthused the girls and boys to look forward in life to bigger and better things. We sincerely hope with the help of the II B I we can some day have a high school and we wish there could be some plane to light up the building. We sometimes have our B. Y. P. U. in the school GATLINBURG IN 1920 491 building on Sunday nights. And we have open society every other Friday night, the teachers are compelled to carry lamps from the cottage.
