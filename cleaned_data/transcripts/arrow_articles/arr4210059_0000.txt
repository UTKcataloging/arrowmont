        58 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PM Of course I have made initiation cards for all new members. The average time spent in this office is about 4 hours every evening and an average of 1.0 hours a clay every Saturday and Sunday. Respectfully submitted, FLORENCE CLUM TEMPLE. REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE To Grand Council and Representatives of Pi Beta Phi, in Convention Assembled: At the completion of this, my third year on the Settlement School Committee of Pi Beta Phi, and my second year as Chairman of the Committee, I find that my command of English is totally inadequate to express to you my appreciation for the opportunities which have been mine to serve with my ,Committee in this the greatest work ever attempted by any fraternity. We have labored incessantly this year to surmount the purely mechanical details of handling the Settlement School while located far from the basis of action. Further than that, we have striven with ever-inereasing zeal to place before the fraternity at large a picture that might arouse enthusiasm of graduate and undergraduate alike. That we have been relatively successful has been our reward. That we have not been completely successful in all our aims has but proven to us that there are further steps necessary to be taken in order to convince Pi Beta Phi, collectively and individually, that it is receiving the plaudits of the fraternal world in the work that it is attempting to do, As has been our custom for several years back, we have continued to budget our expenses, and I am happy to say that it has been of inestimable help in directing the financial affairs of the School. At the beginning of the year, we were without the accustomed valuable aid of Miss Melinda Stuart, but discovered in Mrs. Stoolman one whose heart is given to the work, and who repeatedly brought to bear her trained mental equipment upon the problems which presented themselves. As far as the expenses of the School are concerned, all our bills are paid, and those practically when due. There remains in the treasury an amount barely exceeding last year's balance, with which to begin the new year's work. Permit me to discuss the matter of income a little later in my report. The organization of the. School was completed before the session began last summer. We never opened school before under more promising eircustances. With the exception of illness, which required the absence of some of our teachers for a short time, they have been in REPORTS OF OFFICERS 59 service all through the year, giving the most effective co-operation, not only in their own departments, but wherever and whenever the opportunity offered. The head resident of the School, Miss Evelyn Bishop, is well fitted to serve in this capacity. She is well equipped mentally, and naturally gifted in character for the understanding of such a delicate position as. she holds. Many of you know her, and so that the rest of you who hear or read this report may come to know of her grasp of the situation, her executive ability, her heartfelt interest, and her success in the administration of this great work, I am taking the liberty of including her report to the Settlement School Committee. It is not as minutely technical as the report of Mr. Mattil, our ,Smith-Hughes representative, nor of Miss Chew, our Director of the Emma Harper Turner Center at Sugarlands, but for a word painting of any situation, I have yet to find one so dissecting, so illuminating, so all-inclusive. I recommend that you spend sufficient time reading and re-reading this report, so as to steep yourselves with the particulars, in order that you may grasp the situation as a whole. The recommendations made by Miss Bishop, whose report I incorporate below, are the recommendations of the combined faculty of the Schools and of the Committee, who have met and agreed upon this course before presenting this report to you. REPORT OF HEAD RESIDENT Pr PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1924-1925 The year 1924-25 found the School with a larger staff, more varied work, and with an extension school started. Even though the work and workers were new in some departments, I feel sure we can call it a successful year. The school spirit, grade of work, and the co-operation of the people have all been good. For nearly three months the head resident was away on the vacation granted by the Committee last summer, and during that time those in the School carried on the work wonderfully well. Many thanks are due Mrs. Dowell, who took over so much of the office and industrial business and made the vacation possible. The staff has been as follows: Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident. Phyllis Higginbotham, Nurse. Harmo Taylor, AsSistant Nurse. Margaret White, Departmental work, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th grades. Helen Barrett, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th grades. Marion Folsom, 5th, 6th grades. Elmer Watson, 3rd, 4th grades. Emily Burton (one year's vacation) 1st, 2nd primary grades. Barbara Dewell, Domestic Science. Allie Ownby, Weaving. 60 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI O. J. Mattil, Agriculture and Farm Shop. Mrs. Dowell, Purchasing Agent, Housekeeper, and Assistant in the Industrial Dept. Mrs. Dora Chapin, House Mother, Girls' Cottages. Lizzie Reagan, Cook and Helper, Teachers' Cottage. Leander McCarter, General Farm and Handy Work. J. T. Reagan, Carpenter and Repair Work. Mrs. McCarter, Cook, Boys' Cottage. Helen Chew, :Sugarlands School. Cora McCarter, Sugarlands School. At Christmas time Miss .Chew was compelled to go home, and her place was taken by Mary Elder, of Sevierville. Harmo Taylor and Barbara Dewell went back to college at the beginning of the spring term, and their places were taken by Jean Steele and Lois Rogers. J. T. Reagan stopped work at the school in the late winter, and his work was done by one of the school boys. SCHOOL The School enrollment for the past year was no larger than the year before, being 130. The per cent of attendance was better due in part to an efficient truant officer in the county, and in part to a greater appreciation on the part of parents of the advantage of steady attendance. The first six grades completed an eight months' school term. The four upper grades lacked only one week of completing nine months. Six pupils completed the eighth grade and received State certificates. Seven pupils completed second year high school. One new teacher was added. Mr. Elmer Watson took the 3rd and 4th grades, in that way relieving Miss Burton's and Miss Folsom's room of so many grades. He also coached the baseball and basketball teams and made the trips with them. He was hired with the under-standing that he would supervise outside work of boys living here, but through no fault of his, did not do as much of that work as we had hoped he could. His influence with the boys is fine, and his work in school is good enough to favor his return. Miss Margaret White and Miss Helen Barrett were both new, but the classes went on very well, and I believe the girls held the pupils to a high grade of work. Besides the regular grade work, the schedule for weaving, sewing, cooking and agriculture was carefully worked out. All this made a very full course for the boys and girls and gave them all the work they could carry. During the school year the teachers put on a Health Play at one of the Teachers Institutes in Sevierville. The usual plays, entertain ments, etc., were given at Christmas, close ,of school and Thanksgiving. The interest in athletics was excellent. The basketball team played a good many games, both on the local court and in other schools. New REPORTS OF OFFICERS 61 baseball uniforms were given by a group of men who visit here, including Mr. Hall ; the same men gave $30.00 in the winter for baseball, and another visitor gave ball "nits this spring. Of course, the interest of outsiders in the team gave the boys and coach a lot of courage. Athletics have not been an expense to the school. The boys are playing once a week during the summer. TEACHERS Miss Lois Rogers, who has been taking Miss Harmo Taylor's place this spring, will take Miss Folsom's room. The same questions regarding school have been talked over every year, consolidation, extension, etc. I do not think there will be any changes in any of the schools for another year. One good step taken this year is giving the counties an eight month's free school. This will mean much to us. in keeping attendance up, not only daily, but keeping the younger ones in school until the close of the spring term. It will raise the standard of work in the nearby school, too. Also we will receive from the county more money for both this and Sugarlands School. Just what the amount per month will be I can not tell yet, but certainly no less than before, and it will continue for eight months. A new year will be added. This has been our hope for many years, but only now is the time suited to add this extra year. We have had seven pupils to finish second year high, and as these boys and girls are necessary to the morale, both in the school room and athletics, and are most anxious for another year at school, we have had to meet their demands. We were not able to rent or buy the Eslinger house last year, so solved the difficulty of room by putting the sewing in one room of the Stuart Cottage; the cooking stayed in the basement of the schoolhouse; the weaving was moved to the Log Cabin, and all of Mr. Mattil's work was kept in the old barn where it had been. The baskets and weaving we have for sale were kept in Mrs. Dowell's room in the attic as heretofore. Not the least of all our troubles is to find a place to store and pack as well as to sell, the baskets. DOMESTIC SCIENCE From the beginning of the school term, we had regular classes in cooking and sewing. The cooking classes were held in the school basement room; the sewing in one room of the Stuart Cottage. The domestic science teacher also had the care of the meals in the Girls' Cottage, planned for the supplies in that cottage, the high school girls under her supervision prepared the noon meals for all dormitory girls 62 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and five teachers, and the dish that supplemented the noon lunch for the little tots. These meals were all served in the school cooking room. The plan worked very well, although sometimes the high school girls seemed to have rather less theoretical work and perhaps more of practical. The last month of school we discontinued the weaving classes, and the 8th grade girls prepared the noon meal; the high school girls have classes more along the line of text book work. Barbara Dewell was engaged to the first of June, but during the late winter we decided it might be better for her to go back to college for the spring term, coming back here again in the fall. In that way, she could continue her work, yet we would not have to hunt a new teacher for the coming year. We have a Smith-Hughes domestic science teacher for six months, starting in June. The regular school work was continued until close of the term, then classes were started in Cartertown, Sugarlands classes continued right on, and two classes in Gatlinburg. Already there are sixty-two enrolled. Miss White, the Supervisor, felt that this was an ideal place to try out a summer experiment, and we feel that we can assure her that it will be a success. The State pays five-eighths of the salary, which means that we can do this summer work for less than we would have been paid for the work had Barbara continued to the first of June. Jean Steele, the summer teacher, is a girl peculiarly adapted to work with rural people. She does a great amount of visiting in the homes and is having a most successful summer. SMITH-HUGES DEPARTMENT This work had advanced tremendously during the year. Work and plans of the two years previous seemed to take definite shape and in every way tell a most satisfactory tale. The school work with the boys was supplemented by practical lessons in wiring, building, spraying, pruning, repair work. The calls for advice in regard to stock, farms and orchards were many, and came from away back in the mountains. It has seemed as if Mr. Mattil had to be in the saddle or in a car about as much as the nurse. In the spring there would be trips at five in the morning to help a man start his spraying, then back here for breakfast and for school work. The men have been interested in poultry during the year, and have met each Saturday night, some walking several miles. Recently a Poultry Association has been formed to arrange for marketing poultry products. REPORTS OF OFFICERS G3 The Community Club meets once a month, usually oftener. A car-load of fertilizer was handled by it again this spring. The first week in May, the State Supervisor of Smith-Hughes Vocational Work was here. He was most enthusiastic regarding progress made, and said we could not realize it unless we were away for two years and then came back. He was so pleased that he said he would give us an additional $300.00 this year for more equipment for that department. Altogether the department has been very satisfactory the past year, judged not alone by us but by people from other communities and the County Superintendent. FARM The Farm by Tights is not under the care of a Smith Hughes teacher, but Mr. Mattil has given a good deal of time to planning for it and to supervision. It is in better condition now, is producing more, and is being run quite a little more businesslike. There have been a good many reasons why it was impossible to put in up-to-date methods, but little by little we are improving the old ways. We have good stock on the place; pigs, chickens, horses, cows. We are delighted to announce that Mr. and Mrs. Pi Phi Goat are happily domiciled at the School. Reports show at least $500.00 worth of feed raised the past year; no doubt the place produced well toward $1000.00 of the living expenses. We feel sure the farm will show up still better another year. WEAVING It has been the aim of your Committee in the past and your present Committee to encourage the girls from the community to teach in the school. With this in view we have employed as a weaving teacher, Mrs. Ownby. Last summer we had a former girl who had been off to study, to give lessons in root dyeing. WEAVING, BASKETS, CHAIRS This business has grown until it really would keep one person busy all the time if it were handled as it should be. Last fall the orders were larger than ever, and it is surprising how they continue to come in during the whole year. In the summer, a great deal is sold to the hotel visitors. Added to the weaving and baskets are the chairs: straight, rockers, little, medium and large sizes ; also stools. At the present time we have a great many baskets on hand, as people want to make them before crop time comes. During the spring and early summer we do not buy as many. In the fall we will be glad to have this large supply to draw on. I feel that the sales should bring the School sufficient profit to 64 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI maintain a full time weaving teacher, and believe it will if managed well. Not only is the basket business increasing, but I believe the quality of work is better than a few years ago. Added to the basket business, I had word not long ago that a candy firm would take any quantity of black walnuts up to twenty-five tons. I have shipped a few, but hope that in the fall more than one boy or girl can pay their school bill in this way. The mountains are full of black walnuts and should be a source of income. GIRLS' DORMITORY When school commenced, there were five teachers and six girls in the dormitory. The schedule of work was carried out as the year before and the planning of meals and supervision of the house was under the care of Barbara Dewell. She was absolutely new to the work, and there was no house mother. We were fortunate in having girls who had been in the dormitories before and who really understood some parts of the work much better than the teachers. While I was in New York on my vacation, I saw Mrs. Chapin, with whom I had some correspondence, with the result that she came here in December. She is splendid with the girls, and has as much tact with the teachers as with the pupils, and they need a house mother and home maker as much as the little girls do. With as much house work as the girls do, their washing and ironing and mending to look after each week, there is not much time left for work that can count against their school bills. One girl cleaned our cottage each morning before school, two helped some with the house ironing each week, another did a little weaving. During the time Barbara Dewell was ill with flu, and the time between her departure and the arrival of the new teacher, one girl did all the planning and supervising of the high school girls, who prepared the noon meal at the school, and she did very well. After Christmas, the family in the cottages numbers fourteen or fifteen all the time. Boys' DORMITORY The Boys' Cottage, rented from Miss Bishop and Miss Higginbotham, was quite satisfactory the past year. Mr. and Mrs. Leander McCarter lived there, Mrs. McCarter doing the work, and receiving in return board for her husband and little girl. There were times in the early fall when there were only four boys there, but all the spring term there were eight. While the boys did not have many house duties, they did have other work, keeping records of their time. Practically all was work REPORTS OF OFFICERS 65 Mr. Mattil planned and supervised, as it was along his line. We can certainly see improvement in this place. Never have the boys done more work, been more conscientious about it, or done as good a grade of work. One boy had full charge of the incubators this spring; another one the brooder another did practically all the firing of the furnaces; the chickens were entirely looked after by another boy; after Jim Reagan left, one boy kept up the repair work, which included carpenter work, wiring, a little plumbing, etc. With this much work done, our books should show quite a labor charge to offset a big living charge, but the main thing to consider is the fact that these older boys needed to be in school, they were having an opportunity to do these things under supervision and according to approved methods. Living in the dormitory gave them better opportunity to keep up their school work. Another year believe we can have all this still better organized. The last of the year, the boys came to the schoolhouse each night for study, and another year we shall continue this. The responsibility is divided among the teachers, and the boys do better studying. Also some outside boys come for the study hour. HOSPITAL AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT The full report given by Miss Higginbotham gives, much better than I can, the account of work done in that department. However, no report. can half tell the story of amount of work done or what that work means to the people of this country. Neither is that department the limit of Phyllis's work. We depend on her in every way. Year before last we demonstrated the need of an assistant in the office all the time. At the beginning of the school term, Harmo Taylor came and proved a most valuable helper. In fact, we are convinced that the general help these willing college girls can give is worth more to the nurse now than fust the professional help a trained nurse might give. With this help in the office, it has been possible for Miss Higginbotham to do more school work, the thing we always have wanted. In the fall, meetings were held in different schools in the district ; if Miss Higginbotham could not go, Miss Taylor went. The meetings were in charge of Mr. Mattil, but always there was a Health talk given. In the spring term a class for 8th, 9th, and 10th grades was held in our School, the regular Red Cross text being used. Eight girls received Red Cross certificates for completion of this course. The girls thoroughly enjoyed this, and, I know, got a great deal out of it. I am so glad to begin to have these classes. The doctors continue to come in at stated times, and also to make use of our good equipment. 66 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI A dentist comes once a month during the winter months, twice a month in the summer. An assistant has not made the work in this department less, it has only made more work possible. The year has been a good one, with a groat deal accomplished. HEALTH UNIT The County Court voted a sufficient appropriation in the fall to continue the Health Unit, but I feel sure that without our co-operation it 'would not be possible. We put in $1800.00 each year and receive back about $2300.00, but the money is not all. We have clinics, with the County Health Doctor in charge, free vaccination for the people for smallpox, typhoid, and many helps that would be impossible other-wise. There is even talk now that perhaps a Sanitary Inspector will be possible for the county. Time will tell what the County Court will do about that. I do not feel that there is any doubt about the wisdom of our continuing to co-operate in the Health Unit. COMMUNITY It is hard to make a report of community work done, as so much goes hand in hand with the school work. From April to October, we have movies each Saturday in the barn. The people are anxious to have them start even before it is warm enough for us to have, them. During the winter the boys play basketball in the barn. Not only the school, but the Gatlinburg boys usually play there once a week. In summer, the Gatlinburg boys play ball on the school ground. We are happy that the new church is practically completed. Different teachers have taken part in teaching Sunday School classes or reorganizing the Sunday School and assisting in B. Y. P. U. There are more things around the Burg in a social way than there used to be, but we still try to have occasional spellings, ice cream socials, and plays. The great entertainment is picnicing, big little, and middle size go on picnics. Much of Mr. Mattil's work includes community activities: A Community Club meets each month and sometimes oftener. A Poultry Association has been formed. Incubators and Brooders were used by the Community. Health and Farm meetings were held in various little schools during the fall. The big event each October is the Gatlinburg Fair. Last year it was followed by a County Fair in Sevierville, and a Division Fair in Knoxville, where we won second place. We received $65.00 in prizes in Sevierville, REPORTS OF OFFICERS 67 and as we plan to have our soft drinks and ice cream pay the expenses of our fair, we have enough money in the bank now to give a few prizes next fall. Nothing we have ever done has seemed to please everyone in the community like the little News we send out each month. Mr. Mattil and Mrs. Dowell deserve the greatest amount of praise for it, but we all help. Of course, we could not do it but for the mimeograph gotten last year. Smith-Hughes funds paid for part of it, and the School the balance. It certainly is in use a good part of the time. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER AT SUGARLANDS The report from Emma Harper Turner Center at Sugarlands shows eighty-nine pupils enrolled, and two teachers. But this comes far short of telling the tale. Helen Chew came in July and spent the month getting the cottage in shape. The people gave most of the labor and materials for repairing the little house, rent was free, and furniture was made by men of the community and bought by the school. The house was made into quite an attractive little place, and one the people were very proud of, as they had seen what could be done with an old place. No repairs were made on the school house, as the County Board wanted to build as soon as possible. Besides the school, Sunday School, church and various community meetings were held in the one room house. On Saturdays Helen Chew had classes for boys beyond the school age. Some worked across the mountain in North Carolina and would walk over to Sugarlands for their lessons. The regular school work of the seven grades was supplemented all the year by sewing classes taught by Mrs. Dowell (until the Smith-Hughes Economics teacher came) ; agriculture and farm projects by Mr. Mattil. Helen Chew preferred to teach the cooking classes during the fall term. After she left the first of the year Barbara Dewell took those classes. At Christmas time Helen was called home because of illness in the family. Mary Elder, a Sevier County girl, finished the year, and she and Cora McCarter had a very good term of school. Both of the girls were thoroughly interested in the community as well as the school work, scarcely being willing to spend any week-ends at their own homes. The experiment of having 'local girls take over the grade work was one I had been anxious to have tried. It sometimes has seemed to me we were a little slow in doing this. Whether it would be wise to have both teachers local, and a Pi Phi for supervisor and community worker is a question. 68 THE ARRow or PI BETA PHI Helen is to be back this next year and will take the school work as she did last year, and we expect Cora McCarter will go back, too. She is in the East Tennessee Normal now. The amount of book learning the little folks were taught last year is scarcely to be considered in the list of things accomplished in the Sugarlands last year. When I say that it sometimes seems to me that a whole community has been rebuilt, remoulded, the standard of living raised, spirit of cooperation developed, I do not feel I am putting it too strongly. People on the outside notice such a change, and again this year requests have come for us to go into other schools. I am so glad that during the summer Jean Steele and Mr. Mattil can continue their work; Jean goes twice a week; Mr. Mattil, once. Jean has not had less than seventeen girls in the class any time. The women do not come out in such numbers, but I think their classes just as important. In closing the report of the first extension work we have done, I feel we can say that it has been a success, and we all feel that it is a line of work we should continue. POWER AND LIGHT PLANT In the report last year, the statement was made that many nights had been dark ones, which meant that many times we were without lights. This year we can give a better report. The company has continued as first formed, Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples each owning 25% and the School, 50%. The men were not willing for the school to hold a controlling interest. The alternating current and all machinery recommended last year is now installed, with the exception of the governors. Quite a good many families have lights in their homes, more are asking for lights. The old Delco engine was traded in on a new Frigidaire, a small motor for pumping water and a larger one for sawing wood, etc. The Frigidaire is certainly a luxury we scarcely dared dream of. The Light Company seems to be paying good interest on the investment. The school preferred that the rebate be held each month, the stockholders paying for their light in that way money would be on hand for improvements and could be divided at the end of a given time. However, the men chose to do otherwise so receive our rebate on light bill each month. WATER SUPPLY There was some talk this spring ,of a water supply for the Community, the same people going into that as went into the Light Company. The school has sufficient water supply. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 69 BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE PAST YEAR Schoolhouse painted and windows reputtied; Stuart Cottage painted, barn practically completed, wire fence put around upper boundary of wood land; new chicken house built, chicken yard fenced; plank walks laid; one part of old barn made into work shop, tools purchased and lumber racks and tool closets made; new seats made for barn; library doors put in schoolhouse; trees and shrubs planted in school yard, around cottage and hospital; additional wiring in every building; play ground equipment; Frigidaire installed; motor for pumping water; motor for sawing wood, etc.; 'Ford truck purchased; water pipes laid from spring to hog and barn lots; Teachers' Cottz_ge re-roofed. UNFINISHED IMPROVEMENTS ALREADY VOTED ON Tiling and draining fields, orchard and roadway. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR Full time weaving teacher. One more year added to high school course. Teachers' Cottage in Emma Harper Turner Center. Plans made for first unit of a building to take care of baskets, sewing and weaving, as well as some shop work. Mrs. Dowell, as purchasing agent, housekeeper and helper in the office has meant a great deal. She is an efficient person, wherever you place her, and is always willing. With an experience in business, housekeeping and years of interest in church and community things, she certainly is valuable to us. She is staying through the summer and finds plenty to keep her busy helping with the canning, looking after the house and assisting with the basket business. The past year has been a reasonably successful one, and that is because of the untiring work of each one, staff, committee and all. When the teachers left, they all felt that next year could be made still better, and they left with a determination to do their part. (End of quoted report.) In closing this, my second annual report, I should like to take up your time to express to each member of the faculty of the School my keen appreciation of his untiring and unstinted effort. I should like to express to Mrs. Curtis my pleasure in having served on the Committee with her. Her efficient handling of the ways and means and the slides, which have been valuable to the School, and her keen sense of humor, have all gone to make her a beloved member, and it is with regret from all who have been associated with her that she retires from the Committee this year. Mrs. Turner has been handling the publicity, ,and while at times 70 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI she felt discouraged when she had to write four or five letters to get a reply, yet on the whole nobody could have done her work better nor with more enthusiasm than she has. Mrs. Geare has been editing the ARROW articles. If you have read them, you have seen her worth. It has been hard for Mrs. Stoolman to follow Miss Stuart, but there can not be too much praise given to her efficient methods. I am sure I express the sentiments of each and all of us associated with the School when I say to you here assembled that the work has been one of pleasure, one of high ideals, and one for which we shall be ever grateful to you for permitting us to be associated with you in your attempt to make life as a whole just a little finer each day than it was the day before.

Mrs. Dora Chapin, House Mother, Girls' Cottages. Lizzie Reagan, Cook and Helper, Teachers' Cottage. Leander McCarter, General Farm and Handy Work. J. T. Reagan, Carpenter and Repair Work. Mrs. McCarter, Cook, Boys' Cottage. Helen Chew, :Sugarlands School. Cora McCarter, Sugarlands School. At Christmas time Miss .Chew was compelled to go home, and her place was taken by Mary Elder, of Sevierville. Harmo Taylor and Barbara Dewell went back to college at the beginning of the spring term, and their places were taken by Jean Steele and Lois Rogers. J. T. Reagan stopped work at the school in the late winter, and his work was done by one of the school boys. SCHOOL The School enrollment for the past year was no larger than the year before, being 130. The per cent of attendance was better due in part to an efficient truant officer in the county, and in part to a greater appreciation on the part of parents of the advantage of steady attendance. The first six grades completed an eight months' school term. The four upper grades lacked only one week of completing nine months. Six pupils completed the eighth grade and received State certificates. Seven pupils completed second year high school. One new teacher was added. Mr. Elmer Watson took the 3rd and 4th grades, in that way relieving Miss Burton's and Miss Folsom's room of so many grades. He also coached the baseball and basketball teams and made the trips with them. He was hired with the under-standing that he would supervise outside work of boys living here, but through no fault of his, did not do as much of that work as we had hoped he could. His influence with the boys is fine, and his work in school is good enough to favor his return. Miss Margaret White and Miss Helen Barrett were both new, but the classes went on very well, and I believe the girls held the pupils to a high grade of work. Besides the regular grade work, the schedule for weaving, sewing, cooking and agriculture was carefully worked out. All this made a very full course for the boys and girls and gave them all the work they could carry. During the school year the teachers put on a Health Play at one of the Teachers Institutes in Sevierville. The usual plays, entertain ments, etc., were given at Christmas, close ,of school and Thanksgiving. The interest in athletics was excellent. The basketball team played a good many games, both on the local court and in other schools. New REPORTS OF OFFICERS 61 baseball uniforms were given by a group of men who visit here, including Mr. Hall ; the same men gave $30.00 in the winter for baseball, and another visitor gave ball "nits this spring. Of course, the interest of outsiders in the team gave the boys and coach a lot of courage. Athletics have not been an expense to the school. The boys are playing once a week during the summer. TEACHERS Miss Lois Rogers, who has been taking Miss Harmo Taylor's place this spring, will take Miss Folsom's room. The same questions regarding school have been talked over every year, consolidation, extension, etc. I do not think there will be any changes in any of the schools for another year. One good step taken this year is giving the counties an eight month's free school. This will mean much to us. in keeping attendance up, not only daily, but keeping the younger ones in school until the close of the spring term. It will raise the standard of work in the nearby school, too. Also we will receive from the county more money for both this and Sugarlands School. Just what the amount per month will be I can not tell yet, but certainly no less than before, and it will continue for eight months. A new year will be added. This has been our hope for many years, but only now is the time suited to add this extra year. We have had seven pupils to finish second year high, and as these boys and girls are necessary to the morale, both in the school room and athletics, and are most anxious for another year at school, we have had to meet their demands. We were not able to rent or buy the Eslinger house last year, so solved the difficulty of room by putting the sewing in one room of the Stuart Cottage; the cooking stayed in the basement of the schoolhouse; the weaving was moved to the Log Cabin, and all of Mr. Mattil's work was kept in the old barn where it had been. The baskets and weaving we have for sale were kept in Mrs. Dowell's room in the attic as heretofore. Not the least of all our troubles is to find a place to store and pack as well as to sell, the baskets. DOMESTIC SCIENCE From the beginning of the school term, we had regular classes in cooking and sewing. The cooking classes were held in the school basement room; the sewing in one room of the Stuart Cottage. The domestic science teacher also had the care of the meals in the Girls' Cottage, planned for the supplies in that cottage, the high school girls under her supervision prepared the noon meals for all dormitory girls 62 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and five teachers, and the dish that supplemented the noon lunch for the little tots. These meals were all served in the school cooking room. The plan worked very well, although sometimes the high school girls seemed to have rather less theoretical work and perhaps more of practical. The last month of school we discontinued the weaving classes, and the 8th grade girls prepared the noon meal; the high school girls have classes more along the line of text book work. Barbara Dewell was engaged to the first of June, but during the late winter we decided it might be better for her to go back to college for the spring term, coming back here again in the fall. In that way, she could continue her work, yet we would not have to hunt a new teacher for the coming year. We have a Smith-Hughes domestic science teacher for six months, starting in June. The regular school work was continued until close of the term, then classes were started in Cartertown, Sugarlands classes continued right on, and two classes in Gatlinburg. Already there are sixty-two enrolled. Miss White, the Supervisor, felt that this was an ideal place to try out a summer experiment, and we feel that we can assure her that it will be a success. The State pays five-eighths of the salary, which means that we can do this summer work for less than we would have been paid for the work had Barbara continued to the first of June. Jean Steele, the summer teacher, is a girl peculiarly adapted to work with rural people. She does a great amount of visiting in the homes and is having a most successful summer. SMITH-HUGES DEPARTMENT This work had advanced tremendously during the year. Work and plans of the two years previous seemed to take definite shape and in every way tell a most satisfactory tale. The school work with the boys was supplemented by practical lessons in wiring, building, spraying, pruning, repair work. The calls for advice in regard to stock, farms and orchards were many, and came from away back in the mountains. It has seemed as if Mr. Mattil had to be in the saddle or in a car about as much as the nurse. In the spring there would be trips at five in the morning to help a man start his spraying, then back here for breakfast and for school work. The men have been interested in poultry during the year, and have met each Saturday night, some walking several miles. Recently a Poultry Association has been formed to arrange for marketing poultry products. REPORTS OF OFFICERS G3 The Community Club meets once a month, usually oftener. A car-load of fertilizer was handled by it again this spring. The first week in May, the State Supervisor of Smith-Hughes Vocational Work was here. He was most enthusiastic regarding progress made, and said we could not realize it unless we were away for two years and then came back. He was so pleased that he said he would give us an additional $300.00 this year for more equipment for that department. Altogether the department has been very satisfactory the past year, judged not alone by us but by people from other communities and the County Superintendent. FARM The Farm by Tights is not under the care of a Smith Hughes teacher, but Mr. Mattil has given a good deal of time to planning for it and to supervision. It is in better condition now, is producing more, and is being run quite a little more businesslike. There have been a good many reasons why it was impossible to put in up-to-date methods, but little by little we are improving the old ways. We have good stock on the place; pigs, chickens, horses, cows. We are delighted to announce that Mr. and Mrs. Pi Phi Goat are happily domiciled at the School. Reports show at least $500.00 worth of feed raised the past year; no doubt the place produced well toward $1000.00 of the living expenses. We feel sure the farm will show up still better another year. WEAVING It has been the aim of your Committee in the past and your present Committee to encourage the girls from the community to teach in the school. With this in view we have employed as a weaving teacher, Mrs. Ownby. Last summer we had a former girl who had been off to study, to give lessons in root dyeing. WEAVING, BASKETS, CHAIRS This business has grown until it really would keep one person busy all the time if it were handled as it should be. Last fall the orders were larger than ever, and it is surprising how they continue to come in during the whole year. In the summer, a great deal is sold to the hotel visitors. Added to the weaving and baskets are the chairs: straight, rockers, little, medium and large sizes ; also stools. At the present time we have a great many baskets on hand, as people want to make them before crop time comes. During the spring and early summer we do not buy as many. In the fall we will be glad to have this large supply to draw on. I feel that the sales should bring the School sufficient profit to 64 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI maintain a full time weaving teacher, and believe it will if managed well. Not only is the basket business increasing, but I believe the quality of work is better than a few years ago. Added to the basket business, I had word not long ago that a candy firm would take any quantity of black walnuts up to twenty-five tons. I have shipped a few, but hope that in the fall more than one boy or girl can pay their school bill in this way. The mountains are full of black walnuts and should be a source of income. GIRLS' DORMITORY When school commenced, there were five teachers and six girls in the dormitory. The schedule of work was carried out as the year before and the planning of meals and supervision of the house was under the care of Barbara Dewell. She was absolutely new to the work, and there was no house mother. We were fortunate in having girls who had been in the dormitories before and who really understood some parts of the work much better than the teachers. While I was in New York on my vacation, I saw Mrs. Chapin, with whom I had some correspondence, with the result that she came here in December. She is splendid with the girls, and has as much tact with the teachers as with the pupils, and they need a house mother and home maker as much as the little girls do. With as much house work as the girls do, their washing and ironing and mending to look after each week, there is not much time left for work that can count against their school bills. One girl cleaned our cottage each morning before school, two helped some with the house ironing each week, another did a little weaving. During the time Barbara Dewell was ill with flu, and the time between her departure and the arrival of the new teacher, one girl did all the planning and supervising of the high school girls, who prepared the noon meal at the school, and she did very well. After Christmas, the family in the cottages numbers fourteen or fifteen all the time. Boys' DORMITORY The Boys' Cottage, rented from Miss Bishop and Miss Higginbotham, was quite satisfactory the past year. Mr. and Mrs. Leander McCarter lived there, Mrs. McCarter doing the work, and receiving in return board for her husband and little girl. There were times in the early fall when there were only four boys there, but all the spring term there were eight. While the boys did not have many house duties, they did have other work, keeping records of their time. Practically all was work REPORTS OF OFFICERS 65 Mr. Mattil planned and supervised, as it was along his line. We can certainly see improvement in this place. Never have the boys done more work, been more conscientious about it, or done as good a grade of work. One boy had full charge of the incubators this spring; another one the brooder another did practically all the firing of the furnaces; the chickens were entirely looked after by another boy; after Jim Reagan left, one boy kept up the repair work, which included carpenter work, wiring, a little plumbing, etc. With this much work done, our books should show quite a labor charge to offset a big living charge, but the main thing to consider is the fact that these older boys needed to be in school, they were having an opportunity to do these things under supervision and according to approved methods. Living in the dormitory gave them better opportunity to keep up their school work. Another year believe we can have all this still better organized. The last of the year, the boys came to the schoolhouse each night for study, and another year we shall continue this. The responsibility is divided among the teachers, and the boys do better studying. Also some outside boys come for the study hour. HOSPITAL AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT The full report given by Miss Higginbotham gives, much better than I can, the account of work done in that department. However, no report. can half tell the story of amount of work done or what that work means to the people of this country. Neither is that department the limit of Phyllis's work. We depend on her in every way. Year before last we demonstrated the need of an assistant in the office all the time. At the beginning of the school term, Harmo Taylor came and proved a most valuable helper. In fact, we are convinced that the general help these willing college girls can give is worth more to the nurse now than fust the professional help a trained nurse might give. With this help in the office, it has been possible for Miss Higginbotham to do more school work, the thing we always have wanted. In the fall, meetings were held in different schools in the district ; if Miss Higginbotham could not go, Miss Taylor went. The meetings were in charge of Mr. Mattil, but always there was a Health talk given. In the spring term a class for 8th, 9th, and 10th grades was held in our School, the regular Red Cross text being used. Eight girls received Red Cross certificates for completion of this course. The girls thoroughly enjoyed this, and, I know, got a great deal out of it. I am so glad to begin to have these classes. The doctors continue to come in at stated times, and also to make use of our good equipment. 66 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI A dentist comes once a month during the winter months, twice a month in the summer. An assistant has not made the work in this department less, it has only made more work possible. The year has been a good one, with a groat deal accomplished. HEALTH UNIT The County Court voted a sufficient appropriation in the fall to continue the Health Unit, but I feel sure that without our co-operation it 'would not be possible. We put in $1800.00 each year and receive back about $2300.00, but the money is not all. We have clinics, with the County Health Doctor in charge, free vaccination for the people for smallpox, typhoid, and many helps that would be impossible other-wise. There is even talk now that perhaps a Sanitary Inspector will be possible for the county. Time will tell what the County Court will do about that. I do not feel that there is any doubt about the wisdom of our continuing to co-operate in the Health Unit. COMMUNITY It is hard to make a report of community work done, as so much goes hand in hand with the school work. From April to October, we have movies each Saturday in the barn. The people are anxious to have them start even before it is warm enough for us to have, them. During the winter the boys play basketball in the barn. Not only the school, but the Gatlinburg boys usually play there once a week. In summer, the Gatlinburg boys play ball on the school ground. We are happy that the new church is practically completed. Different teachers have taken part in teaching Sunday School classes or reorganizing the Sunday School and assisting in B. Y. P. U. There are more things around the Burg in a social way than there used to be, but we still try to have occasional spellings, ice cream socials, and plays. The great entertainment is picnicing, big little, and middle size go on picnics. Much of Mr. Mattil's work includes community activities: A Community Club meets each month and sometimes oftener. A Poultry Association has been formed. Incubators and Brooders were used by the Community. Health and Farm meetings were held in various little schools during the fall. The big event each October is the Gatlinburg Fair. Last year it was followed by a County Fair in Sevierville, and a Division Fair in Knoxville, where we won second place. We received $65.00 in prizes in Sevierville, REPORTS OF OFFICERS 67 and as we plan to have our soft drinks and ice cream pay the expenses of our fair, we have enough money in the bank now to give a few prizes next fall. Nothing we have ever done has seemed to please everyone in the community like the little News we send out each month. Mr. Mattil and Mrs. Dowell deserve the greatest amount of praise for it, but we all help. Of course, we could not do it but for the mimeograph gotten last year. Smith-Hughes funds paid for part of it, and the School the balance. It certainly is in use a good part of the time. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER AT SUGARLANDS The report from Emma Harper Turner Center at Sugarlands shows eighty-nine pupils enrolled, and two teachers. But this comes far short of telling the tale. Helen Chew came in July and spent the month getting the cottage in shape. The people gave most of the labor and materials for repairing the little house, rent was free, and furniture was made by men of the community and bought by the school. The house was made into quite an attractive little place, and one the people were very proud of, as they had seen what could be done with an old place. No repairs were made on the school house, as the County Board wanted to build as soon as possible. Besides the school, Sunday School, church and various community meetings were held in the one room house. On Saturdays Helen Chew had classes for boys beyond the school age. Some worked across the mountain in North Carolina and would walk over to Sugarlands for their lessons. The regular school work of the seven grades was supplemented all the year by sewing classes taught by Mrs. Dowell (until the Smith-Hughes Economics teacher came) ; agriculture and farm projects by Mr. Mattil. Helen Chew preferred to teach the cooking classes during the fall term. After she left the first of the year Barbara Dewell took those classes. At Christmas time Helen was called home because of illness in the family. Mary Elder, a Sevier County girl, finished the year, and she and Cora McCarter had a very good term of school. Both of the girls were thoroughly interested in the community as well as the school work, scarcely being willing to spend any week-ends at their own homes. The experiment of having 'local girls take over the grade work was one I had been anxious to have tried. It sometimes has seemed to me we were a little slow in doing this. Whether it would be wise to have both teachers local, and a Pi Phi for supervisor and community worker is a question. 68 THE ARRow or PI BETA PHI Helen is to be back this next year and will take the school work as she did last year, and we expect Cora McCarter will go back, too. She is in the East Tennessee Normal now. The amount of book learning the little folks were taught last year is scarcely to be considered in the list of things accomplished in the Sugarlands last year. When I say that it sometimes seems to me that a whole community has been rebuilt, remoulded, the standard of living raised, spirit of cooperation developed, I do not feel I am putting it too strongly. People on the outside notice such a change, and again this year requests have come for us to go into other schools. I am so glad that during the summer Jean Steele and Mr. Mattil can continue their work; Jean goes twice a week; Mr. Mattil, once. Jean has not had less than seventeen girls in the class any time. The women do not come out in such numbers, but I think their classes just as important. In closing the report of the first extension work we have done, I feel we can say that it has been a success, and we all feel that it is a line of work we should continue. POWER AND LIGHT PLANT In the report last year, the statement was made that many nights had been dark ones, which meant that many times we were without lights. This year we can give a better report. The company has continued as first formed, Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples each owning 25% and the School, 50%. The men were not willing for the school to hold a controlling interest. The alternating current and all machinery recommended last year is now installed, with the exception of the governors. Quite a good many families have lights in their homes, more are asking for lights. The old Delco engine was traded in on a new Frigidaire, a small motor for pumping water and a larger one for sawing wood, etc. The Frigidaire is certainly a luxury we scarcely dared dream of. The Light Company seems to be paying good interest on the investment. The school preferred that the rebate be held each month, the stockholders paying for their light in that way money would be on hand for improvements and could be divided at the end of a given time. However, the men chose to do otherwise so receive our rebate on light bill each month. WATER SUPPLY There was some talk this spring ,of a water supply for the Community, the same people going into that as went into the Light Company. The school has sufficient water supply. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 69 BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE PAST YEAR Schoolhouse painted and windows reputtied; Stuart Cottage painted, barn practically completed, wire fence put around upper boundary of wood land; new chicken house built, chicken yard fenced; plank walks laid; one part of old barn made into work shop, tools purchased and lumber racks and tool closets made; new seats made for barn; library doors put in schoolhouse; trees and shrubs planted in school yard, around cottage and hospital; additional wiring in every building; play ground equipment; Frigidaire installed; motor for pumping water; motor for sawing wood, etc.; 'Ford truck purchased; water pipes laid from spring to hog and barn lots; Teachers' Cottz_ge re-roofed. UNFINISHED IMPROVEMENTS ALREADY VOTED ON Tiling and draining fields, orchard and roadway. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR Full time weaving teacher. One more year added to high school course. Teachers' Cottage in Emma Harper Turner Center. Plans made for first unit of a building to take care of baskets, sewing and weaving, as well as some shop work. Mrs. Dowell, as purchasing agent, housekeeper and helper in the office has meant a great deal. She is an efficient person, wherever you place her, and is always willing. With an experience in business, housekeeping and years of interest in church and community things, she certainly is valuable to us. She is staying through the summer and finds plenty to keep her busy helping with the canning, looking after the house and assisting with the basket business. The past year has been a reasonably successful one, and that is because of the untiring work of each one, staff, committee and all. When the teachers left, they all felt that next year could be made still better, and they left with a determination to do their part. (End of quoted report.) In closing this, my second annual report, I should like to take up your time to express to each member of the faculty of the School my keen appreciation of his untiring and unstinted effort. I should like to express to Mrs. Curtis my pleasure in having served on the Committee with her. Her efficient handling of the ways and means and the slides, which have been valuable to the School, and her keen sense of humor, have all gone to make her a beloved member, and it is with regret from all who have been associated with her that she retires from the Committee this year. Mrs. Turner has been handling the publicity, ,and while at times 70 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI she felt discouraged when she had to write four or five letters to get a reply, yet on the whole nobody could have done her work better nor with more enthusiasm than she has. Mrs. Geare has been editing the ARROW articles. If you have read them, you have seen her worth. It has been hard for Mrs. Stoolman to follow Miss Stuart, but there can not be too much praise given to her efficient methods. I am sure I express the sentiments of each and all of us associated with the School when I say to you here assembled that the work has been one of pleasure, one of high ideals, and one for which we shall be ever grateful to you for permitting us to be associated with you in your attempt to make life as a whole just a little finer each day than it was the day before.

        62 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and five teachers, and the dish that supplemented the noon lunch for the little tots. These meals were all served in the school cooking room. The plan worked very well, although sometimes the high school girls seemed to have rather less theoretical work and perhaps more of practical. The last month of school we discontinued the weaving classes, and the 8th grade girls prepared the noon meal; the high school girls have classes more along the line of text book work. Barbara Dewell was engaged to the first of June, but during the late winter we decided it might be better for her to go back to college for the spring term, coming back here again in the fall. In that way, she could continue her work, yet we would not have to hunt a new teacher for the coming year. We have a Smith-Hughes domestic science teacher for six months, starting in June. The regular school work was continued until close of the term, then classes were started in Cartertown, Sugarlands classes continued right on, and two classes in Gatlinburg. Already there are sixty-two enrolled. Miss White, the Supervisor, felt that this was an ideal place to try out a summer experiment, and we feel that we can assure her that it will be a success. The State pays five-eighths of the salary, which means that we can do this summer work for less than we would have been paid for the work had Barbara continued to the first of June. Jean Steele, the summer teacher, is a girl peculiarly adapted to work with rural people. She does a great amount of visiting in the homes and is having a most successful summer. SMITH-HUGES DEPARTMENT This work had advanced tremendously during the year. Work and plans of the two years previous seemed to take definite shape and in every way tell a most satisfactory tale. The school work with the boys was supplemented by practical lessons in wiring, building, spraying, pruning, repair work. The calls for advice in regard to stock, farms and orchards were many, and came from away back in the mountains. It has seemed as if Mr. Mattil had to be in the saddle or in a car about as much as the nurse. In the spring there would be trips at five in the morning to help a man start his spraying, then back here for breakfast and for school work. The men have been interested in poultry during the year, and have met each Saturday night, some walking several miles. Recently a Poultry Association has been formed to arrange for marketing poultry products. REPORTS OF OFFICERS G3 The Community Club meets once a month, usually oftener. A car-load of fertilizer was handled by it again this spring. The first week in May, the State Supervisor of Smith-Hughes Vocational Work was here. He was most enthusiastic regarding progress made, and said we could not realize it unless we were away for two years and then came back. He was so pleased that he said he would give us an additional $300.00 this year for more equipment for that department. Altogether the department has been very satisfactory the past year, judged not alone by us but by people from other communities and the County Superintendent. FARM The Farm by Tights is not under the care of a Smith Hughes teacher, but Mr. Mattil has given a good deal of time to planning for it and to supervision. It is in better condition now, is producing more, and is being run quite a little more businesslike. There have been a good many reasons why it was impossible to put in up-to-date methods, but little by little we are improving the old ways. We have good stock on the place; pigs, chickens, horses, cows. We are delighted to announce that Mr. and Mrs. Pi Phi Goat are happily domiciled at the School. Reports show at least $500.00 worth of feed raised the past year; no doubt the place produced well toward $1000.00 of the living expenses. We feel sure the farm will show up still better another year. WEAVING It has been the aim of your Committee in the past and your present Committee to encourage the girls from the community to teach in the school. With this in view we have employed as a weaving teacher, Mrs. Ownby. Last summer we had a former girl who had been off to study, to give lessons in root dyeing. WEAVING, BASKETS, CHAIRS This business has grown until it really would keep one person busy all the time if it were handled as it should be. Last fall the orders were larger than ever, and it is surprising how they continue to come in during the whole year. In the summer, a great deal is sold to the hotel visitors. Added to the weaving and baskets are the chairs: straight, rockers, little, medium and large sizes ; also stools. At the present time we have a great many baskets on hand, as people want to make them before crop time comes. During the spring and early summer we do not buy as many. In the fall we will be glad to have this large supply to draw on. I feel that the sales should bring the School sufficient profit to 64 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI maintain a full time weaving teacher, and believe it will if managed well. Not only is the basket business increasing, but I believe the quality of work is better than a few years ago. Added to the basket business, I had word not long ago that a candy firm would take any quantity of black walnuts up to twenty-five tons. I have shipped a few, but hope that in the fall more than one boy or girl can pay their school bill in this way. The mountains are full of black walnuts and should be a source of income. GIRLS' DORMITORY When school commenced, there were five teachers and six girls in the dormitory. The schedule of work was carried out as the year before and the planning of meals and supervision of the house was under the care of Barbara Dewell. She was absolutely new to the work, and there was no house mother. We were fortunate in having girls who had been in the dormitories before and who really understood some parts of the work much better than the teachers. While I was in New York on my vacation, I saw Mrs. Chapin, with whom I had some correspondence, with the result that she came here in December. She is splendid with the girls, and has as much tact with the teachers as with the pupils, and they need a house mother and home maker as much as the little girls do. With as much house work as the girls do, their washing and ironing and mending to look after each week, there is not much time left for work that can count against their school bills. One girl cleaned our cottage each morning before school, two helped some with the house ironing each week, another did a little weaving. During the time Barbara Dewell was ill with flu, and the time between her departure and the arrival of the new teacher, one girl did all the planning and supervising of the high school girls, who prepared the noon meal at the school, and she did very well. After Christmas, the family in the cottages numbers fourteen or fifteen all the time. Boys' DORMITORY The Boys' Cottage, rented from Miss Bishop and Miss Higginbotham, was quite satisfactory the past year. Mr. and Mrs. Leander McCarter lived there, Mrs. McCarter doing the work, and receiving in return board for her husband and little girl. There were times in the early fall when there were only four boys there, but all the spring term there were eight. While the boys did not have many house duties, they did have other work, keeping records of their time. Practically all was work REPORTS OF OFFICERS 65 Mr. Mattil planned and supervised, as it was along his line. We can certainly see improvement in this place. Never have the boys done more work, been more conscientious about it, or done as good a grade of work. One boy had full charge of the incubators this spring; another one the brooder another did practically all the firing of the furnaces; the chickens were entirely looked after by another boy; after Jim Reagan left, one boy kept up the repair work, which included carpenter work, wiring, a little plumbing, etc. With this much work done, our books should show quite a labor charge to offset a big living charge, but the main thing to consider is the fact that these older boys needed to be in school, they were having an opportunity to do these things under supervision and according to approved methods. Living in the dormitory gave them better opportunity to keep up their school work. Another year believe we can have all this still better organized. The last of the year, the boys came to the schoolhouse each night for study, and another year we shall continue this. The responsibility is divided among the teachers, and the boys do better studying. Also some outside boys come for the study hour. HOSPITAL AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT The full report given by Miss Higginbotham gives, much better than I can, the account of work done in that department. However, no report. can half tell the story of amount of work done or what that work means to the people of this country. Neither is that department the limit of Phyllis's work. We depend on her in every way. Year before last we demonstrated the need of an assistant in the office all the time. At the beginning of the school term, Harmo Taylor came and proved a most valuable helper. In fact, we are convinced that the general help these willing college girls can give is worth more to the nurse now than fust the professional help a trained nurse might give. With this help in the office, it has been possible for Miss Higginbotham to do more school work, the thing we always have wanted. In the fall, meetings were held in different schools in the district ; if Miss Higginbotham could not go, Miss Taylor went. The meetings were in charge of Mr. Mattil, but always there was a Health talk given. In the spring term a class for 8th, 9th, and 10th grades was held in our School, the regular Red Cross text being used. Eight girls received Red Cross certificates for completion of this course. The girls thoroughly enjoyed this, and, I know, got a great deal out of it. I am so glad to begin to have these classes. The doctors continue to come in at stated times, and also to make use of our good equipment. 66 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI A dentist comes once a month during the winter months, twice a month in the summer. An assistant has not made the work in this department less, it has only made more work possible. The year has been a good one, with a groat deal accomplished. HEALTH UNIT The County Court voted a sufficient appropriation in the fall to continue the Health Unit, but I feel sure that without our co-operation it 'would not be possible. We put in $1800.00 each year and receive back about $2300.00, but the money is not all. We have clinics, with the County Health Doctor in charge, free vaccination for the people for smallpox, typhoid, and many helps that would be impossible other-wise. There is even talk now that perhaps a Sanitary Inspector will be possible for the county. Time will tell what the County Court will do about that. I do not feel that there is any doubt about the wisdom of our continuing to co-operate in the Health Unit. COMMUNITY It is hard to make a report of community work done, as so much goes hand in hand with the school work. From April to October, we have movies each Saturday in the barn. The people are anxious to have them start even before it is warm enough for us to have, them. During the winter the boys play basketball in the barn. Not only the school, but the Gatlinburg boys usually play there once a week. In summer, the Gatlinburg boys play ball on the school ground. We are happy that the new church is practically completed. Different teachers have taken part in teaching Sunday School classes or reorganizing the Sunday School and assisting in B. Y. P. U. There are more things around the Burg in a social way than there used to be, but we still try to have occasional spellings, ice cream socials, and plays. The great entertainment is picnicing, big little, and middle size go on picnics. Much of Mr. Mattil's work includes community activities: A Community Club meets each month and sometimes oftener. A Poultry Association has been formed. Incubators and Brooders were used by the Community. Health and Farm meetings were held in various little schools during the fall. The big event each October is the Gatlinburg Fair. Last year it was followed by a County Fair in Sevierville, and a Division Fair in Knoxville, where we won second place. We received $65.00 in prizes in Sevierville, REPORTS OF OFFICERS 67 and as we plan to have our soft drinks and ice cream pay the expenses of our fair, we have enough money in the bank now to give a few prizes next fall. Nothing we have ever done has seemed to please everyone in the community like the little News we send out each month. Mr. Mattil and Mrs. Dowell deserve the greatest amount of praise for it, but we all help. Of course, we could not do it but for the mimeograph gotten last year. Smith-Hughes funds paid for part of it, and the School the balance. It certainly is in use a good part of the time. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER AT SUGARLANDS The report from Emma Harper Turner Center at Sugarlands shows eighty-nine pupils enrolled, and two teachers. But this comes far short of telling the tale. Helen Chew came in July and spent the month getting the cottage in shape. The people gave most of the labor and materials for repairing the little house, rent was free, and furniture was made by men of the community and bought by the school. The house was made into quite an attractive little place, and one the people were very proud of, as they had seen what could be done with an old place. No repairs were made on the school house, as the County Board wanted to build as soon as possible. Besides the school, Sunday School, church and various community meetings were held in the one room house. On Saturdays Helen Chew had classes for boys beyond the school age. Some worked across the mountain in North Carolina and would walk over to Sugarlands for their lessons. The regular school work of the seven grades was supplemented all the year by sewing classes taught by Mrs. Dowell (until the Smith-Hughes Economics teacher came) ; agriculture and farm projects by Mr. Mattil. Helen Chew preferred to teach the cooking classes during the fall term. After she left the first of the year Barbara Dewell took those classes. At Christmas time Helen was called home because of illness in the family. Mary Elder, a Sevier County girl, finished the year, and she and Cora McCarter had a very good term of school. Both of the girls were thoroughly interested in the community as well as the school work, scarcely being willing to spend any week-ends at their own homes. The experiment of having 'local girls take over the grade work was one I had been anxious to have tried. It sometimes has seemed to me we were a little slow in doing this. Whether it would be wise to have both teachers local, and a Pi Phi for supervisor and community worker is a question. 68 THE ARRow or PI BETA PHI Helen is to be back this next year and will take the school work as she did last year, and we expect Cora McCarter will go back, too. She is in the East Tennessee Normal now. The amount of book learning the little folks were taught last year is scarcely to be considered in the list of things accomplished in the Sugarlands last year. When I say that it sometimes seems to me that a whole community has been rebuilt, remoulded, the standard of living raised, spirit of cooperation developed, I do not feel I am putting it too strongly. People on the outside notice such a change, and again this year requests have come for us to go into other schools. I am so glad that during the summer Jean Steele and Mr. Mattil can continue their work; Jean goes twice a week; Mr. Mattil, once. Jean has not had less than seventeen girls in the class any time. The women do not come out in such numbers, but I think their classes just as important. In closing the report of the first extension work we have done, I feel we can say that it has been a success, and we all feel that it is a line of work we should continue. POWER AND LIGHT PLANT In the report last year, the statement was made that many nights had been dark ones, which meant that many times we were without lights. This year we can give a better report. The company has continued as first formed, Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples each owning 25% and the School, 50%. The men were not willing for the school to hold a controlling interest. The alternating current and all machinery recommended last year is now installed, with the exception of the governors. Quite a good many families have lights in their homes, more are asking for lights. The old Delco engine was traded in on a new Frigidaire, a small motor for pumping water and a larger one for sawing wood, etc. The Frigidaire is certainly a luxury we scarcely dared dream of. The Light Company seems to be paying good interest on the investment. The school preferred that the rebate be held each month, the stockholders paying for their light in that way money would be on hand for improvements and could be divided at the end of a given time. However, the men chose to do otherwise so receive our rebate on light bill each month. WATER SUPPLY There was some talk this spring ,of a water supply for the Community, the same people going into that as went into the Light Company. The school has sufficient water supply. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 69 BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE PAST YEAR Schoolhouse painted and windows reputtied; Stuart Cottage painted, barn practically completed, wire fence put around upper boundary of wood land; new chicken house built, chicken yard fenced; plank walks laid; one part of old barn made into work shop, tools purchased and lumber racks and tool closets made; new seats made for barn; library doors put in schoolhouse; trees and shrubs planted in school yard, around cottage and hospital; additional wiring in every building; play ground equipment; Frigidaire installed; motor for pumping water; motor for sawing wood, etc.; 'Ford truck purchased; water pipes laid from spring to hog and barn lots; Teachers' Cottz_ge re-roofed. UNFINISHED IMPROVEMENTS ALREADY VOTED ON Tiling and draining fields, orchard and roadway. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR Full time weaving teacher. One more year added to high school course. Teachers' Cottage in Emma Harper Turner Center. Plans made for first unit of a building to take care of baskets, sewing and weaving, as well as some shop work. Mrs. Dowell, as purchasing agent, housekeeper and helper in the office has meant a great deal. She is an efficient person, wherever you place her, and is always willing. With an experience in business, housekeeping and years of interest in church and community things, she certainly is valuable to us. She is staying through the summer and finds plenty to keep her busy helping with the canning, looking after the house and assisting with the basket business. The past year has been a reasonably successful one, and that is because of the untiring work of each one, staff, committee and all. When the teachers left, they all felt that next year could be made still better, and they left with a determination to do their part. (End of quoted report.) In closing this, my second annual report, I should like to take up your time to express to each member of the faculty of the School my keen appreciation of his untiring and unstinted effort. I should like to express to Mrs. Curtis my pleasure in having served on the Committee with her. Her efficient handling of the ways and means and the slides, which have been valuable to the School, and her keen sense of humor, have all gone to make her a beloved member, and it is with regret from all who have been associated with her that she retires from the Committee this year. Mrs. Turner has been handling the publicity, ,and while at times 70 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI she felt discouraged when she had to write four or five letters to get a reply, yet on the whole nobody could have done her work better nor with more enthusiasm than she has. Mrs. Geare has been editing the ARROW articles. If you have read them, you have seen her worth. It has been hard for Mrs. Stoolman to follow Miss Stuart, but there can not be too much praise given to her efficient methods. I am sure I express the sentiments of each and all of us associated with the School when I say to you here assembled that the work has been one of pleasure, one of high ideals, and one for which we shall be ever grateful to you for permitting us to be associated with you in your attempt to make life as a whole just a little finer each day than it was the day before.

        64 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI maintain a full time weaving teacher, and believe it will if managed well. Not only is the basket business increasing, but I believe the quality of work is better than a few years ago. Added to the basket business, I had word not long ago that a candy firm would take any quantity of black walnuts up to twenty-five tons. I have shipped a few, but hope that in the fall more than one boy or girl can pay their school bill in this way. The mountains are full of black walnuts and should be a source of income. GIRLS' DORMITORY When school commenced, there were five teachers and six girls in the dormitory. The schedule of work was carried out as the year before and the planning of meals and supervision of the house was under the care of Barbara Dewell. She was absolutely new to the work, and there was no house mother. We were fortunate in having girls who had been in the dormitories before and who really understood some parts of the work much better than the teachers. While I was in New York on my vacation, I saw Mrs. Chapin, with whom I had some correspondence, with the result that she came here in December. She is splendid with the girls, and has as much tact with the teachers as with the pupils, and they need a house mother and home maker as much as the little girls do. With as much house work as the girls do, their washing and ironing and mending to look after each week, there is not much time left for work that can count against their school bills. One girl cleaned our cottage each morning before school, two helped some with the house ironing each week, another did a little weaving. During the time Barbara Dewell was ill with flu, and the time between her departure and the arrival of the new teacher, one girl did all the planning and supervising of the high school girls, who prepared the noon meal at the school, and she did very well. After Christmas, the family in the cottages numbers fourteen or fifteen all the time. Boys' DORMITORY The Boys' Cottage, rented from Miss Bishop and Miss Higginbotham, was quite satisfactory the past year. Mr. and Mrs. Leander McCarter lived there, Mrs. McCarter doing the work, and receiving in return board for her husband and little girl. There were times in the early fall when there were only four boys there, but all the spring term there were eight. While the boys did not have many house duties, they did have other work, keeping records of their time. Practically all was work REPORTS OF OFFICERS 65 Mr. Mattil planned and supervised, as it was along his line. We can certainly see improvement in this place. Never have the boys done more work, been more conscientious about it, or done as good a grade of work. One boy had full charge of the incubators this spring; another one the brooder another did practically all the firing of the furnaces; the chickens were entirely looked after by another boy; after Jim Reagan left, one boy kept up the repair work, which included carpenter work, wiring, a little plumbing, etc. With this much work done, our books should show quite a labor charge to offset a big living charge, but the main thing to consider is the fact that these older boys needed to be in school, they were having an opportunity to do these things under supervision and according to approved methods. Living in the dormitory gave them better opportunity to keep up their school work. Another year believe we can have all this still better organized. The last of the year, the boys came to the schoolhouse each night for study, and another year we shall continue this. The responsibility is divided among the teachers, and the boys do better studying. Also some outside boys come for the study hour. HOSPITAL AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT The full report given by Miss Higginbotham gives, much better than I can, the account of work done in that department. However, no report. can half tell the story of amount of work done or what that work means to the people of this country. Neither is that department the limit of Phyllis's work. We depend on her in every way. Year before last we demonstrated the need of an assistant in the office all the time. At the beginning of the school term, Harmo Taylor came and proved a most valuable helper. In fact, we are convinced that the general help these willing college girls can give is worth more to the nurse now than fust the professional help a trained nurse might give. With this help in the office, it has been possible for Miss Higginbotham to do more school work, the thing we always have wanted. In the fall, meetings were held in different schools in the district ; if Miss Higginbotham could not go, Miss Taylor went. The meetings were in charge of Mr. Mattil, but always there was a Health talk given. In the spring term a class for 8th, 9th, and 10th grades was held in our School, the regular Red Cross text being used. Eight girls received Red Cross certificates for completion of this course. The girls thoroughly enjoyed this, and, I know, got a great deal out of it. I am so glad to begin to have these classes. The doctors continue to come in at stated times, and also to make use of our good equipment. 66 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI A dentist comes once a month during the winter months, twice a month in the summer. An assistant has not made the work in this department less, it has only made more work possible. The year has been a good one, with a groat deal accomplished. HEALTH UNIT The County Court voted a sufficient appropriation in the fall to continue the Health Unit, but I feel sure that without our co-operation it 'would not be possible. We put in $1800.00 each year and receive back about $2300.00, but the money is not all. We have clinics, with the County Health Doctor in charge, free vaccination for the people for smallpox, typhoid, and many helps that would be impossible other-wise. There is even talk now that perhaps a Sanitary Inspector will be possible for the county. Time will tell what the County Court will do about that. I do not feel that there is any doubt about the wisdom of our continuing to co-operate in the Health Unit. COMMUNITY It is hard to make a report of community work done, as so much goes hand in hand with the school work. From April to October, we have movies each Saturday in the barn. The people are anxious to have them start even before it is warm enough for us to have, them. During the winter the boys play basketball in the barn. Not only the school, but the Gatlinburg boys usually play there once a week. In summer, the Gatlinburg boys play ball on the school ground. We are happy that the new church is practically completed. Different teachers have taken part in teaching Sunday School classes or reorganizing the Sunday School and assisting in B. Y. P. U. There are more things around the Burg in a social way than there used to be, but we still try to have occasional spellings, ice cream socials, and plays. The great entertainment is picnicing, big little, and middle size go on picnics. Much of Mr. Mattil's work includes community activities: A Community Club meets each month and sometimes oftener. A Poultry Association has been formed. Incubators and Brooders were used by the Community. Health and Farm meetings were held in various little schools during the fall. The big event each October is the Gatlinburg Fair. Last year it was followed by a County Fair in Sevierville, and a Division Fair in Knoxville, where we won second place. We received $65.00 in prizes in Sevierville, REPORTS OF OFFICERS 67 and as we plan to have our soft drinks and ice cream pay the expenses of our fair, we have enough money in the bank now to give a few prizes next fall. Nothing we have ever done has seemed to please everyone in the community like the little News we send out each month. Mr. Mattil and Mrs. Dowell deserve the greatest amount of praise for it, but we all help. Of course, we could not do it but for the mimeograph gotten last year. Smith-Hughes funds paid for part of it, and the School the balance. It certainly is in use a good part of the time. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER AT SUGARLANDS The report from Emma Harper Turner Center at Sugarlands shows eighty-nine pupils enrolled, and two teachers. But this comes far short of telling the tale. Helen Chew came in July and spent the month getting the cottage in shape. The people gave most of the labor and materials for repairing the little house, rent was free, and furniture was made by men of the community and bought by the school. The house was made into quite an attractive little place, and one the people were very proud of, as they had seen what could be done with an old place. No repairs were made on the school house, as the County Board wanted to build as soon as possible. Besides the school, Sunday School, church and various community meetings were held in the one room house. On Saturdays Helen Chew had classes for boys beyond the school age. Some worked across the mountain in North Carolina and would walk over to Sugarlands for their lessons. The regular school work of the seven grades was supplemented all the year by sewing classes taught by Mrs. Dowell (until the Smith-Hughes Economics teacher came) ; agriculture and farm projects by Mr. Mattil. Helen Chew preferred to teach the cooking classes during the fall term. After she left the first of the year Barbara Dewell took those classes. At Christmas time Helen was called home because of illness in the family. Mary Elder, a Sevier County girl, finished the year, and she and Cora McCarter had a very good term of school. Both of the girls were thoroughly interested in the community as well as the school work, scarcely being willing to spend any week-ends at their own homes. The experiment of having 'local girls take over the grade work was one I had been anxious to have tried. It sometimes has seemed to me we were a little slow in doing this. Whether it would be wise to have both teachers local, and a Pi Phi for supervisor and community worker is a question. 68 THE ARRow or PI BETA PHI Helen is to be back this next year and will take the school work as she did last year, and we expect Cora McCarter will go back, too. She is in the East Tennessee Normal now. The amount of book learning the little folks were taught last year is scarcely to be considered in the list of things accomplished in the Sugarlands last year. When I say that it sometimes seems to me that a whole community has been rebuilt, remoulded, the standard of living raised, spirit of cooperation developed, I do not feel I am putting it too strongly. People on the outside notice such a change, and again this year requests have come for us to go into other schools. I am so glad that during the summer Jean Steele and Mr. Mattil can continue their work; Jean goes twice a week; Mr. Mattil, once. Jean has not had less than seventeen girls in the class any time. The women do not come out in such numbers, but I think their classes just as important. In closing the report of the first extension work we have done, I feel we can say that it has been a success, and we all feel that it is a line of work we should continue. POWER AND LIGHT PLANT In the report last year, the statement was made that many nights had been dark ones, which meant that many times we were without lights. This year we can give a better report. The company has continued as first formed, Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples each owning 25% and the School, 50%. The men were not willing for the school to hold a controlling interest. The alternating current and all machinery recommended last year is now installed, with the exception of the governors. Quite a good many families have lights in their homes, more are asking for lights. The old Delco engine was traded in on a new Frigidaire, a small motor for pumping water and a larger one for sawing wood, etc. The Frigidaire is certainly a luxury we scarcely dared dream of. The Light Company seems to be paying good interest on the investment. The school preferred that the rebate be held each month, the stockholders paying for their light in that way money would be on hand for improvements and could be divided at the end of a given time. However, the men chose to do otherwise so receive our rebate on light bill each month. WATER SUPPLY There was some talk this spring ,of a water supply for the Community, the same people going into that as went into the Light Company. The school has sufficient water supply. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 69 BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE PAST YEAR Schoolhouse painted and windows reputtied; Stuart Cottage painted, barn practically completed, wire fence put around upper boundary of wood land; new chicken house built, chicken yard fenced; plank walks laid; one part of old barn made into work shop, tools purchased and lumber racks and tool closets made; new seats made for barn; library doors put in schoolhouse; trees and shrubs planted in school yard, around cottage and hospital; additional wiring in every building; play ground equipment; Frigidaire installed; motor for pumping water; motor for sawing wood, etc.; 'Ford truck purchased; water pipes laid from spring to hog and barn lots; Teachers' Cottz_ge re-roofed. UNFINISHED IMPROVEMENTS ALREADY VOTED ON Tiling and draining fields, orchard and roadway. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR Full time weaving teacher. One more year added to high school course. Teachers' Cottage in Emma Harper Turner Center. Plans made for first unit of a building to take care of baskets, sewing and weaving, as well as some shop work. Mrs. Dowell, as purchasing agent, housekeeper and helper in the office has meant a great deal. She is an efficient person, wherever you place her, and is always willing. With an experience in business, housekeeping and years of interest in church and community things, she certainly is valuable to us. She is staying through the summer and finds plenty to keep her busy helping with the canning, looking after the house and assisting with the basket business. The past year has been a reasonably successful one, and that is because of the untiring work of each one, staff, committee and all. When the teachers left, they all felt that next year could be made still better, and they left with a determination to do their part. (End of quoted report.) In closing this, my second annual report, I should like to take up your time to express to each member of the faculty of the School my keen appreciation of his untiring and unstinted effort. I should like to express to Mrs. Curtis my pleasure in having served on the Committee with her. Her efficient handling of the ways and means and the slides, which have been valuable to the School, and her keen sense of humor, have all gone to make her a beloved member, and it is with regret from all who have been associated with her that she retires from the Committee this year. Mrs. Turner has been handling the publicity, ,and while at times 70 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI she felt discouraged when she had to write four or five letters to get a reply, yet on the whole nobody could have done her work better nor with more enthusiasm than she has. Mrs. Geare has been editing the ARROW articles. If you have read them, you have seen her worth. It has been hard for Mrs. Stoolman to follow Miss Stuart, but there can not be too much praise given to her efficient methods. I am sure I express the sentiments of each and all of us associated with the School when I say to you here assembled that the work has been one of pleasure, one of high ideals, and one for which we shall be ever grateful to you for permitting us to be associated with you in your attempt to make life as a whole just a little finer each day than it was the day before.

        66 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI A dentist comes once a month during the winter months, twice a month in the summer. An assistant has not made the work in this department less, it has only made more work possible. The year has been a good one, with a groat deal accomplished. HEALTH UNIT The County Court voted a sufficient appropriation in the fall to continue the Health Unit, but I feel sure that without our co-operation it 'would not be possible. We put in $1800.00 each year and receive back about $2300.00, but the money is not all. We have clinics, with the County Health Doctor in charge, free vaccination for the people for smallpox, typhoid, and many helps that would be impossible other-wise. There is even talk now that perhaps a Sanitary Inspector will be possible for the county. Time will tell what the County Court will do about that. I do not feel that there is any doubt about the wisdom of our continuing to co-operate in the Health Unit. COMMUNITY It is hard to make a report of community work done, as so much goes hand in hand with the school work. From April to October, we have movies each Saturday in the barn. The people are anxious to have them start even before it is warm enough for us to have, them. During the winter the boys play basketball in the barn. Not only the school, but the Gatlinburg boys usually play there once a week. In summer, the Gatlinburg boys play ball on the school ground. We are happy that the new church is practically completed. Different teachers have taken part in teaching Sunday School classes or reorganizing the Sunday School and assisting in B. Y. P. U. There are more things around the Burg in a social way than there used to be, but we still try to have occasional spellings, ice cream socials, and plays. The great entertainment is picnicing, big little, and middle size go on picnics. Much of Mr. Mattil's work includes community activities: A Community Club meets each month and sometimes oftener. A Poultry Association has been formed. Incubators and Brooders were used by the Community. Health and Farm meetings were held in various little schools during the fall. The big event each October is the Gatlinburg Fair. Last year it was followed by a County Fair in Sevierville, and a Division Fair in Knoxville, where we won second place. We received $65.00 in prizes in Sevierville, REPORTS OF OFFICERS 67 and as we plan to have our soft drinks and ice cream pay the expenses of our fair, we have enough money in the bank now to give a few prizes next fall. Nothing we have ever done has seemed to please everyone in the community like the little News we send out each month. Mr. Mattil and Mrs. Dowell deserve the greatest amount of praise for it, but we all help. Of course, we could not do it but for the mimeograph gotten last year. Smith-Hughes funds paid for part of it, and the School the balance. It certainly is in use a good part of the time. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER AT SUGARLANDS The report from Emma Harper Turner Center at Sugarlands shows eighty-nine pupils enrolled, and two teachers. But this comes far short of telling the tale. Helen Chew came in July and spent the month getting the cottage in shape. The people gave most of the labor and materials for repairing the little house, rent was free, and furniture was made by men of the community and bought by the school. The house was made into quite an attractive little place, and one the people were very proud of, as they had seen what could be done with an old place. No repairs were made on the school house, as the County Board wanted to build as soon as possible. Besides the school, Sunday School, church and various community meetings were held in the one room house. On Saturdays Helen Chew had classes for boys beyond the school age. Some worked across the mountain in North Carolina and would walk over to Sugarlands for their lessons. The regular school work of the seven grades was supplemented all the year by sewing classes taught by Mrs. Dowell (until the Smith-Hughes Economics teacher came) ; agriculture and farm projects by Mr. Mattil. Helen Chew preferred to teach the cooking classes during the fall term. After she left the first of the year Barbara Dewell took those classes. At Christmas time Helen was called home because of illness in the family. Mary Elder, a Sevier County girl, finished the year, and she and Cora McCarter had a very good term of school. Both of the girls were thoroughly interested in the community as well as the school work, scarcely being willing to spend any week-ends at their own homes. The experiment of having 'local girls take over the grade work was one I had been anxious to have tried. It sometimes has seemed to me we were a little slow in doing this. Whether it would be wise to have both teachers local, and a Pi Phi for supervisor and community worker is a question. 68 THE ARRow or PI BETA PHI Helen is to be back this next year and will take the school work as she did last year, and we expect Cora McCarter will go back, too. She is in the East Tennessee Normal now. The amount of book learning the little folks were taught last year is scarcely to be considered in the list of things accomplished in the Sugarlands last year. When I say that it sometimes seems to me that a whole community has been rebuilt, remoulded, the standard of living raised, spirit of cooperation developed, I do not feel I am putting it too strongly. People on the outside notice such a change, and again this year requests have come for us to go into other schools. I am so glad that during the summer Jean Steele and Mr. Mattil can continue their work; Jean goes twice a week; Mr. Mattil, once. Jean has not had less than seventeen girls in the class any time. The women do not come out in such numbers, but I think their classes just as important. In closing the report of the first extension work we have done, I feel we can say that it has been a success, and we all feel that it is a line of work we should continue. POWER AND LIGHT PLANT In the report last year, the statement was made that many nights had been dark ones, which meant that many times we were without lights. This year we can give a better report. The company has continued as first formed, Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples each owning 25% and the School, 50%. The men were not willing for the school to hold a controlling interest. The alternating current and all machinery recommended last year is now installed, with the exception of the governors. Quite a good many families have lights in their homes, more are asking for lights. The old Delco engine was traded in on a new Frigidaire, a small motor for pumping water and a larger one for sawing wood, etc. The Frigidaire is certainly a luxury we scarcely dared dream of. The Light Company seems to be paying good interest on the investment. The school preferred that the rebate be held each month, the stockholders paying for their light in that way money would be on hand for improvements and could be divided at the end of a given time. However, the men chose to do otherwise so receive our rebate on light bill each month. WATER SUPPLY There was some talk this spring ,of a water supply for the Community, the same people going into that as went into the Light Company. The school has sufficient water supply. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 69 BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE PAST YEAR Schoolhouse painted and windows reputtied; Stuart Cottage painted, barn practically completed, wire fence put around upper boundary of wood land; new chicken house built, chicken yard fenced; plank walks laid; one part of old barn made into work shop, tools purchased and lumber racks and tool closets made; new seats made for barn; library doors put in schoolhouse; trees and shrubs planted in school yard, around cottage and hospital; additional wiring in every building; play ground equipment; Frigidaire installed; motor for pumping water; motor for sawing wood, etc.; 'Ford truck purchased; water pipes laid from spring to hog and barn lots; Teachers' Cottz_ge re-roofed. UNFINISHED IMPROVEMENTS ALREADY VOTED ON Tiling and draining fields, orchard and roadway. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR Full time weaving teacher. One more year added to high school course. Teachers' Cottage in Emma Harper Turner Center. Plans made for first unit of a building to take care of baskets, sewing and weaving, as well as some shop work. Mrs. Dowell, as purchasing agent, housekeeper and helper in the office has meant a great deal. She is an efficient person, wherever you place her, and is always willing. With an experience in business, housekeeping and years of interest in church and community things, she certainly is valuable to us. She is staying through the summer and finds plenty to keep her busy helping with the canning, looking after the house and assisting with the basket business. The past year has been a reasonably successful one, and that is because of the untiring work of each one, staff, committee and all. When the teachers left, they all felt that next year could be made still better, and they left with a determination to do their part. (End of quoted report.) In closing this, my second annual report, I should like to take up your time to express to each member of the faculty of the School my keen appreciation of his untiring and unstinted effort. I should like to express to Mrs. Curtis my pleasure in having served on the Committee with her. Her efficient handling of the ways and means and the slides, which have been valuable to the School, and her keen sense of humor, have all gone to make her a beloved member, and it is with regret from all who have been associated with her that she retires from the Committee this year. Mrs. Turner has been handling the publicity, ,and while at times 70 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI she felt discouraged when she had to write four or five letters to get a reply, yet on the whole nobody could have done her work better nor with more enthusiasm than she has. Mrs. Geare has been editing the ARROW articles. If you have read them, you have seen her worth. It has been hard for Mrs. Stoolman to follow Miss Stuart, but there can not be too much praise given to her efficient methods. I am sure I express the sentiments of each and all of us associated with the School when I say to you here assembled that the work has been one of pleasure, one of high ideals, and one for which we shall be ever grateful to you for permitting us to be associated with you in your attempt to make life as a whole just a little finer each day than it was the day before.

        68 THE ARRow or PI BETA PHI Helen is to be back this next year and will take the school work as she did last year, and we expect Cora McCarter will go back, too.

        70 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI she felt discouraged when she had to write four or five letters to get a reply, yet on the whole nobody could have done her work better nor with more enthusiasm than she has. Mrs. Geare has been editing the ARROW articles. If you have read them, you have seen her worth. It has been hard for Mrs. Stoolman to follow Miss Stuart, but there can not be too much praise given to her efficient methods. I am sure I express the sentiments of each and all of us associated with the School when I say to you here assembled that the work has been one of pleasure, one of high ideals, and one for which we shall be ever grateful to you for permitting us to be associated with you in your attempt to make life as a whole just a little finer each day than it was the day before.

The average time spent in this office is about 4 hours every evening and an average of 1.0 hours a clay every Saturday and Sunday. Respectfully submitted, FLORENCE CLUM TEMPLE. REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE To Grand Council and Representatives of Pi Beta Phi, in Convention Assembled: At the completion of this, my third year on the Settlement School Committee of Pi Beta Phi, and my second year as Chairman of the Committee, I find that my command of English is totally inadequate to express to you my appreciation for the opportunities which have been mine to serve with my ,Committee in this the greatest work ever attempted by any fraternity. We have labored incessantly this year to surmount the purely mechanical details of handling the Settlement School while located far from the basis of action. Further than that, we have striven with ever-inereasing zeal to place before the fraternity at large a picture that might arouse enthusiasm of graduate and undergraduate alike. That we have been relatively successful has been our reward. That we have not been completely successful in all our aims has but proven to us that there are further steps necessary to be taken in order to convince Pi Beta Phi, collectively and individually, that it is receiving the plaudits of the fraternal world in the work that it is attempting to do, As has been our custom for several years back, we have continued to budget our expenses, and I am happy to say that it has been of inestimable help in directing the financial affairs of the School. At the beginning of the year, we were without the accustomed valuable aid of Miss Melinda Stuart, but discovered in Mrs. Stoolman one whose heart is given to the work, and who repeatedly brought to bear her trained mental equipment upon the problems which presented themselves. As far as the expenses of the School are concerned, all our bills are paid, and those practically when due. There remains in the treasury an amount barely exceeding last year's balance, with which to begin the new year's work. Permit me to discuss the matter of income a little later in my report. The organization of the. School was completed before the session began last summer. We never opened school before under more promising eircustances. With the exception of illness, which required the absence of some of our teachers for a short time, they have been in REPORTS OF OFFICERS 59 service all through the year, giving the most effective co-operation, not only in their own departments, but wherever and whenever the opportunity offered. The head resident of the School, Miss Evelyn Bishop, is well fitted to serve in this capacity. She is well equipped mentally, and naturally gifted in character for the understanding of such a delicate position as. she holds. Many of you know her, and so that the rest of you who hear or read this report may come to know of her grasp of the situation, her executive ability, her heartfelt interest, and her success in the administration of this great work, I am taking the liberty of including her report to the Settlement School Committee. It is not as minutely technical as the report of Mr. Mattil, our ,Smith-Hughes representative, nor of Miss Chew, our Director of the Emma Harper Turner Center at Sugarlands, but for a word painting of any situation, I have yet to find one so dissecting, so illuminating, so all-inclusive. I recommend that you spend sufficient time reading and re-reading this report, so as to steep yourselves with the particulars, in order that you may grasp the situation as a whole. The recommendations made by Miss Bishop, whose report I incorporate below, are the recommendations of the combined faculty of the Schools and of the Committee, who have met and agreed upon this course before presenting this report to you. REPORT OF HEAD RESIDENT Pr PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1924-1925 The year 1924-25 found the School with a larger staff, more varied work, and with an extension school started. Even though the work and workers were new in some departments, I feel sure we can call it a successful year. The school spirit, grade of work, and the co-operation of the people have all been good. For nearly three months the head resident was away on the vacation granted by the Committee last summer, and during that time those in the School carried on the work wonderfully well. Many thanks are due Mrs. Dowell, who took over so much of the office and industrial business and made the vacation possible. The staff has been as follows: Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident. Phyllis Higginbotham, Nurse. Harmo Taylor, AsSistant Nurse. Margaret White, Departmental work, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th grades. Helen Barrett, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th grades. Marion Folsom, 5th, 6th grades. Elmer Watson, 3rd, 4th grades. Emily Burton (one year's vacation) 1st, 2nd primary grades. Barbara Dewell, Domestic Science. Allie Ownby, Weaving. 60 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI O. J. Mattil, Agriculture and Farm Shop. Mrs. Dowell, Purchasing Agent, Housekeeper, and Assistant in the Industrial Dept. Mrs. Dora Chapin, House Mother, Girls' Cottages. Lizzie Reagan, Cook and Helper, Teachers' Cottage. Leander McCarter, General Farm and Handy Work. J. T. Reagan, Carpenter and Repair Work. Mrs. McCarter, Cook, Boys' Cottage. Helen Chew, :Sugarlands School. Cora McCarter, Sugarlands School. At Christmas time Miss .Chew was compelled to go home, and her place was taken by Mary Elder, of Sevierville. Harmo Taylor and Barbara Dewell went back to college at the beginning of the spring term, and their places were taken by Jean Steele and Lois Rogers. J. T. Reagan stopped work at the school in the late winter, and his work was done by one of the school boys. SCHOOL The School enrollment for the past year was no larger than the year before, being 130. The per cent of attendance was better due in part to an efficient truant officer in the county, and in part to a greater appreciation on the part of parents of the advantage of steady attendance. The first six grades completed an eight months' school term. The four upper grades lacked only one week of completing nine months. Six pupils completed the eighth grade and received State certificates. Seven pupils completed second year high school. One new teacher was added. Mr. Elmer Watson took the 3rd and 4th grades, in that way relieving Miss Burton's and Miss Folsom's room of so many grades. He also coached the baseball and basketball teams and made the trips with them. He was hired with the under-standing that he would supervise outside work of boys living here, but through no fault of his, did not do as much of that work as we had hoped he could. His influence with the boys is fine, and his work in school is good enough to favor his return. Miss Margaret White and Miss Helen Barrett were both new, but the classes went on very well, and I believe the girls held the pupils to a high grade of work. Besides the regular grade work, the schedule for weaving, sewing, cooking and agriculture was carefully worked out. All this made a very full course for the boys and girls and gave them all the work they could carry. During the school year the teachers put on a Health Play at one of the Teachers Institutes in Sevierville. The usual plays, entertain ments, etc., were given at Christmas, close ,of school and Thanksgiving. The interest in athletics was excellent. The basketball team played a good many games, both on the local court and in other schools. New REPORTS OF OFFICERS 61 baseball uniforms were given by a group of men who visit here, including Mr. Hall ; the same men gave $30.00 in the winter for baseball, and another visitor gave ball "nits this spring. Of course, the interest of outsiders in the team gave the boys and coach a lot of courage. Athletics have not been an expense to the school. The boys are playing once a week during the summer. TEACHERS Miss Lois Rogers, who has been taking Miss Harmo Taylor's place this spring, will take Miss Folsom's room. The same questions regarding school have been talked over every year, consolidation, extension, etc. I do not think there will be any changes in any of the schools for another year. One good step taken this year is giving the counties an eight month's free school. This will mean much to us. in keeping attendance up, not only daily, but keeping the younger ones in school until the close of the spring term. It will raise the standard of work in the nearby school, too. Also we will receive from the county more money for both this and Sugarlands School. Just what the amount per month will be I can not tell yet, but certainly no less than before, and it will continue for eight months. A new year will be added. This has been our hope for many years, but only now is the time suited to add this extra year. We have had seven pupils to finish second year high, and as these boys and girls are necessary to the morale, both in the school room and athletics, and are most anxious for another year at school, we have had to meet their demands. We were not able to rent or buy the Eslinger house last year, so solved the difficulty of room by putting the sewing in one room of the Stuart Cottage; the cooking stayed in the basement of the schoolhouse; the weaving was moved to the Log Cabin, and all of Mr. Mattil's work was kept in the old barn where it had been. The baskets and weaving we have for sale were kept in Mrs. Dowell's room in the attic as heretofore. Not the least of all our troubles is to find a place to store and pack as well as to sell, the baskets. DOMESTIC SCIENCE From the beginning of the school term, we had regular classes in cooking and sewing. The cooking classes were held in the school basement room; the sewing in one room of the Stuart Cottage. The domestic science teacher also had the care of the meals in the Girls' Cottage, planned for the supplies in that cottage, the high school girls under her supervision prepared the noon meals for all dormitory girls 62 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and five teachers, and the dish that supplemented the noon lunch for the little tots. These meals were all served in the school cooking room. The plan worked very well, although sometimes the high school girls seemed to have rather less theoretical work and perhaps more of practical. The last month of school we discontinued the weaving classes, and the 8th grade girls prepared the noon meal; the high school girls have classes more along the line of text book work. Barbara Dewell was engaged to the first of June, but during the late winter we decided it might be better for her to go back to college for the spring term, coming back here again in the fall. In that way, she could continue her work, yet we would not have to hunt a new teacher for the coming year. We have a Smith-Hughes domestic science teacher for six months, starting in June. The regular school work was continued until close of the term, then classes were started in Cartertown, Sugarlands classes continued right on, and two classes in Gatlinburg. Already there are sixty-two enrolled. Miss White, the Supervisor, felt that this was an ideal place to try out a summer experiment, and we feel that we can assure her that it will be a success. The State pays five-eighths of the salary, which means that we can do this summer work for less than we would have been paid for the work had Barbara continued to the first of June. Jean Steele, the summer teacher, is a girl peculiarly adapted to work with rural people. She does a great amount of visiting in the homes and is having a most successful summer. SMITH-HUGES DEPARTMENT This work had advanced tremendously during the year. Work and plans of the two years previous seemed to take definite shape and in every way tell a most satisfactory tale. The school work with the boys was supplemented by practical lessons in wiring, building, spraying, pruning, repair work. The calls for advice in regard to stock, farms and orchards were many, and came from away back in the mountains. It has seemed as if Mr. Mattil had to be in the saddle or in a car about as much as the nurse. In the spring there would be trips at five in the morning to help a man start his spraying, then back here for breakfast and for school work. The men have been interested in poultry during the year, and have met each Saturday night, some walking several miles. Recently a Poultry Association has been formed to arrange for marketing poultry products. REPORTS OF OFFICERS G3 The Community Club meets once a month, usually oftener. A car-load of fertilizer was handled by it again this spring. The first week in May, the State Supervisor of Smith-Hughes Vocational Work was here. He was most enthusiastic regarding progress made, and said we could not realize it unless we were away for two years and then came back. He was so pleased that he said he would give us an additional $300.00 this year for more equipment for that department. Altogether the department has been very satisfactory the past year, judged not alone by us but by people from other communities and the County Superintendent. FARM The Farm by Tights is not under the care of a Smith Hughes teacher, but Mr. Mattil has given a good deal of time to planning for it and to supervision. It is in better condition now, is producing more, and is being run quite a little more businesslike. There have been a good many reasons why it was impossible to put in up-to-date methods, but little by little we are improving the old ways. We have good stock on the place; pigs, chickens, horses, cows. We are delighted to announce that Mr. and Mrs. Pi Phi Goat are happily domiciled at the School. Reports show at least $500.00 worth of feed raised the past year; no doubt the place produced well toward $1000.00 of the living expenses. We feel sure the farm will show up still better another year. WEAVING It has been the aim of your Committee in the past and your present Committee to encourage the girls from the community to teach in the school. With this in view we have employed as a weaving teacher, Mrs. Ownby. Last summer we had a former girl who had been off to study, to give lessons in root dyeing. WEAVING, BASKETS, CHAIRS This business has grown until it really would keep one person busy all the time if it were handled as it should be. Last fall the orders were larger than ever, and it is surprising how they continue to come in during the whole year. In the summer, a great deal is sold to the hotel visitors. Added to the weaving and baskets are the chairs: straight, rockers, little, medium and large sizes ; also stools. At the present time we have a great many baskets on hand, as people want to make them before crop time comes. During the spring and early summer we do not buy as many. In the fall we will be glad to have this large supply to draw on. I feel that the sales should bring the School sufficient profit to 64 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI maintain a full time weaving teacher, and believe it will if managed well. Not only is the basket business increasing, but I believe the quality of work is better than a few years ago. Added to the basket business, I had word not long ago that a candy firm would take any quantity of black walnuts up to twenty-five tons. I have shipped a few, but hope that in the fall more than one boy or girl can pay their school bill in this way. The mountains are full of black walnuts and should be a source of income. GIRLS' DORMITORY When school commenced, there were five teachers and six girls in the dormitory. The schedule of work was carried out as the year before and the planning of meals and supervision of the house was under the care of Barbara Dewell. She was absolutely new to the work, and there was no house mother. We were fortunate in having girls who had been in the dormitories before and who really understood some parts of the work much better than the teachers. While I was in New York on my vacation, I saw Mrs. Chapin, with whom I had some correspondence, with the result that she came here in December. She is splendid with the girls, and has as much tact with the teachers as with the pupils, and they need a house mother and home maker as much as the little girls do. With as much house work as the girls do, their washing and ironing and mending to look after each week, there is not much time left for work that can count against their school bills. One girl cleaned our cottage each morning before school, two helped some with the house ironing each week, another did a little weaving. During the time Barbara Dewell was ill with flu, and the time between her departure and the arrival of the new teacher, one girl did all the planning and supervising of the high school girls, who prepared the noon meal at the school, and she did very well. After Christmas, the family in the cottages numbers fourteen or fifteen all the time. Boys' DORMITORY The Boys' Cottage, rented from Miss Bishop and Miss Higginbotham, was quite satisfactory the past year. Mr. and Mrs. Leander McCarter lived there, Mrs. McCarter doing the work, and receiving in return board for her husband and little girl. There were times in the early fall when there were only four boys there, but all the spring term there were eight. While the boys did not have many house duties, they did have other work, keeping records of their time. Practically all was work REPORTS OF OFFICERS 65 Mr. Mattil planned and supervised, as it was along his line. We can certainly see improvement in this place. Never have the boys done more work, been more conscientious about it, or done as good a grade of work. One boy had full charge of the incubators this spring; another one the brooder another did practically all the firing of the furnaces; the chickens were entirely looked after by another boy; after Jim Reagan left, one boy kept up the repair work, which included carpenter work, wiring, a little plumbing, etc. With this much work done, our books should show quite a labor charge to offset a big living charge, but the main thing to consider is the fact that these older boys needed to be in school, they were having an opportunity to do these things under supervision and according to approved methods. Living in the dormitory gave them better opportunity to keep up their school work. Another year believe we can have all this still better organized. The last of the year, the boys came to the schoolhouse each night for study, and another year we shall continue this. The responsibility is divided among the teachers, and the boys do better studying. Also some outside boys come for the study hour. HOSPITAL AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT The full report given by Miss Higginbotham gives, much better than I can, the account of work done in that department. However, no report. can half tell the story of amount of work done or what that work means to the people of this country. Neither is that department the limit of Phyllis's work. We depend on her in every way. Year before last we demonstrated the need of an assistant in the office all the time. At the beginning of the school term, Harmo Taylor came and proved a most valuable helper. In fact, we are convinced that the general help these willing college girls can give is worth more to the nurse now than fust the professional help a trained nurse might give. With this help in the office, it has been possible for Miss Higginbotham to do more school work, the thing we always have wanted. In the fall, meetings were held in different schools in the district ; if Miss Higginbotham could not go, Miss Taylor went. The meetings were in charge of Mr. Mattil, but always there was a Health talk given. In the spring term a class for 8th, 9th, and 10th grades was held in our School, the regular Red Cross text being used. Eight girls received Red Cross certificates for completion of this course. The girls thoroughly enjoyed this, and, I know, got a great deal out of it. I am so glad to begin to have these classes. The doctors continue to come in at stated times, and also to make use of our good equipment. 66 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI A dentist comes once a month during the winter months, twice a month in the summer. An assistant has not made the work in this department less, it has only made more work possible. The year has been a good one, with a groat deal accomplished. HEALTH UNIT The County Court voted a sufficient appropriation in the fall to continue the Health Unit, but I feel sure that without our co-operation it 'would not be possible. We put in $1800.00 each year and receive back about $2300.00, but the money is not all. We have clinics, with the County Health Doctor in charge, free vaccination for the people for smallpox, typhoid, and many helps that would be impossible other-wise. There is even talk now that perhaps a Sanitary Inspector will be possible for the county. Time will tell what the County Court will do about that. I do not feel that there is any doubt about the wisdom of our continuing to co-operate in the Health Unit. COMMUNITY It is hard to make a report of community work done, as so much goes hand in hand with the school work. From April to October, we have movies each Saturday in the barn. The people are anxious to have them start even before it is warm enough for us to have, them. During the winter the boys play basketball in the barn. Not only the school, but the Gatlinburg boys usually play there once a week. In summer, the Gatlinburg boys play ball on the school ground. We are happy that the new church is practically completed. Different teachers have taken part in teaching Sunday School classes or reorganizing the Sunday School and assisting in B. Y. P. U. There are more things around the Burg in a social way than there used to be, but we still try to have occasional spellings, ice cream socials, and plays. The great entertainment is picnicing, big little, and middle size go on picnics. Much of Mr. Mattil's work includes community activities: A Community Club meets each month and sometimes oftener. A Poultry Association has been formed. Incubators and Brooders were used by the Community. Health and Farm meetings were held in various little schools during the fall. The big event each October is the Gatlinburg Fair. Last year it was followed by a County Fair in Sevierville, and a Division Fair in Knoxville, where we won second place. We received $65.00 in prizes in Sevierville, REPORTS OF OFFICERS 67 and as we plan to have our soft drinks and ice cream pay the expenses of our fair, we have enough money in the bank now to give a few prizes next fall. Nothing we have ever done has seemed to please everyone in the community like the little News we send out each month. Mr. Mattil and Mrs. Dowell deserve the greatest amount of praise for it, but we all help. Of course, we could not do it but for the mimeograph gotten last year. Smith-Hughes funds paid for part of it, and the School the balance. It certainly is in use a good part of the time. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER AT SUGARLANDS The report from Emma Harper Turner Center at Sugarlands shows eighty-nine pupils enrolled, and two teachers. But this comes far short of telling the tale. Helen Chew came in July and spent the month getting the cottage in shape. The people gave most of the labor and materials for repairing the little house, rent was free, and furniture was made by men of the community and bought by the school. The house was made into quite an attractive little place, and one the people were very proud of, as they had seen what could be done with an old place. No repairs were made on the school house, as the County Board wanted to build as soon as possible. Besides the school, Sunday School, church and various community meetings were held in the one room house. On Saturdays Helen Chew had classes for boys beyond the school age. Some worked across the mountain in North Carolina and would walk over to Sugarlands for their lessons. The regular school work of the seven grades was supplemented all the year by sewing classes taught by Mrs. Dowell (until the Smith-Hughes Economics teacher came) ; agriculture and farm projects by Mr. Mattil. Helen Chew preferred to teach the cooking classes during the fall term. After she left the first of the year Barbara Dewell took those classes. At Christmas time Helen was called home because of illness in the family. Mary Elder, a Sevier County girl, finished the year, and she and Cora McCarter had a very good term of school. Both of the girls were thoroughly interested in the community as well as the school work, scarcely being willing to spend any week-ends at their own homes. The experiment of having 'local girls take over the grade work was one I had been anxious to have tried. It sometimes has seemed to me we were a little slow in doing this. Whether it would be wise to have both teachers local, and a Pi Phi for supervisor and community worker is a question. 68 THE ARRow or PI BETA PHI Helen is to be back this next year and will take the school work as she did last year, and we expect Cora McCarter will go back, too. She is in the East Tennessee Normal now. The amount of book learning the little folks were taught last year is scarcely to be considered in the list of things accomplished in the Sugarlands last year. When I say that it sometimes seems to me that a whole community has been rebuilt, remoulded, the standard of living raised, spirit of cooperation developed, I do not feel I am putting it too strongly. People on the outside notice such a change, and again this year requests have come for us to go into other schools. I am so glad that during the summer Jean Steele and Mr. Mattil can continue their work; Jean goes twice a week; Mr. Mattil, once. Jean has not had less than seventeen girls in the class any time. The women do not come out in such numbers, but I think their classes just as important. In closing the report of the first extension work we have done, I feel we can say that it has been a success, and we all feel that it is a line of work we should continue. POWER AND LIGHT PLANT In the report last year, the statement was made that many nights had been dark ones, which meant that many times we were without lights. This year we can give a better report. The company has continued as first formed, Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples each owning 25% and the School, 50%. The men were not willing for the school to hold a controlling interest. The alternating current and all machinery recommended last year is now installed, with the exception of the governors. Quite a good many families have lights in their homes, more are asking for lights. The old Delco engine was traded in on a new Frigidaire, a small motor for pumping water and a larger one for sawing wood, etc. The Frigidaire is certainly a luxury we scarcely dared dream of. The Light Company seems to be paying good interest on the investment. The school preferred that the rebate be held each month, the stockholders paying for their light in that way money would be on hand for improvements and could be divided at the end of a given time. However, the men chose to do otherwise so receive our rebate on light bill each month. WATER SUPPLY There was some talk this spring ,of a water supply for the Community, the same people going into that as went into the Light Company. The school has sufficient water supply. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 69 BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE PAST YEAR Schoolhouse painted and windows reputtied; Stuart Cottage painted, barn practically completed, wire fence put around upper boundary of wood land; new chicken house built, chicken yard fenced; plank walks laid; one part of old barn made into work shop, tools purchased and lumber racks and tool closets made; new seats made for barn; library doors put in schoolhouse; trees and shrubs planted in school yard, around cottage and hospital; additional wiring in every building; play ground equipment; Frigidaire installed; motor for pumping water; motor for sawing wood, etc.; 'Ford truck purchased; water pipes laid from spring to hog and barn lots; Teachers' Cottz_ge re-roofed. UNFINISHED IMPROVEMENTS ALREADY VOTED ON Tiling and draining fields, orchard and roadway. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR Full time weaving teacher. One more year added to high school course. Teachers' Cottage in Emma Harper Turner Center. Plans made for first unit of a building to take care of baskets, sewing and weaving, as well as some shop work. Mrs. Dowell, as purchasing agent, housekeeper and helper in the office has meant a great deal. She is an efficient person, wherever you place her, and is always willing. With an experience in business, housekeeping and years of interest in church and community things, she certainly is valuable to us. She is staying through the summer and finds plenty to keep her busy helping with the canning, looking after the house and assisting with the basket business. The past year has been a reasonably successful one, and that is because of the untiring work of each one, staff, committee and all. When the teachers left, they all felt that next year could be made still better, and they left with a determination to do their part. (End of quoted report.) In closing this, my second annual report, I should like to take up your time to express to each member of the faculty of the School my keen appreciation of his untiring and unstinted effort. I should like to express to Mrs. Curtis my pleasure in having served on the Committee with her. Her efficient handling of the ways and means and the slides, which have been valuable to the School, and her keen sense of humor, have all gone to make her a beloved member, and it is with regret from all who have been associated with her that she retires from the Committee this year. Mrs. Turner has been handling the publicity, ,and while at times 70 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI she felt discouraged when she had to write four or five letters to get a reply, yet on the whole nobody could have done her work better nor with more enthusiasm than she has. Mrs. Geare has been editing the ARROW articles. If you have read them, you have seen her worth. It has been hard for Mrs. Stoolman to follow Miss Stuart, but there can not be too much praise given to her efficient methods. I am sure I express the sentiments of each and all of us associated with the School when I say to you here assembled that the work has been one of pleasure, one of high ideals, and one for which we shall be ever grateful to you for permitting us to be associated with you in your attempt to make life as a whole just a little finer each day than it was the day before.
