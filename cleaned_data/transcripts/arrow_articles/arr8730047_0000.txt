        Jill Click, Oklahoma Beta Area Winner To Compete In June Miss Wool Pageant by BARBARA HADLEY, Oklahoma Beta Jill Click, a member of the Oklahoma Beta chapter of Pi Beta Phi, has been named "Miss Wool" of Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas. Early in November Jill was informed that she had been selected as one of the twelve finalists for the "Miss Wool" pageant held in Shawnee, Oklahoma. In the pageant, the contestants wore three different wool outfits furnished by the clothing stores of Shawnee. Jill's prizes for being selected "Miss Wool" include a $400 scholarship, $200 worth of clothes, $100 worth of free modeling lessons, and an expense paid trip to San Angelo, Texas, in June to compete in the "Miss Wool of America" pageant. Throughout the year Miss Click has made several speeches to Rotary Clubs, Sheep and Wool Producers' meetings, and various other organizations and clubs. When asked about her experience as "Miss Wool," Jill remarked, "It's all been quite fun and a gratifying experience which I have enjoyed immensely." Grant Awarded For India Study by Km CARLSON Minnesota Alpha NOT MANY girls have the opportunity to study in India. However, Cyndy Brehm, a Pi Phi at the University of Minnesota, was one of these few. Of the many students applying for the Phi Upsilon Scholarship Grant only two were chosen, with Cyndy being one of them. Therefore, four months of her junior year were spent living and attending school at the Sir Avinashilingam Home Science College at Coimbatore, India. While in India, Cyndy not only experienced the ways and customs of the Indian people, but studied their techniques in food preparation and diet. Since Cyndy's major is, in part, community nutrition, this was extremely beneficial to her. When her period of study terminated, Cyndy spent a month touring different areas in India. This experience in India is only one of the many ways in which Cyndy has been active throughout her four years of college. Cyndy initially was a Pi Phi at Lawrence College in Wisconsin, where she spent her fresh-man and sophomore years. There she became involved in community and college activities and served as Y-Teen advisor, high school scholar-ship counselor, dorm activities chairman, Stu-dent Senate, Messiah Choir and Executive Dorm Board, At the end of her sophomore year Cyndy transferred to the University of Minnesota and became an active member of Minnesota Alpha. Since her arrival at the University Cyndy has participated in Young Republicans, was Rose Queen candidate and Homecoming representative. Cyndy is majoring in Family Social Science and Community Nutrition, the first to do so at the university. Not only has Cyndy managed to accelerate in college involvement but she has been outstanding scholastically as well, with an over-all average of a 3.6. As a Pi Phi Cyndy has undoubtedly done her share, serving as Pi Phi scholarship chairman and vice president at her former college and as Pi Phi historian and recording secretary at Minnesota Alpha. The Minnesota Alpha chapter is proud of Cyndy's achievements and it is evident that she has proved to be an outstanding Pi Phi. 46 News of Anne Cheney, Houston scholarship recipient, left, enters the new Emma Harper Turner classroom building with classmates Marvel Secor Smith, Iowa Gamma, center, and Sally Sutton, Illinois Theta.

Sister Pasquina works with her class of arts and crafts in the Catholic School of Clark, Louisiana. Mentally Retarded Receive Benefits SISTER PASQUINA TAMAGNI is a teacher of mentally retarded children at St. Mary's Training School in Clark, Louisiana. Last summer Sister Pasquina was a student in the Textile De-sign class at Arrowmont. Although she has been a teacher at St. Mary's for eleven years, she was just recently assigned to a full-time job of teaching arts and crafts. The program is departmentalized, so that she works with 75% of the enrollment on a bi-weekly basis. The total enrollment is about 160 children, all within the trainable level. Work is assigned according to the ability of the child, his mental age, and any specific needs he has for coordination (since many of the children have problems with fine movement). "I must tell you," said Sister Pasquina, "that my course at Arrowmont was a true life-saver for me, since I have been out of the field for several years. You can well see how I have put what I learned to use. I feel you have a wonderful program, and I enjoyed my stay there." Gene Reed of Rye, N.Y., was a scholarship recipient of the Westchester, N.Y. Alumnae Club. Gene is a volunteer worker with many groups, teaching arts and crafts. Her love for handicrafts, and for helping other people enjoy them, took her to Arrowmont last summer. "My home is a constant workshop and open house for arts and crafts sessions," says Mrs. Reed. "I conduct weekly training sessions in arts and crafts for a variety of organizations in a variety of skills: creative stitchery, macrame, decoupage, stone and plank painting, papier machand pine cone art, and other things." In addition to working in her own home, Mrs. Reed often travels to neighboring communities to train Girl Scout leaders in a variety of activities for their troops. "Obviously I find great enjoyment in hand-crafts," Gene says. "I was delighted to be at Arrowmont and learn new skills to bring to my groups at home. My first visit to Arrowmont was truly impressive and inspirational." 48 Houston Pi Phi Works With Senior Citizens by ANNE MELTON CHENEY Maryland Bela I had a wonderful experience last summer. I received a scholarship from the Houston Alumnae Club to study at Arrowmont. Needless to say, it meant a great deal to me and I was pleased to have the unusual opportunity. Gatlin-burg has been featured in The ARROW many times and all have seen the products of the school at Arrowcraft sales. Therefore, Pi Phis have been exposed to the school and its surroundings. These previews, however, in no way prepare the first-time visitor for the magnificence of the country side, the excellence of the school facilities, or the capabilities of the staff. In June of 1970, a new classroom building was opened. All classes are now conducted in this building and it is a great improvement over the previous situation where classes were not consolidated under one roof. The equipment used is first class, and every effort is being made to supply even finer tools to augment the creativity of the students. Good facilities and fine equipment do not come cheap, and, naturally, the need for sufficient funds to maintain high standards is ever present. Economies are effected whenever possible without sacrifice of quality. My principal objective at Arrowmont was to acquire skills which I could, in turn, impart to senior citizens in Houston. The Houston Junior Forum maintains a recreation center for older adults and our Houston Alumnae Club staffs the arts and crafts department. My special studies at Arrowmont were in pottery and silver jewelry making, both of which are among the crafts taught by the Pi Phis in Houston. It is impossible to describe the gratification and sense of fulfillment resulting from being qualified to participate in this worthwhile endeavor. Where there was loneliness, these older people have companionship; where there was a lack of purpose, there is a sense of accomplishment. More than 550 senior citizens participate in this program, and their expressions of gratitude are heart-warming. What better way to close somewhat the rift between the generations than if each province provide scholarships to deserving active and alumnae Pi Phis to study at Arrowmont. Seven sessions will be offered at Arrowmont during Summer, 1971. One week sessions will be held on the following dates: June 14-18 inclusive July 19-23 inclusive July 26-30 inclusive August 2-6 inclusive Two week sessions will be held on the following dates: June 21-july 2 inclusive July 5-16 inclusive August 9-20 inclusive For information on courses offered and expenses, write for brochure from Arrowmont, Box 567, Gatlinburg, Tenn. 37738.

Charles is an undergraduate student from Louisiana State University, working on two degrees simultaneously-a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Ceramics and Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture. His ceramic mushrooms on the table are now ready for the kiln. This young potter designed and created the mushrooms for the fountain in the South Atrium, a section of the Exhibit Gallery. Students of many ages and backgrounds make significant contributions to Arrowmont in their works each year. Two students in the Textile Design class last summer met for the first time on the plane en route to Arrowmont. Both are teachers of the mentally retarded. Sister Concetta Scipione, left, is from Shreveport, while Sister Pasquina Tamagnini is from Clark, La. Their instructor, Sister Mary Remy, center, is chairman of the Art Department of Mount Mary College in Milwaukee, Wis. She had many new ideas for the class, since she lust returned from a year exploring arts and crafts in Finland on a Fulbright Research Grant. Mrs. Audrey Dove, scholarship recipient of the Northern Virginia Alumnae Club, shows some of the articles made during her course in Recreational Craft at Arrowmont last summer. Audrey is a teacher's aide in the public schools for the Special Education Classes at the Drew Smith Training Center in Alexandria, Va. She teaches crafts to 75 children from 6 to 17 years of age. Her second class was a pottery class, which, she says, offers the best means of expression for some of the younger students. Operation Brass Tacks Would You Be Fair On A by STANLEY S. JACOBS ury? At the conclusion of a Miami lawsuit in which a man sued a building owner because an elevator fell with him and caused serious injuries, veteran newsmen and court attendants predicted the jury unquestionably would return a verdict for the victim. But after three days of bitter debate in the jury room, the foreman reported that the veniremen could not reach a verdict; one jury-man stubbornly held out against his colleagues who favored the complainant. The judge dismissed the jury and the case was tried again. This time, the plaintiff won $15,000 of the $25,000 he sought as damages. Why did one member stalemate the first jury by refusing to find for the accident victim ? Here is what this juror later told a newspaperman: "The injured fellow on the witness stand made a poor impression on me. He wore yellow shoes with run-over heels and his socks drooped. His tie had food stains on it. I figured that since he was sloppy and indifferent about his personal appearance, he probably had been negligent about his safety, too. That's why I refused to vote with the others on his behalf." Trivial as these "reasons" were, this juror's adamant stand irritated but did not surprise the judge. For too many jurors are known to be unpredictable, inattentive, prejudiced and in-consistent. Some critics of our trial system believe that the erratic performance of many juries is attributable to the fact that most responsible, educated citizens find it easy to evade jury service. The statistics seem to bear out this belief. The Texas Bar Association interviewed 115,000 residents of that state who had asked to be excused from jury service. Only 18,000 actually were exempted; the pleas of the others were disregarded as trivial or spurious. Some sample excuses: "I'm allergic to wool and can't sit next to men in wool suits." .. . "My bridge club will miss me if I don't show up." . . . "My wife isill in the hospital and I have to stay home to take care of the kids." (This, from a 33-year-old Ph.D. who never had been married!) Eight out of ten Texans who had to accept jury duty bitterly complained that they were losing money by sitting in court. Of those who asked to be excused, more that 82% were in high income brackets and 70% were active in community affairs, ranging from PTA to good government leagues. The Bar Association probers learned that there are other reasons why too many individuals shirk jury service. Among these are fear of boredom in the courtroom, dislike of hectoring by attorneys, and dread of arguing with other jurors. Our nationwide evasion of jury duty is abetted by the laws of many states whose legislators leaned over backward to excuse a wide variety of people from this obligation. Exempted in many states are clergymen, doctors, teachers, pharmacists, veterinarians, morticians, railway brakemen and railroad presidents. But most people who have served on juries would like to do it again. Professor Harry Kaiven of the University of Chicago Law School says that 94% of jurors he questioned had found the experience interesting and satisfying, once they had overcome their initial distaste for it. The need for public-spirited, intelligent jurors was emphasized by the Ruth Commission in Pennsylvania which investigated the lax juries of that state. It found that some juries, tiring of argumentation, had flipped coins or drawn straws to arrive at verdicts. Even more shocking is the case of the mid-western woman who served on a criminal court jury. Unaware that the panel could be discharged if agreement could not be reached, she voted with the others to send the defendant to prison for life. Later she said, "I still believe the poor man was not proved guilty, because 51

"My home is a constant workshop and open house for arts and crafts sessions," says Mrs. Reed. "I conduct weekly training sessions in arts and crafts for a variety of organizations in a variety of skills: creative stitchery, macrame, decoupage, stone and plank painting, papier machand pine cone art, and other things." In addition to working in her own home, Mrs. Reed often travels to neighboring communities to train Girl Scout leaders in a variety of activities for their troops. "Obviously I find great enjoyment in hand-crafts," Gene says. "I was delighted to be at Arrowmont and learn new skills to bring to my groups at home. My first visit to Arrowmont was truly impressive and inspirational." 48 Houston Pi Phi Works With Senior Citizens by ANNE MELTON CHENEY Maryland Bela I had a wonderful experience last summer. I received a scholarship from the Houston Alumnae Club to study at Arrowmont. Needless to say, it meant a great deal to me and I was pleased to have the unusual opportunity. Gatlin-burg has been featured in The ARROW many times and all have seen the products of the school at Arrowcraft sales. Therefore, Pi Phis have been exposed to the school and its surroundings. These previews, however, in no way prepare the first-time visitor for the magnificence of the country side, the excellence of the school facilities, or the capabilities of the staff. In June of 1970, a new classroom building was opened. All classes are now conducted in this building and it is a great improvement over the previous situation where classes were not consolidated under one roof. The equipment used is first class, and every effort is being made to supply even finer tools to augment the creativity of the students. Good facilities and fine equipment do not come cheap, and, naturally, the need for sufficient funds to maintain high standards is ever present. Economies are effected whenever possible without sacrifice of quality. My principal objective at Arrowmont was to acquire skills which I could, in turn, impart to senior citizens in Houston. The Houston Junior Forum maintains a recreation center for older adults and our Houston Alumnae Club staffs the arts and crafts department. My special studies at Arrowmont were in pottery and silver jewelry making, both of which are among the crafts taught by the Pi Phis in Houston. It is impossible to describe the gratification and sense of fulfillment resulting from being qualified to participate in this worthwhile endeavor. Where there was loneliness, these older people have companionship; where there was a lack of purpose, there is a sense of accomplishment. More than 550 senior citizens participate in this program, and their expressions of gratitude are heart-warming. What better way to close somewhat the rift between the generations than if each province provide scholarships to deserving active and alumnae Pi Phis to study at Arrowmont. Seven sessions will be offered at Arrowmont during Summer, 1971. One week sessions will be held on the following dates: June 14-18 inclusive July 19-23 inclusive July 26-30 inclusive August 2-6 inclusive Two week sessions will be held on the following dates: June 21-july 2 inclusive July 5-16 inclusive August 9-20 inclusive For information on courses offered and expenses, write for brochure from Arrowmont, Box 567, Gatlinburg, Tenn. 37738.

Mrs. Cheney, Maryland Beta, received a scholarship to Arrowmont to further her work with this group. 49 Scholarship recipient of the Baton Rouge Club, Charles Hubbs is throwing a pot on a potter's wheel in the Ceramic Studio of Arrowmont. Charles is an undergraduate student from Louisiana State University, working on two degrees simultaneously-a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Ceramics and Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture. His ceramic mushrooms on the table are now ready for the kiln. This young potter designed and created the mushrooms for the fountain in the South Atrium, a section of the Exhibit Gallery. Students of many ages and backgrounds make significant contributions to Arrowmont in their works each year. Two students in the Textile Design class last summer met for the first time on the plane en route to Arrowmont. Both are teachers of the mentally retarded. Sister Concetta Scipione, left, is from Shreveport, while Sister Pasquina Tamagnini is from Clark, La. Their instructor, Sister Mary Remy, center, is chairman of the Art Department of Mount Mary College in Milwaukee, Wis. She had many new ideas for the class, since she lust returned from a year exploring arts and crafts in Finland on a Fulbright Research Grant. Mrs. Audrey Dove, scholarship recipient of the Northern Virginia Alumnae Club, shows some of the articles made during her course in Recreational Craft at Arrowmont last summer. Audrey is a teacher's aide in the public schools for the Special Education Classes at the Drew Smith Training Center in Alexandria, Va. She teaches crafts to 75 children from 6 to 17 years of age. Her second class was a pottery class, which, she says, offers the best means of expression for some of the younger students. Operation Brass Tacks Would You Be Fair On A by STANLEY S. JACOBS ury? At the conclusion of a Miami lawsuit in which a man sued a building owner because an elevator fell with him and caused serious injuries, veteran newsmen and court attendants predicted the jury unquestionably would return a verdict for the victim. But after three days of bitter debate in the jury room, the foreman reported that the veniremen could not reach a verdict; one jury-man stubbornly held out against his colleagues who favored the complainant. The judge dismissed the jury and the case was tried again. This time, the plaintiff won $15,000 of the $25,000 he sought as damages. Why did one member stalemate the first jury by refusing to find for the accident victim ? Here is what this juror later told a newspaperman: "The injured fellow on the witness stand made a poor impression on me. He wore yellow shoes with run-over heels and his socks drooped. His tie had food stains on it. I figured that since he was sloppy and indifferent about his personal appearance, he probably had been negligent about his safety, too. That's why I refused to vote with the others on his behalf." Trivial as these "reasons" were, this juror's adamant stand irritated but did not surprise the judge. For too many jurors are known to be unpredictable, inattentive, prejudiced and in-consistent. Some critics of our trial system believe that the erratic performance of many juries is attributable to the fact that most responsible, educated citizens find it easy to evade jury service. The statistics seem to bear out this belief. The Texas Bar Association interviewed 115,000 residents of that state who had asked to be excused from jury service. Only 18,000 actually were exempted; the pleas of the others were disregarded as trivial or spurious. Some sample excuses: "I'm allergic to wool and can't sit next to men in wool suits." .. . "My bridge club will miss me if I don't show up." . . . "My wife isill in the hospital and I have to stay home to take care of the kids." (This, from a 33-year-old Ph.D. who never had been married!) Eight out of ten Texans who had to accept jury duty bitterly complained that they were losing money by sitting in court. Of those who asked to be excused, more that 82% were in high income brackets and 70% were active in community affairs, ranging from PTA to good government leagues. The Bar Association probers learned that there are other reasons why too many individuals shirk jury service. Among these are fear of boredom in the courtroom, dislike of hectoring by attorneys, and dread of arguing with other jurors. Our nationwide evasion of jury duty is abetted by the laws of many states whose legislators leaned over backward to excuse a wide variety of people from this obligation. Exempted in many states are clergymen, doctors, teachers, pharmacists, veterinarians, morticians, railway brakemen and railroad presidents. But most people who have served on juries would like to do it again. Professor Harry Kaiven of the University of Chicago Law School says that 94% of jurors he questioned had found the experience interesting and satisfying, once they had overcome their initial distaste for it. The need for public-spirited, intelligent jurors was emphasized by the Ruth Commission in Pennsylvania which investigated the lax juries of that state. It found that some juries, tiring of argumentation, had flipped coins or drawn straws to arrive at verdicts. Even more shocking is the case of the mid-western woman who served on a criminal court jury. Unaware that the panel could be discharged if agreement could not be reached, she voted with the others to send the defendant to prison for life. Later she said, "I still believe the poor man was not proved guilty, because 51
