Two of the staunchest friends of the school in those early days were Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Huff. When it seemed that the school would be forced to close its doors on account of the scarcity of pupils Mr. and Mrs. Huff might have been seen carrying their little four-year-old daughter to enter school, not with the hope of imbibing much learning at this tender age but with the sole idea of increasing the number of students in the school so that it would continue. From that day little Miss Huff became a regularly enrolled student until she graduated. While in school she christened and became the first editor-inchief on the Wine and Blue section of this paper. After her graduation she finished her high school work in one year at Virginia Intermont, located at Bristol, and later completed two years at Maryville College. Today both students and es Its Own teachers alike welcome Miss Matt Huff as a member of her alma m ter. She is the first graduate the school to have this distincti MISS MATTIE HUFF and it seems fitting to those w: know her that it should come this once youngest student of Beta Phi School and first editor the Wine and Blue.

Shop Work in Sugarlands WHEN Katherine Wattwo questions came up : what shoe son Farmer began her sewing be done with the boys during tl classes in Sugarlands two years ago period and what was there to The February ARROW L sewing table. All worked out out much trouble. From the )er pile back of the shed at the age the boys found boards and a a table. It was rough and good to look at, having been from all kinds of boards and low the girls must have had :ulty in cutting a straight seam. never, it was not used long for ng. We decided the girls might ell go to the cottage with their ng and the boys turned the sew-room at the school into a shop. e started with a hammer and from the cottage, some of the brought tools from home and asn't long until the school do-1 some more. The shop has one of the busiest places about school at recess, between , and evenings after school you usually find someone working unless there is an exciting going on outside. le boys are pretty clever about :ng things. It seems to have handed down to them from fathers who have made their homes and furniture. Among hings they have made are bird es, bird feeders and shelters, lid racks, shelves, nail boxes, bows, arrows, and many kinds of toys, Nearly everything is made according to directions and they have learned to take great pride in putting a good finish on their things. Not only the boys enjoy the shop but the girls too. They made their sewing boxes out of cigar boxes, painted them, and made their own designs. This fall they painted bottles for vases. The shop work had a great deal to do with our winning first prize on our school exhibit for the last three years at the Gatlinburg Fair. This money has been used for paint, sandpaper, screws, nails, etc. The wood that is used is just any that can be found. Occasionally you will see Miss Evelyn or some other member of the Gatlinburg family carrying an empty drygoods box up. Everyone knows about the shop and it seems to attract more attention than any other part of the school. This Christmas we have had two gifts for the shop and the new tools the money has bought will keep more than one boy busy and happy. EVA HATHAWAY, Iowa B Wily Burton Initiated her careful instruction to the little folks of Gatlinburg. During the past year and a half she has been working with the same interest and enthusiasm in the Sugarlands. Due to the illness of her father it has been necessary for her to return to her home in Montclair, New Jersey. She left Gatlinburg on November On the previous evening a dinner was given in her honor by the IN THE early days of Pi Beta Phi School a little e appeared in Gatlinburg and .fined to become a mighty force )th the school and community.

Reprint from Gatlinburg News, November, 1929. The purpose of a local Panhellenic Association on a campus is to preserve the general welfare of each fraternity, promote interfraternalism, and to co-operate as a united fraternity body with the administration of the college or university. To accomplish any one or all of these purposes your Panhellenic Association, and you too, must have a background of knowledge, a foreground of constructive program, and a standing-ground of prestige, esteem, and appreciation. And these all depend upon each member of fraternities, as well as upon college Panhellenic. A background of knowledge means time and thought in familiarizing oneself with the history, development, and work of National Panhellenic Congress. It means a study and learning of the Panhellenic Creed, the 1nterfraternity Compact, and the Standards of Ethical Conduct. It means knowing generally and appreciating the fineness of all sister fraternities. It means knowing the significant movements and the trend in fraternity life of today. The old saying is still very true, "You will only get as much out of a thing as you put into it!" You are missing the fullness of fraternity relationship if you have not a back-ground of knowledge and understanding. And it is expected of the college fraternity woman! A foreground of constructive program! Many say "What can we do?" Let us start at the beginning: Regular worth while and interesting' Panhellenic meetings are vital. Not meetings hastily "sandwiched in" between two more important events, but a definite time, unhurried and uninterrupted, given over to study or discussion of Panhellenism in its various forms. A program for the year whith includes educational features for the freshman, conference opportunities and discussion for the initiated members, a social program that is interesting and good, scholarship plans for all women students, less of legislative and judiciary work and more of intimate thinking and working together. How many problems common to all could be discussed: pledge training, house problems, the president's task, campus problems, individual responsibilities, on and on. Let us lay aside the topic of rushing for awhile and set out to build a strong practical association that will lift the Panhellenic to a place of real leadership on the campus ; let us plan a program that will assist scholarship, will develop real democracy, and will build interfraternalisna by constructive thinking and living. By BEATRICE HERRON BROWN, Chairman of College Panhellenic Committee mks! Books! More Books! The following article was written by Ethel F. McCulloch, Indiana A, librarian of the Evansville Library, Evansville, Indiana. Miss Mc-Culloch had the inspiration last summer to spend her vacation in Gatlinburg fortunately and happened to select the time of committee meeting. She joined in the excursions up the creeks and "hollers" and became as enthusiastic as the rest in the work of Pi Phi in and about Gatlinburg. Of course her trained eye fell on the rather poor selection of books and she at once offered to go through the library and make suggistions for its improvement. The committee seized upon her suggestion and she not only spent days at this work but finally consented to write this article for THE ARROW. Her interest didn't wane after her visit either as was evidenced by her gift of a large box of books that arrived early in the fall.-EDITOR By Ethel F. McCulloch ARE you goin' to throw ay ?"

Books of description and travel open the doors into the great outside world and history and science help all of us to interpret the present more intelligently in the light of the past. Hence, a good library is one of the requirements of the state of Tennessee, upon which state aid to schools is based. And now I am wondering if it would not be possible for each of us to acquire the habit of sending a book to the school upon various joyous occasions. Christmas, St. Valentine's day and even our own birthdays afford ample excuses for making much needed presents. Let us not send "attic books," or worn books, or dirty books, or just any books, but the kind of books we would buy for our own boys and girls, our nephews and nieces, our own wee friends.

Banta's Greek Exchange The February ARROW Panhellenic Congress Comparisons are Odious 445 S OME time ago a college paper published the statement that a certain fraternity was the best in the country and likewise it mentioned the best sorority. The statement was challenged in many minds, not because members of other Greek letter organizations not rated first coveted the distinction, but because fair minded people know that it is impossible to study any fraternity over the en-tire country and give it .first or second or any definite place without qualification for all time. The undergraduates questioned too and many asked if National Panhellenic Congress had ever made an official rating of its member fraternities. The ready answer is that National Panhellenic Congress has never attempted such an undertaking and we believe this organization is not interested in compiling a Dunn or Bradstreet for Greeks that will catalogue its members under a classification whereby the college world will know where we stand in the scale. National Panhellenic Council delegates and fraternity officers and workers who study and know the college fraternity are convinced that while fraternities are founded on the same general principles each has adopted individual policies which have made comparisons unfair and impossible. An example of this is found in the fraternity that has chartered only a small number of chapters over a long period of years in contrast to the young or organization with a large chapter roll. Both have attainedinternal strength and are contributing much to the lives of their members by widely varying policies. There are so many intangible and unweighable factors which con-tribute to the strength and effectiveness of every fraternity that any official or authoritative rating tending to group fraternities into classes is impossible. This conviction has no doubt silenced the unfounded classification of "Big Three" widened to "Big Five" and eventually "Big Eight" and what-not which was glibly made some time ago. It cannot be denied that every loyal fraternity member believes his fraternity is best, best for him, and that is as it should be. Neither do we deny that some chapters have fortunately maintained an even balance throughout the years, thus gaining an impregnable prestige on a certain campus, and establishing some scale of rating for that locality. But the changing personnel of each year may at any time affect the stability of a chapter and the opinion of those who accurately weigh fraternity values. The highly organized centralized fraternity of today tends toward uniformity of purpose andpolicy everywhere with an elimination of weaknesses in every chapter, but no fraternity is 100 per cent strong in every particular on every campus where it has a chapter, and cannot be rated in first place everywhere, at all times. As people are coming to under-stand each other better it is most gratifying to know that fraternities

The statement was challenged in many minds, not because members of other Greek letter organizations not rated first coveted the distinction, but because fair minded people know that it is impossible to study any fraternity over the en-tire country and give it .first or second or any definite place without qualification for all time. The undergraduates questioned too and many asked if National Panhellenic Congress had ever made an official rating of its member fraternities. The ready answer is that National Panhellenic Congress has never attempted such an undertaking and we believe this organization is not interested in compiling a Dunn or Bradstreet for Greeks that will catalogue its members under a classification whereby the college world will know where we stand in the scale. National Panhellenic Council delegates and fraternity officers and workers who study and know the college fraternity are convinced that while fraternities are founded on the same general principles each has adopted individual policies which have made comparisons unfair and impossible. An example of this is found in the fraternity that has chartered only a small number of chapters over a long period of years in contrast to the young or organization with a large chapter roll. Both have attainedinternal strength and are contributing much to the lives of their members by widely varying policies. There are so many intangible and unweighable factors which con-tribute to the strength and effectiveness of every fraternity that any official or authoritative rating tending to group fraternities into classes is impossible. This conviction has no doubt silenced the unfounded classification of "Big Three" widened to "Big Five" and eventually "Big Eight" and what-not which was glibly made some time ago. It cannot be denied that every loyal fraternity member believes his fraternity is best, best for him, and that is as it should be. Neither do we deny that some chapters have fortunately maintained an even balance throughout the years, thus gaining an impregnable prestige on a certain campus, and establishing some scale of rating for that locality. But the changing personnel of each year may at any time affect the stability of a chapter and the opinion of those who accurately weigh fraternity values. The highly organized centralized fraternity of today tends toward uniformity of purpose andpolicy everywhere with an elimination of weaknesses in every chapter, but no fraternity is 100 per cent strong in every particular on every campus where it has a chapter, and cannot be rated in first place everywhere, at all times.

Two of the staunchest friends of the school in those early days were Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Huff. When it seemed that the school would be forced to close its doors on account of the scarcity of pupils Mr. and Mrs. Huff might have been seen carrying their little four-year-old daughter to enter school, not with the hope of imbibing much learning at this tender age but with the sole idea of increasing the number of students in the school so that it would continue. From that day little Miss Huff became a regularly enrolled student until she graduated. While in school she christened and became the first editor-inchief on the Wine and Blue section of this paper. After her graduation she finished her high school work in one year at Virginia Intermont, located at Bristol, and later completed two years at Maryville College. Today both students and es Its Own teachers alike welcome Miss Matt Huff as a member of her alma m ter. She is the first graduate the school to have this distincti MISS MATTIE HUFF and it seems fitting to those w: know her that it should come this once youngest student of Beta Phi School and first editor the Wine and Blue.

All worked out out much trouble. From the )er pile back of the shed at the age the boys found boards and a a table. It was rough and good to look at, having been from all kinds of boards and low the girls must have had :ulty in cutting a straight seam. never, it was not used long for ng. We decided the girls might ell go to the cottage with their ng and the boys turned the sew-room at the school into a shop. e started with a hammer and from the cottage, some of the brought tools from home and asn't long until the school do-1 some more. The shop has one of the busiest places about school at recess, between , and evenings after school you usually find someone working unless there is an exciting going on outside. le boys are pretty clever about :ng things. It seems to have handed down to them from fathers who have made their homes and furniture. Among hings they have made are bird es, bird feeders and shelters, lid racks, shelves, nail boxes, bows, arrows, and many kinds of toys, Nearly everything is made according to directions and they have learned to take great pride in putting a good finish on their things. Not only the boys enjoy the shop but the girls too. They made their sewing boxes out of cigar boxes, painted them, and made their own designs. This fall they painted bottles for vases. The shop work had a great deal to do with our winning first prize on our school exhibit for the last three years at the Gatlinburg Fair. This money has been used for paint, sandpaper, screws, nails, etc. The wood that is used is just any that can be found. Occasionally you will see Miss Evelyn or some other member of the Gatlinburg family carrying an empty drygoods box up. Everyone knows about the shop and it seems to attract more attention than any other part of the school. This Christmas we have had two gifts for the shop and the new tools the money has bought will keep more than one boy busy and happy.

During the past year and a half she has been working with the same interest and enthusiasm in the Sugarlands.

Reprint from Gatlinburg News, November, 1929. The purpose of a local Panhellenic Association on a campus is to preserve the general welfare of each fraternity, promote interfraternalism, and to co-operate as a united fraternity body with the administration of the college or university. To accomplish any one or all of these purposes your Panhellenic Association, and you too, must have a background of knowledge, a foreground of constructive program, and a standing-ground of prestige, esteem, and appreciation. And these all depend upon each member of fraternities, as well as upon college Panhellenic. A background of knowledge means time and thought in familiarizing oneself with the history, development, and work of National Panhellenic Congress. It means a study and learning of the Panhellenic Creed, the 1nterfraternity Compact, and the Standards of Ethical Conduct. It means knowing generally and appreciating the fineness of all sister fraternities. It means knowing the significant movements and the trend in fraternity life of today. The old saying is still very true, "You will only get as much out of a thing as you put into it!" You are missing the fullness of fraternity relationship if you have not a back-ground of knowledge and understanding. And it is expected of the college fraternity woman! A foreground of constructive program! Many say "What can we do?" Let us start at the beginning: Regular worth while and interesting' Panhellenic meetings are vital. Not meetings hastily "sandwiched in" between two more important events, but a definite time, unhurried and uninterrupted, given over to study or discussion of Panhellenism in its various forms. A program for the year whith includes educational features for the freshman, conference opportunities and discussion for the initiated members, a social program that is interesting and good, scholarship plans for all women students, less of legislative and judiciary work and more of intimate thinking and working together. How many problems common to all could be discussed: pledge training, house problems, the president's task, campus problems, individual responsibilities, on and on. Let us lay aside the topic of rushing for awhile and set out to build a strong practical association that will lift the Panhellenic to a place of real leadership on the campus ; let us plan a program that will assist scholarship, will develop real democracy, and will build interfraternalisna by constructive thinking and living.

Banta's Greek Exchange The February ARROW Panhellenic Congress Comparisons are Odious 445 S OME time ago a college paper published the statement that a certain fraternity was the best in the country and likewise it mentioned the best sorority. The statement was challenged in many minds, not because members of other Greek letter organizations not rated first coveted the distinction, but because fair minded people know that it is impossible to study any fraternity over the en-tire country and give it .first or second or any definite place without qualification for all time. The undergraduates questioned too and many asked if National Panhellenic Congress had ever made an official rating of its member fraternities. The ready answer is that National Panhellenic Congress has never attempted such an undertaking and we believe this organization is not interested in compiling a Dunn or Bradstreet for Greeks that will catalogue its members under a classification whereby the college world will know where we stand in the scale. National Panhellenic Council delegates and fraternity officers and workers who study and know the college fraternity are convinced that while fraternities are founded on the same general principles each has adopted individual policies which have made comparisons unfair and impossible. An example of this is found in the fraternity that has chartered only a small number of chapters over a long period of years in contrast to the young or organization with a large chapter roll. Both have attainedinternal strength and are contributing much to the lives of their members by widely varying policies. There are so many intangible and unweighable factors which con-tribute to the strength and effectiveness of every fraternity that any official or authoritative rating tending to group fraternities into classes is impossible. This conviction has no doubt silenced the unfounded classification of "Big Three" widened to "Big Five" and eventually "Big Eight" and what-not which was glibly made some time ago. It cannot be denied that every loyal fraternity member believes his fraternity is best, best for him, and that is as it should be. Neither do we deny that some chapters have fortunately maintained an even balance throughout the years, thus gaining an impregnable prestige on a certain campus, and establishing some scale of rating for that locality. But the changing personnel of each year may at any time affect the stability of a chapter and the opinion of those who accurately weigh fraternity values. The highly organized centralized fraternity of today tends toward uniformity of purpose andpolicy everywhere with an elimination of weaknesses in every chapter, but no fraternity is 100 per cent strong in every particular on every campus where it has a chapter, and cannot be rated in first place everywhere, at all times. As people are coming to under-stand each other better it is most gratifying to know that fraternities
