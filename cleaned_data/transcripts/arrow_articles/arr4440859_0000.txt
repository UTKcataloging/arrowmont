        858 THE ARROW 0V PI BETA PHI EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR VIEWS OF NEW 'NG AT SETTLEMENT SCHOOL NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 859 NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON .11 Edited by BLANCHE CHARLTON CURTIS (MRS. PERCE H.) .11 ' %5 Hillside Drive, Burlingame, Calif. .II MR. TURNER'S GMT In the last issue of the ARROW we tried to tell you a little of how much we owe to Professor White, to Mr. Mattil and to Mr. John Turner for finally getting our new industrial building started. Since then Mr. Turner has made his report on the actual expense incurred so far and by giving us a large part of his legitimate commission as builder has arrived at a total that is $1589.10 under the approximate estimate. The letter that ac-companies this generous gift is an inspiration and we quote in part from it: "The one aim and desire I have had was to give the best I could and come under our approximate estimate. I have had the pleasure, by not including the commission mentioned, to come about $1589.10 under. "I hope you will find and feel as I do that you have got value received for your expenditure. I refused work in Knoxville so that I could give my whole time and attention to your work. I knew this had to be to get results and justify the responsibility placed upon me. I think I was stimulated by that responsibility and I am sure that I put my whole soul into it because you were so wrapped up in it not for your own personal gain but to up-lift neglected humanity. I was struck with admiration while at Gatlinburg as I looked at these children from homes of poverty brought by your work and example to the place where their actions, their modest dignity, their conversation and deportment cannot be surpassed." .II .11 .11 .II ..l tiOTEI.S [JWi NAtLAKUCNEE %O (iOR BOYS ~i ALL 4NAHY SP45 noTEL N 4+iTYAIOC $ORiHG3 HTEL. a. ..OW. 1H.

Nxws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 861 GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS PARK GIFT of $5,000,000 made on March 5 by the Laura Spel man Rockefeller Memorial to the Great Smoky Mountains 4 "4 National Park fund insures the East of a great national park rivaling the national parks of the West and accessible to three-fourths of the country's inhabitants. This proposed National Park is right at the doorstep of our Settlement School. Says the New York Times : The Rockefeller donation voted by the trustees of the memorial in memory of the late Mrs. John D. Rockefeller, Sr., makes certain that the $10,000,000 goal sought by those who conceived the idea of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park will be reached. Nearly $5,000,000 has been raised by public subscription and by legislative appropriation in North Carolina and Tennessee. The State funds authorized to date are to be raised by bond issues. The $10,000,000 fund will be used to purchase the vast tract of land for the Great Smoky 'Mountains National Park. The acquisition of the land has been placed in the hands of the North Carolina National Park Commission in North Carolina, and a Tennessee Nation-al Park Commission in Tennessee. When the state park commissions have assembled the lands for the park, the two states will turn over the area to the Federal Government for park development by the National Park 'Service, which has supervision over the great national parks in other parts of the United States. The !Great Smoky Mountains National Park will include approximately 70,000 acres of which 300,000 acres are of virgin forests. 862 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI Approximately half the pre-scribed area lies in North Carolina, and half in Tennessee. Knoxville, Tenn., and Asheville, North Carolina are the largest cities adjacent t o t h e park territory. The park area has within its borders a score of mountain peaks 6,000 feet high or higher. Hundreds of peaks tower above 5,000 feet. A recent survey of t he projected park's wild animal life showed that there, were more than 3,200 red deer, and that black bear, elk and smaller g a m e were to Ile found in abundance. The tract contains more than 400 miles of trout streams. Here, as Secretary James Wilson said in a government report, are "the greatest mountain masses east of the Rock ies," and the Smokies tower higher above Knoxville than the Rockies above Denver, while Le Conte, 6,680 feet above sea level is a mile above Gatlinburg. "Within the park area there are whole tracts of forest where, even to this day, no human being has set foot, and only three or four living men have traversed the crest of the Great Smokies from end to end. NEWS "FROM LITTLE PIGEON 863 When the Great Smokies become a National Park, a splendid highway for automobiles will traverse the entire length of that crest. The highway which is already under construction passes the front gate directly opposite our Settlement School cottages. A very excellent description of Eastern Tennessee is given by Theodore Marvin in Explosives Engineer of t h e Hercules Powder Co., under the title, "A National Park in Eastern America's Highlands," as follows: One evening during a bear hunt, Horace Kephart, author of "Our Southern Highlanders," paused near Briar Knob on the high ridge which is a part of the boundary between Tennessee and North Carolina. From the Tennessee side rose the noise of a logging engine as it hauled down the slope the fallen monarchs of this, America's last great virgin deciduous forest. Contemplating the deforestation of the surrounding wilderness he apostrophized, "All this shall be swept away, tree and plant, beast and fish. Fire will blacken the earth; flood will swallow and spew forth the soil. The simple-hearted native men and women will scatter and disappear. In their stead will come slaves speaking strange tongues to toil in the darkness under the rocks. Soot will arise, and foul gasses ; the streams will run murky death. Let me not see it!" Realizing the possibility of this fate for the majestic slopes of this picturesque mountain range, the Great Smoky Mountains Conservation Association, headed by Mr. Willis P. Davis and Colonel D. C. Chapman, of Knoxville, four years ago initiated *a movement for the preservation of the natural beauties of the region. This organization's appeal for a national park in the Gredt Smoky Mountains was later augmented by support from the North Carolina civic clubs. The worthiness of the cause for which these enthusiastic groups were working impressed Dr. Hubert Work, Secretary of the Interior. He responded to their petitions by appointing the Southern Appalachian Park Committee which, after eight months of exploration, reported that of several possible mountain park sites in Eastern United States, "The Great Smoky Mountains easily stand first because of the height of the mountains, depth of valleys, ruggedness of the area, and the unexampled variety of trees, shrubs, and plants." Secretary Work, by congressional authorization, appointed the same committee as a commission to determine the area and boundaries of the park, and to receive definite offers of donations of lands and moneys. This became necessary as there was no precedent in Congress for the purchase of park property with federal money. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 865 The commission recommended a park area of 450,000 acres. Al-ready people of North Carolina and Tennessee have raised over a million dollars * as a nucleus of the purchase price, and these states are appealing to citizens of other commonwealths. Donations from thousands of lovers of the forest primeval are needed to frustrate the fulfillment of Kephart's dire prophecy. Then will the mountain citizens retain their heritage. Forty-three miles by road southeast of Knoxville lies Gatlinburg, a quaint little Tennessee settlement just outside the proposed border of the new park. It is reached from Sevierville and Pigeon Forge along the west fork of Little Pigeon River. To the south, east and west, is the land of the Tennessee mountain people. The distant haze-blue skyline of the mountains faintly traced against the deeper blue of skies, marks the state border of Tennessee and North Carolina. Along this ridge of the Great Smoky Mountains there is a twenty-eight mile stretch where the whole mountain range is over a mile above sea level. From its summit rise Mount Guyot (6615 ft.) , Laurel Top, Sawtooth, lgount Collins, Clingman's Dome (G644 ft.), Silers Bald, Briar Knob, Thunderhead, Little Bald, Gregory Bald, and lesser peaks. Over the range is the Qualla Indian Reservation not far from Bryson City, North Carolina. There reside the descendants of a Cherokee Indian tribe which defied the American army in post-colonial days and in spite of every effort to move them they remained in the land of their birth. Near Gatlinburg is majestic mount Le Conte which rises 6,6S0 and i little more than a mile above its base level. To the south are the Sugarlands, a wilderness of mountains masked by the almost impenetrable growths of trees and bushes. Journeying south from Knoxville thru Maryville, Kinzel Springs, Tuckaleeehe Cove, and Rich Mountain, Cades Cove is reached. From that point the divide is accessible by horse or on foot. There and northeastward to the proposed park boundaries is a magnificent country of rugged mountains and virgin forests. A land where the customs and speech of England during the eighteenth century bide with the mountain dwellers, proud descendants of Scotch-Irish ancestors. That this area may be preserved as nearly as possible in its primitive state is the aim of park enthusiasts. With that goal achieved the grandeur of the Great Smokies will be made more accessible to park visitors by the construction of roads into different sections from where the little known areas can be reached on foot. There is a growing opposition to girdling such peaks as Mount Le Conte with automobile roads. By careful zoning, the more distinctive parts will * On March 6, 1928, the total contributions received from other sources exclusive of the Rockefeller gift anicunted to: $4,913,000.00. 866 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI be maintained as they now are, in fact as they were in the days of Daniel Boone and the Revolutionary War. He who seeks adventure in the Great Smoky Mountains should first visit the shrine of the park's enthusiasts Mount Le Conte. It was early one May morning that I left *Knoxville, with that peak as my objective. Winding through a country of green farmlands and blooming orchards, a broad macadam road extends to Sevierville and thence to Pigeon Forge. It is from this picturesque village, on the west fork of the Little Pigeon River, that one gains a view of the Great Smokies, lying like an enchanted land behind their curtain of blue haze. Seven miles farther is Gatlinburg just outside the park border and the northern "sesame" to the secrets of the Smokies. At the Mountain View Hotel, an inn rustically constructed of hewn logs but possessing modern conveniences, I .was impressed by the excellence of the hand made-furniture. The proprietor explained, "The mountain people make these for us from native wood; even the bottoms are woven from 'hickory splits.' They haven't always done as much of this work: as now-a-days, at least not until 1912 when the Pi Beta Phi fraternity started its Settlement School here. At this school, mountain folks have been taught to do lots of things." Further curiosity prompted a visit to the School shop. There were displayed for sale the baskets, pipes, rugs, towels, bed-spreads, scarfs, and other handiwork of the mountaineers. As expressed by Miss Rogers, one of the School staff, "The purpose of the Settlement is to give to the mountaineers of the Appalachian Mountains of southeastern Tennessee educational training, the equivalent of a complete elementary and high school course, with particular emphasis on industrial and agricultural work, arts, and crafts. Also to provide a hospital and nursing center, to maintain a settlement house with recreational activities, and to extend to the mountain people such other help as may be needed." It is from Gatlinburg that the trail to Mount Le ,Conte starts. Mountain vistas, the forests, flowers, and shrubs encountered on the climb to the summit can best be described not by words but by the accompanying illustrations. Mount Le Conte, which is only thirty-one feet lower than Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Rocky Mountains, is pre-eminent in ruggedness, its gorges and glens all softened by a blanket of virgin forest. Along the mountain slopes can be found most of the 127 species of trees, and the 174 species of shrubs which grow in this district. The trees at the summit are typically Canadian, while the lower altitude growths are our southern types, The rhododendron is everyhere present; laurel and azaleas bloom in pro-fusion. One afternoon while traveling along a road which was being blasted and scraped near the base of Le Conte, I encountered a mountaineer NEWS FROlvr LITTLE PIGEON 867 working on the highway. His house near-by appeared to be standing only by virtue of its supporting stone chimney. "Yup," he boasted, "my old man built him that thar stone stack fifty years ago, an' hit ain't gave no trouble a' tall since. Guess hit'll stand thar 'nother fifty years." I hope it does! This mud-plastered stone chimney will cause passers-by to reflect on the hardships under which these mountaineers lived. A change is impending here; roads blasted into remote areas for transportation and communication are breaking down physical barriers. But in planning developments much thought is being given to the conservation of the natural beauties of the mountains, nor is the pictur esqueness of the native home-life being destroyed." With the proposed Great Smoky Mountains National Park be-coming a reality, the nation will turn its eyes towards that part of the country on which the eyes of 18,000 Pi Phis have been focused since 1912. To the world those "creeks and hollers" which have become an intimate part of our existence will soon become realities. As the World skims by in motor cars glimpsing the picturesque cabins tucked away on the hillsides, Pi Beta Phi will continue to carry its message of hope and helpfulness back into the coves and "hollers" away from the beaten trail. VACATION SUGGESTIONS Most of us are intending to do this summer some of the things we had hoped to do the past winter. Hcw many can obtain one Chevrolet customer during vacation? Certainly, if we are to make 250 Chevrolet sales and win the $250 bonus to help pay for the new Settlement School building, an earnest effort must be made. A. Washington, D. C. ri Phi has made an interesting suggestion: To go to Detroit, which may include a' delightful lake trip, and drive the new Chevrolet home. The freight saved is 'much more than the railway fare. Detroit is the most convenient point but cars can probably be obtained this way at any one cf the many branch fa'etories all over the United States, from which the deliveries are made. Perhaps there may be other such vacation trips. Take some friends with you and give them a free ride back!

Threading the same dress warp in the class. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 8 WEAVING AT GATLINBURG HE weaving industry i n Gatlinburg is booming. It h a grown in the past three years from a small, rather ha hazard business to the level of an industry of great ec, nomic importance to the families living all through this regio Every woman, with hardly an exception, has a loom. Not of them weave for the School, several sell their own weaving their homes, while others sell to the two other gift shops that hal opened here. We have no control over these and have no de finite idea of the number of women who' are given employment, e: cept that it is smaller than ours. The community problems th arise from the competition among the shops and people are nun erous and complicated. Prices and quality are not stabalized amot those who do not come in contact with the School, so we are co] fronted with a great problem of how to educate them up to tl point where their pride in their weaving will help to overcon their tendency to cheapen their craft during the tourist season. Our part in the weaving business is now a large and u: questioned influence for good among the people. It may be teresting to know that from May 16, 1927, to March 30, 192 we have paid $8,676.64 to the women for their weaving. \A have tried to divide the weaving from each home as evenly possible so the thirty-eight homes that we have touched ha, all been equally benefited. We have noticed in the past two years that the children fro these homes come to school better dressed; the homes are gra, ually becoming better furnished, especially in the matter of Vi trolas ; the women themselves wear winter coats instead of th sweaters; they have more pleasure than ever before because the now have money for an occasional trip to Sevierville and Kno: vine. Sometimes the money has to go for food because we ma( some families back in the mountains who are pitifully poor. Oi girl through her weaving, supplied her family of father, moth and seven brothers and sisters with food all this winter. finally became too much for her so we helped her to elope! Nc a widow with two children is doing a her weaving. On the other hand, one woman told me the other day that s: couldn't pay me what she owed us for her weaving supplies I 370 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI muse she had to meet a payment on her car with her last weaving money. Perhaps this is just as well for baby carriages are not 'Known in this part of the country and her youngest children are :win boys. A Letter Written by a Mountain 'Woma'n Asking for weaving work Weaving is a complicated affair and the actual making of the cloth, which is the only fun connected with it, comes after days of labor. When we added the cost of putting a dress warp in the loom we found to our amazement that we paid around $7.00 for one warp. Then before we know it, it is all woven off and we have to ga through days of work of warping, beaming, threading, drawing through the sley, and tying it before the loom NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 871 is again ready for weaving. All the dresses are woven at the School under our personal supervision and we have only one girl trained to weave them. If she should suddenly get married before we train another we would be in a sad plight. Formalities, like an engagement or an announcement are unknown here. A trip to the nearest preacher or squire does the trick, and the next day I begin to look for someone to take over the work. The girls will marry and move away, so that not the least of our worries that we encounter are those of matrimony and maternity and the nurse and I do have some things in common. We have ideals for our weaving in Gatlinburg but how slowly we move toward them. We supply the finest of materials to the women because we believe that weaving is an art and as such deserves the best in order to pro-mote the pride a n d joy that comes from working from lovely cotton, wools, linens and silks ; we insist upon the highest type of workmanship or we cannot hope to sell the weaving; we are trying to put the business on a bas-is of equality so all women will have a fair division of labor; we want to build up a bigger business each year so we can employ more women a n d reach more homes for there is no limit to our growth; we are trying to educate the people to a place where they will realize that they are a part of a movement to recreate the old American colonial weaving, whose only present home is among the mountain people themselves. It is a joy to find a woman who has an inborn sense of color and to develop it. We have two outstanding cases. One is Izora Conner, who first started to do all our Izora weaving. Her face beams with pride when she brings down some new color scheme and we compliment her on it. The other one is Pearl Bales, who has made our loveliest striped wool pillows. She is A Weaver and her Baby 72 THE ARROW or PI BETA PHI ,upporting her family of two children, an invalid husband and a roung sister. It is women of this type that we are reaching and )ringing more pleasure into their lives than they ever dreamed of ive years ago. Before weaving came into their homes they just at and rocked for hours and hours because with only one or two -ooms to live in house work was reduced to a minimum. A busy woman is a happy one. Also, too, we have the tourist problem to combat. The splenlid pike to Knoxville and the Smoky Mountains National Park novement is bringing the outside world to the very doors of these nountain people and so comes the prying, curious bargain hunter, who goes from home to home to buy wherever the women will ;ell the cheapest towels. That type does not help us reach our ideals very quickly. Then there is the other type of persons who can ap-)reciate our work and sympathize with our problems and are such I help and inspiration. Each idea gradually works its way into :he homes and that is where our influence must be of the most :areful and thoughtful kind to help the people to select the best md discard the worthless. We want those who buy our weaving to realize that they Ire not buying just an article but that they are supplying some woman with contentment and perhaps food; they are helping us to work out an economic problem of widespread influence for progress ; they are helping to keep the Arrow Craft Shop and the Weaving Department in the community for they are self-supporting and all money from Arrow Craft sales is used to maintain the entire Industrial Department. This year we have increased our industrial business 33 per-cent over last year. We can increase it 300 percent and only :na'ke a beginning in our opportunity for development. We can supply your demand for weaving, no matter how large it may Jecome. This is our aim and it is only through the cooperation )f the outside world, who demand our products, and the people )f Gatlinburg who make the products in their homes, with the School as a medium, between, that we can finally reach our ideals.

Mountain vistas, the forests, flowers, and shrubs encountered on the climb to the summit can best be described not by words but by the accompanying illustrations. Mount Le Conte, which is only thirty-one feet lower than Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Rocky Mountains, is pre-eminent in ruggedness, its gorges and glens all softened by a blanket of virgin forest. Along the mountain slopes can be found most of the 127 species of trees, and the 174 species of shrubs which grow in this district. The trees at the summit are typically Canadian, while the lower altitude growths are our southern types, The rhododendron is everyhere present; laurel and azaleas bloom in pro-fusion. One afternoon while traveling along a road which was being blasted and scraped near the base of Le Conte, I encountered a mountaineer NEWS FROlvr LITTLE PIGEON 867 working on the highway. His house near-by appeared to be standing only by virtue of its supporting stone chimney. "Yup," he boasted, "my old man built him that thar stone stack fifty years ago, an' hit ain't gave no trouble a' tall since. Guess hit'll stand thar 'nother fifty years." I hope it does! This mud-plastered stone chimney will cause passers-by to reflect on the hardships under which these mountaineers lived. A change is impending here; roads blasted into remote areas for transportation and communication are breaking down physical barriers. But in planning developments much thought is being given to the conservation of the natural beauties of the mountains, nor is the pictur esqueness of the native home-life being destroyed." With the proposed Great Smoky Mountains National Park be-coming a reality, the nation will turn its eyes towards that part of the country on which the eyes of 18,000 Pi Phis have been focused since 1912. To the world those "creeks and hollers" which have become an intimate part of our existence will soon become realities. As the World skims by in motor cars glimpsing the picturesque cabins tucked away on the hillsides, Pi Beta Phi will continue to carry its message of hope and helpfulness back into the coves and "hollers" away from the beaten trail. VACATION SUGGESTIONS Most of us are intending to do this summer some of the things we had hoped to do the past winter. Hcw many can obtain one Chevrolet customer during vacation? Certainly, if we are to make 250 Chevrolet sales and win the $250 bonus to help pay for the new Settlement School building, an earnest effort must be made. A. Washington, D. C. ri Phi has made an interesting suggestion: To go to Detroit, which may include a' delightful lake trip, and drive the new Chevrolet home. The freight saved is 'much more than the railway fare. Detroit is the most convenient point but cars can probably be obtained this way at any one cf the many branch fa'etories all over the United States, from which the deliveries are made.

It h a grown in the past three years from a small, rather ha hazard business to the level of an industry of great ec, nomic importance to the families living all through this regio Every woman, with hardly an exception, has a loom. Not of them weave for the School, several sell their own weaving their homes, while others sell to the two other gift shops that hal opened here. We have no control over these and have no de finite idea of the number of women who' are given employment, e: cept that it is smaller than ours. The community problems th arise from the competition among the shops and people are nun erous and complicated. Prices and quality are not stabalized amot those who do not come in contact with the School, so we are co] fronted with a great problem of how to educate them up to tl point where their pride in their weaving will help to overcon their tendency to cheapen their craft during the tourist season. Our part in the weaving business is now a large and u: questioned influence for good among the people. It may be teresting to know that from May 16, 1927, to March 30, 192 we have paid $8,676.64 to the women for their weaving. \A have tried to divide the weaving from each home as evenly possible so the thirty-eight homes that we have touched ha, all been equally benefited. We have noticed in the past two years that the children fro these homes come to school better dressed; the homes are gra, ually becoming better furnished, especially in the matter of Vi trolas ; the women themselves wear winter coats instead of th sweaters; they have more pleasure than ever before because the now have money for an occasional trip to Sevierville and Kno: vine. Sometimes the money has to go for food because we ma( some families back in the mountains who are pitifully poor. Oi girl through her weaving, supplied her family of father, moth and seven brothers and sisters with food all this winter. finally became too much for her so we helped her to elope!

A Letter Written by a Mountain 'Woma'n Asking for weaving work Weaving is a complicated affair and the actual making of the cloth, which is the only fun connected with it, comes after days of labor. When we added the cost of putting a dress warp in the loom we found to our amazement that we paid around $7.00 for one warp. Then before we know it, it is all woven off and we have to ga through days of work of warping, beaming, threading, drawing through the sley, and tying it before the loom NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 871 is again ready for weaving. All the dresses are woven at the School under our personal supervision and we have only one girl trained to weave them. If she should suddenly get married before we train another we would be in a sad plight. Formalities, like an engagement or an announcement are unknown here. A trip to the nearest preacher or squire does the trick, and the next day I begin to look for someone to take over the work. The girls will marry and move away, so that not the least of our worries that we encounter are those of matrimony and maternity and the nurse and I do have some things in common. We have ideals for our weaving in Gatlinburg but how slowly we move toward them. We supply the finest of materials to the women because we believe that weaving is an art and as such deserves the best in order to pro-mote the pride a n d joy that comes from working from lovely cotton, wools, linens and silks ; we insist upon the highest type of workmanship or we cannot hope to sell the weaving; we are trying to put the business on a bas-is of equality so all women will have a fair division of labor; we want to build up a bigger business each year so we can employ more women a n d reach more homes for there is no limit to our growth; we are trying to educate the people to a place where they will realize that they are a part of a movement to recreate the old American colonial weaving, whose only present home is among the mountain people themselves. It is a joy to find a woman who has an inborn sense of color and to develop it. We have two outstanding cases. One is Izora Conner, who first started to do all our Izora weaving. Her face beams with pride when she brings down some new color scheme and we compliment her on it. The other one is Pearl Bales, who has made our loveliest striped wool pillows. She is A Weaver and her Baby 72 THE ARROW or PI BETA PHI ,upporting her family of two children, an invalid husband and a roung sister. It is women of this type that we are reaching and )ringing more pleasure into their lives than they ever dreamed of ive years ago. Before weaving came into their homes they just at and rocked for hours and hours because with only one or two -ooms to live in house work was reduced to a minimum. A busy woman is a happy one. Also, too, we have the tourist problem to combat. The splenlid pike to Knoxville and the Smoky Mountains National Park novement is bringing the outside world to the very doors of these nountain people and so comes the prying, curious bargain hunter, who goes from home to home to buy wherever the women will ;ell the cheapest towels. That type does not help us reach our ideals very quickly. Then there is the other type of persons who can ap-)reciate our work and sympathize with our problems and are such I help and inspiration. Each idea gradually works its way into :he homes and that is where our influence must be of the most :areful and thoughtful kind to help the people to select the best md discard the worthless. We want those who buy our weaving to realize that they Ire not buying just an article but that they are supplying some woman with contentment and perhaps food; they are helping us to work out an economic problem of widespread influence for progress ; they are helping to keep the Arrow Craft Shop and the Weaving Department in the community for they are self-supporting and all money from Arrow Craft sales is used to maintain the entire Industrial Department. This year we have increased our industrial business 33 per-cent over last year. We can increase it 300 percent and only :na'ke a beginning in our opportunity for development. We can supply your demand for weaving, no matter how large it may Jecome. This is our aim and it is only through the cooperation )f the outside world, who demand our products, and the people )f Gatlinburg who make the products in their homes, with the School as a medium, between, that we can finally reach our ideals.

        862 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI Approximately half the pre-scribed area lies in North Carolina, and half in Tennessee. Knoxville, Tenn., and Asheville, North Carolina are the largest cities adjacent t o t h e park territory. The park area has within its borders a score of mountain peaks 6,000 feet high or higher. Hundreds of peaks tower above 5,000 feet. A recent survey of t he projected park's wild animal life showed that there, were more than 3,200 red deer, and that black bear, elk and smaller g a m e were to Ile found in abundance. The tract contains more than 400 miles of trout streams. Here, as Secretary James Wilson said in a government report, are "the greatest mountain masses east of the Rock ies," and the Smokies tower higher above Knoxville than the Rockies above Denver, while Le Conte, 6,680 feet above sea level is a mile above Gatlinburg. "Within the park area there are whole tracts of forest where, even to this day, no human being has set foot, and only three or four living men have traversed the crest of the Great Smokies from end to end. NEWS "FROM LITTLE PIGEON 863 When the Great Smokies become a National Park, a splendid highway for automobiles will traverse the entire length of that crest. The highway which is already under construction passes the front gate directly opposite our Settlement School cottages. A very excellent description of Eastern Tennessee is given by Theodore Marvin in Explosives Engineer of t h e Hercules Powder Co., under the title, "A National Park in Eastern America's Highlands," as follows: One evening during a bear hunt, Horace Kephart, author of "Our Southern Highlanders," paused near Briar Knob on the high ridge which is a part of the boundary between Tennessee and North Carolina. From the Tennessee side rose the noise of a logging engine as it hauled down the slope the fallen monarchs of this, America's last great virgin deciduous forest. Contemplating the deforestation of the surrounding wilderness he apostrophized, "All this shall be swept away, tree and plant, beast and fish. Fire will blacken the earth; flood will swallow and spew forth the soil. The simple-hearted native men and women will scatter and disappear. In their stead will come slaves speaking strange tongues to toil in the darkness under the rocks. Soot will arise, and foul gasses ; the streams will run murky death. Let me not see it!" Realizing the possibility of this fate for the majestic slopes of this picturesque mountain range, the Great Smoky Mountains Conservation Association, headed by Mr. Willis P. Davis and Colonel D. C. Chapman, of Knoxville, four years ago initiated *a movement for the preservation of the natural beauties of the region. This organization's appeal for a national park in the Gredt Smoky Mountains was later augmented by support from the North Carolina civic clubs. The worthiness of the cause for which these enthusiastic groups were working impressed Dr. Hubert Work, Secretary of the Interior. He responded to their petitions by appointing the Southern Appalachian Park Committee which, after eight months of exploration, reported that of several possible mountain park sites in Eastern United States, "The Great Smoky Mountains easily stand first because of the height of the mountains, depth of valleys, ruggedness of the area, and the unexampled variety of trees, shrubs, and plants." Secretary Work, by congressional authorization, appointed the same committee as a commission to determine the area and boundaries of the park, and to receive definite offers of donations of lands and moneys. This became necessary as there was no precedent in Congress for the purchase of park property with federal money. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 865 The commission recommended a park area of 450,000 acres. Al-ready people of North Carolina and Tennessee have raised over a million dollars * as a nucleus of the purchase price, and these states are appealing to citizens of other commonwealths. Donations from thousands of lovers of the forest primeval are needed to frustrate the fulfillment of Kephart's dire prophecy. Then will the mountain citizens retain their heritage. Forty-three miles by road southeast of Knoxville lies Gatlinburg, a quaint little Tennessee settlement just outside the proposed border of the new park. It is reached from Sevierville and Pigeon Forge along the west fork of Little Pigeon River. To the south, east and west, is the land of the Tennessee mountain people. The distant haze-blue skyline of the mountains faintly traced against the deeper blue of skies, marks the state border of Tennessee and North Carolina. Along this ridge of the Great Smoky Mountains there is a twenty-eight mile stretch where the whole mountain range is over a mile above sea level. From its summit rise Mount Guyot (6615 ft.) , Laurel Top, Sawtooth, lgount Collins, Clingman's Dome (G644 ft.), Silers Bald, Briar Knob, Thunderhead, Little Bald, Gregory Bald, and lesser peaks. Over the range is the Qualla Indian Reservation not far from Bryson City, North Carolina. There reside the descendants of a Cherokee Indian tribe which defied the American army in post-colonial days and in spite of every effort to move them they remained in the land of their birth. Near Gatlinburg is majestic mount Le Conte which rises 6,6S0 and i little more than a mile above its base level. To the south are the Sugarlands, a wilderness of mountains masked by the almost impenetrable growths of trees and bushes. Journeying south from Knoxville thru Maryville, Kinzel Springs, Tuckaleeehe Cove, and Rich Mountain, Cades Cove is reached. From that point the divide is accessible by horse or on foot. There and northeastward to the proposed park boundaries is a magnificent country of rugged mountains and virgin forests. A land where the customs and speech of England during the eighteenth century bide with the mountain dwellers, proud descendants of Scotch-Irish ancestors. That this area may be preserved as nearly as possible in its primitive state is the aim of park enthusiasts. With that goal achieved the grandeur of the Great Smokies will be made more accessible to park visitors by the construction of roads into different sections from where the little known areas can be reached on foot. There is a growing opposition to girdling such peaks as Mount Le Conte with automobile roads. By careful zoning, the more distinctive parts will * On March 6, 1928, the total contributions received from other sources exclusive of the Rockefeller gift anicunted to: $4,913,000.00. 866 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI be maintained as they now are, in fact as they were in the days of Daniel Boone and the Revolutionary War. He who seeks adventure in the Great Smoky Mountains should first visit the shrine of the park's enthusiasts Mount Le Conte. It was early one May morning that I left *Knoxville, with that peak as my objective. Winding through a country of green farmlands and blooming orchards, a broad macadam road extends to Sevierville and thence to Pigeon Forge. It is from this picturesque village, on the west fork of the Little Pigeon River, that one gains a view of the Great Smokies, lying like an enchanted land behind their curtain of blue haze. Seven miles farther is Gatlinburg just outside the park border and the northern "sesame" to the secrets of the Smokies. At the Mountain View Hotel, an inn rustically constructed of hewn logs but possessing modern conveniences, I .was impressed by the excellence of the hand made-furniture. The proprietor explained, "The mountain people make these for us from native wood; even the bottoms are woven from 'hickory splits.' They haven't always done as much of this work: as now-a-days, at least not until 1912 when the Pi Beta Phi fraternity started its Settlement School here. At this school, mountain folks have been taught to do lots of things." Further curiosity prompted a visit to the School shop. There were displayed for sale the baskets, pipes, rugs, towels, bed-spreads, scarfs, and other handiwork of the mountaineers. As expressed by Miss Rogers, one of the School staff, "The purpose of the Settlement is to give to the mountaineers of the Appalachian Mountains of southeastern Tennessee educational training, the equivalent of a complete elementary and high school course, with particular emphasis on industrial and agricultural work, arts, and crafts. Also to provide a hospital and nursing center, to maintain a settlement house with recreational activities, and to extend to the mountain people such other help as may be needed." It is from Gatlinburg that the trail to Mount Le ,Conte starts. Mountain vistas, the forests, flowers, and shrubs encountered on the climb to the summit can best be described not by words but by the accompanying illustrations. Mount Le Conte, which is only thirty-one feet lower than Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Rocky Mountains, is pre-eminent in ruggedness, its gorges and glens all softened by a blanket of virgin forest.

With that goal achieved the grandeur of the Great Smokies will be made more accessible to park visitors by the construction of roads into different sections from where the little known areas can be reached on foot. There is a growing opposition to girdling such peaks as Mount Le Conte with automobile roads. By careful zoning, the more distinctive parts will * On March 6, 1928, the total contributions received from other sources exclusive of the Rockefeller gift anicunted to: $4,913,000.00. 866 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI be maintained as they now are, in fact as they were in the days of Daniel Boone and the Revolutionary War. He who seeks adventure in the Great Smoky Mountains should first visit the shrine of the park's enthusiasts Mount Le Conte. It was early one May morning that I left *Knoxville, with that peak as my objective. Winding through a country of green farmlands and blooming orchards, a broad macadam road extends to Sevierville and thence to Pigeon Forge. It is from this picturesque village, on the west fork of the Little Pigeon River, that one gains a view of the Great Smokies, lying like an enchanted land behind their curtain of blue haze. Seven miles farther is Gatlinburg just outside the park border and the northern "sesame" to the secrets of the Smokies. At the Mountain View Hotel, an inn rustically constructed of hewn logs but possessing modern conveniences, I .was impressed by the excellence of the hand made-furniture. The proprietor explained, "The mountain people make these for us from native wood; even the bottoms are woven from 'hickory splits.' They haven't always done as much of this work: as now-a-days, at least not until 1912 when the Pi Beta Phi fraternity started its Settlement School here. At this school, mountain folks have been taught to do lots of things." Further curiosity prompted a visit to the School shop. There were displayed for sale the baskets, pipes, rugs, towels, bed-spreads, scarfs, and other handiwork of the mountaineers. As expressed by Miss Rogers, one of the School staff, "The purpose of the Settlement is to give to the mountaineers of the Appalachian Mountains of southeastern Tennessee educational training, the equivalent of a complete elementary and high school course, with particular emphasis on industrial and agricultural work, arts, and crafts. Also to provide a hospital and nursing center, to maintain a settlement house with recreational activities, and to extend to the mountain people such other help as may be needed." It is from Gatlinburg that the trail to Mount Le ,Conte starts. Mountain vistas, the forests, flowers, and shrubs encountered on the climb to the summit can best be described not by words but by the accompanying illustrations. Mount Le Conte, which is only thirty-one feet lower than Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Rocky Mountains, is pre-eminent in ruggedness, its gorges and glens all softened by a blanket of virgin forest. Along the mountain slopes can be found most of the 127 species of trees, and the 174 species of shrubs which grow in this district. The trees at the summit are typically Canadian, while the lower altitude growths are our southern types, The rhododendron is everyhere present; laurel and azaleas bloom in pro-fusion. One afternoon while traveling along a road which was being blasted and scraped near the base of Le Conte, I encountered a mountaineer NEWS FROlvr LITTLE PIGEON 867 working on the highway. His house near-by appeared to be standing only by virtue of its supporting stone chimney. "Yup," he boasted, "my old man built him that thar stone stack fifty years ago, an' hit ain't gave no trouble a' tall since. Guess hit'll stand thar 'nother fifty years." I hope it does! This mud-plastered stone chimney will cause passers-by to reflect on the hardships under which these mountaineers lived. A change is impending here; roads blasted into remote areas for transportation and communication are breaking down physical barriers. But in planning developments much thought is being given to the conservation of the natural beauties of the mountains, nor is the pictur esqueness of the native home-life being destroyed." With the proposed Great Smoky Mountains National Park be-coming a reality, the nation will turn its eyes towards that part of the country on which the eyes of 18,000 Pi Phis have been focused since 1912. To the world those "creeks and hollers" which have become an intimate part of our existence will soon become realities. As the World skims by in motor cars glimpsing the picturesque cabins tucked away on the hillsides, Pi Beta Phi will continue to carry its message of hope and helpfulness back into the coves and "hollers" away from the beaten trail. VACATION SUGGESTIONS Most of us are intending to do this summer some of the things we had hoped to do the past winter. Hcw many can obtain one Chevrolet customer during vacation? Certainly, if we are to make 250 Chevrolet sales and win the $250 bonus to help pay for the new Settlement School building, an earnest effort must be made. A. Washington, D. C. ri Phi has made an interesting suggestion: To go to Detroit, which may include a' delightful lake trip, and drive the new Chevrolet home. The freight saved is 'much more than the railway fare. Detroit is the most convenient point but cars can probably be obtained this way at any one cf the many branch fa'etories all over the United States, from which the deliveries are made. Perhaps there may be other such vacation trips. Take some friends with you and give them a free ride back!

It h a grown in the past three years from a small, rather ha hazard business to the level of an industry of great ec, nomic importance to the families living all through this regio Every woman, with hardly an exception, has a loom. Not of them weave for the School, several sell their own weaving their homes, while others sell to the two other gift shops that hal opened here. We have no control over these and have no de finite idea of the number of women who' are given employment, e: cept that it is smaller than ours. The community problems th arise from the competition among the shops and people are nun erous and complicated. Prices and quality are not stabalized amot those who do not come in contact with the School, so we are co] fronted with a great problem of how to educate them up to tl point where their pride in their weaving will help to overcon their tendency to cheapen their craft during the tourist season. Our part in the weaving business is now a large and u: questioned influence for good among the people. It may be teresting to know that from May 16, 1927, to March 30, 192 we have paid $8,676.64 to the women for their weaving. \A have tried to divide the weaving from each home as evenly possible so the thirty-eight homes that we have touched ha, all been equally benefited. We have noticed in the past two years that the children fro these homes come to school better dressed; the homes are gra, ually becoming better furnished, especially in the matter of Vi trolas ; the women themselves wear winter coats instead of th sweaters; they have more pleasure than ever before because the now have money for an occasional trip to Sevierville and Kno: vine. Sometimes the money has to go for food because we ma( some families back in the mountains who are pitifully poor. Oi girl through her weaving, supplied her family of father, moth and seven brothers and sisters with food all this winter. finally became too much for her so we helped her to elope!

A Letter Written by a Mountain 'Woma'n Asking for weaving work Weaving is a complicated affair and the actual making of the cloth, which is the only fun connected with it, comes after days of labor. When we added the cost of putting a dress warp in the loom we found to our amazement that we paid around $7.00 for one warp. Then before we know it, it is all woven off and we have to ga through days of work of warping, beaming, threading, drawing through the sley, and tying it before the loom NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 871 is again ready for weaving. All the dresses are woven at the School under our personal supervision and we have only one girl trained to weave them. If she should suddenly get married before we train another we would be in a sad plight. Formalities, like an engagement or an announcement are unknown here. A trip to the nearest preacher or squire does the trick, and the next day I begin to look for someone to take over the work. The girls will marry and move away, so that not the least of our worries that we encounter are those of matrimony and maternity and the nurse and I do have some things in common. We have ideals for our weaving in Gatlinburg but how slowly we move toward them. We supply the finest of materials to the women because we believe that weaving is an art and as such deserves the best in order to pro-mote the pride a n d joy that comes from working from lovely cotton, wools, linens and silks ; we insist upon the highest type of workmanship or we cannot hope to sell the weaving; we are trying to put the business on a bas-is of equality so all women will have a fair division of labor; we want to build up a bigger business each year so we can employ more women a n d reach more homes for there is no limit to our growth; we are trying to educate the people to a place where they will realize that they are a part of a movement to recreate the old American colonial weaving, whose only present home is among the mountain people themselves. It is a joy to find a woman who has an inborn sense of color and to develop it. We have two outstanding cases. One is Izora Conner, who first started to do all our Izora weaving. Her face beams with pride when she brings down some new color scheme and we compliment her on it. The other one is Pearl Bales, who has made our loveliest striped wool pillows. She is A Weaver and her Baby 72 THE ARROW or PI BETA PHI ,upporting her family of two children, an invalid husband and a roung sister. It is women of this type that we are reaching and )ringing more pleasure into their lives than they ever dreamed of ive years ago. Before weaving came into their homes they just at and rocked for hours and hours because with only one or two -ooms to live in house work was reduced to a minimum. A busy woman is a happy one. Also, too, we have the tourist problem to combat. The splenlid pike to Knoxville and the Smoky Mountains National Park novement is bringing the outside world to the very doors of these nountain people and so comes the prying, curious bargain hunter, who goes from home to home to buy wherever the women will ;ell the cheapest towels. That type does not help us reach our ideals very quickly. Then there is the other type of persons who can ap-)reciate our work and sympathize with our problems and are such I help and inspiration. Each idea gradually works its way into :he homes and that is where our influence must be of the most :areful and thoughtful kind to help the people to select the best md discard the worthless. We want those who buy our weaving to realize that they Ire not buying just an article but that they are supplying some woman with contentment and perhaps food; they are helping us to work out an economic problem of widespread influence for progress ; they are helping to keep the Arrow Craft Shop and the Weaving Department in the community for they are self-supporting and all money from Arrow Craft sales is used to maintain the entire Industrial Department. This year we have increased our industrial business 33 per-cent over last year. We can increase it 300 percent and only :na'ke a beginning in our opportunity for development. We can supply your demand for weaving, no matter how large it may Jecome. This is our aim and it is only through the cooperation )f the outside world, who demand our products, and the people )f Gatlinburg who make the products in their homes, with the School as a medium, between, that we can finally reach our ideals.

PERCE H.) .11 ' %5 Hillside Drive, Burlingame, Calif. .II MR. TURNER'S GMT In the last issue of the ARROW we tried to tell you a little of how much we owe to Professor White, to Mr. Mattil and to Mr. John Turner for finally getting our new industrial building started. Since then Mr. Turner has made his report on the actual expense incurred so far and by giving us a large part of his legitimate commission as builder has arrived at a total that is $1589.10 under the approximate estimate. The letter that ac-companies this generous gift is an inspiration and we quote in part from it: "The one aim and desire I have had was to give the best I could and come under our approximate estimate. I have had the pleasure, by not including the commission mentioned, to come about $1589.10 under. "I hope you will find and feel as I do that you have got value received for your expenditure. I refused work in Knoxville so that I could give my whole time and attention to your work. I knew this had to be to get results and justify the responsibility placed upon me. I think I was stimulated by that responsibility and I am sure that I put my whole soul into it because you were so wrapped up in it not for your own personal gain but to up-lift neglected humanity. I was struck with admiration while at Gatlinburg as I looked at these children from homes of poverty brought by your work and example to the place where their actions, their modest dignity, their conversation and deportment cannot be surpassed." .II .11 .11 .II ..l tiOTEI.S [JWi NAtLAKUCNEE %O (iOR BOYS ~i ALL 4NAHY SP45 noTEL N 4+iTYAIOC $ORiHG3 HTEL. a. ..OW. 1H.

Nxws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 861 GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS PARK GIFT of $5,000,000 made on March 5 by the Laura Spel man Rockefeller Memorial to the Great Smoky Mountains 4 "4 National Park fund insures the East of a great national park rivaling the national parks of the West and accessible to three-fourths of the country's inhabitants. This proposed National Park is right at the doorstep of our Settlement School. Says the New York Times : The Rockefeller donation voted by the trustees of the memorial in memory of the late Mrs. John D. Rockefeller, Sr., makes certain that the $10,000,000 goal sought by those who conceived the idea of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park will be reached. Nearly $5,000,000 has been raised by public subscription and by legislative appropriation in North Carolina and Tennessee. The State funds authorized to date are to be raised by bond issues. The $10,000,000 fund will be used to purchase the vast tract of land for the Great Smoky 'Mountains National Park. The acquisition of the land has been placed in the hands of the North Carolina National Park Commission in North Carolina, and a Tennessee Nation-al Park Commission in Tennessee. When the state park commissions have assembled the lands for the park, the two states will turn over the area to the Federal Government for park development by the National Park 'Service, which has supervision over the great national parks in other parts of the United States. The !Great Smoky Mountains National Park will include approximately 70,000 acres of which 300,000 acres are of virgin forests. 862 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI Approximately half the pre-scribed area lies in North Carolina, and half in Tennessee. Knoxville, Tenn., and Asheville, North Carolina are the largest cities adjacent t o t h e park territory. The park area has within its borders a score of mountain peaks 6,000 feet high or higher. Hundreds of peaks tower above 5,000 feet. A recent survey of t he projected park's wild animal life showed that there, were more than 3,200 red deer, and that black bear, elk and smaller g a m e were to Ile found in abundance. The tract contains more than 400 miles of trout streams. Here, as Secretary James Wilson said in a government report, are "the greatest mountain masses east of the Rock ies," and the Smokies tower higher above Knoxville than the Rockies above Denver, while Le Conte, 6,680 feet above sea level is a mile above Gatlinburg. "Within the park area there are whole tracts of forest where, even to this day, no human being has set foot, and only three or four living men have traversed the crest of the Great Smokies from end to end. NEWS "FROM LITTLE PIGEON 863 When the Great Smokies become a National Park, a splendid highway for automobiles will traverse the entire length of that crest. The highway which is already under construction passes the front gate directly opposite our Settlement School cottages. A very excellent description of Eastern Tennessee is given by Theodore Marvin in Explosives Engineer of t h e Hercules Powder Co., under the title, "A National Park in Eastern America's Highlands," as follows: One evening during a bear hunt, Horace Kephart, author of "Our Southern Highlanders," paused near Briar Knob on the high ridge which is a part of the boundary between Tennessee and North Carolina. From the Tennessee side rose the noise of a logging engine as it hauled down the slope the fallen monarchs of this, America's last great virgin deciduous forest. Contemplating the deforestation of the surrounding wilderness he apostrophized, "All this shall be swept away, tree and plant, beast and fish. Fire will blacken the earth; flood will swallow and spew forth the soil. The simple-hearted native men and women will scatter and disappear. In their stead will come slaves speaking strange tongues to toil in the darkness under the rocks. Soot will arise, and foul gasses ; the streams will run murky death. Let me not see it!" Realizing the possibility of this fate for the majestic slopes of this picturesque mountain range, the Great Smoky Mountains Conservation Association, headed by Mr. Willis P. Davis and Colonel D. C. Chapman, of Knoxville, four years ago initiated *a movement for the preservation of the natural beauties of the region. This organization's appeal for a national park in the Gredt Smoky Mountains was later augmented by support from the North Carolina civic clubs. The worthiness of the cause for which these enthusiastic groups were working impressed Dr. Hubert Work, Secretary of the Interior. He responded to their petitions by appointing the Southern Appalachian Park Committee which, after eight months of exploration, reported that of several possible mountain park sites in Eastern United States, "The Great Smoky Mountains easily stand first because of the height of the mountains, depth of valleys, ruggedness of the area, and the unexampled variety of trees, shrubs, and plants." Secretary Work, by congressional authorization, appointed the same committee as a commission to determine the area and boundaries of the park, and to receive definite offers of donations of lands and moneys. This became necessary as there was no precedent in Congress for the purchase of park property with federal money. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 865 The commission recommended a park area of 450,000 acres. Al-ready people of North Carolina and Tennessee have raised over a million dollars * as a nucleus of the purchase price, and these states are appealing to citizens of other commonwealths. Donations from thousands of lovers of the forest primeval are needed to frustrate the fulfillment of Kephart's dire prophecy. Then will the mountain citizens retain their heritage. Forty-three miles by road southeast of Knoxville lies Gatlinburg, a quaint little Tennessee settlement just outside the proposed border of the new park. It is reached from Sevierville and Pigeon Forge along the west fork of Little Pigeon River. To the south, east and west, is the land of the Tennessee mountain people. The distant haze-blue skyline of the mountains faintly traced against the deeper blue of skies, marks the state border of Tennessee and North Carolina. Along this ridge of the Great Smoky Mountains there is a twenty-eight mile stretch where the whole mountain range is over a mile above sea level. From its summit rise Mount Guyot (6615 ft.) , Laurel Top, Sawtooth, lgount Collins, Clingman's Dome (G644 ft.), Silers Bald, Briar Knob, Thunderhead, Little Bald, Gregory Bald, and lesser peaks. Over the range is the Qualla Indian Reservation not far from Bryson City, North Carolina. There reside the descendants of a Cherokee Indian tribe which defied the American army in post-colonial days and in spite of every effort to move them they remained in the land of their birth. Near Gatlinburg is majestic mount Le Conte which rises 6,6S0 and i little more than a mile above its base level. To the south are the Sugarlands, a wilderness of mountains masked by the almost impenetrable growths of trees and bushes. Journeying south from Knoxville thru Maryville, Kinzel Springs, Tuckaleeehe Cove, and Rich Mountain, Cades Cove is reached. From that point the divide is accessible by horse or on foot. There and northeastward to the proposed park boundaries is a magnificent country of rugged mountains and virgin forests. A land where the customs and speech of England during the eighteenth century bide with the mountain dwellers, proud descendants of Scotch-Irish ancestors. That this area may be preserved as nearly as possible in its primitive state is the aim of park enthusiasts. With that goal achieved the grandeur of the Great Smokies will be made more accessible to park visitors by the construction of roads into different sections from where the little known areas can be reached on foot. There is a growing opposition to girdling such peaks as Mount Le Conte with automobile roads. By careful zoning, the more distinctive parts will * On March 6, 1928, the total contributions received from other sources exclusive of the Rockefeller gift anicunted to: $4,913,000.00. 866 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI be maintained as they now are, in fact as they were in the days of Daniel Boone and the Revolutionary War. He who seeks adventure in the Great Smoky Mountains should first visit the shrine of the park's enthusiasts Mount Le Conte. It was early one May morning that I left *Knoxville, with that peak as my objective. Winding through a country of green farmlands and blooming orchards, a broad macadam road extends to Sevierville and thence to Pigeon Forge. It is from this picturesque village, on the west fork of the Little Pigeon River, that one gains a view of the Great Smokies, lying like an enchanted land behind their curtain of blue haze. Seven miles farther is Gatlinburg just outside the park border and the northern "sesame" to the secrets of the Smokies. At the Mountain View Hotel, an inn rustically constructed of hewn logs but possessing modern conveniences, I .was impressed by the excellence of the hand made-furniture. The proprietor explained, "The mountain people make these for us from native wood; even the bottoms are woven from 'hickory splits.' They haven't always done as much of this work: as now-a-days, at least not until 1912 when the Pi Beta Phi fraternity started its Settlement School here. At this school, mountain folks have been taught to do lots of things." Further curiosity prompted a visit to the School shop. There were displayed for sale the baskets, pipes, rugs, towels, bed-spreads, scarfs, and other handiwork of the mountaineers. As expressed by Miss Rogers, one of the School staff, "The purpose of the Settlement is to give to the mountaineers of the Appalachian Mountains of southeastern Tennessee educational training, the equivalent of a complete elementary and high school course, with particular emphasis on industrial and agricultural work, arts, and crafts. Also to provide a hospital and nursing center, to maintain a settlement house with recreational activities, and to extend to the mountain people such other help as may be needed." It is from Gatlinburg that the trail to Mount Le ,Conte starts. Mountain vistas, the forests, flowers, and shrubs encountered on the climb to the summit can best be described not by words but by the accompanying illustrations. Mount Le Conte, which is only thirty-one feet lower than Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Rocky Mountains, is pre-eminent in ruggedness, its gorges and glens all softened by a blanket of virgin forest. Along the mountain slopes can be found most of the 127 species of trees, and the 174 species of shrubs which grow in this district. The trees at the summit are typically Canadian, while the lower altitude growths are our southern types, The rhododendron is everyhere present; laurel and azaleas bloom in pro-fusion. One afternoon while traveling along a road which was being blasted and scraped near the base of Le Conte, I encountered a mountaineer NEWS FROlvr LITTLE PIGEON 867 working on the highway. His house near-by appeared to be standing only by virtue of its supporting stone chimney. "Yup," he boasted, "my old man built him that thar stone stack fifty years ago, an' hit ain't gave no trouble a' tall since. Guess hit'll stand thar 'nother fifty years." I hope it does! This mud-plastered stone chimney will cause passers-by to reflect on the hardships under which these mountaineers lived. A change is impending here; roads blasted into remote areas for transportation and communication are breaking down physical barriers. But in planning developments much thought is being given to the conservation of the natural beauties of the mountains, nor is the pictur esqueness of the native home-life being destroyed." With the proposed Great Smoky Mountains National Park be-coming a reality, the nation will turn its eyes towards that part of the country on which the eyes of 18,000 Pi Phis have been focused since 1912. To the world those "creeks and hollers" which have become an intimate part of our existence will soon become realities. As the World skims by in motor cars glimpsing the picturesque cabins tucked away on the hillsides, Pi Beta Phi will continue to carry its message of hope and helpfulness back into the coves and "hollers" away from the beaten trail. VACATION SUGGESTIONS Most of us are intending to do this summer some of the things we had hoped to do the past winter. Hcw many can obtain one Chevrolet customer during vacation? Certainly, if we are to make 250 Chevrolet sales and win the $250 bonus to help pay for the new Settlement School building, an earnest effort must be made. A. Washington, D. C. ri Phi has made an interesting suggestion: To go to Detroit, which may include a' delightful lake trip, and drive the new Chevrolet home. The freight saved is 'much more than the railway fare. Detroit is the most convenient point but cars can probably be obtained this way at any one cf the many branch fa'etories all over the United States, from which the deliveries are made. Perhaps there may be other such vacation trips. Take some friends with you and give them a free ride back!

It h a grown in the past three years from a small, rather ha hazard business to the level of an industry of great ec, nomic importance to the families living all through this regio Every woman, with hardly an exception, has a loom. Not of them weave for the School, several sell their own weaving their homes, while others sell to the two other gift shops that hal opened here. We have no control over these and have no de finite idea of the number of women who' are given employment, e: cept that it is smaller than ours. The community problems th arise from the competition among the shops and people are nun erous and complicated. Prices and quality are not stabalized amot those who do not come in contact with the School, so we are co] fronted with a great problem of how to educate them up to tl point where their pride in their weaving will help to overcon their tendency to cheapen their craft during the tourist season. Our part in the weaving business is now a large and u: questioned influence for good among the people. It may be teresting to know that from May 16, 1927, to March 30, 192 we have paid $8,676.64 to the women for their weaving. \A have tried to divide the weaving from each home as evenly possible so the thirty-eight homes that we have touched ha, all been equally benefited. We have noticed in the past two years that the children fro these homes come to school better dressed; the homes are gra, ually becoming better furnished, especially in the matter of Vi trolas ; the women themselves wear winter coats instead of th sweaters; they have more pleasure than ever before because the now have money for an occasional trip to Sevierville and Kno: vine.

The splenlid pike to Knoxville and the Smoky Mountains National Park novement is bringing the outside world to the very doors of these nountain people and so comes the prying, curious bargain hunter, who goes from home to home to buy wherever the women will ;ell the cheapest towels. That type does not help us reach our ideals very quickly. Then there is the other type of persons who can ap-)reciate our work and sympathize with our problems and are such I help and inspiration. Each idea gradually works its way into :he homes and that is where our influence must be of the most :areful and thoughtful kind to help the people to select the best md discard the worthless. We want those who buy our weaving to realize that they Ire not buying just an article but that they are supplying some woman with contentment and perhaps food; they are helping us to work out an economic problem of widespread influence for progress ; they are helping to keep the Arrow Craft Shop and the Weaving Department in the community for they are self-supporting and all money from Arrow Craft sales is used to maintain the entire Industrial Department. This year we have increased our industrial business 33 per-cent over last year. We can increase it 300 percent and only :na'ke a beginning in our opportunity for development. We can supply your demand for weaving, no matter how large it may Jecome. This is our aim and it is only through the cooperation )f the outside world, who demand our products, and the people )f Gatlinburg who make the products in their homes, with the School as a medium, between, that we can finally reach our ideals.
