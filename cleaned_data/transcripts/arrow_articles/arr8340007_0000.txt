        Louisiana Beta Dream House by Debbie Leake, Louisiana Beta Louisiana Beta's new home was dedicated on November 13, 1966. The dedication ceremony opened with the invocation given by Reverend James Young which was followed by the welcome and response given by Chancellor Taylor and Mrs. John Eastham. Then Mrs. Richard A. Roberts, house corporation president, conducted the dedication. Following this Mrs. Watts, President of the Mother's Club, sang the hymn "Bless This House" accompanied by members of the sorority. Mrs. Roberts was presented with a gold plaque inscribed with her name recognizing her many years of dedication to Pi Beta Phi as Louisiana Beta House Corporation President. Her portrait will be painted and hung in the living room. Father Cody gave the benediction. The dedication was followed by a Tea during which parents, faculty, and fellow students were shown through the house. The Pi Beta Phi house favors an air of continental elegance and waives informality. From the front to the back door, this continental grandeur prevails. From a lushly colored dining hall to the telephone booths, it's luxury. The exterior is simulated old brick of French Regency style with a New Orleans influence. The all-air conditioned house of plastic interior has acoustical ceilings and vinyl tile floors. Uniquely, French doors across the front of the House open onto the lawn fronting the lake. The reception hall is enhanced by a sparkling French Re-gency crystal chandelier purchased in New Orleans. A custom-made wrought iron stair railing winds up-stairs from the hall to the dormitory rooms which house fifty girls. On the right side (entering) of the hall is the dining hall and kitchen; on the left, the living and chapter rooms. There are many paintings used throughout the house including two done by mothers of Pi Beta Phis and given as a gift to the chapter. Upstairs rooms, with a few exceptions, house two girls to a room. Each girl has a desk, light, bookshelf, mirror, chest, and very ample storage space. Outside, the house is distinguished by symbols that have a special meaning for us Pi Phis. It is the Pi Beta Phi arrow which is so skillfully constructed into the balcony grillwork that it is sometimes overlooked, but when discovered becomes a conversation piece. Another symbol is the Greek letters encrusted in the door-knobs. "What we wanted to achieve, and what we have, in this house is a home that is ladylike," Mrs. Roberts said. "Something that is feminine yet formal, something that will teach the sorority members how to live graciously and comfortably too. This is the effect we wanted a French house in a Louisiana setting with today's Pi Beta Phis as occupants." These words symbolize what all Pi Beta Phis of our chapter feel toward our new home it is indeed a dream come true! Louisiana Beta's new home. 6 News from Little Pigeon Edited by Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin The Little Pigeon "Little Pigeon News" follows the colorful Little Pigeon River around a wooded bend this summer as Pi Beta Phi Settlement School gives way to the Centennial project, The Art and Craft Center. Left behind for all time is a record of service as imposing and indestructible as the stones that dot the pathways of the River. -30 Over the years "News from Little Pigeon" has kept the fraternity informed of the struggles, the progress and the accomplishments of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. This has spanned the time from the establishment of the one room school in Gatlinburg in 1912 to the present day with the successful Arrowcraft Shop and the outstanding Craft Workshop program. This summer the Settlement School will become the foundation for the Centennial. Project, an expanded Art and Craft Center. This is to be the last issue of "News from Little Pigeon" and we wish to express our appreciation to all, both Pi Phis and other friends, whose contributions to this section have added so greatly to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School story. And, especially do we thank Dorothy Stuck, Editor of THE ARROW, for her guidance over the last five years. SALLY WILD GORDON Settlement School Committee Editor of "News from Little Pigeon" 7 Memoirs of Settlement School Gatlinburg with Mount Harrison in the background in the winter of 1413. Sometimes it is good to look back in order that one may look forward and with more wisdom and understanding. I have been asked to do just that to our philanthropic project in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, as a 40-year Pi Phi and as a 35-year citizen of Gatlinburg. I will tell you of the progress our Settlement School has made through the years. From the moment I saw the movie of our Settlement School, shown by the Director of the School, Miss Evelyn Bishop, at the 1927 Convention in Breezy Point, Michigan, I knew exactly what I wanted to do upon graduation from college. In my application to the Settlement School, I said that I would accept any opening, even though I had pre-pared to teach mathematics in high school. How happy I was when notified that I had been accepted as a teacher of the third and fourth grades for the 1928-29 school year. Never will I forget my trip to Gatlinburg over the new road being constructed into Gatlinburg. How excited I was, but disappointed that the low hanging clouds were obscuring any glimpse of a mountain. How impressed I was with the beauty of the foliage, the loud roar of the Little Pigeon River as it flowed swiftly over the large rocks (I heard that roar continuously night and day for one month after which I no longer heard it unless my attention was called to it). How surprised I was to be dumped out of the taxi, trunk, baggage and all beside the road at the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School sign. Walking up Pi Phi Lane to Helmick House, or Teachers' Cottage as it was more often called, I was greeted by Miss Mary Pollard, one of the first Pi Phi teachers in the early days of our School, who was assisting our director, Miss Evelyn Bishop, this summer of 1928. On going inside the cottage, it was a nice surprise to find all modern conveniences especially electric lights and inside plumbing. I didn't expect either. I could write a book about those three years 1928-1931. There were fourteen people on the staff that year of 1928 and all lived in the three dormito-ries Teachers' Cottage, Pollard Cottage (where the kitchen, dining room and girls' dormitory were located) and Stuart Cottage (where I lived with 4 other staff members) . On meeting Miss Evelyn Bishop I soon learned why she was loved and looked up to not only by the staff but also by every mountain family within miles of the School. She had a magnetic personality, was a good administrator, and always looked for and brought out the good in everyone. We were fortunate to have had her during those formative years of our School 1917 to 1933. The other members on the staff in 1928 were Miss Elizabeth Cook, bookkeeper; La Delle Allen (Pi Phi from Arkansas), Arrowcraft manager; Winogene Redding, weaving instructor; Frances Moore, nurse in Jennie Nicol Health Center; Mrs. Morgan, dietician and housemother for girls' dormitory; Eleanor Brabson, teacher of Primer, 1st and 2nd grades; Alice Williams (Pi Phi from Illinois), teacher of 5th and 6th grades; Kathryn Kibler (Pi Phi from Kansas), teacher of 7th and 8th and high school English; Katharine Watson, Home Ec teacher; Bruce Overton, principal and teacher in the 2-year high school; O. J. Mattil, Smith Hughes Agriculture teacher; and Lois Rogers (Pi Phi from Texas) worked in summers in Arrowcraft Shop. Also living in the dormitories in 1928 were 15 girls and 15 boys, high school age, who earned most of their way by doing chores on the place. These children lived too far away to walk and there were no buses then. Most of these have become leaders in their communities now. Two boys living there in 1928 were Herbert Trentham, now driver of a sight-seeing car at Moutain View Hotel and Wade King, one of the managers of Reagan's. Furniture Shop. School started the first week in August and lasted eight months so that the children might get through school by April 1 that they could help in the fields all spring and summer. How impressed I was with my first day of school 8 by Henrietta McCutchan Huff Missouri Beta Gatlinburg and Mount Harrison in the same view in the summer of 1966. a class of 30 bare-footed boys and girls all very normal, healthy, bright children as, you might find in any rural school. I was amazed to find almost every child with blond hair showing their Anglo-Saxon descent. During my second year of teaching, the one-room school house up Cherokee Orchard road was closed and some of these children were placed in my 3rd and 4th grades. What a contrast between the foundation of these children and that of those children who had always gone to our Pi Beta Phi School. I had to give much individual attention to these children in order to help improve their reading. At that time the teachers were required to visit every home once a month. We would take turns hitching up the two school horses and riding horse-back up the creeks and "hollers" each day after school. In looking back, it wouldn't be right to leave out our branch school located farther back in the mountains where the road ended in the Sugarlands. This 2-room school, called the Emma Harper Turner Center, was started in 1924-2 5, the staff that first year being Helen Chew, Cora McCarter and Mary Elder. Helen Chew even had a night school for adults. Some of my best friends here in Gatlinburg attended this school and now own motels and other businesses in Gatlinburg. As all families had to move out when the Park came, the school was closed around 1933 or 34. What fun Kathryn Kebler and later Barbara Horton and I had riding horseback up there on weekends, then hiking with Eva Hathaway (Iowa Pi Phi), who came in 1928 and after closing this school started one in Laurel Lick, Emily Burton (who taught in Gatlinburg from 1917 to 1928 when she moved to the Sugarlands School) and Mrs. Anna Dowell (Iowa Beta), housekeeper. (She had been at our School since 1921.) During the three years I taught at our Settlement School, not only did I fall in love with the beautiful mountains and the fine people living here, but also in particular with a certain young man by the nameof James N. Huff, who was in that first class of 1912 and whose father, Andy J. Huff, was the man responsible for keeping the Pi Phi School here in that first year. After our marriage in 1931, we had 5 children, all of whom attended our Pi Beta Phi School and gained a good foundation to go on to college and secure degrees. Three daughters are also Pi Phis. Over the years some things have remained unchanged the primeval beauty of these Smoky Mountains, the roar of the fast moving streams, and the natural ability and intelligence of the mountain people with their good Anglo-Saxon heritage. What are the changes that have been made in Gatlinburg? These changes have meant progress for this mountain community. They have come so fast over the years that it is hard to realize this is the same locality. All roads have been improved no more fording the streams. The road that ended in the sugarlands, when I arrived 1928, now goes over Newfound Gap into Cherokee, North Carolina. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park was dedicated in 1941 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The establishment of the Park brought about the majority of changes. The town grew in population from 500 in 1928 to approximately 2000 now. As the U. S. Government Park Service bought up the land for the Park, the mountain people moved down into the lower elevations many moving into Gatlinburg and vicinity. Those who owned land in Gatlinburg heeded the advice of Mr. Andy Huff and held on to their property. The education they received at our school, plus their own natural shrewdness, prepared them to cope with this prosperity. Motels, gift shops and restaurants started springing up after the dedication of the Park in '41. Pi Phi set the example of using good architects in their buildings. Andy Huff was wise enough to see the wisdom in this policy and had the vision to see the need for providing many more modern rooms in his hotel (first built in 1917) for the many tourists who would be coming with the opening of the new 9 10 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI trans-mountain road. He used an architect in planning the new addition to his hotel, completed in 1931 long before the Park was dedicated. Mr. Huff was a man of vision. If the leaders of Gatlin-burg had listened to his advice, there would have been six lanes instead of only four lanes on the Parkway through Gatlinburg. With the increase in population the enrollment at the school kept growing. Instead of 4 teachers for the 8 elementary grades as in 1928, there are now 16 teachers. The high school became a four-year accredited school shortly after my oldest daughter started to school in 1936. We know how the County has gradually taken over more and more of the sup-port of the school in Gatlinburg as was the intent from the beginning of the Settlement School in 1912. As more income from the tourist trade came into the County, there has been more money to help support the schools. The teachers' salaries have in-creased from $50.00 per month plus room and board that I received in 1928 to over $300.00 per month paid by the County to most teachers. In 1963 the Gatlinburg and Pittman High Schools were moved into a new consolidated high school building located five miles out of Gatlinburg off Highway 73. This year the County is building fourteen new rooms for the elementary school with the help of the City of Gatlinburg. The old white building where I taught will be torn down. I have seen many fine Pi Phi Directors of our Settlement School come and go after Miss Evelyn re-signed in 1933: Miss Chaffee, Mrs. Weaver, Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, Miss Dyer, and finally our present capable director, Mrs. Marion Mueller, who has so ably directed the Settlement School since her arrival here in 1952. I wish I had space to list all the many Pi Phi teachers who have come through the years while I have been living here in Gatlinburg. Each has left her imprint on this community. Many children have been named after a teacher whom their parents had admired as a pupil. Two Pi Phis are living in Gatlinburg and are still teaching in the Gatlinburg schools Dorothy Douthat Manley (Mo. Gamma) and Sue Huff Cox (Tenn. Gamma) who was in that first class of 1912. I would also like to name all the wonderful Pi Phis who have served so unselfishly as members of the Settlement School Committee and whom I have had the privilege of getting to know. In living in Gatlinburg, I have been most fortunate to get to see Grand Council every other year when they meet here between Conventions, especially enjoying seeing my classmate in college, our Grand President, Alice Weber Johnson. There are some who would like to keep Gatlin-burg as it was in those early days. It was a happy time. There was none of the hustle and bustle of the present time. But I doubt that one can find a single individual, native to these mountains, who wouldwant to return to those days. What a contrast there is with their way of living and now. No longer do you find a one-room log cabin with no electricity and no inside plumbing. These people have taken advantage of every opportunity that has come their way. Today most everyone has a comfortable modern home. Nowhere can you find any lovelier homes than right here in Gatlin-burg. No longer do you find the women doing the hard work on a small farm plowing, hoeing corn, milkinb o besides all the housework (carrying water from the spring, washing the clothes outside in the old iron wash kettle, churning the milk) as in those early days. Most of them had large families and the children did help but the women became old looking before the age of 30. Weaving for Arrowcraft Shop helped the women in this respect for many families long before the coming of the tourist trade with jobs opening up in restaurants, gift shops and motels and still helps women. They can stay at home, make an income, and still care for their "young-uns." No longer does one see the women walking be-hind their husbands as they come into town (as I saw some of those still living back in the mountain in 1928). All husbands and wives walk side by side as equals. Most every family has an automobile and ride to town or wherever they desire to go. Many people have gained a wrong impression of what the mountain people are like from reading some of the popular comics. We know they are pictured as always being barefooted, with hair uncut or uncombed, wearing ragged clothes, etc. How untrue! When one of my daughters went to Pi Phi Convention in 1960, the girls couldn't believe any-one from Gatlinburg ever wore shoes. When I came to teach in 1928 the children did come to school barefooted in the hot months of August and September as was true at this time in many rural schools. Today the children all dress as the children in any other city school. Back in 1928 because of their isolation and because of their low income, the people did not dress in the newest styles of the day. However, many of the young people had gone off to college and were as well dressed as any other college girl or boy. Today you will find the citizens of Gatlinburg as well dressed as anyone anywhere in our U.S.A. Visit our churches any Sunday and you will find out for yourself. As Gatlinburg has grown in population, it has grown in the number of churches. In 1928 there was one Baptist church. Now there are ten churches: 3 Baptist, 1 Methodist, 1 Episcopal, 1 Catholic, 1 Lutheran, 1 Church of Christ, 1 Presbyterian and 1 Christian Scientist. I will say little about our Health work since this service is no longer needed. Gatlinburg now has a medical center with two fine doctors. There is also an osteopath in town and two dentists. But I must THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 11 say that the influence of our Jennie Nicol Health Center and the help it has meant to every family far and near over the years cannot be measured. The nurses through the years have meant happier, healthier lives for the people. With no doctor in Gatlin-burg in the first few years of my marriage (the first doctor came in 1935), I turned to the nurse for ad-vice many times. I have heard so many speak of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham, the first nurse, that I feel as though she were a long time friend. I finally met her in person on a recent visit here. Two former nurses have now retired and are living in Gatlinburg. Frances Moore, came to the Health Center in 1928, the same year I came to teach, and was school nurse for three years. While she was here she married O. J. Mattil, our Smith-Hughes Agriculture teacher from 1922 to 1929 at which time he started a woodworking shop and taught woodworking to the high school boys. He is now an officer in the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild of which Arrowcraft Shop is a member. The other nurse is Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta Delta Convention Initiate in 1958) who was the nurse here longer than any other nurse from 1935 to 1965 30 years in all. How she has come to be loved through the years by all of us and what a service she has performed cannot be measured! She is still active in civic projects and on the advisory board of the County Welfare Department. I would say the most exciting and most satisfying changes are those made in our Craft Program. My introduction to this Craft Program was on my second day in. Gatlinburg when Miss Evelyn asked me whether I would like to visit some of our weavers for Arrowcraft Shop. How thrilled I was to walk up Baskins Creek with Miss Onken, Grand President of Pi Beta Phi, Miss Mary Pollard, Miss Evelyn and Alice Williams (a new Pi Phi teacher, also) to see Izora Keener and her sister-in-law, Myrtle Conner. What beautiful articles they have woven through the years. Myrtle is still weaving and looks younger now than she did then. Although Izora has had to stop weaving due to age, I still see her in church almost every Sunday with her son and his family. We have read how Carolyn McKnight Hughes, Minnesota Alpha, revived the lost art of weaving and basket-making and how these articles were soldto Alumnae Clubs to bring in a small income for those people back in 1914 and 1915. And then how Miss Evelyn Bishop promoted this work, finally se-curing in 1925 Winogene Redding to assume full time charge of the weaving department (Gene held that position for 20 years. She walked miles upon miles through the cold winter months in those early years and later rode horseback to instruct the women at their looms. Much credit goes to Gene for her work with the mountain women. She designed some beautiful articles for Arrowcraft Shop through the years); how Arrowcraft Shop was started in 1926 in a room in Stuart Cottage by Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor (Pi Phis from Texas) and then moved to Teachers' Cottage and finally in 1927 to the original school building on. Baskens Creek and the road. I really went wild over the lovely articles on display in this shop and spent most of my salary for the beautiful linens and a coverlet. La Delle Allen (Pi Phi from Arkansas) was manager of the Arrowcraft Shop from 1927 to 1934. Mrs. Ethel Snow followed her and served for seven-teen years. Then came Marion Mueller (Indiana Gamma now director of School), Elizabeth Rue (Iowa Gamma now in charge of the branch shop in Mountain View Hotel), Nevada Christian (Nevada Alpha) and now Maria Tate (Florida Beta). All wonderful Pi Phis and each giving fine contribution to our Arrowcraft Shop. Now that our educational mission in this mountain community has been accomplished, we are now ready for our new philanthropy which has an even greater prospect for service to mankind the expansion of our Centennial Project the Arts and Crafts Center honoring our Founders anew. The Creative Arts are found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also as Alumnae Clubs we can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Senior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. To achieve this goal will take large amounts of money through the years. May each Pi Phi GIVE and GIVE and GIVE to our Centennial Fund. 4Settlement School Panorama 1945 1967 by Marion Webb Mueller, Indiana Gamma Director, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School The panoramic view of our Settlement School necessarily will be a mental picture of a series of images and events. Myriads of pictures and articles have been presented to our Alumna: Club members through the years. Yet, it seems most timely to pause for reflection in this, our Pi Beta Phi Centennial year. During this interim thousands of Pi Phis have been to our Settlement School, and those first visitors who came would wonder now at the many changes in the village during these two decades. Tourism attracted an estimated 6,466,000 persons in the adjoining Smoky Mountain National Park during the summer of 1966 as compared with 750,090 in 1945. An omen of spring is the local residents `checking up' on the new additions for the following tourist season. Each spring when I think the ultimate expansion has been made, I soon learn that more dreams are in the making. Gatlinburg adjoins the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and has an altitude of less than thirteen hundred feet while Mt. Le Conte which is visible and only a few miles distant by crow flight boasts the third highest altitude of the area over 6500 feet. As one drives a distance of approximately twelve miles to the Newfound Gap into North Carolina there is a kaleidoscopic scene of beauty and nature's wonder which is protected from commercial-ism by. the Park authorities. Gatlinburg at last count had 153 motels and 6 hotels, providing accommodations for over 13,000 tourists an unusual number for a town with a population of approximately 2300. Circa 1962 a nearby Ski Resort, a hospital and industrial attractions were added in the County, thus giving employment to several hundred people. Within the last twenty-five years the number of one-room schools has dwindled from twenty to one at present. From those entering school the percentage of high school graduates in 1962 was approximately thirty-five per cent. A determined effort to improve this record is being made by local and state authorities. Many new schools with innovations are being planned in eastern Tennessee. 014 Pi Beta Phi Settlement School which is located on Parkway in the heart of Gatlinburg has played an integral part in this development through the years. In so doing a development has taken place= at our school the development of a Craft Program. We must look at our topography to understand the development. In the background is an undeveloped wooded area. Twelve buildings are nestled together to form our Settlement School Campus. Approaching the school on Parkway one sees the Pi Beta Phi Craft Office (or administration building), next door across an expanse of lawn is Arrowcraft Shop. Back of Arrowcraft Shop is the Emma Harper Turner Building, presently used as a jewelry classroom. The old high school building further back on the campus houses four or five classrooms of our Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Workshop. Next to this building are three buildings used only by the County. At the left of our school lane is the Art and Craft Center, including the Evelyn Bishop Lounge, Loom House and Lolita Prouty Pottery Wing. Emily Helmick House, Pollard Dormitory (obsolete) and Stuart Cottage are on the lane leading to the popular Red Barn and Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House. At present these buildings are inadequate for our work-shops to expand. Even though our Pi Beta Phi and University of Tennessee Craft Workshop is well established and well-known there is competition with other craft schools with modern equipment, thus making our Centennial Craft Development Program most timely. Before we look to the future we must review some of the highlights of the last two decades. Having participated in three-fourths of that era, I can say that Pi Phis can justly be proud of the many accomplishments of this Memorial to our Founders. The discontinuance of the Dormitory Program in 1965 was with regret in many ways, yet with the aforesaid development of the area one can see why Pi Phi should look to other areas. However, it is a thrill to see the living evidence of our program evidence of helping in some way that not even a `thank you' may be given until years later. I recall two instances where unpaid accounts were paid in full after the student had been gone over five years. Many return for calls with their brides and the young mothers frequently come to introduce a babe in arms. Many of the boys return in uniform on leave. The most recent a handsome, tall youth whose name I could not recall was completing his service in Vietnam, but had signed up for another year. When I expressed my regret that we had to have this war, he said without hesitation "if you were there, you would understand." One of the girls we helped through the longest period is now in the Air Force. Christmas I received a lovely `crafty' looking card from her at Travis Air Force Base. Having lived at the dormitory since the seventh grade and having served as Kitchen-Aide several summers she knew crafts. In 1965 Pi Beta Phi discontinued the Health Service, having a registered nurse since 1920. Forty-five years of service! Here, too, chapters could be writ-ten, however, recognition has been given this project 12 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 13 in recent ARROWS. Another immeasureable service! The administration office now occupies that building on Parkway. In 1963 the Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlin-burg consolidated with Pittman Center High School five miles east. The elementary school still carries the name of Pi Beta Phi, although there are no teachers furnished by Pi Beta Phi beginning with 1966 fiscal school year. Plans for a new elementary building are completed by the County, also sufficient land to build traded with Pi Beta Phi. 1962 was an eventful year. ARROWS of that year carry details of the celebration of the fiftieth Anniversary of Settlement School. All Pi Phis should be thrilled to read of these events, however, there is one which is almost a `thrill of a lifetime' to me the Exhibit of Weaving from our Arrowcraft Shop and Workshop at the Smithsonian Institution. After much preparation to have this exhibit for one month I simply `burst with pride' when I saw this display. There was an additional honor after the display was dismantled, the Institution asked for seven pieces of the early weaving for their permanent collection (not for permanent exhibit). Pi Phi has thus received recognition for posterity. Our Grace Coolidge Collection of books is now housed at Staff House. All appropriate school books were given to the high school or the elementary school with the consolidation, however, books of the area, travel books, and craft books are in this Collection. A Jeanette Mitchell Minor Collection of Craft Books is being purchased for our craft classes. Several other memorial books have been given by others among them Mrs. Dorothy Lexau (daughter of Mrs. Ethel Trainer), and Mrs. Fred Van Aken in memory of her mother. Each building has memorials or gifts in honor of Pi Phis or some interested per-son. There are innumerable stories of these many, many gifts. We must keep faith with these generous donors of gifts by preserving them. The Red Barn was remodelled due to a bequest of a Pi Phi. Even though I had the privilege of helping with this project, ldid not realize (and I doubt if others who were working in this project realized) the scope of its popularity serving for youth groups for retreats, for our Pi Phi groups, and educational groups, as well as workshop students. The Red Barn has many tales to relate considering that it not only served as a barn in the literal sense, but also housed the first movies and basketball games in Gatlinburg. Arrowcraft Shop still serves as a multipurpose project giving an outlet to the many craftsmen who make these products and serving as a unifying contact with our Pi Beta Phi Clubs throughout the United States. There is a great economic benefit to the weavers and craftsmen because all the folks of the area do not wish to participate directly in tour-ism. There is inherent talent among many of the craftsmen which gives a certain satisfaction in making something with the hands. I trust there is mutual benefit with the Alumnre Clubs and Arrowcraft in the sale of the crafts. Clubs send clippings of unusual pictures with their `mountain crafts.' Having become very craft conscious in this area (tourism attracts more people, however, unquestionably it is a craft area which is renowned) we can be proud of our specialty of Arrowcraft, the weaving. I have found no production weaving which surpasses that of the cottage industry of our Arrowcraft Shop. In 1945 there was a momentous decision made for Pi Beta Phi. Due to the efforts of many Pi Phis and Dean Harris of the University of Tennessee there was a craft workshop on the Settlement School campus. Doubtless, they said they would try it for a year. There was an enrollment of 52 students! Al-most one-third of our present capacity. The following year our present Workshop Director, Marian Heard, became co-director and has since served as director through twenty-one summers. Having worked with Marian fifteen of those summers I will say that it is due largely to her efforts through constant vigilance that our 1967 Workshop can boast of its high standards of both design and craftsmanship the top characteristic of our school. Each year I am amazed at the tremendous results of the students with varying backgrounds ranging from the professional designer-craftsman to the highly skilled amateur. Many of them, especially the beginner, surprise themselves. The various aspects of our workshop development have far-reaching results. There are several scholar-ships provided by Alumni Clubs (and deeply appreciated). Virginia Alpha Scholarship is presented annually to a Pi Phi. The Southern California Area Council has provided scholarships biennially for The busy Gatlinburg of today with some of the 153 motels and 6 hotels in the foreground. 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI several years. There have been several Rehabilitation and Study Grants given by states, also foreign students studying in various capacities. Our seven assistantships providing for one credit course are consid-, ered a scholarship with board and room and tuition. Outside sources sometimes provide for supplemental teaching salary. The Southern Highland Handicraft Guild has donated $100 toward a scholarship for 1967. Each year twenty-five or more states are represented among our personnel and one or more foreign countries. Even though we advertise nationally there has been much evidence of growth with the experiences passed on by our students. In 1955 and 1958 Marian Heard conducted a European Craft Tour sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee. Yes, interest is still shown in having another such tour perhaps in the United States. Several of our students and staff attended the first International Craft meeting in June 1965. Our roots are deep in the craft program. Crafts are not new. The cavepaintings 40,000 years ago tell a story of the beginning of crafts. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. In 1967 we find young and old, seeking a satisfaction in doing something with their hands because creative crafts: develop skill provide an outlet for self-expressionmay be a form of recreation increase sensitiveness as to surroundings and give dignity to common things frequently bring out unsuspected abilities furnish aesthetic satisfaction and are pathways to wonder and beauty that form a link between nature and art explain and help rationalize the machine (many designer-craftsmen are in demand in industry) bring the handicapped into better adjustment are a delight to the adventuresome This panoramic view of our Settlement School in this land of a great natural beauty and hope, and a cultural heritage of several generations is very, very brief. However, it does bring us to our Centennial year where again we must pause to look at the future a moment. We must look at the coming of the new! All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. The path ahead is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi, to surpass the accomplishments of our first hundred years accomplishments which would have been impossible without the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. Beacon in a Mountain Village by Mrs. Sue (Huff) Cox, Tennessee Gamma It has been with profound interest that I have watched the growth of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. From the very beginning this missionary project, always sparked with the enthusiasm on the part of many dedicated women, has been a beacon in this mountain village. It has truly proved the way, beginning in the pioneering days, toward making Gatlinburg the cultural center that it is proud to be today. Now that we have become an incorporated town with our thousands of seasonal visitors, Pi Beta Phi continues to strengthen and widen its efforts through its craft program which can be meaningful to people all over the world. As a former pupil and teacher of the school, and, for the past ten years an honorary member of Pi Beta Phi, I wish to express my deep appreciation to the many, many Pi Phis whom I have loved and have worked with in this Gatlinburg project which I certainly believe will continue for generations to come. Settlement School Committee 1962-1967 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE-seated from left Sally Wild Gordon, Wis. Alpha, Editor, "Little Pigeon News" (1962-67); Dorothy Coleman Thorman, Ill. Epsilon, Chairman (1963-67); and Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, Slides and Movie films (1964-67). Standing Sally Bosman Schneiter, Ind. Alpha, Treasurer (1962-67); and Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha, Secretary (1961-67). The first Settlement School was organized at the Alumnae Session of Convention held June 28th, 1910, at Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. The last Settlement School Committee will complete its business at the June Convention of 1967 to be held at the Edge-water Beach Hotel in Chicago, Illinois. Settlement School Committee has served the fraternity for 57 years. Many dedicated members of Pi Beta Phi have worked on the Committee and are responsible for making Settlement School the most outstanding philanthropic venture undertaken by a fraternity. The years 1962 to 1967 have been challenging and educational for the members of the final committee. It has been the responsibility of the commit-tee to carry on during what have been called the transitional years. In 1962-63, the question was "transitional to what ?" All the members of the committee and members of the Settlement School Staff felt strongly that Settlement School was too well established in the field of crafts to let the fraternity move away and abandon the program for something entirely different for a new philanthropic project. There was unanimous agreement in wanting to continue Summer Craft Workshop and Arrow-craft Shop. Marian Heard, Director of Summer Craft Workshop, could see the establishment of a great Art and Craft Center. This idea had been the dream of Jessie Harris, Vice-Dean of the College of Home Economics, University of Tennessee, when the first Summer Craft Workshop was organized in 1945. Here was the foundation for a new program of expansion. To inform the fraternity about the extensiveness of the current Settlement School programs, a 16 mm movie film was made, in color. This film showed Arrowcraft Shop and all activities related to it. The major part of the film was devoted to showing the work done in classes of Craft Workshop. The film was shown at the 1964 convention and has been widely circulated for three years among clubs and charters, with excellent reception. Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics of the University of Tennesseeand Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design, University of Tennessee were guests of the fraternity at the 1964 convention, as speakers at the Settlement School night program. Dean Odland spoke of the mutual interest in the further development of the summer Craft Workshop program by the Ad-ministration of the University of Tennessee. She ex-pressed its willingness to cooperate in every way possible to make it a success. She said, "it would seem that with an historical background of successful pioneering on the part of Pi Beta Phi in the area of craft development programs, there would be an ideal opportunity to provide continued leadership in the utilization of human resources, through judicious, sound, yet inspired programs." This association of a great State University and a fraternity is unique and inspiring. Pi Beta Phi met the challenge and voted to establish an Art and Craft Center on the Settlement School property in Gatlinburg, as the Centennial Project. With Settlement School established as the foundation of the Centennial Project, the committee made every effort to inform the fraternity of how strong this foundation was. All forms of communication were used to present the present day pro-grams. Little Pigeon News in the ARROW, featured articles on Craft Workshop. Students told of their experiences and how much it meant to be a student under outstanding craftsmen. The May L. Keller Award was given for the pro-grams that showed the progress of Settlement School program from one of providing education on the elementary school level to one of providing education on the college level. Pi Beta Phi severed all responsibility for educational and Health Center programs, they have been assumed by Sevier County and the City of Gatlin-burg. These programs included: Dormitory for boy and girls, Health Center and providing salaries fa] special teachers. Pi Beta Phi has shown its deef (Continued on page 18) 15 1963-1967 Settle ent School Art and Craft Center by Dorothy Coleman Thor an, Illinois Epsilon Chairman of Settlement School Committee 1963-67 The Fiftieth Anniversary of Settlement School, an altruistic project, and Memorial to the Founders of Pi Beta Phi, was celebrated in 1962. A complete history of Settlement School, through the convention of 1962, was published and distributed by the fraternity. The last sentence in the history was the following quotation: "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." The Settlement School Committee of 1963-1967 picked up the torch and continued to develop the Settlement School program towards a great future, the establishment of an Art and Craft Center. In 1964, Pi Beta Phi voted to establish an Art and Craft Center on the foundation of Settlement School, as the Centennial Project. The development of Settlement School as an Art and Craft Center goes as far back as 1914-15 when the first handcrafted articles were sold to Alumnae clubs to bring in a small income for the mountain people. The establishment of Arrowcraft Shop in 1926 was a big step forward. The beauty and appreciation of native crafts led to a demand which has been met by Pi Beta Phi Alumnx Clubs, through the distribution of hand weaving and crafts in almost every state in the United States through Arrowcraft Shop. The second step towards development of an Art and Craft Center was made with the opening of the first Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, in 1945. Under the Di-rectorship of Marian G. Heard, Tennessee Gamma, Professor of Craft Design, the Summer Craft Work-shop has become well established nationally and is a school of great renown. Since 1962 the Summer Craft Workshop program has been expanded and strengthened through the following: The construction of the Weaving Studio in 1962. The construction of the Ceramic Studio in 1966 (considered the best of its kind, today). The addition of a one week short session, offering. Concentrated instruction under outstanding craftsmen. Increase'd salaries, making it possible to have excellent faculties. Increased publicity in national magazines, in-creasing enrollment. The Centennial Project will continue to build on the present program so that it can be expanded into a year-round program. It is planned that there will be new and well equipped dormitories, new class-room facilities and a multi-purpose building. This expansion will offer a comfortable and inspiring environment in which students will create new ideas, learn new techniques and skills, and acquire information that can be used to help others help them-selves. Credit for the strong foundation upon which the Centennial Project will be established belongs to hundreds of people, over a long period of time, but those most recently responsible, who deserve recognition are: Dr. Holt, President of the University of Tennessee; Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics; Marian G. Heard, Tenn. Ga., Professor of Craft Design and Director of Summer Craft Workshop for 21 years; Marion W. Mueller, Ind. Ga., Director of Settlement School for 15 years; and Maria H. Tate, Fla. B., Manager of Arrowcraft Shop for 5 years. Mary Mintich, Belmont, N. C. art teacher and student at Craft workshop for many years, in an article in the Winter ARROW 1966, said, "The influence of Craft Workshop clearly extends beyond the range of those fortunate to study there. We, the students, are looking forward to its increased growth and development." The Centennial Project has now picked up the torch and will carry on to make the former Settlement School the greatest Art and Craft Center, and a wonderful Memorial to the Founders of PI BETA PHI DURING ITS SECOND CENTURY.

When We Were Young by Barbara Mills Dewell Wood, Iowa Gamma I was attending the Settlement School sale in the fall of 1966 with my daughter-in-law. As we wandered from room to room inspecting the beautiful hand made articles we came to a group of pictures of the school as it looks today. "My," I said, "how it has changed since I taught there." Sally Gordon, editor of "News From Little Pigeon," was standing near-by and asked when I had taught there. I fumbled in my mind for dates and said, "I was there twenty or twenty-five years ago, from 1924 to 1926," and then I gasped, "over forty years ago! Why, that makes me an old timer." I hastened to add that I was barely 19 years old and had had just two years at Iowa State College at Ames when I arrived at Gatlinburg for my first year as a teacher of Home Economics. "The cookin"n' sewin' teacher," the mountain people called me. Sally asked if I would reminisce a bit about the school in the earlier years, so if my sisters will bear with my memories, refreshed a bit by a very poorly kept diary, I will try to tell you about the school and two of the happiest years of my life. I arrived in Gatlinburg the end of July 1924, after a long trip by train from Missouri Valley, Iowa to Chicago; another train from Chicago to Cincinnati, another train from Cincinnati to Knoxville, Tennessee and then a little trolley from Knoxville to Sevierville. There I was met by a handsome young man, Jim Huff, who drove me in his Ford from Sevierville, over a winding, rocky road 200 feet or so above the Little Pigeon River to Gatlin-burg. My diary gives a list of all the people I met at the Teachers' cottage that first day, but I will mention only a few. Miss Evelyn Bishop, head resident, whom. I was to grow to love, as everyone who knew her did. Mrs. Dowell, who purchased all foodstuffs. Helen Chew, the teacher who was to open the "new branch division of the Settlement School" up the Sugarlands. Miss Phyllis Higginbothom, Nurse. Aunt Lizzie Reagan, Housekeeper, who asked me when I met her if I had ever heard of her, and when I said, "Yes," chuckled and patted me on the cheek so hard it felt like a slap. There were many others that first day, Mr. Mattel, agriculture teacher; Mr. Dentin Lean-der, farm manager, postman and general helper for all the teachers; Mary Ann, etc. My diary states, "The cottages have hot and cold running water, electric light (from the school's own plant). I will live in the girls' dormitory, I guess I'llbe the chaperone ! There will be other teachers in the other two cottages, one on each side of mine. The teachers and dormitory girls are to prepare our dinners every night." Jim Huff, who met me, is one of Andy Huff's children. Mr. and Mrs. Huff played an important part in persuading the school to go to Gatlinburg. Jim told me the story of the earliest years as he drove me to the school. He said when the Pi Phis finally chose Gatlinburg for their school, the Gatlin-burg people had guaranteed a certain number of pupils. The 'first day of school opened, there was one pupil less than they had promised, so Andy Huff carried his little four year old daughter, Mattie, to school every day so that the Pi Phi teachers would stay. It seems natural that one day Mattie would go to college (Iowa State at Ames) and become a Pi Phi herself. Jack Huff, Stella Huff and Jim were out of the Pi Phi School when I was there, but Mattie was in high school and Blanche was in 5th or 6th grade. Many happy times, and delicious meals, were enjoyed at the Huff's Hotel, The Mountain View. Shortly after I arrived a big room with a huge stone fireplace at one end was added, where the teachers often gathered to enjoy the warmth of the fire and the "tall tales" Jack and Jim were always telling us. I arrived earlier than most of the other teachers, as the Home Economics Department was just being organized. I had to make plans for my cooking laboratory, go into Knoxville and buy supplies, get material for the curtains at the windows and plan how my morning cooking classes could prepare every school day the lunch for all of the teachers. Besides that I had to plan for the cooking class I would have at the Sugarlands one afternoon each week. I would ride Lady, my horse, the six miles there. Then one afternoon a week I rode to Cartertown for a sewing class. That school had no desks, only benches and when the children wrote they sat on the floor and used their benches as desks. By the middle of August when the school opened, the other teachers had arrived. There was Margaret White, Harmo Taylor, Helen Barrett, Marian Folsom, Emily Burton, Gene Redding and Lois Rogers. In reading over my diary I find many references to our school truck, or station wagon. It was our only means, other than by foot or horse back, to go anywhere, and often nine or ten teachers would go, for a day, to some other community or into Knoxville for a taste of city living and a big dinner of meat at the Farragut Hotel. B.Y.P.U. (Baptist Young People Union) was a part of our life too. I remember when I applied for a position at the school, one of the questions I had 17 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI to answer was, "will you be willing to take part in church activities ?" We all did take part, every Sun-day evening in the little white Baptist Church house, so close to the school. The teachers often led the young peoples meetings. We played the organ and helped lead the singing. Sunday evening and church were an important part of our lives. The Barn was more than a barn. On Friday nights fast and rough basketball games were held in the loft and on Saturday nights "old movies" were shown. All the teachers, students, townspeople and summer people came to these. If you think TV shows old movies, you should have seen the "old movies" of 1925. But it was Social Life and fun. In September we had our Fair. My diary tells of the canned fruits and tomatoes and jelly my cooking classes exhibited and the sewing classes had note-books of samples of stitches and seams. The Fair was more than a school project, it was a community project. I was clerk at the Fair and note that we took our exhibit to the County Fair at Sevierville, where our school exhibit won 1st place, then on to the Knoxville Fair. We always went to the fairs of other communities and I was judge many times of canned goods, baked foods, butter, etc. Once I was even asked at the Pittman Fair to judge 1st and 2nd place of two old old hand woven coverlets. They were both perfectly beautiful and intricate. How could I judge? I finally gave the Blue Ribbon to the one I liked best and the Red Ribbon to the other. I remembered our laundress, Martha Clabo, with one crippled hand, who washed all of our clothes on a washboard, and boiled them outside in a big black kettle over a wood fire. She ironed them all too and we paid fifty cents a week, no matter how few or many pieces we had in the wash. Then there were the "Harp singin's." I went the first time expecting to see harps, but discovered it was so called because Mr. Harp wrote the song book. The notes are all different shapes, triangles, circles, squares, etc. Each shape tells whether it is for the soprano, bass, alto or tenor. How those mountain people could sing. The leader sounded his tuning fork and away they went. It really was beautiful. I wonder if harp singing has been forgotten, if so it is too bad to lose such an interesting art. I remember mounting "Lady" with my saddlebags full of new style patterns and riding off up Roarin' Fork, or Baskin's Creek, or once a week in the summer fifteen miles away to conduct adult classes in community the meadow City of Gatlinburg. as a public parking lot and for Chamber of Commerce building. Pi Beta Phi has deeded land to Sevier County, for the construction of a new elementary school building. The White School building built in 1914 and the Rock building built in 1928 by Pi Beta Phi havesewing. Really, most of the women sewed very well, but they were hungry for new style dresses and they loved the patterns I brought. Then there were our weekend trips, usually on foot, to Alum Cave over the mountain to North Carolina on foot to Elkmont. We climbed Mt. Le Conte with jack and Jim to guide us straight up the mountainside. There was no easy trail then, we just climbed up. the mountain, with Jack urging us on. When we would ask how much farther to the top, he'd say, "It's just around the corner." Teaching at Gatlinburg gave us an opportunity to meet many interesting wonderful people. Aunt Lydia lived in a little one room house up the mountainside. She kept her potatoes from freezing by putting them under the floor boards in front of her fireplace. When we went to see her we always wore skirts and a hat to cover our bobbed hair, for she would take us to task and quote from the Bible where "It is an abomination unto the Lord for a woman to put on the raiment of man or to be shorn of her hair." Mr. and Mrs. Hall were retired and lived in a lovely house overlooking Gatlinburg and the Little Pigeon River. They often invited us teachers to their home and served us delicacies we would never have otherwise. Mrs. Duffield, who had an adorable little house, would invite us up occasionally for waffles and sausages and a pleasant evening around her fire. Of course, when the Settlement School Commit-tee came, we loved it. Nita Hill Stark was Chairman then and Mr. Stark would drive us in his big car to Knoxville for a wonderful dinner. There were trips to the Sugarlands and a night in Helen Chew's little three room cabin, furnished entirely with handmade mountain furniture. Our life as teachers at the school was very simple, but fun and healthful. Some evenings we would all sing to Miss Evelyn's playing, or listen to her read some book aloud. We took on mountain ways and went to bed early. We got up early too. Some of us had looms in our rooms. I still have the first towel I ever wove. It has very uneven edges. Anyone who has been to the Smoky Mountain National Park knows of its beauty. It is good to know the lovely holly, balsam, laurel and rhododendron, galax leaves and bear moss are being saved. I like to think that the school, besides all of it's other accomplishments, was instrumental in bringing this beautiful area to the attention of the world. rooted interest in the selling 2.2 acres of House to the (Continued from page 1 S) of Gatlinburg by served their original purpose well and will be re-in front of Staff placed.

Her Dedication Leads to Canadian Bench Marjorie Montgomery Bowker, Alberta Alpha, Is First Woman to Hold Such an Office Dedicated interest in problems ranging from child welfare to penal institution conditions has led an Alberta Alpha Pi Phi, to the post and responsibility of Judge of the Juvenile and Family Courts for the Province of Alberta, Canada, the highest judicial post ever to be held by a woman in Canada. A Pi Phi sister, Ruth Bowen, Women's Editor of the Edmonton journal, is the one who points out that Judge Bowker's direction toward this high honor was involuntary. She wrote, "Her steps had no conscious direction toward a judge's chair . . . but Mrs. W. F. Bowker is one woman with the social conscience to have impelled her to make voluntary investigations into the problems of child welfare, juvenile delinquency, the state of prisons in Alberta." Judge Bowker's appointment came in June, 1966. Prior to her appointment Canada had known three woman magistrates, two appointed in 1916 and an-other appointed in 1964. Under a former judicial system, all magistrates had the powers of a juvenile Court Judge for the locality where they served. In 1952, a new structure of juvenile and Family Courts was established in the Province and Mrs. Bowker is the first woman to be appointed judge in this provincial court. She has said that she feels her experience in three areas has been useful to her in her new position. These are her study and research over a number of years in the field of juvenile delinquency and penal reform; her visitation, with official approval, of all correctional institutions in Alberta in 1963; her rather thorough study of the Child Welfare situation in Alberta, through membership on the Provincial Adoption Committee, which included visitation of all child-care and youth-serving facilities in the Province. (She was the only woman on this three-member committee). Her visitation to every jail and custodial institution in Alberta was at her own request in an effort to see first hand the conditions under which both women and juvenile delinquents lived in these institutions. Ruth Bowen wrote, "Her own research led her all over the province to consult with welfare workers in the field and to gain an education in human problems . . . she knocked on doors to see living conditions for herself . . . out of this grew another area of concern, the problems of the retarded. Her report on preventive health services is now being studied by the premier and minister of health." Mrs. Bowker graduated from the University of Alberta in Arts and Law, and was admitted to the bar Judge Marjorie Montgomery Bowker of Alberta in 1940. She met her husband, Wilbur F. Bowker, Dean of Law, University of Alberta, while both were practicing with an Edmonton law firm. She carried on her husband's practice with the firm while he was in active service during World War II. The Bowkers have three children, sons, Blair, 18 and Keith Wilbur, 14, and daughter, Lorna Ethel, 16. Across the years she has been active in Y.W.C.A. activities; has served as an executive member of two major social concern agencies in Edmonton; and is the first woman to be appointed to the University of Alberta Hospital Board. She is a member of the junior League and was to be one of the guest panelists at the Junior League of America's national convention in Montreal, May, 1967. Mrs. Bowker has been a loyal and active Pi Phi since her initiation in 1936. She was secretary of her chapter; she served two different terms as president of the Edmonton Alumnae Club. She was active in initiating the Canadian Project and served as its first Western Representative following its establishment. She was on the Alberta Alpha Alumnae Advisory Committee for six years. 19

        Memoirs of Settlement School Gatlinburg with Mount Harrison in the background in the winter of 1413. Sometimes it is good to look back in order that one may look forward and with more wisdom and understanding. I have been asked to do just that to our philanthropic project in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, as a 40-year Pi Phi and as a 35-year citizen of Gatlinburg. I will tell you of the progress our Settlement School has made through the years. From the moment I saw the movie of our Settlement School, shown by the Director of the School, Miss Evelyn Bishop, at the 1927 Convention in Breezy Point, Michigan, I knew exactly what I wanted to do upon graduation from college. In my application to the Settlement School, I said that I would accept any opening, even though I had pre-pared to teach mathematics in high school. How happy I was when notified that I had been accepted as a teacher of the third and fourth grades for the 1928-29 school year. Never will I forget my trip to Gatlinburg over the new road being constructed into Gatlinburg. How excited I was, but disappointed that the low hanging clouds were obscuring any glimpse of a mountain. How impressed I was with the beauty of the foliage, the loud roar of the Little Pigeon River as it flowed swiftly over the large rocks (I heard that roar continuously night and day for one month after which I no longer heard it unless my attention was called to it). How surprised I was to be dumped out of the taxi, trunk, baggage and all beside the road at the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School sign. Walking up Pi Phi Lane to Helmick House, or Teachers' Cottage as it was more often called, I was greeted by Miss Mary Pollard, one of the first Pi Phi teachers in the early days of our School, who was assisting our director, Miss Evelyn Bishop, this summer of 1928. On going inside the cottage, it was a nice surprise to find all modern conveniences especially electric lights and inside plumbing. I didn't expect either. I could write a book about those three years 1928-1931. There were fourteen people on the staff that year of 1928 and all lived in the three dormito-ries Teachers' Cottage, Pollard Cottage (where the kitchen, dining room and girls' dormitory were located) and Stuart Cottage (where I lived with 4 other staff members) . On meeting Miss Evelyn Bishop I soon learned why she was loved and looked up to not only by the staff but also by every mountain family within miles of the School. She had a magnetic personality, was a good administrator, and always looked for and brought out the good in everyone. We were fortunate to have had her during those formative years of our School 1917 to 1933. The other members on the staff in 1928 were Miss Elizabeth Cook, bookkeeper; La Delle Allen (Pi Phi from Arkansas), Arrowcraft manager; Winogene Redding, weaving instructor; Frances Moore, nurse in Jennie Nicol Health Center; Mrs. Morgan, dietician and housemother for girls' dormitory; Eleanor Brabson, teacher of Primer, 1st and 2nd grades; Alice Williams (Pi Phi from Illinois), teacher of 5th and 6th grades; Kathryn Kibler (Pi Phi from Kansas), teacher of 7th and 8th and high school English; Katharine Watson, Home Ec teacher; Bruce Overton, principal and teacher in the 2-year high school; O. J. Mattil, Smith Hughes Agriculture teacher; and Lois Rogers (Pi Phi from Texas) worked in summers in Arrowcraft Shop. Also living in the dormitories in 1928 were 15 girls and 15 boys, high school age, who earned most of their way by doing chores on the place. These children lived too far away to walk and there were no buses then. Most of these have become leaders in their communities now. Two boys living there in 1928 were Herbert Trentham, now driver of a sight-seeing car at Moutain View Hotel and Wade King, one of the managers of Reagan's. Furniture Shop. School started the first week in August and lasted eight months so that the children might get through school by April 1 that they could help in the fields all spring and summer. How impressed I was with my first day of school 8 by Henrietta McCutchan Huff Missouri Beta Gatlinburg and Mount Harrison in the same view in the summer of 1966. a class of 30 bare-footed boys and girls all very normal, healthy, bright children as, you might find in any rural school. I was amazed to find almost every child with blond hair showing their Anglo-Saxon descent. During my second year of teaching, the one-room school house up Cherokee Orchard road was closed and some of these children were placed in my 3rd and 4th grades. What a contrast between the foundation of these children and that of those children who had always gone to our Pi Beta Phi School. I had to give much individual attention to these children in order to help improve their reading. At that time the teachers were required to visit every home once a month. We would take turns hitching up the two school horses and riding horse-back up the creeks and "hollers" each day after school. In looking back, it wouldn't be right to leave out our branch school located farther back in the mountains where the road ended in the Sugarlands. This 2-room school, called the Emma Harper Turner Center, was started in 1924-2 5, the staff that first year being Helen Chew, Cora McCarter and Mary Elder. Helen Chew even had a night school for adults. Some of my best friends here in Gatlinburg attended this school and now own motels and other businesses in Gatlinburg. As all families had to move out when the Park came, the school was closed around 1933 or 34. What fun Kathryn Kebler and later Barbara Horton and I had riding horseback up there on weekends, then hiking with Eva Hathaway (Iowa Pi Phi), who came in 1928 and after closing this school started one in Laurel Lick, Emily Burton (who taught in Gatlinburg from 1917 to 1928 when she moved to the Sugarlands School) and Mrs. Anna Dowell (Iowa Beta), housekeeper. (She had been at our School since 1921.) During the three years I taught at our Settlement School, not only did I fall in love with the beautiful mountains and the fine people living here, but also in particular with a certain young man by the nameof James N. Huff, who was in that first class of 1912 and whose father, Andy J. Huff, was the man responsible for keeping the Pi Phi School here in that first year. After our marriage in 1931, we had 5 children, all of whom attended our Pi Beta Phi School and gained a good foundation to go on to college and secure degrees. Three daughters are also Pi Phis. Over the years some things have remained unchanged the primeval beauty of these Smoky Mountains, the roar of the fast moving streams, and the natural ability and intelligence of the mountain people with their good Anglo-Saxon heritage. What are the changes that have been made in Gatlinburg? These changes have meant progress for this mountain community. They have come so fast over the years that it is hard to realize this is the same locality. All roads have been improved no more fording the streams. The road that ended in the sugarlands, when I arrived 1928, now goes over Newfound Gap into Cherokee, North Carolina. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park was dedicated in 1941 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The establishment of the Park brought about the majority of changes. The town grew in population from 500 in 1928 to approximately 2000 now. As the U. S. Government Park Service bought up the land for the Park, the mountain people moved down into the lower elevations many moving into Gatlinburg and vicinity. Those who owned land in Gatlinburg heeded the advice of Mr. Andy Huff and held on to their property. The education they received at our school, plus their own natural shrewdness, prepared them to cope with this prosperity. Motels, gift shops and restaurants started springing up after the dedication of the Park in '41. Pi Phi set the example of using good architects in their buildings. Andy Huff was wise enough to see the wisdom in this policy and had the vision to see the need for providing many more modern rooms in his hotel (first built in 1917) for the many tourists who would be coming with the opening of the new 9 10 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI trans-mountain road. He used an architect in planning the new addition to his hotel, completed in 1931 long before the Park was dedicated. Mr. Huff was a man of vision. If the leaders of Gatlin-burg had listened to his advice, there would have been six lanes instead of only four lanes on the Parkway through Gatlinburg. With the increase in population the enrollment at the school kept growing. Instead of 4 teachers for the 8 elementary grades as in 1928, there are now 16 teachers. The high school became a four-year accredited school shortly after my oldest daughter started to school in 1936. We know how the County has gradually taken over more and more of the sup-port of the school in Gatlinburg as was the intent from the beginning of the Settlement School in 1912. As more income from the tourist trade came into the County, there has been more money to help support the schools. The teachers' salaries have in-creased from $50.00 per month plus room and board that I received in 1928 to over $300.00 per month paid by the County to most teachers. In 1963 the Gatlinburg and Pittman High Schools were moved into a new consolidated high school building located five miles out of Gatlinburg off Highway 73. This year the County is building fourteen new rooms for the elementary school with the help of the City of Gatlinburg. The old white building where I taught will be torn down. I have seen many fine Pi Phi Directors of our Settlement School come and go after Miss Evelyn re-signed in 1933: Miss Chaffee, Mrs. Weaver, Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, Miss Dyer, and finally our present capable director, Mrs. Marion Mueller, who has so ably directed the Settlement School since her arrival here in 1952. I wish I had space to list all the many Pi Phi teachers who have come through the years while I have been living here in Gatlinburg. Each has left her imprint on this community. Many children have been named after a teacher whom their parents had admired as a pupil. Two Pi Phis are living in Gatlinburg and are still teaching in the Gatlinburg schools Dorothy Douthat Manley (Mo. Gamma) and Sue Huff Cox (Tenn. Gamma) who was in that first class of 1912. I would also like to name all the wonderful Pi Phis who have served so unselfishly as members of the Settlement School Committee and whom I have had the privilege of getting to know. In living in Gatlinburg, I have been most fortunate to get to see Grand Council every other year when they meet here between Conventions, especially enjoying seeing my classmate in college, our Grand President, Alice Weber Johnson. There are some who would like to keep Gatlin-burg as it was in those early days. It was a happy time. There was none of the hustle and bustle of the present time. But I doubt that one can find a single individual, native to these mountains, who wouldwant to return to those days. What a contrast there is with their way of living and now. No longer do you find a one-room log cabin with no electricity and no inside plumbing. These people have taken advantage of every opportunity that has come their way. Today most everyone has a comfortable modern home. Nowhere can you find any lovelier homes than right here in Gatlin-burg. No longer do you find the women doing the hard work on a small farm plowing, hoeing corn, milkinb o besides all the housework (carrying water from the spring, washing the clothes outside in the old iron wash kettle, churning the milk) as in those early days. Most of them had large families and the children did help but the women became old looking before the age of 30. Weaving for Arrowcraft Shop helped the women in this respect for many families long before the coming of the tourist trade with jobs opening up in restaurants, gift shops and motels and still helps women. They can stay at home, make an income, and still care for their "young-uns." No longer does one see the women walking be-hind their husbands as they come into town (as I saw some of those still living back in the mountain in 1928). All husbands and wives walk side by side as equals. Most every family has an automobile and ride to town or wherever they desire to go. Many people have gained a wrong impression of what the mountain people are like from reading some of the popular comics. We know they are pictured as always being barefooted, with hair uncut or uncombed, wearing ragged clothes, etc. How untrue! When one of my daughters went to Pi Phi Convention in 1960, the girls couldn't believe any-one from Gatlinburg ever wore shoes. When I came to teach in 1928 the children did come to school barefooted in the hot months of August and September as was true at this time in many rural schools. Today the children all dress as the children in any other city school. Back in 1928 because of their isolation and because of their low income, the people did not dress in the newest styles of the day. However, many of the young people had gone off to college and were as well dressed as any other college girl or boy. Today you will find the citizens of Gatlinburg as well dressed as anyone anywhere in our U.S.A. Visit our churches any Sunday and you will find out for yourself. As Gatlinburg has grown in population, it has grown in the number of churches. In 1928 there was one Baptist church. Now there are ten churches: 3 Baptist, 1 Methodist, 1 Episcopal, 1 Catholic, 1 Lutheran, 1 Church of Christ, 1 Presbyterian and 1 Christian Scientist. I will say little about our Health work since this service is no longer needed. Gatlinburg now has a medical center with two fine doctors. There is also an osteopath in town and two dentists. But I must THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 11 say that the influence of our Jennie Nicol Health Center and the help it has meant to every family far and near over the years cannot be measured. The nurses through the years have meant happier, healthier lives for the people. With no doctor in Gatlin-burg in the first few years of my marriage (the first doctor came in 1935), I turned to the nurse for ad-vice many times. I have heard so many speak of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham, the first nurse, that I feel as though she were a long time friend. I finally met her in person on a recent visit here. Two former nurses have now retired and are living in Gatlinburg. Frances Moore, came to the Health Center in 1928, the same year I came to teach, and was school nurse for three years. While she was here she married O. J. Mattil, our Smith-Hughes Agriculture teacher from 1922 to 1929 at which time he started a woodworking shop and taught woodworking to the high school boys. He is now an officer in the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild of which Arrowcraft Shop is a member. The other nurse is Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta Delta Convention Initiate in 1958) who was the nurse here longer than any other nurse from 1935 to 1965 30 years in all. How she has come to be loved through the years by all of us and what a service she has performed cannot be measured! She is still active in civic projects and on the advisory board of the County Welfare Department. I would say the most exciting and most satisfying changes are those made in our Craft Program. My introduction to this Craft Program was on my second day in. Gatlinburg when Miss Evelyn asked me whether I would like to visit some of our weavers for Arrowcraft Shop. How thrilled I was to walk up Baskins Creek with Miss Onken, Grand President of Pi Beta Phi, Miss Mary Pollard, Miss Evelyn and Alice Williams (a new Pi Phi teacher, also) to see Izora Keener and her sister-in-law, Myrtle Conner. What beautiful articles they have woven through the years. Myrtle is still weaving and looks younger now than she did then. Although Izora has had to stop weaving due to age, I still see her in church almost every Sunday with her son and his family. We have read how Carolyn McKnight Hughes, Minnesota Alpha, revived the lost art of weaving and basket-making and how these articles were soldto Alumnae Clubs to bring in a small income for those people back in 1914 and 1915. And then how Miss Evelyn Bishop promoted this work, finally se-curing in 1925 Winogene Redding to assume full time charge of the weaving department (Gene held that position for 20 years. She walked miles upon miles through the cold winter months in those early years and later rode horseback to instruct the women at their looms. Much credit goes to Gene for her work with the mountain women. She designed some beautiful articles for Arrowcraft Shop through the years); how Arrowcraft Shop was started in 1926 in a room in Stuart Cottage by Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor (Pi Phis from Texas) and then moved to Teachers' Cottage and finally in 1927 to the original school building on. Baskens Creek and the road. I really went wild over the lovely articles on display in this shop and spent most of my salary for the beautiful linens and a coverlet. La Delle Allen (Pi Phi from Arkansas) was manager of the Arrowcraft Shop from 1927 to 1934. Mrs. Ethel Snow followed her and served for seven-teen years. Then came Marion Mueller (Indiana Gamma now director of School), Elizabeth Rue (Iowa Gamma now in charge of the branch shop in Mountain View Hotel), Nevada Christian (Nevada Alpha) and now Maria Tate (Florida Beta). All wonderful Pi Phis and each giving fine contribution to our Arrowcraft Shop. Now that our educational mission in this mountain community has been accomplished, we are now ready for our new philanthropy which has an even greater prospect for service to mankind the expansion of our Centennial Project the Arts and Crafts Center honoring our Founders anew. The Creative Arts are found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also as Alumnae Clubs we can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Senior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. To achieve this goal will take large amounts of money through the years. May each Pi Phi GIVE and GIVE and GIVE to our Centennial Fund. 4Settlement School Panorama 1945 1967 by Marion Webb Mueller, Indiana Gamma Director, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School The panoramic view of our Settlement School necessarily will be a mental picture of a series of images and events. Myriads of pictures and articles have been presented to our Alumna: Club members through the years. Yet, it seems most timely to pause for reflection in this, our Pi Beta Phi Centennial year. During this interim thousands of Pi Phis have been to our Settlement School, and those first visitors who came would wonder now at the many changes in the village during these two decades. Tourism attracted an estimated 6,466,000 persons in the adjoining Smoky Mountain National Park during the summer of 1966 as compared with 750,090 in 1945. An omen of spring is the local residents `checking up' on the new additions for the following tourist season. Each spring when I think the ultimate expansion has been made, I soon learn that more dreams are in the making. Gatlinburg adjoins the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and has an altitude of less than thirteen hundred feet while Mt. Le Conte which is visible and only a few miles distant by crow flight boasts the third highest altitude of the area over 6500 feet. As one drives a distance of approximately twelve miles to the Newfound Gap into North Carolina there is a kaleidoscopic scene of beauty and nature's wonder which is protected from commercial-ism by. the Park authorities. Gatlinburg at last count had 153 motels and 6 hotels, providing accommodations for over 13,000 tourists an unusual number for a town with a population of approximately 2300. Circa 1962 a nearby Ski Resort, a hospital and industrial attractions were added in the County, thus giving employment to several hundred people. Within the last twenty-five years the number of one-room schools has dwindled from twenty to one at present. From those entering school the percentage of high school graduates in 1962 was approximately thirty-five per cent. A determined effort to improve this record is being made by local and state authorities. Many new schools with innovations are being planned in eastern Tennessee. 014 Pi Beta Phi Settlement School which is located on Parkway in the heart of Gatlinburg has played an integral part in this development through the years. In so doing a development has taken place= at our school the development of a Craft Program. We must look at our topography to understand the development. In the background is an undeveloped wooded area. Twelve buildings are nestled together to form our Settlement School Campus. Approaching the school on Parkway one sees the Pi Beta Phi Craft Office (or administration building), next door across an expanse of lawn is Arrowcraft Shop. Back of Arrowcraft Shop is the Emma Harper Turner Building, presently used as a jewelry classroom. The old high school building further back on the campus houses four or five classrooms of our Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Workshop. Next to this building are three buildings used only by the County. At the left of our school lane is the Art and Craft Center, including the Evelyn Bishop Lounge, Loom House and Lolita Prouty Pottery Wing. Emily Helmick House, Pollard Dormitory (obsolete) and Stuart Cottage are on the lane leading to the popular Red Barn and Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House. At present these buildings are inadequate for our work-shops to expand. Even though our Pi Beta Phi and University of Tennessee Craft Workshop is well established and well-known there is competition with other craft schools with modern equipment, thus making our Centennial Craft Development Program most timely. Before we look to the future we must review some of the highlights of the last two decades. Having participated in three-fourths of that era, I can say that Pi Phis can justly be proud of the many accomplishments of this Memorial to our Founders. The discontinuance of the Dormitory Program in 1965 was with regret in many ways, yet with the aforesaid development of the area one can see why Pi Phi should look to other areas. However, it is a thrill to see the living evidence of our program evidence of helping in some way that not even a `thank you' may be given until years later. I recall two instances where unpaid accounts were paid in full after the student had been gone over five years. Many return for calls with their brides and the young mothers frequently come to introduce a babe in arms. Many of the boys return in uniform on leave. The most recent a handsome, tall youth whose name I could not recall was completing his service in Vietnam, but had signed up for another year. When I expressed my regret that we had to have this war, he said without hesitation "if you were there, you would understand." One of the girls we helped through the longest period is now in the Air Force. Christmas I received a lovely `crafty' looking card from her at Travis Air Force Base. Having lived at the dormitory since the seventh grade and having served as Kitchen-Aide several summers she knew crafts. In 1965 Pi Beta Phi discontinued the Health Service, having a registered nurse since 1920. Forty-five years of service! Here, too, chapters could be writ-ten, however, recognition has been given this project 12 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 13 in recent ARROWS. Another immeasureable service! The administration office now occupies that building on Parkway. In 1963 the Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlin-burg consolidated with Pittman Center High School five miles east. The elementary school still carries the name of Pi Beta Phi, although there are no teachers furnished by Pi Beta Phi beginning with 1966 fiscal school year. Plans for a new elementary building are completed by the County, also sufficient land to build traded with Pi Beta Phi. 1962 was an eventful year. ARROWS of that year carry details of the celebration of the fiftieth Anniversary of Settlement School. All Pi Phis should be thrilled to read of these events, however, there is one which is almost a `thrill of a lifetime' to me the Exhibit of Weaving from our Arrowcraft Shop and Workshop at the Smithsonian Institution. After much preparation to have this exhibit for one month I simply `burst with pride' when I saw this display. There was an additional honor after the display was dismantled, the Institution asked for seven pieces of the early weaving for their permanent collection (not for permanent exhibit). Pi Phi has thus received recognition for posterity. Our Grace Coolidge Collection of books is now housed at Staff House. All appropriate school books were given to the high school or the elementary school with the consolidation, however, books of the area, travel books, and craft books are in this Collection. A Jeanette Mitchell Minor Collection of Craft Books is being purchased for our craft classes. Several other memorial books have been given by others among them Mrs. Dorothy Lexau (daughter of Mrs. Ethel Trainer), and Mrs. Fred Van Aken in memory of her mother. Each building has memorials or gifts in honor of Pi Phis or some interested per-son. There are innumerable stories of these many, many gifts. We must keep faith with these generous donors of gifts by preserving them. The Red Barn was remodelled due to a bequest of a Pi Phi. Even though I had the privilege of helping with this project, ldid not realize (and I doubt if others who were working in this project realized) the scope of its popularity serving for youth groups for retreats, for our Pi Phi groups, and educational groups, as well as workshop students. The Red Barn has many tales to relate considering that it not only served as a barn in the literal sense, but also housed the first movies and basketball games in Gatlinburg. Arrowcraft Shop still serves as a multipurpose project giving an outlet to the many craftsmen who make these products and serving as a unifying contact with our Pi Beta Phi Clubs throughout the United States. There is a great economic benefit to the weavers and craftsmen because all the folks of the area do not wish to participate directly in tour-ism. There is inherent talent among many of the craftsmen which gives a certain satisfaction in making something with the hands. I trust there is mutual benefit with the Alumnre Clubs and Arrowcraft in the sale of the crafts. Clubs send clippings of unusual pictures with their `mountain crafts.' Having become very craft conscious in this area (tourism attracts more people, however, unquestionably it is a craft area which is renowned) we can be proud of our specialty of Arrowcraft, the weaving. I have found no production weaving which surpasses that of the cottage industry of our Arrowcraft Shop. In 1945 there was a momentous decision made for Pi Beta Phi. Due to the efforts of many Pi Phis and Dean Harris of the University of Tennessee there was a craft workshop on the Settlement School campus. Doubtless, they said they would try it for a year. There was an enrollment of 52 students! Al-most one-third of our present capacity. The following year our present Workshop Director, Marian Heard, became co-director and has since served as director through twenty-one summers. Having worked with Marian fifteen of those summers I will say that it is due largely to her efforts through constant vigilance that our 1967 Workshop can boast of its high standards of both design and craftsmanship the top characteristic of our school. Each year I am amazed at the tremendous results of the students with varying backgrounds ranging from the professional designer-craftsman to the highly skilled amateur. Many of them, especially the beginner, surprise themselves. The various aspects of our workshop development have far-reaching results. There are several scholar-ships provided by Alumni Clubs (and deeply appreciated). Virginia Alpha Scholarship is presented annually to a Pi Phi. The Southern California Area Council has provided scholarships biennially for The busy Gatlinburg of today with some of the 153 motels and 6 hotels in the foreground. 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI several years. There have been several Rehabilitation and Study Grants given by states, also foreign students studying in various capacities. Our seven assistantships providing for one credit course are consid-, ered a scholarship with board and room and tuition. Outside sources sometimes provide for supplemental teaching salary. The Southern Highland Handicraft Guild has donated $100 toward a scholarship for 1967. Each year twenty-five or more states are represented among our personnel and one or more foreign countries. Even though we advertise nationally there has been much evidence of growth with the experiences passed on by our students. In 1955 and 1958 Marian Heard conducted a European Craft Tour sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee. Yes, interest is still shown in having another such tour perhaps in the United States. Several of our students and staff attended the first International Craft meeting in June 1965. Our roots are deep in the craft program. Crafts are not new. The cavepaintings 40,000 years ago tell a story of the beginning of crafts. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. In 1967 we find young and old, seeking a satisfaction in doing something with their hands because creative crafts: develop skill provide an outlet for self-expressionmay be a form of recreation increase sensitiveness as to surroundings and give dignity to common things frequently bring out unsuspected abilities furnish aesthetic satisfaction and are pathways to wonder and beauty that form a link between nature and art explain and help rationalize the machine (many designer-craftsmen are in demand in industry) bring the handicapped into better adjustment are a delight to the adventuresome This panoramic view of our Settlement School in this land of a great natural beauty and hope, and a cultural heritage of several generations is very, very brief. However, it does bring us to our Centennial year where again we must pause to look at the future a moment. We must look at the coming of the new! All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. The path ahead is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi, to surpass the accomplishments of our first hundred years accomplishments which would have been impossible without the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. Beacon in a Mountain Village by Mrs. Sue (Huff) Cox, Tennessee Gamma It has been with profound interest that I have watched the growth of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. From the very beginning this missionary project, always sparked with the enthusiasm on the part of many dedicated women, has been a beacon in this mountain village. It has truly proved the way, beginning in the pioneering days, toward making Gatlinburg the cultural center that it is proud to be today. Now that we have become an incorporated town with our thousands of seasonal visitors, Pi Beta Phi continues to strengthen and widen its efforts through its craft program which can be meaningful to people all over the world. As a former pupil and teacher of the school, and, for the past ten years an honorary member of Pi Beta Phi, I wish to express my deep appreciation to the many, many Pi Phis whom I have loved and have worked with in this Gatlinburg project which I certainly believe will continue for generations to come. Settlement School Committee 1962-1967 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE-seated from left Sally Wild Gordon, Wis. Alpha, Editor, "Little Pigeon News" (1962-67); Dorothy Coleman Thorman, Ill. Epsilon, Chairman (1963-67); and Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, Slides and Movie films (1964-67). Standing Sally Bosman Schneiter, Ind. Alpha, Treasurer (1962-67); and Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha, Secretary (1961-67). The first Settlement School was organized at the Alumnae Session of Convention held June 28th, 1910, at Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. The last Settlement School Committee will complete its business at the June Convention of 1967 to be held at the Edge-water Beach Hotel in Chicago, Illinois. Settlement School Committee has served the fraternity for 57 years. Many dedicated members of Pi Beta Phi have worked on the Committee and are responsible for making Settlement School the most outstanding philanthropic venture undertaken by a fraternity. The years 1962 to 1967 have been challenging and educational for the members of the final committee. It has been the responsibility of the commit-tee to carry on during what have been called the transitional years. In 1962-63, the question was "transitional to what ?" All the members of the committee and members of the Settlement School Staff felt strongly that Settlement School was too well established in the field of crafts to let the fraternity move away and abandon the program for something entirely different for a new philanthropic project. There was unanimous agreement in wanting to continue Summer Craft Workshop and Arrow-craft Shop. Marian Heard, Director of Summer Craft Workshop, could see the establishment of a great Art and Craft Center. This idea had been the dream of Jessie Harris, Vice-Dean of the College of Home Economics, University of Tennessee, when the first Summer Craft Workshop was organized in 1945. Here was the foundation for a new program of expansion. To inform the fraternity about the extensiveness of the current Settlement School programs, a 16 mm movie film was made, in color. This film showed Arrowcraft Shop and all activities related to it. The major part of the film was devoted to showing the work done in classes of Craft Workshop. The film was shown at the 1964 convention and has been widely circulated for three years among clubs and charters, with excellent reception. Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics of the University of Tennesseeand Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design, University of Tennessee were guests of the fraternity at the 1964 convention, as speakers at the Settlement School night program. Dean Odland spoke of the mutual interest in the further development of the summer Craft Workshop program by the Ad-ministration of the University of Tennessee. She ex-pressed its willingness to cooperate in every way possible to make it a success. She said, "it would seem that with an historical background of successful pioneering on the part of Pi Beta Phi in the area of craft development programs, there would be an ideal opportunity to provide continued leadership in the utilization of human resources, through judicious, sound, yet inspired programs." This association of a great State University and a fraternity is unique and inspiring. Pi Beta Phi met the challenge and voted to establish an Art and Craft Center on the Settlement School property in Gatlinburg, as the Centennial Project. With Settlement School established as the foundation of the Centennial Project, the committee made every effort to inform the fraternity of how strong this foundation was. All forms of communication were used to present the present day pro-grams. Little Pigeon News in the ARROW, featured articles on Craft Workshop. Students told of their experiences and how much it meant to be a student under outstanding craftsmen. The May L. Keller Award was given for the pro-grams that showed the progress of Settlement School program from one of providing education on the elementary school level to one of providing education on the college level. Pi Beta Phi severed all responsibility for educational and Health Center programs, they have been assumed by Sevier County and the City of Gatlin-burg. These programs included: Dormitory for boy and girls, Health Center and providing salaries fa] special teachers. Pi Beta Phi has shown its deef (Continued on page 18) 15 1963-1967 Settle ent School Art and Craft Center by Dorothy Coleman Thor an, Illinois Epsilon Chairman of Settlement School Committee 1963-67 The Fiftieth Anniversary of Settlement School, an altruistic project, and Memorial to the Founders of Pi Beta Phi, was celebrated in 1962. A complete history of Settlement School, through the convention of 1962, was published and distributed by the fraternity. The last sentence in the history was the following quotation: "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." The Settlement School Committee of 1963-1967 picked up the torch and continued to develop the Settlement School program towards a great future, the establishment of an Art and Craft Center. In 1964, Pi Beta Phi voted to establish an Art and Craft Center on the foundation of Settlement School, as the Centennial Project. The development of Settlement School as an Art and Craft Center goes as far back as 1914-15 when the first handcrafted articles were sold to Alumnae clubs to bring in a small income for the mountain people. The establishment of Arrowcraft Shop in 1926 was a big step forward. The beauty and appreciation of native crafts led to a demand which has been met by Pi Beta Phi Alumnx Clubs, through the distribution of hand weaving and crafts in almost every state in the United States through Arrowcraft Shop. The second step towards development of an Art and Craft Center was made with the opening of the first Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, in 1945. Under the Di-rectorship of Marian G. Heard, Tennessee Gamma, Professor of Craft Design, the Summer Craft Work-shop has become well established nationally and is a school of great renown. Since 1962 the Summer Craft Workshop program has been expanded and strengthened through the following: The construction of the Weaving Studio in 1962. The construction of the Ceramic Studio in 1966 (considered the best of its kind, today). The addition of a one week short session, offering. Concentrated instruction under outstanding craftsmen. Increase'd salaries, making it possible to have excellent faculties. Increased publicity in national magazines, in-creasing enrollment. The Centennial Project will continue to build on the present program so that it can be expanded into a year-round program. It is planned that there will be new and well equipped dormitories, new class-room facilities and a multi-purpose building. This expansion will offer a comfortable and inspiring environment in which students will create new ideas, learn new techniques and skills, and acquire information that can be used to help others help them-selves. Credit for the strong foundation upon which the Centennial Project will be established belongs to hundreds of people, over a long period of time, but those most recently responsible, who deserve recognition are: Dr. Holt, President of the University of Tennessee; Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics; Marian G. Heard, Tenn. Ga., Professor of Craft Design and Director of Summer Craft Workshop for 21 years; Marion W. Mueller, Ind. Ga., Director of Settlement School for 15 years; and Maria H. Tate, Fla. B., Manager of Arrowcraft Shop for 5 years. Mary Mintich, Belmont, N. C. art teacher and student at Craft workshop for many years, in an article in the Winter ARROW 1966, said, "The influence of Craft Workshop clearly extends beyond the range of those fortunate to study there. We, the students, are looking forward to its increased growth and development." The Centennial Project has now picked up the torch and will carry on to make the former Settlement School the greatest Art and Craft Center, and a wonderful Memorial to the Founders of PI BETA PHI DURING ITS SECOND CENTURY.

When We Were Young by Barbara Mills Dewell Wood, Iowa Gamma I was attending the Settlement School sale in the fall of 1966 with my daughter-in-law. As we wandered from room to room inspecting the beautiful hand made articles we came to a group of pictures of the school as it looks today. "My," I said, "how it has changed since I taught there." Sally Gordon, editor of "News From Little Pigeon," was standing near-by and asked when I had taught there. I fumbled in my mind for dates and said, "I was there twenty or twenty-five years ago, from 1924 to 1926," and then I gasped, "over forty years ago! Why, that makes me an old timer." I hastened to add that I was barely 19 years old and had had just two years at Iowa State College at Ames when I arrived at Gatlinburg for my first year as a teacher of Home Economics. "The cookin"n' sewin' teacher," the mountain people called me. Sally asked if I would reminisce a bit about the school in the earlier years, so if my sisters will bear with my memories, refreshed a bit by a very poorly kept diary, I will try to tell you about the school and two of the happiest years of my life. I arrived in Gatlinburg the end of July 1924, after a long trip by train from Missouri Valley, Iowa to Chicago; another train from Chicago to Cincinnati, another train from Cincinnati to Knoxville, Tennessee and then a little trolley from Knoxville to Sevierville. There I was met by a handsome young man, Jim Huff, who drove me in his Ford from Sevierville, over a winding, rocky road 200 feet or so above the Little Pigeon River to Gatlin-burg. My diary gives a list of all the people I met at the Teachers' cottage that first day, but I will mention only a few. Miss Evelyn Bishop, head resident, whom. I was to grow to love, as everyone who knew her did. Mrs. Dowell, who purchased all foodstuffs. Helen Chew, the teacher who was to open the "new branch division of the Settlement School" up the Sugarlands. Miss Phyllis Higginbothom, Nurse. Aunt Lizzie Reagan, Housekeeper, who asked me when I met her if I had ever heard of her, and when I said, "Yes," chuckled and patted me on the cheek so hard it felt like a slap. There were many others that first day, Mr. Mattel, agriculture teacher; Mr. Dentin Lean-der, farm manager, postman and general helper for all the teachers; Mary Ann, etc. My diary states, "The cottages have hot and cold running water, electric light (from the school's own plant). I will live in the girls' dormitory, I guess I'llbe the chaperone ! There will be other teachers in the other two cottages, one on each side of mine. The teachers and dormitory girls are to prepare our dinners every night." Jim Huff, who met me, is one of Andy Huff's children. Mr. and Mrs. Huff played an important part in persuading the school to go to Gatlinburg. Jim told me the story of the earliest years as he drove me to the school. He said when the Pi Phis finally chose Gatlinburg for their school, the Gatlin-burg people had guaranteed a certain number of pupils. The 'first day of school opened, there was one pupil less than they had promised, so Andy Huff carried his little four year old daughter, Mattie, to school every day so that the Pi Phi teachers would stay. It seems natural that one day Mattie would go to college (Iowa State at Ames) and become a Pi Phi herself. Jack Huff, Stella Huff and Jim were out of the Pi Phi School when I was there, but Mattie was in high school and Blanche was in 5th or 6th grade. Many happy times, and delicious meals, were enjoyed at the Huff's Hotel, The Mountain View. Shortly after I arrived a big room with a huge stone fireplace at one end was added, where the teachers often gathered to enjoy the warmth of the fire and the "tall tales" Jack and Jim were always telling us. I arrived earlier than most of the other teachers, as the Home Economics Department was just being organized. I had to make plans for my cooking laboratory, go into Knoxville and buy supplies, get material for the curtains at the windows and plan how my morning cooking classes could prepare every school day the lunch for all of the teachers. Besides that I had to plan for the cooking class I would have at the Sugarlands one afternoon each week. I would ride Lady, my horse, the six miles there. Then one afternoon a week I rode to Cartertown for a sewing class. That school had no desks, only benches and when the children wrote they sat on the floor and used their benches as desks. By the middle of August when the school opened, the other teachers had arrived. There was Margaret White, Harmo Taylor, Helen Barrett, Marian Folsom, Emily Burton, Gene Redding and Lois Rogers. In reading over my diary I find many references to our school truck, or station wagon. It was our only means, other than by foot or horse back, to go anywhere, and often nine or ten teachers would go, for a day, to some other community or into Knoxville for a taste of city living and a big dinner of meat at the Farragut Hotel. B.Y.P.U. (Baptist Young People Union) was a part of our life too. I remember when I applied for a position at the school, one of the questions I had 17 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI to answer was, "will you be willing to take part in church activities ?" We all did take part, every Sun-day evening in the little white Baptist Church house, so close to the school. The teachers often led the young peoples meetings. We played the organ and helped lead the singing. Sunday evening and church were an important part of our lives. The Barn was more than a barn. On Friday nights fast and rough basketball games were held in the loft and on Saturday nights "old movies" were shown. All the teachers, students, townspeople and summer people came to these. If you think TV shows old movies, you should have seen the "old movies" of 1925. But it was Social Life and fun. In September we had our Fair. My diary tells of the canned fruits and tomatoes and jelly my cooking classes exhibited and the sewing classes had note-books of samples of stitches and seams. The Fair was more than a school project, it was a community project. I was clerk at the Fair and note that we took our exhibit to the County Fair at Sevierville, where our school exhibit won 1st place, then on to the Knoxville Fair. We always went to the fairs of other communities and I was judge many times of canned goods, baked foods, butter, etc. Once I was even asked at the Pittman Fair to judge 1st and 2nd place of two old old hand woven coverlets. They were both perfectly beautiful and intricate. How could I judge? I finally gave the Blue Ribbon to the one I liked best and the Red Ribbon to the other. I remembered our laundress, Martha Clabo, with one crippled hand, who washed all of our clothes on a washboard, and boiled them outside in a big black kettle over a wood fire. She ironed them all too and we paid fifty cents a week, no matter how few or many pieces we had in the wash. Then there were the "Harp singin's." I went the first time expecting to see harps, but discovered it was so called because Mr. Harp wrote the song book. The notes are all different shapes, triangles, circles, squares, etc. Each shape tells whether it is for the soprano, bass, alto or tenor. How those mountain people could sing. The leader sounded his tuning fork and away they went. It really was beautiful. I wonder if harp singing has been forgotten, if so it is too bad to lose such an interesting art. I remember mounting "Lady" with my saddlebags full of new style patterns and riding off up Roarin' Fork, or Baskin's Creek, or once a week in the summer fifteen miles away to conduct adult classes in community the meadow City of Gatlinburg. as a public parking lot and for Chamber of Commerce building. Pi Beta Phi has deeded land to Sevier County, for the construction of a new elementary school building. The White School building built in 1914 and the Rock building built in 1928 by Pi Beta Phi havesewing. Really, most of the women sewed very well, but they were hungry for new style dresses and they loved the patterns I brought. Then there were our weekend trips, usually on foot, to Alum Cave over the mountain to North Carolina on foot to Elkmont. We climbed Mt. Le Conte with jack and Jim to guide us straight up the mountainside. There was no easy trail then, we just climbed up. the mountain, with Jack urging us on. When we would ask how much farther to the top, he'd say, "It's just around the corner." Teaching at Gatlinburg gave us an opportunity to meet many interesting wonderful people. Aunt Lydia lived in a little one room house up the mountainside. She kept her potatoes from freezing by putting them under the floor boards in front of her fireplace. When we went to see her we always wore skirts and a hat to cover our bobbed hair, for she would take us to task and quote from the Bible where "It is an abomination unto the Lord for a woman to put on the raiment of man or to be shorn of her hair." Mr. and Mrs. Hall were retired and lived in a lovely house overlooking Gatlinburg and the Little Pigeon River. They often invited us teachers to their home and served us delicacies we would never have otherwise. Mrs. Duffield, who had an adorable little house, would invite us up occasionally for waffles and sausages and a pleasant evening around her fire. Of course, when the Settlement School Commit-tee came, we loved it. Nita Hill Stark was Chairman then and Mr. Stark would drive us in his big car to Knoxville for a wonderful dinner. There were trips to the Sugarlands and a night in Helen Chew's little three room cabin, furnished entirely with handmade mountain furniture. Our life as teachers at the school was very simple, but fun and healthful. Some evenings we would all sing to Miss Evelyn's playing, or listen to her read some book aloud. We took on mountain ways and went to bed early. We got up early too. Some of us had looms in our rooms. I still have the first towel I ever wove. It has very uneven edges. Anyone who has been to the Smoky Mountain National Park knows of its beauty. It is good to know the lovely holly, balsam, laurel and rhododendron, galax leaves and bear moss are being saved. I like to think that the school, besides all of it's other accomplishments, was instrumental in bringing this beautiful area to the attention of the world. rooted interest in the selling 2.2 acres of House to the (Continued from page 1 S) of Gatlinburg by served their original purpose well and will be re-in front of Staff placed.

The Last Settlement School Committee of 1967 is proud to pass on this wonderful heritage to the Centennial Project Administration. It has been an exciting and rewarding experience for the last committee members to have served the fraternity and we say, "thank you." Her Dedication Leads to Canadian Bench Marjorie Montgomery Bowker, Alberta Alpha, Is First Woman to Hold Such an Office Dedicated interest in problems ranging from child welfare to penal institution conditions has led an Alberta Alpha Pi Phi, to the post and responsibility of Judge of the Juvenile and Family Courts for the Province of Alberta, Canada, the highest judicial post ever to be held by a woman in Canada. A Pi Phi sister, Ruth Bowen, Women's Editor of the Edmonton journal, is the one who points out that Judge Bowker's direction toward this high honor was involuntary. She wrote, "Her steps had no conscious direction toward a judge's chair . . . but Mrs. W. F. Bowker is one woman with the social conscience to have impelled her to make voluntary investigations into the problems of child welfare, juvenile delinquency, the state of prisons in Alberta." Judge Bowker's appointment came in June, 1966. Prior to her appointment Canada had known three woman magistrates, two appointed in 1916 and an-other appointed in 1964. Under a former judicial system, all magistrates had the powers of a juvenile Court Judge for the locality where they served. In 1952, a new structure of juvenile and Family Courts was established in the Province and Mrs. Bowker is the first woman to be appointed judge in this provincial court. She has said that she feels her experience in three areas has been useful to her in her new position. These are her study and research over a number of years in the field of juvenile delinquency and penal reform; her visitation, with official approval, of all correctional institutions in Alberta in 1963; her rather thorough study of the Child Welfare situation in Alberta, through membership on the Provincial Adoption Committee, which included visitation of all child-care and youth-serving facilities in the Province. (She was the only woman on this three-member committee). Her visitation to every jail and custodial institution in Alberta was at her own request in an effort to see first hand the conditions under which both women and juvenile delinquents lived in these institutions. Ruth Bowen wrote, "Her own research led her all over the province to consult with welfare workers in the field and to gain an education in human problems . . . she knocked on doors to see living conditions for herself . . . out of this grew another area of concern, the problems of the retarded. Her report on preventive health services is now being studied by the premier and minister of health." Mrs. Bowker graduated from the University of Alberta in Arts and Law, and was admitted to the bar Judge Marjorie Montgomery Bowker of Alberta in 1940. She met her husband, Wilbur F. Bowker, Dean of Law, University of Alberta, while both were practicing with an Edmonton law firm. She carried on her husband's practice with the firm while he was in active service during World War II. The Bowkers have three children, sons, Blair, 18 and Keith Wilbur, 14, and daughter, Lorna Ethel, 16. Across the years she has been active in Y.W.C.A. activities; has served as an executive member of two major social concern agencies in Edmonton; and is the first woman to be appointed to the University of Alberta Hospital Board. She is a member of the junior League and was to be one of the guest panelists at the Junior League of America's national convention in Montreal, May, 1967. Mrs. Bowker has been a loyal and active Pi Phi since her initiation in 1936. She was secretary of her chapter; she served two different terms as president of the Edmonton Alumnae Club. She was active in initiating the Canadian Project and served as its first Western Representative following its establishment. She was on the Alberta Alpha Alumnae Advisory Committee for six years. 19

        10 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI trans-mountain road. He used an architect in planning the new addition to his hotel, completed in 1931 long before the Park was dedicated. Mr. Huff was a man of vision. If the leaders of Gatlin-burg had listened to his advice, there would have been six lanes instead of only four lanes on the Parkway through Gatlinburg. With the increase in population the enrollment at the school kept growing. Instead of 4 teachers for the 8 elementary grades as in 1928, there are now 16 teachers. The high school became a four-year accredited school shortly after my oldest daughter started to school in 1936. We know how the County has gradually taken over more and more of the sup-port of the school in Gatlinburg as was the intent from the beginning of the Settlement School in 1912. As more income from the tourist trade came into the County, there has been more money to help support the schools. The teachers' salaries have in-creased from $50.00 per month plus room and board that I received in 1928 to over $300.00 per month paid by the County to most teachers. In 1963 the Gatlinburg and Pittman High Schools were moved into a new consolidated high school building located five miles out of Gatlinburg off Highway 73. This year the County is building fourteen new rooms for the elementary school with the help of the City of Gatlinburg. The old white building where I taught will be torn down. I have seen many fine Pi Phi Directors of our Settlement School come and go after Miss Evelyn re-signed in 1933: Miss Chaffee, Mrs. Weaver, Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, Miss Dyer, and finally our present capable director, Mrs. Marion Mueller, who has so ably directed the Settlement School since her arrival here in 1952. I wish I had space to list all the many Pi Phi teachers who have come through the years while I have been living here in Gatlinburg. Each has left her imprint on this community. Many children have been named after a teacher whom their parents had admired as a pupil. Two Pi Phis are living in Gatlinburg and are still teaching in the Gatlinburg schools Dorothy Douthat Manley (Mo. Gamma) and Sue Huff Cox (Tenn. Gamma) who was in that first class of 1912. I would also like to name all the wonderful Pi Phis who have served so unselfishly as members of the Settlement School Committee and whom I have had the privilege of getting to know. In living in Gatlinburg, I have been most fortunate to get to see Grand Council every other year when they meet here between Conventions, especially enjoying seeing my classmate in college, our Grand President, Alice Weber Johnson. There are some who would like to keep Gatlin-burg as it was in those early days. It was a happy time. There was none of the hustle and bustle of the present time. But I doubt that one can find a single individual, native to these mountains, who wouldwant to return to those days. What a contrast there is with their way of living and now. No longer do you find a one-room log cabin with no electricity and no inside plumbing. These people have taken advantage of every opportunity that has come their way. Today most everyone has a comfortable modern home. Nowhere can you find any lovelier homes than right here in Gatlin-burg. No longer do you find the women doing the hard work on a small farm plowing, hoeing corn, milkinb o besides all the housework (carrying water from the spring, washing the clothes outside in the old iron wash kettle, churning the milk) as in those early days. Most of them had large families and the children did help but the women became old looking before the age of 30. Weaving for Arrowcraft Shop helped the women in this respect for many families long before the coming of the tourist trade with jobs opening up in restaurants, gift shops and motels and still helps women. They can stay at home, make an income, and still care for their "young-uns." No longer does one see the women walking be-hind their husbands as they come into town (as I saw some of those still living back in the mountain in 1928). All husbands and wives walk side by side as equals. Most every family has an automobile and ride to town or wherever they desire to go. Many people have gained a wrong impression of what the mountain people are like from reading some of the popular comics. We know they are pictured as always being barefooted, with hair uncut or uncombed, wearing ragged clothes, etc. How untrue! When one of my daughters went to Pi Phi Convention in 1960, the girls couldn't believe any-one from Gatlinburg ever wore shoes. When I came to teach in 1928 the children did come to school barefooted in the hot months of August and September as was true at this time in many rural schools. Today the children all dress as the children in any other city school. Back in 1928 because of their isolation and because of their low income, the people did not dress in the newest styles of the day. However, many of the young people had gone off to college and were as well dressed as any other college girl or boy. Today you will find the citizens of Gatlinburg as well dressed as anyone anywhere in our U.S.A. Visit our churches any Sunday and you will find out for yourself. As Gatlinburg has grown in population, it has grown in the number of churches. In 1928 there was one Baptist church. Now there are ten churches: 3 Baptist, 1 Methodist, 1 Episcopal, 1 Catholic, 1 Lutheran, 1 Church of Christ, 1 Presbyterian and 1 Christian Scientist. I will say little about our Health work since this service is no longer needed. Gatlinburg now has a medical center with two fine doctors. There is also an osteopath in town and two dentists. But I must THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 11 say that the influence of our Jennie Nicol Health Center and the help it has meant to every family far and near over the years cannot be measured. The nurses through the years have meant happier, healthier lives for the people. With no doctor in Gatlin-burg in the first few years of my marriage (the first doctor came in 1935), I turned to the nurse for ad-vice many times. I have heard so many speak of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham, the first nurse, that I feel as though she were a long time friend. I finally met her in person on a recent visit here. Two former nurses have now retired and are living in Gatlinburg. Frances Moore, came to the Health Center in 1928, the same year I came to teach, and was school nurse for three years. While she was here she married O. J. Mattil, our Smith-Hughes Agriculture teacher from 1922 to 1929 at which time he started a woodworking shop and taught woodworking to the high school boys. He is now an officer in the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild of which Arrowcraft Shop is a member. The other nurse is Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta Delta Convention Initiate in 1958) who was the nurse here longer than any other nurse from 1935 to 1965 30 years in all. How she has come to be loved through the years by all of us and what a service she has performed cannot be measured! She is still active in civic projects and on the advisory board of the County Welfare Department. I would say the most exciting and most satisfying changes are those made in our Craft Program. My introduction to this Craft Program was on my second day in. Gatlinburg when Miss Evelyn asked me whether I would like to visit some of our weavers for Arrowcraft Shop. How thrilled I was to walk up Baskins Creek with Miss Onken, Grand President of Pi Beta Phi, Miss Mary Pollard, Miss Evelyn and Alice Williams (a new Pi Phi teacher, also) to see Izora Keener and her sister-in-law, Myrtle Conner. What beautiful articles they have woven through the years. Myrtle is still weaving and looks younger now than she did then. Although Izora has had to stop weaving due to age, I still see her in church almost every Sunday with her son and his family. We have read how Carolyn McKnight Hughes, Minnesota Alpha, revived the lost art of weaving and basket-making and how these articles were soldto Alumnae Clubs to bring in a small income for those people back in 1914 and 1915. And then how Miss Evelyn Bishop promoted this work, finally se-curing in 1925 Winogene Redding to assume full time charge of the weaving department (Gene held that position for 20 years. She walked miles upon miles through the cold winter months in those early years and later rode horseback to instruct the women at their looms. Much credit goes to Gene for her work with the mountain women. She designed some beautiful articles for Arrowcraft Shop through the years); how Arrowcraft Shop was started in 1926 in a room in Stuart Cottage by Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor (Pi Phis from Texas) and then moved to Teachers' Cottage and finally in 1927 to the original school building on. Baskens Creek and the road. I really went wild over the lovely articles on display in this shop and spent most of my salary for the beautiful linens and a coverlet. La Delle Allen (Pi Phi from Arkansas) was manager of the Arrowcraft Shop from 1927 to 1934. Mrs. Ethel Snow followed her and served for seven-teen years. Then came Marion Mueller (Indiana Gamma now director of School), Elizabeth Rue (Iowa Gamma now in charge of the branch shop in Mountain View Hotel), Nevada Christian (Nevada Alpha) and now Maria Tate (Florida Beta). All wonderful Pi Phis and each giving fine contribution to our Arrowcraft Shop. Now that our educational mission in this mountain community has been accomplished, we are now ready for our new philanthropy which has an even greater prospect for service to mankind the expansion of our Centennial Project the Arts and Crafts Center honoring our Founders anew. The Creative Arts are found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also as Alumnae Clubs we can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Senior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. To achieve this goal will take large amounts of money through the years. May each Pi Phi GIVE and GIVE and GIVE to our Centennial Fund. 4Settlement School Panorama 1945 1967 by Marion Webb Mueller, Indiana Gamma Director, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School The panoramic view of our Settlement School necessarily will be a mental picture of a series of images and events. Myriads of pictures and articles have been presented to our Alumna: Club members through the years. Yet, it seems most timely to pause for reflection in this, our Pi Beta Phi Centennial year. During this interim thousands of Pi Phis have been to our Settlement School, and those first visitors who came would wonder now at the many changes in the village during these two decades. Tourism attracted an estimated 6,466,000 persons in the adjoining Smoky Mountain National Park during the summer of 1966 as compared with 750,090 in 1945. An omen of spring is the local residents `checking up' on the new additions for the following tourist season. Each spring when I think the ultimate expansion has been made, I soon learn that more dreams are in the making. Gatlinburg adjoins the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and has an altitude of less than thirteen hundred feet while Mt. Le Conte which is visible and only a few miles distant by crow flight boasts the third highest altitude of the area over 6500 feet. As one drives a distance of approximately twelve miles to the Newfound Gap into North Carolina there is a kaleidoscopic scene of beauty and nature's wonder which is protected from commercial-ism by. the Park authorities. Gatlinburg at last count had 153 motels and 6 hotels, providing accommodations for over 13,000 tourists an unusual number for a town with a population of approximately 2300. Circa 1962 a nearby Ski Resort, a hospital and industrial attractions were added in the County, thus giving employment to several hundred people. Within the last twenty-five years the number of one-room schools has dwindled from twenty to one at present. From those entering school the percentage of high school graduates in 1962 was approximately thirty-five per cent. A determined effort to improve this record is being made by local and state authorities. Many new schools with innovations are being planned in eastern Tennessee. 014 Pi Beta Phi Settlement School which is located on Parkway in the heart of Gatlinburg has played an integral part in this development through the years. In so doing a development has taken place= at our school the development of a Craft Program. We must look at our topography to understand the development. In the background is an undeveloped wooded area. Twelve buildings are nestled together to form our Settlement School Campus. Approaching the school on Parkway one sees the Pi Beta Phi Craft Office (or administration building), next door across an expanse of lawn is Arrowcraft Shop. Back of Arrowcraft Shop is the Emma Harper Turner Building, presently used as a jewelry classroom. The old high school building further back on the campus houses four or five classrooms of our Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Workshop. Next to this building are three buildings used only by the County. At the left of our school lane is the Art and Craft Center, including the Evelyn Bishop Lounge, Loom House and Lolita Prouty Pottery Wing. Emily Helmick House, Pollard Dormitory (obsolete) and Stuart Cottage are on the lane leading to the popular Red Barn and Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House. At present these buildings are inadequate for our work-shops to expand. Even though our Pi Beta Phi and University of Tennessee Craft Workshop is well established and well-known there is competition with other craft schools with modern equipment, thus making our Centennial Craft Development Program most timely. Before we look to the future we must review some of the highlights of the last two decades. Having participated in three-fourths of that era, I can say that Pi Phis can justly be proud of the many accomplishments of this Memorial to our Founders. The discontinuance of the Dormitory Program in 1965 was with regret in many ways, yet with the aforesaid development of the area one can see why Pi Phi should look to other areas. However, it is a thrill to see the living evidence of our program evidence of helping in some way that not even a `thank you' may be given until years later. I recall two instances where unpaid accounts were paid in full after the student had been gone over five years. Many return for calls with their brides and the young mothers frequently come to introduce a babe in arms. Many of the boys return in uniform on leave. The most recent a handsome, tall youth whose name I could not recall was completing his service in Vietnam, but had signed up for another year. When I expressed my regret that we had to have this war, he said without hesitation "if you were there, you would understand." One of the girls we helped through the longest period is now in the Air Force. Christmas I received a lovely `crafty' looking card from her at Travis Air Force Base. Having lived at the dormitory since the seventh grade and having served as Kitchen-Aide several summers she knew crafts. In 1965 Pi Beta Phi discontinued the Health Service, having a registered nurse since 1920. Forty-five years of service! Here, too, chapters could be writ-ten, however, recognition has been given this project 12 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 13 in recent ARROWS. Another immeasureable service! The administration office now occupies that building on Parkway. In 1963 the Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlin-burg consolidated with Pittman Center High School five miles east. The elementary school still carries the name of Pi Beta Phi, although there are no teachers furnished by Pi Beta Phi beginning with 1966 fiscal school year. Plans for a new elementary building are completed by the County, also sufficient land to build traded with Pi Beta Phi. 1962 was an eventful year. ARROWS of that year carry details of the celebration of the fiftieth Anniversary of Settlement School. All Pi Phis should be thrilled to read of these events, however, there is one which is almost a `thrill of a lifetime' to me the Exhibit of Weaving from our Arrowcraft Shop and Workshop at the Smithsonian Institution. After much preparation to have this exhibit for one month I simply `burst with pride' when I saw this display. There was an additional honor after the display was dismantled, the Institution asked for seven pieces of the early weaving for their permanent collection (not for permanent exhibit). Pi Phi has thus received recognition for posterity. Our Grace Coolidge Collection of books is now housed at Staff House. All appropriate school books were given to the high school or the elementary school with the consolidation, however, books of the area, travel books, and craft books are in this Collection. A Jeanette Mitchell Minor Collection of Craft Books is being purchased for our craft classes. Several other memorial books have been given by others among them Mrs. Dorothy Lexau (daughter of Mrs. Ethel Trainer), and Mrs. Fred Van Aken in memory of her mother. Each building has memorials or gifts in honor of Pi Phis or some interested per-son. There are innumerable stories of these many, many gifts. We must keep faith with these generous donors of gifts by preserving them. The Red Barn was remodelled due to a bequest of a Pi Phi. Even though I had the privilege of helping with this project, ldid not realize (and I doubt if others who were working in this project realized) the scope of its popularity serving for youth groups for retreats, for our Pi Phi groups, and educational groups, as well as workshop students. The Red Barn has many tales to relate considering that it not only served as a barn in the literal sense, but also housed the first movies and basketball games in Gatlinburg. Arrowcraft Shop still serves as a multipurpose project giving an outlet to the many craftsmen who make these products and serving as a unifying contact with our Pi Beta Phi Clubs throughout the United States. There is a great economic benefit to the weavers and craftsmen because all the folks of the area do not wish to participate directly in tour-ism. There is inherent talent among many of the craftsmen which gives a certain satisfaction in making something with the hands. I trust there is mutual benefit with the Alumnre Clubs and Arrowcraft in the sale of the crafts. Clubs send clippings of unusual pictures with their `mountain crafts.' Having become very craft conscious in this area (tourism attracts more people, however, unquestionably it is a craft area which is renowned) we can be proud of our specialty of Arrowcraft, the weaving. I have found no production weaving which surpasses that of the cottage industry of our Arrowcraft Shop. In 1945 there was a momentous decision made for Pi Beta Phi. Due to the efforts of many Pi Phis and Dean Harris of the University of Tennessee there was a craft workshop on the Settlement School campus. Doubtless, they said they would try it for a year. There was an enrollment of 52 students! Al-most one-third of our present capacity. The following year our present Workshop Director, Marian Heard, became co-director and has since served as director through twenty-one summers. Having worked with Marian fifteen of those summers I will say that it is due largely to her efforts through constant vigilance that our 1967 Workshop can boast of its high standards of both design and craftsmanship the top characteristic of our school. Each year I am amazed at the tremendous results of the students with varying backgrounds ranging from the professional designer-craftsman to the highly skilled amateur. Many of them, especially the beginner, surprise themselves. The various aspects of our workshop development have far-reaching results. There are several scholar-ships provided by Alumni Clubs (and deeply appreciated). Virginia Alpha Scholarship is presented annually to a Pi Phi. The Southern California Area Council has provided scholarships biennially for The busy Gatlinburg of today with some of the 153 motels and 6 hotels in the foreground. 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI several years. There have been several Rehabilitation and Study Grants given by states, also foreign students studying in various capacities. Our seven assistantships providing for one credit course are consid-, ered a scholarship with board and room and tuition. Outside sources sometimes provide for supplemental teaching salary. The Southern Highland Handicraft Guild has donated $100 toward a scholarship for 1967. Each year twenty-five or more states are represented among our personnel and one or more foreign countries. Even though we advertise nationally there has been much evidence of growth with the experiences passed on by our students. In 1955 and 1958 Marian Heard conducted a European Craft Tour sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee. Yes, interest is still shown in having another such tour perhaps in the United States. Several of our students and staff attended the first International Craft meeting in June 1965. Our roots are deep in the craft program. Crafts are not new. The cavepaintings 40,000 years ago tell a story of the beginning of crafts. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. In 1967 we find young and old, seeking a satisfaction in doing something with their hands because creative crafts: develop skill provide an outlet for self-expressionmay be a form of recreation increase sensitiveness as to surroundings and give dignity to common things frequently bring out unsuspected abilities furnish aesthetic satisfaction and are pathways to wonder and beauty that form a link between nature and art explain and help rationalize the machine (many designer-craftsmen are in demand in industry) bring the handicapped into better adjustment are a delight to the adventuresome This panoramic view of our Settlement School in this land of a great natural beauty and hope, and a cultural heritage of several generations is very, very brief. However, it does bring us to our Centennial year where again we must pause to look at the future a moment. We must look at the coming of the new! All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. The path ahead is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi, to surpass the accomplishments of our first hundred years accomplishments which would have been impossible without the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. Beacon in a Mountain Village by Mrs. Sue (Huff) Cox, Tennessee Gamma It has been with profound interest that I have watched the growth of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. From the very beginning this missionary project, always sparked with the enthusiasm on the part of many dedicated women, has been a beacon in this mountain village. It has truly proved the way, beginning in the pioneering days, toward making Gatlinburg the cultural center that it is proud to be today. Now that we have become an incorporated town with our thousands of seasonal visitors, Pi Beta Phi continues to strengthen and widen its efforts through its craft program which can be meaningful to people all over the world. As a former pupil and teacher of the school, and, for the past ten years an honorary member of Pi Beta Phi, I wish to express my deep appreciation to the many, many Pi Phis whom I have loved and have worked with in this Gatlinburg project which I certainly believe will continue for generations to come. Settlement School Committee 1962-1967 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE-seated from left Sally Wild Gordon, Wis. Alpha, Editor, "Little Pigeon News" (1962-67); Dorothy Coleman Thorman, Ill. Epsilon, Chairman (1963-67); and Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, Slides and Movie films (1964-67). Standing Sally Bosman Schneiter, Ind. Alpha, Treasurer (1962-67); and Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha, Secretary (1961-67). The first Settlement School was organized at the Alumnae Session of Convention held June 28th, 1910, at Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. The last Settlement School Committee will complete its business at the June Convention of 1967 to be held at the Edge-water Beach Hotel in Chicago, Illinois. Settlement School Committee has served the fraternity for 57 years. Many dedicated members of Pi Beta Phi have worked on the Committee and are responsible for making Settlement School the most outstanding philanthropic venture undertaken by a fraternity. The years 1962 to 1967 have been challenging and educational for the members of the final committee. It has been the responsibility of the commit-tee to carry on during what have been called the transitional years. In 1962-63, the question was "transitional to what ?" All the members of the committee and members of the Settlement School Staff felt strongly that Settlement School was too well established in the field of crafts to let the fraternity move away and abandon the program for something entirely different for a new philanthropic project. There was unanimous agreement in wanting to continue Summer Craft Workshop and Arrow-craft Shop. Marian Heard, Director of Summer Craft Workshop, could see the establishment of a great Art and Craft Center. This idea had been the dream of Jessie Harris, Vice-Dean of the College of Home Economics, University of Tennessee, when the first Summer Craft Workshop was organized in 1945. Here was the foundation for a new program of expansion. To inform the fraternity about the extensiveness of the current Settlement School programs, a 16 mm movie film was made, in color. This film showed Arrowcraft Shop and all activities related to it. The major part of the film was devoted to showing the work done in classes of Craft Workshop. The film was shown at the 1964 convention and has been widely circulated for three years among clubs and charters, with excellent reception. Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics of the University of Tennesseeand Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design, University of Tennessee were guests of the fraternity at the 1964 convention, as speakers at the Settlement School night program. Dean Odland spoke of the mutual interest in the further development of the summer Craft Workshop program by the Ad-ministration of the University of Tennessee. She ex-pressed its willingness to cooperate in every way possible to make it a success. She said, "it would seem that with an historical background of successful pioneering on the part of Pi Beta Phi in the area of craft development programs, there would be an ideal opportunity to provide continued leadership in the utilization of human resources, through judicious, sound, yet inspired programs." This association of a great State University and a fraternity is unique and inspiring. Pi Beta Phi met the challenge and voted to establish an Art and Craft Center on the Settlement School property in Gatlinburg, as the Centennial Project. With Settlement School established as the foundation of the Centennial Project, the committee made every effort to inform the fraternity of how strong this foundation was. All forms of communication were used to present the present day pro-grams. Little Pigeon News in the ARROW, featured articles on Craft Workshop. Students told of their experiences and how much it meant to be a student under outstanding craftsmen. The May L. Keller Award was given for the pro-grams that showed the progress of Settlement School program from one of providing education on the elementary school level to one of providing education on the college level.

A complete history of Settlement School, through the convention of 1962, was published and distributed by the fraternity. The last sentence in the history was the following quotation: "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." The Settlement School Committee of 1963-1967 picked up the torch and continued to develop the Settlement School program towards a great future, the establishment of an Art and Craft Center. In 1964, Pi Beta Phi voted to establish an Art and Craft Center on the foundation of Settlement School, as the Centennial Project. The development of Settlement School as an Art and Craft Center goes as far back as 1914-15 when the first handcrafted articles were sold to Alumnae clubs to bring in a small income for the mountain people. The establishment of Arrowcraft Shop in 1926 was a big step forward. The beauty and appreciation of native crafts led to a demand which has been met by Pi Beta Phi Alumnx Clubs, through the distribution of hand weaving and crafts in almost every state in the United States through Arrowcraft Shop. The second step towards development of an Art and Craft Center was made with the opening of the first Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, in 1945. Under the Di-rectorship of Marian G. Heard, Tennessee Gamma, Professor of Craft Design, the Summer Craft Work-shop has become well established nationally and is a school of great renown. Since 1962 the Summer Craft Workshop program has been expanded and strengthened through the following: The construction of the Weaving Studio in 1962. The construction of the Ceramic Studio in 1966 (considered the best of its kind, today). The addition of a one week short session, offering. Concentrated instruction under outstanding craftsmen. Increase'd salaries, making it possible to have excellent faculties. Increased publicity in national magazines, in-creasing enrollment. The Centennial Project will continue to build on the present program so that it can be expanded into a year-round program. It is planned that there will be new and well equipped dormitories, new class-room facilities and a multi-purpose building. This expansion will offer a comfortable and inspiring environment in which students will create new ideas, learn new techniques and skills, and acquire information that can be used to help others help them-selves. Credit for the strong foundation upon which the Centennial Project will be established belongs to hundreds of people, over a long period of time, but those most recently responsible, who deserve recognition are: Dr. Holt, President of the University of Tennessee; Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics; Marian G. Heard, Tenn. Ga., Professor of Craft Design and Director of Summer Craft Workshop for 21 years; Marion W. Mueller, Ind. Ga., Director of Settlement School for 15 years; and Maria H. Tate, Fla. B., Manager of Arrowcraft Shop for 5 years. Mary Mintich, Belmont, N. C. art teacher and student at Craft workshop for many years, in an article in the Winter ARROW 1966, said, "The influence of Craft Workshop clearly extends beyond the range of those fortunate to study there. We, the students, are looking forward to its increased growth and development." The Centennial Project has now picked up the torch and will carry on to make the former Settlement School the greatest Art and Craft Center, and a wonderful Memorial to the Founders of PI BETA PHI DURING ITS SECOND CENTURY.

When We Were Young by Barbara Mills Dewell Wood, Iowa Gamma I was attending the Settlement School sale in the fall of 1966 with my daughter-in-law. As we wandered from room to room inspecting the beautiful hand made articles we came to a group of pictures of the school as it looks today. "My," I said, "how it has changed since I taught there." Sally Gordon, editor of "News From Little Pigeon," was standing near-by and asked when I had taught there. I fumbled in my mind for dates and said, "I was there twenty or twenty-five years ago, from 1924 to 1926," and then I gasped, "over forty years ago! Why, that makes me an old timer." I hastened to add that I was barely 19 years old and had had just two years at Iowa State College at Ames when I arrived at Gatlinburg for my first year as a teacher of Home Economics. "The cookin"n' sewin' teacher," the mountain people called me. Sally asked if I would reminisce a bit about the school in the earlier years, so if my sisters will bear with my memories, refreshed a bit by a very poorly kept diary, I will try to tell you about the school and two of the happiest years of my life. I arrived in Gatlinburg the end of July 1924, after a long trip by train from Missouri Valley, Iowa to Chicago; another train from Chicago to Cincinnati, another train from Cincinnati to Knoxville, Tennessee and then a little trolley from Knoxville to Sevierville. There I was met by a handsome young man, Jim Huff, who drove me in his Ford from Sevierville, over a winding, rocky road 200 feet or so above the Little Pigeon River to Gatlin-burg. My diary gives a list of all the people I met at the Teachers' cottage that first day, but I will mention only a few. Miss Evelyn Bishop, head resident, whom. I was to grow to love, as everyone who knew her did. Mrs. Dowell, who purchased all foodstuffs. Helen Chew, the teacher who was to open the "new branch division of the Settlement School" up the Sugarlands. Miss Phyllis Higginbothom, Nurse. Aunt Lizzie Reagan, Housekeeper, who asked me when I met her if I had ever heard of her, and when I said, "Yes," chuckled and patted me on the cheek so hard it felt like a slap. There were many others that first day, Mr. Mattel, agriculture teacher; Mr. Dentin Lean-der, farm manager, postman and general helper for all the teachers; Mary Ann, etc. My diary states, "The cottages have hot and cold running water, electric light (from the school's own plant). I will live in the girls' dormitory, I guess I'llbe the chaperone ! There will be other teachers in the other two cottages, one on each side of mine. The teachers and dormitory girls are to prepare our dinners every night." Jim Huff, who met me, is one of Andy Huff's children. Mr. and Mrs. Huff played an important part in persuading the school to go to Gatlinburg. Jim told me the story of the earliest years as he drove me to the school. He said when the Pi Phis finally chose Gatlinburg for their school, the Gatlin-burg people had guaranteed a certain number of pupils. The 'first day of school opened, there was one pupil less than they had promised, so Andy Huff carried his little four year old daughter, Mattie, to school every day so that the Pi Phi teachers would stay. It seems natural that one day Mattie would go to college (Iowa State at Ames) and become a Pi Phi herself. Jack Huff, Stella Huff and Jim were out of the Pi Phi School when I was there, but Mattie was in high school and Blanche was in 5th or 6th grade. Many happy times, and delicious meals, were enjoyed at the Huff's Hotel, The Mountain View. Shortly after I arrived a big room with a huge stone fireplace at one end was added, where the teachers often gathered to enjoy the warmth of the fire and the "tall tales" Jack and Jim were always telling us. I arrived earlier than most of the other teachers, as the Home Economics Department was just being organized. I had to make plans for my cooking laboratory, go into Knoxville and buy supplies, get material for the curtains at the windows and plan how my morning cooking classes could prepare every school day the lunch for all of the teachers. Besides that I had to plan for the cooking class I would have at the Sugarlands one afternoon each week. I would ride Lady, my horse, the six miles there. Then one afternoon a week I rode to Cartertown for a sewing class. That school had no desks, only benches and when the children wrote they sat on the floor and used their benches as desks. By the middle of August when the school opened, the other teachers had arrived. There was Margaret White, Harmo Taylor, Helen Barrett, Marian Folsom, Emily Burton, Gene Redding and Lois Rogers. In reading over my diary I find many references to our school truck, or station wagon. It was our only means, other than by foot or horse back, to go anywhere, and often nine or ten teachers would go, for a day, to some other community or into Knoxville for a taste of city living and a big dinner of meat at the Farragut Hotel. B.Y.P.U. (Baptist Young People Union) was a part of our life too. I remember when I applied for a position at the school, one of the questions I had 17 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI to answer was, "will you be willing to take part in church activities ?" We all did take part, every Sun-day evening in the little white Baptist Church house, so close to the school. The teachers often led the young peoples meetings. We played the organ and helped lead the singing. Sunday evening and church were an important part of our lives. The Barn was more than a barn. On Friday nights fast and rough basketball games were held in the loft and on Saturday nights "old movies" were shown. All the teachers, students, townspeople and summer people came to these. If you think TV shows old movies, you should have seen the "old movies" of 1925. But it was Social Life and fun. In September we had our Fair. My diary tells of the canned fruits and tomatoes and jelly my cooking classes exhibited and the sewing classes had note-books of samples of stitches and seams. The Fair was more than a school project, it was a community project. I was clerk at the Fair and note that we took our exhibit to the County Fair at Sevierville, where our school exhibit won 1st place, then on to the Knoxville Fair. We always went to the fairs of other communities and I was judge many times of canned goods, baked foods, butter, etc. Once I was even asked at the Pittman Fair to judge 1st and 2nd place of two old old hand woven coverlets. They were both perfectly beautiful and intricate. How could I judge? I finally gave the Blue Ribbon to the one I liked best and the Red Ribbon to the other. I remembered our laundress, Martha Clabo, with one crippled hand, who washed all of our clothes on a washboard, and boiled them outside in a big black kettle over a wood fire. She ironed them all too and we paid fifty cents a week, no matter how few or many pieces we had in the wash. Then there were the "Harp singin's." I went the first time expecting to see harps, but discovered it was so called because Mr. Harp wrote the song book. The notes are all different shapes, triangles, circles, squares, etc. Each shape tells whether it is for the soprano, bass, alto or tenor. How those mountain people could sing. The leader sounded his tuning fork and away they went. It really was beautiful. I wonder if harp singing has been forgotten, if so it is too bad to lose such an interesting art. I remember mounting "Lady" with my saddlebags full of new style patterns and riding off up Roarin' Fork, or Baskin's Creek, or once a week in the summer fifteen miles away to conduct adult classes in community the meadow City of Gatlinburg. as a public parking lot and for Chamber of Commerce building. Pi Beta Phi has deeded land to Sevier County, for the construction of a new elementary school building. The White School building built in 1914 and the Rock building built in 1928 by Pi Beta Phi havesewing. Really, most of the women sewed very well, but they were hungry for new style dresses and they loved the patterns I brought. Then there were our weekend trips, usually on foot, to Alum Cave over the mountain to North Carolina on foot to Elkmont. We climbed Mt. Le Conte with jack and Jim to guide us straight up the mountainside. There was no easy trail then, we just climbed up. the mountain, with Jack urging us on. When we would ask how much farther to the top, he'd say, "It's just around the corner." Teaching at Gatlinburg gave us an opportunity to meet many interesting wonderful people. Aunt Lydia lived in a little one room house up the mountainside. She kept her potatoes from freezing by putting them under the floor boards in front of her fireplace. When we went to see her we always wore skirts and a hat to cover our bobbed hair, for she would take us to task and quote from the Bible where "It is an abomination unto the Lord for a woman to put on the raiment of man or to be shorn of her hair." Mr. and Mrs. Hall were retired and lived in a lovely house overlooking Gatlinburg and the Little Pigeon River. They often invited us teachers to their home and served us delicacies we would never have otherwise. Mrs. Duffield, who had an adorable little house, would invite us up occasionally for waffles and sausages and a pleasant evening around her fire. Of course, when the Settlement School Commit-tee came, we loved it. Nita Hill Stark was Chairman then and Mr. Stark would drive us in his big car to Knoxville for a wonderful dinner. There were trips to the Sugarlands and a night in Helen Chew's little three room cabin, furnished entirely with handmade mountain furniture. Our life as teachers at the school was very simple, but fun and healthful. Some evenings we would all sing to Miss Evelyn's playing, or listen to her read some book aloud. We took on mountain ways and went to bed early. We got up early too. Some of us had looms in our rooms. I still have the first towel I ever wove. It has very uneven edges. Anyone who has been to the Smoky Mountain National Park knows of its beauty. It is good to know the lovely holly, balsam, laurel and rhododendron, galax leaves and bear moss are being saved. I like to think that the school, besides all of it's other accomplishments, was instrumental in bringing this beautiful area to the attention of the world. rooted interest in the selling 2.2 acres of House to the (Continued from page 1 S) of Gatlinburg by served their original purpose well and will be re-in front of Staff placed. This land is used The Centennial Project can be established on a the location of a strong foundation. The Last Settlement School Committee of 1967 is proud to pass on this wonderful heritage to the Centennial Project Administration. It has been an exciting and rewarding experience for the last committee members to have served the fraternity and we say, "thank you." Her Dedication Leads to Canadian Bench Marjorie Montgomery Bowker, Alberta Alpha, Is First Woman to Hold Such an Office Dedicated interest in problems ranging from child welfare to penal institution conditions has led an Alberta Alpha Pi Phi, to the post and responsibility of Judge of the Juvenile and Family Courts for the Province of Alberta, Canada, the highest judicial post ever to be held by a woman in Canada. A Pi Phi sister, Ruth Bowen, Women's Editor of the Edmonton journal, is the one who points out that Judge Bowker's direction toward this high honor was involuntary. She wrote, "Her steps had no conscious direction toward a judge's chair . . . but Mrs. W. F. Bowker is one woman with the social conscience to have impelled her to make voluntary investigations into the problems of child welfare, juvenile delinquency, the state of prisons in Alberta." Judge Bowker's appointment came in June, 1966. Prior to her appointment Canada had known three woman magistrates, two appointed in 1916 and an-other appointed in 1964. Under a former judicial system, all magistrates had the powers of a juvenile Court Judge for the locality where they served. In 1952, a new structure of juvenile and Family Courts was established in the Province and Mrs. Bowker is the first woman to be appointed judge in this provincial court. She has said that she feels her experience in three areas has been useful to her in her new position. These are her study and research over a number of years in the field of juvenile delinquency and penal reform; her visitation, with official approval, of all correctional institutions in Alberta in 1963; her rather thorough study of the Child Welfare situation in Alberta, through membership on the Provincial Adoption Committee, which included visitation of all child-care and youth-serving facilities in the Province. (She was the only woman on this three-member committee). Her visitation to every jail and custodial institution in Alberta was at her own request in an effort to see first hand the conditions under which both women and juvenile delinquents lived in these institutions. Ruth Bowen wrote, "Her own research led her all over the province to consult with welfare workers in the field and to gain an education in human problems . . . she knocked on doors to see living conditions for herself . . . out of this grew another area of concern, the problems of the retarded. Her report on preventive health services is now being studied by the premier and minister of health." Mrs. Bowker graduated from the University of Alberta in Arts and Law, and was admitted to the bar Judge Marjorie Montgomery Bowker of Alberta in 1940. She met her husband, Wilbur F. Bowker, Dean of Law, University of Alberta, while both were practicing with an Edmonton law firm. She carried on her husband's practice with the firm while he was in active service during World War II. The Bowkers have three children, sons, Blair, 18 and Keith Wilbur, 14, and daughter, Lorna Ethel, 16. Across the years she has been active in Y.W.C.A. activities; has served as an executive member of two major social concern agencies in Edmonton; and is the first woman to be appointed to the University of Alberta Hospital Board. She is a member of the junior League and was to be one of the guest panelists at the Junior League of America's national convention in Montreal, May, 1967. Mrs. Bowker has been a loyal and active Pi Phi since her initiation in 1936. She was secretary of her chapter; she served two different terms as president of the Edmonton Alumnae Club. She was active in initiating the Canadian Project and served as its first Western Representative following its establishment. She was on the Alberta Alpha Alumnae Advisory Committee for six years. 19

        Settlement School Panorama 1945 1967 by Marion Webb Mueller, Indiana Gamma Director, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School The panoramic view of our Settlement School necessarily will be a mental picture of a series of images and events. Myriads of pictures and articles have been presented to our Alumna: Club members through the years. Yet, it seems most timely to pause for reflection in this, our Pi Beta Phi Centennial year. During this interim thousands of Pi Phis have been to our Settlement School, and those first visitors who came would wonder now at the many changes in the village during these two decades. Tourism attracted an estimated 6,466,000 persons in the adjoining Smoky Mountain National Park during the summer of 1966 as compared with 750,090 in 1945. An omen of spring is the local residents `checking up' on the new additions for the following tourist season. Each spring when I think the ultimate expansion has been made, I soon learn that more dreams are in the making. Gatlinburg adjoins the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and has an altitude of less than thirteen hundred feet while Mt. Le Conte which is visible and only a few miles distant by crow flight boasts the third highest altitude of the area over 6500 feet. As one drives a distance of approximately twelve miles to the Newfound Gap into North Carolina there is a kaleidoscopic scene of beauty and nature's wonder which is protected from commercial-ism by. the Park authorities. Gatlinburg at last count had 153 motels and 6 hotels, providing accommodations for over 13,000 tourists an unusual number for a town with a population of approximately 2300. Circa 1962 a nearby Ski Resort, a hospital and industrial attractions were added in the County, thus giving employment to several hundred people. Within the last twenty-five years the number of one-room schools has dwindled from twenty to one at present. From those entering school the percentage of high school graduates in 1962 was approximately thirty-five per cent. A determined effort to improve this record is being made by local and state authorities. Many new schools with innovations are being planned in eastern Tennessee. 014 Pi Beta Phi Settlement School which is located on Parkway in the heart of Gatlinburg has played an integral part in this development through the years. In so doing a development has taken place= at our school the development of a Craft Program. We must look at our topography to understand the development. In the background is an undeveloped wooded area. Twelve buildings are nestled together to form our Settlement School Campus. Approaching the school on Parkway one sees the Pi Beta Phi Craft Office (or administration building), next door across an expanse of lawn is Arrowcraft Shop. Back of Arrowcraft Shop is the Emma Harper Turner Building, presently used as a jewelry classroom. The old high school building further back on the campus houses four or five classrooms of our Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Workshop. Next to this building are three buildings used only by the County. At the left of our school lane is the Art and Craft Center, including the Evelyn Bishop Lounge, Loom House and Lolita Prouty Pottery Wing. Emily Helmick House, Pollard Dormitory (obsolete) and Stuart Cottage are on the lane leading to the popular Red Barn and Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House. At present these buildings are inadequate for our work-shops to expand. Even though our Pi Beta Phi and University of Tennessee Craft Workshop is well established and well-known there is competition with other craft schools with modern equipment, thus making our Centennial Craft Development Program most timely. Before we look to the future we must review some of the highlights of the last two decades. Having participated in three-fourths of that era, I can say that Pi Phis can justly be proud of the many accomplishments of this Memorial to our Founders. The discontinuance of the Dormitory Program in 1965 was with regret in many ways, yet with the aforesaid development of the area one can see why Pi Phi should look to other areas. However, it is a thrill to see the living evidence of our program evidence of helping in some way that not even a `thank you' may be given until years later. I recall two instances where unpaid accounts were paid in full after the student had been gone over five years. Many return for calls with their brides and the young mothers frequently come to introduce a babe in arms. Many of the boys return in uniform on leave. The most recent a handsome, tall youth whose name I could not recall was completing his service in Vietnam, but had signed up for another year. When I expressed my regret that we had to have this war, he said without hesitation "if you were there, you would understand." One of the girls we helped through the longest period is now in the Air Force. Christmas I received a lovely `crafty' looking card from her at Travis Air Force Base. Having lived at the dormitory since the seventh grade and having served as Kitchen-Aide several summers she knew crafts. In 1965 Pi Beta Phi discontinued the Health Service, having a registered nurse since 1920. Forty-five years of service! Here, too, chapters could be writ-ten, however, recognition has been given this project 12 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 13 in recent ARROWS. Another immeasureable service! The administration office now occupies that building on Parkway. In 1963 the Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlin-burg consolidated with Pittman Center High School five miles east. The elementary school still carries the name of Pi Beta Phi, although there are no teachers furnished by Pi Beta Phi beginning with 1966 fiscal school year. Plans for a new elementary building are completed by the County, also sufficient land to build traded with Pi Beta Phi. 1962 was an eventful year. ARROWS of that year carry details of the celebration of the fiftieth Anniversary of Settlement School. All Pi Phis should be thrilled to read of these events, however, there is one which is almost a `thrill of a lifetime' to me the Exhibit of Weaving from our Arrowcraft Shop and Workshop at the Smithsonian Institution. After much preparation to have this exhibit for one month I simply `burst with pride' when I saw this display. There was an additional honor after the display was dismantled, the Institution asked for seven pieces of the early weaving for their permanent collection (not for permanent exhibit). Pi Phi has thus received recognition for posterity. Our Grace Coolidge Collection of books is now housed at Staff House. All appropriate school books were given to the high school or the elementary school with the consolidation, however, books of the area, travel books, and craft books are in this Collection. A Jeanette Mitchell Minor Collection of Craft Books is being purchased for our craft classes. Several other memorial books have been given by others among them Mrs. Dorothy Lexau (daughter of Mrs. Ethel Trainer), and Mrs. Fred Van Aken in memory of her mother. Each building has memorials or gifts in honor of Pi Phis or some interested per-son. There are innumerable stories of these many, many gifts. We must keep faith with these generous donors of gifts by preserving them. The Red Barn was remodelled due to a bequest of a Pi Phi. Even though I had the privilege of helping with this project, ldid not realize (and I doubt if others who were working in this project realized) the scope of its popularity serving for youth groups for retreats, for our Pi Phi groups, and educational groups, as well as workshop students. The Red Barn has many tales to relate considering that it not only served as a barn in the literal sense, but also housed the first movies and basketball games in Gatlinburg. Arrowcraft Shop still serves as a multipurpose project giving an outlet to the many craftsmen who make these products and serving as a unifying contact with our Pi Beta Phi Clubs throughout the United States. There is a great economic benefit to the weavers and craftsmen because all the folks of the area do not wish to participate directly in tour-ism. There is inherent talent among many of the craftsmen which gives a certain satisfaction in making something with the hands. I trust there is mutual benefit with the Alumnre Clubs and Arrowcraft in the sale of the crafts. Clubs send clippings of unusual pictures with their `mountain crafts.' Having become very craft conscious in this area (tourism attracts more people, however, unquestionably it is a craft area which is renowned) we can be proud of our specialty of Arrowcraft, the weaving. I have found no production weaving which surpasses that of the cottage industry of our Arrowcraft Shop. In 1945 there was a momentous decision made for Pi Beta Phi. Due to the efforts of many Pi Phis and Dean Harris of the University of Tennessee there was a craft workshop on the Settlement School campus. Doubtless, they said they would try it for a year. There was an enrollment of 52 students! Al-most one-third of our present capacity. The following year our present Workshop Director, Marian Heard, became co-director and has since served as director through twenty-one summers. Having worked with Marian fifteen of those summers I will say that it is due largely to her efforts through constant vigilance that our 1967 Workshop can boast of its high standards of both design and craftsmanship the top characteristic of our school. Each year I am amazed at the tremendous results of the students with varying backgrounds ranging from the professional designer-craftsman to the highly skilled amateur. Many of them, especially the beginner, surprise themselves. The various aspects of our workshop development have far-reaching results. There are several scholar-ships provided by Alumni Clubs (and deeply appreciated). Virginia Alpha Scholarship is presented annually to a Pi Phi. The Southern California Area Council has provided scholarships biennially for The busy Gatlinburg of today with some of the 153 motels and 6 hotels in the foreground. 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI several years. There have been several Rehabilitation and Study Grants given by states, also foreign students studying in various capacities. Our seven assistantships providing for one credit course are consid-, ered a scholarship with board and room and tuition. Outside sources sometimes provide for supplemental teaching salary. The Southern Highland Handicraft Guild has donated $100 toward a scholarship for 1967. Each year twenty-five or more states are represented among our personnel and one or more foreign countries. Even though we advertise nationally there has been much evidence of growth with the experiences passed on by our students. In 1955 and 1958 Marian Heard conducted a European Craft Tour sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee. Yes, interest is still shown in having another such tour perhaps in the United States. Several of our students and staff attended the first International Craft meeting in June 1965. Our roots are deep in the craft program. Crafts are not new. The cavepaintings 40,000 years ago tell a story of the beginning of crafts. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. In 1967 we find young and old, seeking a satisfaction in doing something with their hands because creative crafts: develop skill provide an outlet for self-expressionmay be a form of recreation increase sensitiveness as to surroundings and give dignity to common things frequently bring out unsuspected abilities furnish aesthetic satisfaction and are pathways to wonder and beauty that form a link between nature and art explain and help rationalize the machine (many designer-craftsmen are in demand in industry) bring the handicapped into better adjustment are a delight to the adventuresome This panoramic view of our Settlement School in this land of a great natural beauty and hope, and a cultural heritage of several generations is very, very brief. However, it does bring us to our Centennial year where again we must pause to look at the future a moment. We must look at the coming of the new! All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. The path ahead is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi, to surpass the accomplishments of our first hundred years accomplishments which would have been impossible without the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. Beacon in a Mountain Village by Mrs. Sue (Huff) Cox, Tennessee Gamma It has been with profound interest that I have watched the growth of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. From the very beginning this missionary project, always sparked with the enthusiasm on the part of many dedicated women, has been a beacon in this mountain village. It has truly proved the way, beginning in the pioneering days, toward making Gatlinburg the cultural center that it is proud to be today. Now that we have become an incorporated town with our thousands of seasonal visitors, Pi Beta Phi continues to strengthen and widen its efforts through its craft program which can be meaningful to people all over the world. As a former pupil and teacher of the school, and, for the past ten years an honorary member of Pi Beta Phi, I wish to express my deep appreciation to the many, many Pi Phis whom I have loved and have worked with in this Gatlinburg project which I certainly believe will continue for generations to come. Settlement School Committee 1962-1967 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE-seated from left Sally Wild Gordon, Wis. Alpha, Editor, "Little Pigeon News" (1962-67); Dorothy Coleman Thorman, Ill. Epsilon, Chairman (1963-67); and Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, Slides and Movie films (1964-67). Standing Sally Bosman Schneiter, Ind. Alpha, Treasurer (1962-67); and Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha, Secretary (1961-67). The first Settlement School was organized at the Alumnae Session of Convention held June 28th, 1910, at Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. The last Settlement School Committee will complete its business at the June Convention of 1967 to be held at the Edge-water Beach Hotel in Chicago, Illinois. Settlement School Committee has served the fraternity for 57 years. Many dedicated members of Pi Beta Phi have worked on the Committee and are responsible for making Settlement School the most outstanding philanthropic venture undertaken by a fraternity. The years 1962 to 1967 have been challenging and educational for the members of the final committee. It has been the responsibility of the commit-tee to carry on during what have been called the transitional years. In 1962-63, the question was "transitional to what ?" All the members of the committee and members of the Settlement School Staff felt strongly that Settlement School was too well established in the field of crafts to let the fraternity move away and abandon the program for something entirely different for a new philanthropic project. There was unanimous agreement in wanting to continue Summer Craft Workshop and Arrow-craft Shop. Marian Heard, Director of Summer Craft Workshop, could see the establishment of a great Art and Craft Center. This idea had been the dream of Jessie Harris, Vice-Dean of the College of Home Economics, University of Tennessee, when the first Summer Craft Workshop was organized in 1945. Here was the foundation for a new program of expansion. To inform the fraternity about the extensiveness of the current Settlement School programs, a 16 mm movie film was made, in color. This film showed Arrowcraft Shop and all activities related to it. The major part of the film was devoted to showing the work done in classes of Craft Workshop. The film was shown at the 1964 convention and has been widely circulated for three years among clubs and charters, with excellent reception. Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics of the University of Tennesseeand Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design, University of Tennessee were guests of the fraternity at the 1964 convention, as speakers at the Settlement School night program. Dean Odland spoke of the mutual interest in the further development of the summer Craft Workshop program by the Ad-ministration of the University of Tennessee. She ex-pressed its willingness to cooperate in every way possible to make it a success.

A complete history of Settlement School, through the convention of 1962, was published and distributed by the fraternity. The last sentence in the history was the following quotation: "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." The Settlement School Committee of 1963-1967 picked up the torch and continued to develop the Settlement School program towards a great future, the establishment of an Art and Craft Center. In 1964, Pi Beta Phi voted to establish an Art and Craft Center on the foundation of Settlement School, as the Centennial Project. The development of Settlement School as an Art and Craft Center goes as far back as 1914-15 when the first handcrafted articles were sold to Alumnae clubs to bring in a small income for the mountain people. The establishment of Arrowcraft Shop in 1926 was a big step forward. The beauty and appreciation of native crafts led to a demand which has been met by Pi Beta Phi Alumnx Clubs, through the distribution of hand weaving and crafts in almost every state in the United States through Arrowcraft Shop. The second step towards development of an Art and Craft Center was made with the opening of the first Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, in 1945. Under the Di-rectorship of Marian G. Heard, Tennessee Gamma, Professor of Craft Design, the Summer Craft Work-shop has become well established nationally and is a school of great renown. Since 1962 the Summer Craft Workshop program has been expanded and strengthened through the following: The construction of the Weaving Studio in 1962. The construction of the Ceramic Studio in 1966 (considered the best of its kind, today). The addition of a one week short session, offering. Concentrated instruction under outstanding craftsmen. Increase'd salaries, making it possible to have excellent faculties. Increased publicity in national magazines, in-creasing enrollment. The Centennial Project will continue to build on the present program so that it can be expanded into a year-round program. It is planned that there will be new and well equipped dormitories, new class-room facilities and a multi-purpose building. This expansion will offer a comfortable and inspiring environment in which students will create new ideas, learn new techniques and skills, and acquire information that can be used to help others help them-selves. Credit for the strong foundation upon which the Centennial Project will be established belongs to hundreds of people, over a long period of time, but those most recently responsible, who deserve recognition are: Dr. Holt, President of the University of Tennessee; Dr. Lura M.

When We Were Young by Barbara Mills Dewell Wood, Iowa Gamma I was attending the Settlement School sale in the fall of 1966 with my daughter-in-law. As we wandered from room to room inspecting the beautiful hand made articles we came to a group of pictures of the school as it looks today. "My," I said, "how it has changed since I taught there." Sally Gordon, editor of "News From Little Pigeon," was standing near-by and asked when I had taught there. I fumbled in my mind for dates and said, "I was there twenty or twenty-five years ago, from 1924 to 1926," and then I gasped, "over forty years ago! Why, that makes me an old timer." I hastened to add that I was barely 19 years old and had had just two years at Iowa State College at Ames when I arrived at Gatlinburg for my first year as a teacher of Home Economics. "The cookin"n' sewin' teacher," the mountain people called me. Sally asked if I would reminisce a bit about the school in the earlier years, so if my sisters will bear with my memories, refreshed a bit by a very poorly kept diary, I will try to tell you about the school and two of the happiest years of my life. I arrived in Gatlinburg the end of July 1924, after a long trip by train from Missouri Valley, Iowa to Chicago; another train from Chicago to Cincinnati, another train from Cincinnati to Knoxville, Tennessee and then a little trolley from Knoxville to Sevierville. There I was met by a handsome young man, Jim Huff, who drove me in his Ford from Sevierville, over a winding, rocky road 200 feet or so above the Little Pigeon River to Gatlin-burg. My diary gives a list of all the people I met at the Teachers' cottage that first day, but I will mention only a few. Miss Evelyn Bishop, head resident, whom. I was to grow to love, as everyone who knew her did. Mrs. Dowell, who purchased all foodstuffs. Helen Chew, the teacher who was to open the "new branch division of the Settlement School" up the Sugarlands. Miss Phyllis Higginbothom, Nurse. Aunt Lizzie Reagan, Housekeeper, who asked me when I met her if I had ever heard of her, and when I said, "Yes," chuckled and patted me on the cheek so hard it felt like a slap. There were many others that first day, Mr. Mattel, agriculture teacher; Mr. Dentin Lean-der, farm manager, postman and general helper for all the teachers; Mary Ann, etc. My diary states, "The cottages have hot and cold running water, electric light (from the school's own plant). I will live in the girls' dormitory, I guess I'llbe the chaperone ! There will be other teachers in the other two cottages, one on each side of mine. The teachers and dormitory girls are to prepare our dinners every night." Jim Huff, who met me, is one of Andy Huff's children. Mr. and Mrs. Huff played an important part in persuading the school to go to Gatlinburg. Jim told me the story of the earliest years as he drove me to the school. He said when the Pi Phis finally chose Gatlinburg for their school, the Gatlin-burg people had guaranteed a certain number of pupils. The 'first day of school opened, there was one pupil less than they had promised, so Andy Huff carried his little four year old daughter, Mattie, to school every day so that the Pi Phi teachers would stay. It seems natural that one day Mattie would go to college (Iowa State at Ames) and become a Pi Phi herself. Jack Huff, Stella Huff and Jim were out of the Pi Phi School when I was there, but Mattie was in high school and Blanche was in 5th or 6th grade. Many happy times, and delicious meals, were enjoyed at the Huff's Hotel, The Mountain View. Shortly after I arrived a big room with a huge stone fireplace at one end was added, where the teachers often gathered to enjoy the warmth of the fire and the "tall tales" Jack and Jim were always telling us. I arrived earlier than most of the other teachers, as the Home Economics Department was just being organized. I had to make plans for my cooking laboratory, go into Knoxville and buy supplies, get material for the curtains at the windows and plan how my morning cooking classes could prepare every school day the lunch for all of the teachers. Besides that I had to plan for the cooking class I would have at the Sugarlands one afternoon each week. I would ride Lady, my horse, the six miles there. Then one afternoon a week I rode to Cartertown for a sewing class. That school had no desks, only benches and when the children wrote they sat on the floor and used their benches as desks. By the middle of August when the school opened, the other teachers had arrived. There was Margaret White, Harmo Taylor, Helen Barrett, Marian Folsom, Emily Burton, Gene Redding and Lois Rogers. In reading over my diary I find many references to our school truck, or station wagon. It was our only means, other than by foot or horse back, to go anywhere, and often nine or ten teachers would go, for a day, to some other community or into Knoxville for a taste of city living and a big dinner of meat at the Farragut Hotel. B.Y.P.U. (Baptist Young People Union) was a part of our life too. I remember when I applied for a position at the school, one of the questions I had 17 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI to answer was, "will you be willing to take part in church activities ?" We all did take part, every Sun-day evening in the little white Baptist Church house, so close to the school. The teachers often led the young peoples meetings. We played the organ and helped lead the singing. Sunday evening and church were an important part of our lives. The Barn was more than a barn. On Friday nights fast and rough basketball games were held in the loft and on Saturday nights "old movies" were shown. All the teachers, students, townspeople and summer people came to these. If you think TV shows old movies, you should have seen the "old movies" of 1925. But it was Social Life and fun. In September we had our Fair. My diary tells of the canned fruits and tomatoes and jelly my cooking classes exhibited and the sewing classes had note-books of samples of stitches and seams. The Fair was more than a school project, it was a community project. I was clerk at the Fair and note that we took our exhibit to the County Fair at Sevierville, where our school exhibit won 1st place, then on to the Knoxville Fair. We always went to the fairs of other communities and I was judge many times of canned goods, baked foods, butter, etc. Once I was even asked at the Pittman Fair to judge 1st and 2nd place of two old old hand woven coverlets. They were both perfectly beautiful and intricate. How could I judge? I finally gave the Blue Ribbon to the one I liked best and the Red Ribbon to the other. I remembered our laundress, Martha Clabo, with one crippled hand, who washed all of our clothes on a washboard, and boiled them outside in a big black kettle over a wood fire. She ironed them all too and we paid fifty cents a week, no matter how few or many pieces we had in the wash. Then there were the "Harp singin's." I went the first time expecting to see harps, but discovered it was so called because Mr. Harp wrote the song book. The notes are all different shapes, triangles, circles, squares, etc. Each shape tells whether it is for the soprano, bass, alto or tenor. How those mountain people could sing. The leader sounded his tuning fork and away they went. It really was beautiful. I wonder if harp singing has been forgotten, if so it is too bad to lose such an interesting art. I remember mounting "Lady" with my saddlebags full of new style patterns and riding off up Roarin' Fork, or Baskin's Creek, or once a week in the summer fifteen miles away to conduct adult classes in community the meadow City of Gatlinburg. as a public parking lot and for Chamber of Commerce building. Pi Beta Phi has deeded land to Sevier County, for the construction of a new elementary school building. The White School building built in 1914 and the Rock building built in 1928 by Pi Beta Phi havesewing. Really, most of the women sewed very well, but they were hungry for new style dresses and they loved the patterns I brought. Then there were our weekend trips, usually on foot, to Alum Cave over the mountain to North Carolina on foot to Elkmont. We climbed Mt. Le Conte with jack and Jim to guide us straight up the mountainside. There was no easy trail then, we just climbed up. the mountain, with Jack urging us on. When we would ask how much farther to the top, he'd say, "It's just around the corner." Teaching at Gatlinburg gave us an opportunity to meet many interesting wonderful people. Aunt Lydia lived in a little one room house up the mountainside. She kept her potatoes from freezing by putting them under the floor boards in front of her fireplace. When we went to see her we always wore skirts and a hat to cover our bobbed hair, for she would take us to task and quote from the Bible where "It is an abomination unto the Lord for a woman to put on the raiment of man or to be shorn of her hair." Mr. and Mrs. Hall were retired and lived in a lovely house overlooking Gatlinburg and the Little Pigeon River. They often invited us teachers to their home and served us delicacies we would never have otherwise. Mrs. Duffield, who had an adorable little house, would invite us up occasionally for waffles and sausages and a pleasant evening around her fire. Of course, when the Settlement School Commit-tee came, we loved it. Nita Hill Stark was Chairman then and Mr. Stark would drive us in his big car to Knoxville for a wonderful dinner. There were trips to the Sugarlands and a night in Helen Chew's little three room cabin, furnished entirely with handmade mountain furniture. Our life as teachers at the school was very simple, but fun and healthful. Some evenings we would all sing to Miss Evelyn's playing, or listen to her read some book aloud. We took on mountain ways and went to bed early. We got up early too. Some of us had looms in our rooms. I still have the first towel I ever wove. It has very uneven edges. Anyone who has been to the Smoky Mountain National Park knows of its beauty. It is good to know the lovely holly, balsam, laurel and rhododendron, galax leaves and bear moss are being saved. I like to think that the school, besides all of it's other accomplishments, was instrumental in bringing this beautiful area to the attention of the world. rooted interest in the selling 2.2 acres of House to the (Continued from page 1 S) of Gatlinburg by served their original purpose well and will be re-in front of Staff placed.

Her Dedication Leads to Canadian Bench Marjorie Montgomery Bowker, Alberta Alpha, Is First Woman to Hold Such an Office Dedicated interest in problems ranging from child welfare to penal institution conditions has led an Alberta Alpha Pi Phi, to the post and responsibility of Judge of the Juvenile and Family Courts for the Province of Alberta, Canada, the highest judicial post ever to be held by a woman in Canada. A Pi Phi sister, Ruth Bowen, Women's Editor of the Edmonton journal, is the one who points out that Judge Bowker's direction toward this high honor was involuntary. She wrote, "Her steps had no conscious direction toward a judge's chair . . . but Mrs. W. F. Bowker is one woman with the social conscience to have impelled her to make voluntary investigations into the problems of child welfare, juvenile delinquency, the state of prisons in Alberta." Judge Bowker's appointment came in June, 1966. Prior to her appointment Canada had known three woman magistrates, two appointed in 1916 and an-other appointed in 1964. Under a former judicial system, all magistrates had the powers of a juvenile Court Judge for the locality where they served. In 1952, a new structure of juvenile and Family Courts was established in the Province and Mrs. Bowker is the first woman to be appointed judge in this provincial court. She has said that she feels her experience in three areas has been useful to her in her new position. These are her study and research over a number of years in the field of juvenile delinquency and penal reform; her visitation, with official approval, of all correctional institutions in Alberta in 1963; her rather thorough study of the Child Welfare situation in Alberta, through membership on the Provincial Adoption Committee, which included visitation of all child-care and youth-serving facilities in the Province. (She was the only woman on this three-member committee). Her visitation to every jail and custodial institution in Alberta was at her own request in an effort to see first hand the conditions under which both women and juvenile delinquents lived in these institutions. Ruth Bowen wrote, "Her own research led her all over the province to consult with welfare workers in the field and to gain an education in human problems . . . she knocked on doors to see living conditions for herself . . . out of this grew another area of concern, the problems of the retarded. Her report on preventive health services is now being studied by the premier and minister of health." Mrs. Bowker graduated from the University of Alberta in Arts and Law, and was admitted to the bar Judge Marjorie Montgomery Bowker of Alberta in 1940. She met her husband, Wilbur F. Bowker, Dean of Law, University of Alberta, while both were practicing with an Edmonton law firm. She carried on her husband's practice with the firm while he was in active service during World War II. The Bowkers have three children, sons, Blair, 18 and Keith Wilbur, 14, and daughter, Lorna Ethel, 16. Across the years she has been active in Y.W.C.A. activities; has served as an executive member of two major social concern agencies in Edmonton; and is the first woman to be appointed to the University of Alberta Hospital Board. She is a member of the junior League and was to be one of the guest panelists at the Junior League of America's national convention in Montreal, May, 1967. Mrs. Bowker has been a loyal and active Pi Phi since her initiation in 1936. She was secretary of her chapter; she served two different terms as president of the Edmonton Alumnae Club. She was active in initiating the Canadian Project and served as its first Western Representative following its establishment. She was on the Alberta Alpha Alumnae Advisory Committee for six years. 19

        14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI several years. There have been several Rehabilitation and Study Grants given by states, also foreign students studying in various capacities. Our seven assistantships providing for one credit course are consid-, ered a scholarship with board and room and tuition. Outside sources sometimes provide for supplemental teaching salary. The Southern Highland Handicraft Guild has donated $100 toward a scholarship for 1967. Each year twenty-five or more states are represented among our personnel and one or more foreign countries. Even though we advertise nationally there has been much evidence of growth with the experiences passed on by our students. In 1955 and 1958 Marian Heard conducted a European Craft Tour sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee. Yes, interest is still shown in having another such tour perhaps in the United States. Several of our students and staff attended the first International Craft meeting in June 1965. Our roots are deep in the craft program. Crafts are not new. The cavepaintings 40,000 years ago tell a story of the beginning of crafts. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. In 1967 we find young and old, seeking a satisfaction in doing something with their hands because creative crafts: develop skill provide an outlet for self-expressionmay be a form of recreation increase sensitiveness as to surroundings and give dignity to common things frequently bring out unsuspected abilities furnish aesthetic satisfaction and are pathways to wonder and beauty that form a link between nature and art explain and help rationalize the machine (many designer-craftsmen are in demand in industry) bring the handicapped into better adjustment are a delight to the adventuresome This panoramic view of our Settlement School in this land of a great natural beauty and hope, and a cultural heritage of several generations is very, very brief. However, it does bring us to our Centennial year where again we must pause to look at the future a moment. We must look at the coming of the new! All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. The path ahead is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi, to surpass the accomplishments of our first hundred years accomplishments which would have been impossible without the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. Beacon in a Mountain Village by Mrs. Sue (Huff) Cox, Tennessee Gamma It has been with profound interest that I have watched the growth of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. From the very beginning this missionary project, always sparked with the enthusiasm on the part of many dedicated women, has been a beacon in this mountain village. It has truly proved the way, beginning in the pioneering days, toward making Gatlinburg the cultural center that it is proud to be today. Now that we have become an incorporated town with our thousands of seasonal visitors, Pi Beta Phi continues to strengthen and widen its efforts through its craft program which can be meaningful to people all over the world. As a former pupil and teacher of the school, and, for the past ten years an honorary member of Pi Beta Phi, I wish to express my deep appreciation to the many, many Pi Phis whom I have loved and have worked with in this Gatlinburg project which I certainly believe will continue for generations to come. Settlement School Committee 1962-1967 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE-seated from left Sally Wild Gordon, Wis. Alpha, Editor, "Little Pigeon News" (1962-67); Dorothy Coleman Thorman, Ill.

Alpha, Treasurer (1962-67); and Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha, Secretary (1961-67). The first Settlement School was organized at the Alumnae Session of Convention held June 28th, 1910, at Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. The last Settlement School Committee will complete its business at the June Convention of 1967 to be held at the Edge-water Beach Hotel in Chicago, Illinois. Settlement School Committee has served the fraternity for 57 years. Many dedicated members of Pi Beta Phi have worked on the Committee and are responsible for making Settlement School the most outstanding philanthropic venture undertaken by a fraternity. The years 1962 to 1967 have been challenging and educational for the members of the final committee. It has been the responsibility of the commit-tee to carry on during what have been called the transitional years. In 1962-63, the question was "transitional to what ?" All the members of the committee and members of the Settlement School Staff felt strongly that Settlement School was too well established in the field of crafts to let the fraternity move away and abandon the program for something entirely different for a new philanthropic project. There was unanimous agreement in wanting to continue Summer Craft Workshop and Arrow-craft Shop. Marian Heard, Director of Summer Craft Workshop, could see the establishment of a great Art and Craft Center. This idea had been the dream of Jessie Harris, Vice-Dean of the College of Home Economics, University of Tennessee, when the first Summer Craft Workshop was organized in 1945. Here was the foundation for a new program of expansion. To inform the fraternity about the extensiveness of the current Settlement School programs, a 16 mm movie film was made, in color. This film showed Arrowcraft Shop and all activities related to it. The major part of the film was devoted to showing the work done in classes of Craft Workshop. The film was shown at the 1964 convention and has been widely circulated for three years among clubs and charters, with excellent reception. Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics of the University of Tennesseeand Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design, University of Tennessee were guests of the fraternity at the 1964 convention, as speakers at the Settlement School night program. Dean Odland spoke of the mutual interest in the further development of the summer Craft Workshop program by the Ad-ministration of the University of Tennessee. She ex-pressed its willingness to cooperate in every way possible to make it a success. She said, "it would seem that with an historical background of successful pioneering on the part of Pi Beta Phi in the area of craft development programs, there would be an ideal opportunity to provide continued leadership in the utilization of human resources, through judicious, sound, yet inspired programs." This association of a great State University and a fraternity is unique and inspiring.

I arrived earlier than most of the other teachers, as the Home Economics Department was just being organized. I had to make plans for my cooking laboratory, go into Knoxville and buy supplies, get material for the curtains at the windows and plan how my morning cooking classes could prepare every school day the lunch for all of the teachers. Besides that I had to plan for the cooking class I would have at the Sugarlands one afternoon each week. I would ride Lady, my horse, the six miles there. Then one afternoon a week I rode to Cartertown for a sewing class. That school had no desks, only benches and when the children wrote they sat on the floor and used their benches as desks. By the middle of August when the school opened, the other teachers had arrived. There was Margaret White, Harmo Taylor, Helen Barrett, Marian Folsom, Emily Burton, Gene Redding and Lois Rogers. In reading over my diary I find many references to our school truck, or station wagon. It was our only means, other than by foot or horse back, to go anywhere, and often nine or ten teachers would go, for a day, to some other community or into Knoxville for a taste of city living and a big dinner of meat at the Farragut Hotel. B.Y.P.U. (Baptist Young People Union) was a part of our life too. I remember when I applied for a position at the school, one of the questions I had 17 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI to answer was, "will you be willing to take part in church activities ?" We all did take part, every Sun-day evening in the little white Baptist Church house, so close to the school. The teachers often led the young peoples meetings. We played the organ and helped lead the singing. Sunday evening and church were an important part of our lives. The Barn was more than a barn. On Friday nights fast and rough basketball games were held in the loft and on Saturday nights "old movies" were shown. All the teachers, students, townspeople and summer people came to these. If you think TV shows old movies, you should have seen the "old movies" of 1925. But it was Social Life and fun. In September we had our Fair. My diary tells of the canned fruits and tomatoes and jelly my cooking classes exhibited and the sewing classes had note-books of samples of stitches and seams. The Fair was more than a school project, it was a community project. I was clerk at the Fair and note that we took our exhibit to the County Fair at Sevierville, where our school exhibit won 1st place, then on to the Knoxville Fair. We always went to the fairs of other communities and I was judge many times of canned goods, baked foods, butter, etc. Once I was even asked at the Pittman Fair to judge 1st and 2nd place of two old old hand woven coverlets. They were both perfectly beautiful and intricate. How could I judge? I finally gave the Blue Ribbon to the one I liked best and the Red Ribbon to the other. I remembered our laundress, Martha Clabo, with one crippled hand, who washed all of our clothes on a washboard, and boiled them outside in a big black kettle over a wood fire. She ironed them all too and we paid fifty cents a week, no matter how few or many pieces we had in the wash. Then there were the "Harp singin's." I went the first time expecting to see harps, but discovered it was so called because Mr. Harp wrote the song book. The notes are all different shapes, triangles, circles, squares, etc. Each shape tells whether it is for the soprano, bass, alto or tenor. How those mountain people could sing. The leader sounded his tuning fork and away they went. It really was beautiful. I wonder if harp singing has been forgotten, if so it is too bad to lose such an interesting art. I remember mounting "Lady" with my saddlebags full of new style patterns and riding off up Roarin' Fork, or Baskin's Creek, or once a week in the summer fifteen miles away to conduct adult classes in community the meadow City of Gatlinburg. as a public parking lot and for Chamber of Commerce building. Pi Beta Phi has deeded land to Sevier County, for the construction of a new elementary school building. The White School building built in 1914 and the Rock building built in 1928 by Pi Beta Phi havesewing. Really, most of the women sewed very well, but they were hungry for new style dresses and they loved the patterns I brought. Then there were our weekend trips, usually on foot, to Alum Cave over the mountain to North Carolina on foot to Elkmont. We climbed Mt. Le Conte with jack and Jim to guide us straight up the mountainside. There was no easy trail then, we just climbed up. the mountain, with Jack urging us on. When we would ask how much farther to the top, he'd say, "It's just around the corner." Teaching at Gatlinburg gave us an opportunity to meet many interesting wonderful people. Aunt Lydia lived in a little one room house up the mountainside. She kept her potatoes from freezing by putting them under the floor boards in front of her fireplace. When we went to see her we always wore skirts and a hat to cover our bobbed hair, for she would take us to task and quote from the Bible where "It is an abomination unto the Lord for a woman to put on the raiment of man or to be shorn of her hair." Mr. and Mrs. Hall were retired and lived in a lovely house overlooking Gatlinburg and the Little Pigeon River. They often invited us teachers to their home and served us delicacies we would never have otherwise. Mrs. Duffield, who had an adorable little house, would invite us up occasionally for waffles and sausages and a pleasant evening around her fire. Of course, when the Settlement School Commit-tee came, we loved it. Nita Hill Stark was Chairman then and Mr. Stark would drive us in his big car to Knoxville for a wonderful dinner. There were trips to the Sugarlands and a night in Helen Chew's little three room cabin, furnished entirely with handmade mountain furniture. Our life as teachers at the school was very simple, but fun and healthful. Some evenings we would all sing to Miss Evelyn's playing, or listen to her read some book aloud. We took on mountain ways and went to bed early. We got up early too. Some of us had looms in our rooms. I still have the first towel I ever wove. It has very uneven edges. Anyone who has been to the Smoky Mountain National Park knows of its beauty. It is good to know the lovely holly, balsam, laurel and rhododendron, galax leaves and bear moss are being saved. I like to think that the school, besides all of it's other accomplishments, was instrumental in bringing this beautiful area to the attention of the world. rooted interest in the selling 2.2 acres of House to the (Continued from page 1 S) of Gatlinburg by served their original purpose well and will be re-in front of Staff placed.

Her Dedication Leads to Canadian Bench Marjorie Montgomery Bowker, Alberta Alpha, Is First Woman to Hold Such an Office Dedicated interest in problems ranging from child welfare to penal institution conditions has led an Alberta Alpha Pi Phi, to the post and responsibility of Judge of the Juvenile and Family Courts for the Province of Alberta, Canada, the highest judicial post ever to be held by a woman in Canada. A Pi Phi sister, Ruth Bowen, Women's Editor of the Edmonton journal, is the one who points out that Judge Bowker's direction toward this high honor was involuntary. She wrote, "Her steps had no conscious direction toward a judge's chair . . . but Mrs. W. F. Bowker is one woman with the social conscience to have impelled her to make voluntary investigations into the problems of child welfare, juvenile delinquency, the state of prisons in Alberta." Judge Bowker's appointment came in June, 1966. Prior to her appointment Canada had known three woman magistrates, two appointed in 1916 and an-other appointed in 1964. Under a former judicial system, all magistrates had the powers of a juvenile Court Judge for the locality where they served. In 1952, a new structure of juvenile and Family Courts was established in the Province and Mrs. Bowker is the first woman to be appointed judge in this provincial court. She has said that she feels her experience in three areas has been useful to her in her new position. These are her study and research over a number of years in the field of juvenile delinquency and penal reform; her visitation, with official approval, of all correctional institutions in Alberta in 1963; her rather thorough study of the Child Welfare situation in Alberta, through membership on the Provincial Adoption Committee, which included visitation of all child-care and youth-serving facilities in the Province. (She was the only woman on this three-member committee). Her visitation to every jail and custodial institution in Alberta was at her own request in an effort to see first hand the conditions under which both women and juvenile delinquents lived in these institutions. Ruth Bowen wrote, "Her own research led her all over the province to consult with welfare workers in the field and to gain an education in human problems . . . she knocked on doors to see living conditions for herself . . . out of this grew another area of concern, the problems of the retarded. Her report on preventive health services is now being studied by the premier and minister of health." Mrs. Bowker graduated from the University of Alberta in Arts and Law, and was admitted to the bar Judge Marjorie Montgomery Bowker of Alberta in 1940. She met her husband, Wilbur F. Bowker, Dean of Law, University of Alberta, while both were practicing with an Edmonton law firm. She carried on her husband's practice with the firm while he was in active service during World War II. The Bowkers have three children, sons, Blair, 18 and Keith Wilbur, 14, and daughter, Lorna Ethel, 16. Across the years she has been active in Y.W.C.A. activities; has served as an executive member of two major social concern agencies in Edmonton; and is the first woman to be appointed to the University of Alberta Hospital Board. She is a member of the junior League and was to be one of the guest panelists at the Junior League of America's national convention in Montreal, May, 1967. Mrs. Bowker has been a loyal and active Pi Phi since her initiation in 1936. She was secretary of her chapter; she served two different terms as president of the Edmonton Alumnae Club. She was active in initiating the Canadian Project and served as its first Western Representative following its establishment. She was on the Alberta Alpha Alumnae Advisory Committee for six years. 19

        1963-1967 Settle ent School Art and Craft Center by Dorothy Coleman Thor an, Illinois Epsilon Chairman of Settlement School Committee 1963-67 The Fiftieth Anniversary of Settlement School, an altruistic project, and Memorial to the Founders of Pi Beta Phi, was celebrated in 1962. A complete history of Settlement School, through the convention of 1962, was published and distributed by the fraternity. The last sentence in the history was the following quotation: "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." The Settlement School Committee of 1963-1967 picked up the torch and continued to develop the Settlement School program towards a great future, the establishment of an Art and Craft Center. In 1964, Pi Beta Phi voted to establish an Art and Craft Center on the foundation of Settlement School, as the Centennial Project. The development of Settlement School as an Art and Craft Center goes as far back as 1914-15 when the first handcrafted articles were sold to Alumnae clubs to bring in a small income for the mountain people. The establishment of Arrowcraft Shop in 1926 was a big step forward. The beauty and appreciation of native crafts led to a demand which has been met by Pi Beta Phi Alumnx Clubs, through the distribution of hand weaving and crafts in almost every state in the United States through Arrowcraft Shop. The second step towards development of an Art and Craft Center was made with the opening of the first Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, in 1945. Under the Di-rectorship of Marian G. Heard, Tennessee Gamma, Professor of Craft Design, the Summer Craft Work-shop has become well established nationally and is a school of great renown. Since 1962 the Summer Craft Workshop program has been expanded and strengthened through the following: The construction of the Weaving Studio in 1962. The construction of the Ceramic Studio in 1966 (considered the best of its kind, today). The addition of a one week short session, offering. Concentrated instruction under outstanding craftsmen. Increase'd salaries, making it possible to have excellent faculties. Increased publicity in national magazines, in-creasing enrollment. The Centennial Project will continue to build on the present program so that it can be expanded into a year-round program. It is planned that there will be new and well equipped dormitories, new class-room facilities and a multi-purpose building. This expansion will offer a comfortable and inspiring environment in which students will create new ideas, learn new techniques and skills, and acquire information that can be used to help others help them-selves. Credit for the strong foundation upon which the Centennial Project will be established belongs to hundreds of people, over a long period of time, but those most recently responsible, who deserve recognition are: Dr. Holt, President of the University of Tennessee; Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics; Marian G. Heard, Tenn. Ga., Professor of Craft Design and Director of Summer Craft Workshop for 21 years; Marion W. Mueller, Ind. Ga., Director of Settlement School for 15 years; and Maria H. Tate, Fla. B., Manager of Arrowcraft Shop for 5 years. Mary Mintich, Belmont, N. C. art teacher and student at Craft workshop for many years, in an article in the Winter ARROW 1966, said, "The influence of Craft Workshop clearly extends beyond the range of those fortunate to study there. We, the students, are looking forward to its increased growth and development." The Centennial Project has now picked up the torch and will carry on to make the former Settlement School the greatest Art and Craft Center, and a wonderful Memorial to the Founders of PI BETA PHI DURING ITS SECOND CENTURY.

When We Were Young by Barbara Mills Dewell Wood, Iowa Gamma I was attending the Settlement School sale in the fall of 1966 with my daughter-in-law. As we wandered from room to room inspecting the beautiful hand made articles we came to a group of pictures of the school as it looks today. "My," I said, "how it has changed since I taught there." Sally Gordon, editor of "News From Little Pigeon," was standing near-by and asked when I had taught there. I fumbled in my mind for dates and said, "I was there twenty or twenty-five years ago, from 1924 to 1926," and then I gasped, "over forty years ago! Why, that makes me an old timer." I hastened to add that I was barely 19 years old and had had just two years at Iowa State College at Ames when I arrived at Gatlinburg for my first year as a teacher of Home Economics. "The cookin"n' sewin' teacher," the mountain people called me. Sally asked if I would reminisce a bit about the school in the earlier years, so if my sisters will bear with my memories, refreshed a bit by a very poorly kept diary, I will try to tell you about the school and two of the happiest years of my life. I arrived in Gatlinburg the end of July 1924, after a long trip by train from Missouri Valley, Iowa to Chicago; another train from Chicago to Cincinnati, another train from Cincinnati to Knoxville, Tennessee and then a little trolley from Knoxville to Sevierville. There I was met by a handsome young man, Jim Huff, who drove me in his Ford from Sevierville, over a winding, rocky road 200 feet or so above the Little Pigeon River to Gatlin-burg. My diary gives a list of all the people I met at the Teachers' cottage that first day, but I will mention only a few. Miss Evelyn Bishop, head resident, whom. I was to grow to love, as everyone who knew her did. Mrs. Dowell, who purchased all foodstuffs. Helen Chew, the teacher who was to open the "new branch division of the Settlement School" up the Sugarlands. Miss Phyllis Higginbothom, Nurse. Aunt Lizzie Reagan, Housekeeper, who asked me when I met her if I had ever heard of her, and when I said, "Yes," chuckled and patted me on the cheek so hard it felt like a slap. There were many others that first day, Mr. Mattel, agriculture teacher; Mr. Dentin Lean-der, farm manager, postman and general helper for all the teachers; Mary Ann, etc. My diary states, "The cottages have hot and cold running water, electric light (from the school's own plant). I will live in the girls' dormitory, I guess I'llbe the chaperone ! There will be other teachers in the other two cottages, one on each side of mine. The teachers and dormitory girls are to prepare our dinners every night." Jim Huff, who met me, is one of Andy Huff's children. Mr. and Mrs. Huff played an important part in persuading the school to go to Gatlinburg. Jim told me the story of the earliest years as he drove me to the school. He said when the Pi Phis finally chose Gatlinburg for their school, the Gatlin-burg people had guaranteed a certain number of pupils. The 'first day of school opened, there was one pupil less than they had promised, so Andy Huff carried his little four year old daughter, Mattie, to school every day so that the Pi Phi teachers would stay. It seems natural that one day Mattie would go to college (Iowa State at Ames) and become a Pi Phi herself. Jack Huff, Stella Huff and Jim were out of the Pi Phi School when I was there, but Mattie was in high school and Blanche was in 5th or 6th grade. Many happy times, and delicious meals, were enjoyed at the Huff's Hotel, The Mountain View. Shortly after I arrived a big room with a huge stone fireplace at one end was added, where the teachers often gathered to enjoy the warmth of the fire and the "tall tales" Jack and Jim were always telling us. I arrived earlier than most of the other teachers, as the Home Economics Department was just being organized. I had to make plans for my cooking laboratory, go into Knoxville and buy supplies, get material for the curtains at the windows and plan how my morning cooking classes could prepare every school day the lunch for all of the teachers. Besides that I had to plan for the cooking class I would have at the Sugarlands one afternoon each week. I would ride Lady, my horse, the six miles there.

In reading over my diary I find many references to our school truck, or station wagon. It was our only means, other than by foot or horse back, to go anywhere, and often nine or ten teachers would go, for a day, to some other community or into Knoxville for a taste of city living and a big dinner of meat at the Farragut Hotel.

I like to think that the school, besides all of it's other accomplishments, was instrumental in bringing this beautiful area to the attention of the world. rooted interest in the selling 2.2 acres of House to the (Continued from page 1 S) of Gatlinburg by served their original purpose well and will be re-in front of Staff placed.

Her Dedication Leads to Canadian Bench Marjorie Montgomery Bowker, Alberta Alpha, Is First Woman to Hold Such an Office Dedicated interest in problems ranging from child welfare to penal institution conditions has led an Alberta Alpha Pi Phi, to the post and responsibility of Judge of the Juvenile and Family Courts for the Province of Alberta, Canada, the highest judicial post ever to be held by a woman in Canada. A Pi Phi sister, Ruth Bowen, Women's Editor of the Edmonton journal, is the one who points out that Judge Bowker's direction toward this high honor was involuntary. She wrote, "Her steps had no conscious direction toward a judge's chair . . . but Mrs. W. F. Bowker is one woman with the social conscience to have impelled her to make voluntary investigations into the problems of child welfare, juvenile delinquency, the state of prisons in Alberta." Judge Bowker's appointment came in June, 1966. Prior to her appointment Canada had known three woman magistrates, two appointed in 1916 and an-other appointed in 1964. Under a former judicial system, all magistrates had the powers of a juvenile Court Judge for the locality where they served. In 1952, a new structure of juvenile and Family Courts was established in the Province and Mrs. Bowker is the first woman to be appointed judge in this provincial court. She has said that she feels her experience in three areas has been useful to her in her new position. These are her study and research over a number of years in the field of juvenile delinquency and penal reform; her visitation, with official approval, of all correctional institutions in Alberta in 1963; her rather thorough study of the Child Welfare situation in Alberta, through membership on the Provincial Adoption Committee, which included visitation of all child-care and youth-serving facilities in the Province. (She was the only woman on this three-member committee). Her visitation to every jail and custodial institution in Alberta was at her own request in an effort to see first hand the conditions under which both women and juvenile delinquents lived in these institutions. Ruth Bowen wrote, "Her own research led her all over the province to consult with welfare workers in the field and to gain an education in human problems . . . she knocked on doors to see living conditions for herself . . . out of this grew another area of concern, the problems of the retarded. Her report on preventive health services is now being studied by the premier and minister of health." Mrs. Bowker graduated from the University of Alberta in Arts and Law, and was admitted to the bar Judge Marjorie Montgomery Bowker of Alberta in 1940. She met her husband, Wilbur F. Bowker, Dean of Law, University of Alberta, while both were practicing with an Edmonton law firm. She carried on her husband's practice with the firm while he was in active service during World War II. The Bowkers have three children, sons, Blair, 18 and Keith Wilbur, 14, and daughter, Lorna Ethel, 16. Across the years she has been active in Y.W.C.A. activities; has served as an executive member of two major social concern agencies in Edmonton; and is the first woman to be appointed to the University of Alberta Hospital Board. She is a member of the junior League and was to be one of the guest panelists at the Junior League of America's national convention in Montreal, May, 1967. Mrs. Bowker has been a loyal and active Pi Phi since her initiation in 1936. She was secretary of her chapter; she served two different terms as president of the Edmonton Alumnae Club. She was active in initiating the Canadian Project and served as its first Western Representative following its establishment. She was on the Alberta Alpha Alumnae Advisory Committee for six years. 19 Louisiana Beta Dream House by Debbie Leake, Louisiana Beta Louisiana Beta's new home was dedicated on November 13, 1966. The dedication ceremony opened with the invocation given by Reverend James Young which was followed by the welcome and response given by Chancellor Taylor and Mrs. John Eastham. Then Mrs. Richard A. Roberts, house corporation president, conducted the dedication. Following this Mrs. Watts, President of the Mother's Club, sang the hymn "Bless This House" accompanied by members of the sorority. Mrs. Roberts was presented with a gold plaque inscribed with her name recognizing her many years of dedication to Pi Beta Phi as Louisiana Beta House Corporation President. Her portrait will be painted and hung in the living room. Father Cody gave the benediction. The dedication was followed by a Tea during which parents, faculty, and fellow students were shown through the house. The Pi Beta Phi house favors an air of continental elegance and waives informality. From the front to the back door, this continental grandeur prevails. From a lushly colored dining hall to the telephone booths, it's luxury. The exterior is simulated old brick of French Regency style with a New Orleans influence. The all-air conditioned house of plastic interior has acoustical ceilings and vinyl tile floors. Uniquely, French doors across the front of the House open onto the lawn fronting the lake. The reception hall is enhanced by a sparkling French Re-gency crystal chandelier purchased in New Orleans. A custom-made wrought iron stair railing winds up-stairs from the hall to the dormitory rooms which house fifty girls. On the right side (entering) of the hall is the dining hall and kitchen; on the left, the living and chapter rooms. There are many paintings used throughout the house including two done by mothers of Pi Beta Phis and given as a gift to the chapter. Upstairs rooms, with a few exceptions, house two girls to a room. Each girl has a desk, light, bookshelf, mirror, chest, and very ample storage space. Outside, the house is distinguished by symbols that have a special meaning for us Pi Phis. It is the Pi Beta Phi arrow which is so skillfully constructed into the balcony grillwork that it is sometimes overlooked, but when discovered becomes a conversation piece. Another symbol is the Greek letters encrusted in the door-knobs. "What we wanted to achieve, and what we have, in this house is a home that is ladylike," Mrs. Roberts said. "Something that is feminine yet formal, something that will teach the sorority members how to live graciously and comfortably too. This is the effect we wanted a French house in a Louisiana setting with today's Pi Beta Phis as occupants." These words symbolize what all Pi Beta Phis of our chapter feel toward our new home it is indeed a dream come true! Louisiana Beta's new home. 6 News from Little Pigeon Edited by Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin The Little Pigeon "Little Pigeon News" follows the colorful Little Pigeon River around a wooded bend this summer as Pi Beta Phi Settlement School gives way to the Centennial project, The Art and Craft Center. Left behind for all time is a record of service as imposing and indestructible as the stones that dot the pathways of the River. -30 Over the years "News from Little Pigeon" has kept the fraternity informed of the struggles, the progress and the accomplishments of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. This has spanned the time from the establishment of the one room school in Gatlinburg in 1912 to the present day with the successful Arrowcraft Shop and the outstanding Craft Workshop program. This summer the Settlement School will become the foundation for the Centennial. Project, an expanded Art and Craft Center. This is to be the last issue of "News from Little Pigeon" and we wish to express our appreciation to all, both Pi Phis and other friends, whose contributions to this section have added so greatly to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School story. And, especially do we thank Dorothy Stuck, Editor of THE ARROW, for her guidance over the last five years. SALLY WILD GORDON Settlement School Committee Editor of "News from Little Pigeon" 7 Memoirs of Settlement School Gatlinburg with Mount Harrison in the background in the winter of 1413. Sometimes it is good to look back in order that one may look forward and with more wisdom and understanding. I have been asked to do just that to our philanthropic project in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, as a 40-year Pi Phi and as a 35-year citizen of Gatlinburg. I will tell you of the progress our Settlement School has made through the years. From the moment I saw the movie of our Settlement School, shown by the Director of the School, Miss Evelyn Bishop, at the 1927 Convention in Breezy Point, Michigan, I knew exactly what I wanted to do upon graduation from college. In my application to the Settlement School, I said that I would accept any opening, even though I had pre-pared to teach mathematics in high school. How happy I was when notified that I had been accepted as a teacher of the third and fourth grades for the 1928-29 school year. Never will I forget my trip to Gatlinburg over the new road being constructed into Gatlinburg. How excited I was, but disappointed that the low hanging clouds were obscuring any glimpse of a mountain. How impressed I was with the beauty of the foliage, the loud roar of the Little Pigeon River as it flowed swiftly over the large rocks (I heard that roar continuously night and day for one month after which I no longer heard it unless my attention was called to it). How surprised I was to be dumped out of the taxi, trunk, baggage and all beside the road at the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School sign. Walking up Pi Phi Lane to Helmick House, or Teachers' Cottage as it was more often called, I was greeted by Miss Mary Pollard, one of the first Pi Phi teachers in the early days of our School, who was assisting our director, Miss Evelyn Bishop, this summer of 1928. On going inside the cottage, it was a nice surprise to find all modern conveniences especially electric lights and inside plumbing. I didn't expect either. I could write a book about those three years 1928-1931. There were fourteen people on the staff that year of 1928 and all lived in the three dormito-ries Teachers' Cottage, Pollard Cottage (where the kitchen, dining room and girls' dormitory were located) and Stuart Cottage (where I lived with 4 other staff members) . On meeting Miss Evelyn Bishop I soon learned why she was loved and looked up to not only by the staff but also by every mountain family within miles of the School. She had a magnetic personality, was a good administrator, and always looked for and brought out the good in everyone. We were fortunate to have had her during those formative years of our School 1917 to 1933. The other members on the staff in 1928 were Miss Elizabeth Cook, bookkeeper; La Delle Allen (Pi Phi from Arkansas), Arrowcraft manager; Winogene Redding, weaving instructor; Frances Moore, nurse in Jennie Nicol Health Center; Mrs. Morgan, dietician and housemother for girls' dormitory; Eleanor Brabson, teacher of Primer, 1st and 2nd grades; Alice Williams (Pi Phi from Illinois), teacher of 5th and 6th grades; Kathryn Kibler (Pi Phi from Kansas), teacher of 7th and 8th and high school English; Katharine Watson, Home Ec teacher; Bruce Overton, principal and teacher in the 2-year high school; O. J. Mattil, Smith Hughes Agriculture teacher; and Lois Rogers (Pi Phi from Texas) worked in summers in Arrowcraft Shop. Also living in the dormitories in 1928 were 15 girls and 15 boys, high school age, who earned most of their way by doing chores on the place. These children lived too far away to walk and there were no buses then. Most of these have become leaders in their communities now. Two boys living there in 1928 were Herbert Trentham, now driver of a sight-seeing car at Moutain View Hotel and Wade King, one of the managers of Reagan's. Furniture Shop. School started the first week in August and lasted eight months so that the children might get through school by April 1 that they could help in the fields all spring and summer. How impressed I was with my first day of school 8 by Henrietta McCutchan Huff Missouri Beta Gatlinburg and Mount Harrison in the same view in the summer of 1966. a class of 30 bare-footed boys and girls all very normal, healthy, bright children as, you might find in any rural school. I was amazed to find almost every child with blond hair showing their Anglo-Saxon descent. During my second year of teaching, the one-room school house up Cherokee Orchard road was closed and some of these children were placed in my 3rd and 4th grades. What a contrast between the foundation of these children and that of those children who had always gone to our Pi Beta Phi School. I had to give much individual attention to these children in order to help improve their reading. At that time the teachers were required to visit every home once a month. We would take turns hitching up the two school horses and riding horse-back up the creeks and "hollers" each day after school. In looking back, it wouldn't be right to leave out our branch school located farther back in the mountains where the road ended in the Sugarlands. This 2-room school, called the Emma Harper Turner Center, was started in 1924-2 5, the staff that first year being Helen Chew, Cora McCarter and Mary Elder. Helen Chew even had a night school for adults. Some of my best friends here in Gatlinburg attended this school and now own motels and other businesses in Gatlinburg. As all families had to move out when the Park came, the school was closed around 1933 or 34. What fun Kathryn Kebler and later Barbara Horton and I had riding horseback up there on weekends, then hiking with Eva Hathaway (Iowa Pi Phi), who came in 1928 and after closing this school started one in Laurel Lick, Emily Burton (who taught in Gatlinburg from 1917 to 1928 when she moved to the Sugarlands School) and Mrs. Anna Dowell (Iowa Beta), housekeeper. (She had been at our School since 1921.) During the three years I taught at our Settlement School, not only did I fall in love with the beautiful mountains and the fine people living here, but also in particular with a certain young man by the nameof James N. Huff, who was in that first class of 1912 and whose father, Andy J. Huff, was the man responsible for keeping the Pi Phi School here in that first year. After our marriage in 1931, we had 5 children, all of whom attended our Pi Beta Phi School and gained a good foundation to go on to college and secure degrees. Three daughters are also Pi Phis. Over the years some things have remained unchanged the primeval beauty of these Smoky Mountains, the roar of the fast moving streams, and the natural ability and intelligence of the mountain people with their good Anglo-Saxon heritage. What are the changes that have been made in Gatlinburg? These changes have meant progress for this mountain community. They have come so fast over the years that it is hard to realize this is the same locality. All roads have been improved no more fording the streams. The road that ended in the sugarlands, when I arrived 1928, now goes over Newfound Gap into Cherokee, North Carolina. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park was dedicated in 1941 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The establishment of the Park brought about the majority of changes. The town grew in population from 500 in 1928 to approximately 2000 now. As the U. S. Government Park Service bought up the land for the Park, the mountain people moved down into the lower elevations many moving into Gatlinburg and vicinity. Those who owned land in Gatlinburg heeded the advice of Mr. Andy Huff and held on to their property. The education they received at our school, plus their own natural shrewdness, prepared them to cope with this prosperity. Motels, gift shops and restaurants started springing up after the dedication of the Park in '41. Pi Phi set the example of using good architects in their buildings. Andy Huff was wise enough to see the wisdom in this policy and had the vision to see the need for providing many more modern rooms in his hotel (first built in 1917) for the many tourists who would be coming with the opening of the new 9 10 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI trans-mountain road. He used an architect in planning the new addition to his hotel, completed in 1931 long before the Park was dedicated. Mr. Huff was a man of vision. If the leaders of Gatlin-burg had listened to his advice, there would have been six lanes instead of only four lanes on the Parkway through Gatlinburg. With the increase in population the enrollment at the school kept growing. Instead of 4 teachers for the 8 elementary grades as in 1928, there are now 16 teachers. The high school became a four-year accredited school shortly after my oldest daughter started to school in 1936. We know how the County has gradually taken over more and more of the sup-port of the school in Gatlinburg as was the intent from the beginning of the Settlement School in 1912. As more income from the tourist trade came into the County, there has been more money to help support the schools. The teachers' salaries have in-creased from $50.00 per month plus room and board that I received in 1928 to over $300.00 per month paid by the County to most teachers. In 1963 the Gatlinburg and Pittman High Schools were moved into a new consolidated high school building located five miles out of Gatlinburg off Highway 73. This year the County is building fourteen new rooms for the elementary school with the help of the City of Gatlinburg. The old white building where I taught will be torn down. I have seen many fine Pi Phi Directors of our Settlement School come and go after Miss Evelyn re-signed in 1933: Miss Chaffee, Mrs. Weaver, Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, Miss Dyer, and finally our present capable director, Mrs. Marion Mueller, who has so ably directed the Settlement School since her arrival here in 1952. I wish I had space to list all the many Pi Phi teachers who have come through the years while I have been living here in Gatlinburg. Each has left her imprint on this community. Many children have been named after a teacher whom their parents had admired as a pupil. Two Pi Phis are living in Gatlinburg and are still teaching in the Gatlinburg schools Dorothy Douthat Manley (Mo. Gamma) and Sue Huff Cox (Tenn. Gamma) who was in that first class of 1912. I would also like to name all the wonderful Pi Phis who have served so unselfishly as members of the Settlement School Committee and whom I have had the privilege of getting to know. In living in Gatlinburg, I have been most fortunate to get to see Grand Council every other year when they meet here between Conventions, especially enjoying seeing my classmate in college, our Grand President, Alice Weber Johnson. There are some who would like to keep Gatlin-burg as it was in those early days. It was a happy time. There was none of the hustle and bustle of the present time. But I doubt that one can find a single individual, native to these mountains, who wouldwant to return to those days. What a contrast there is with their way of living and now. No longer do you find a one-room log cabin with no electricity and no inside plumbing. These people have taken advantage of every opportunity that has come their way. Today most everyone has a comfortable modern home. Nowhere can you find any lovelier homes than right here in Gatlin-burg. No longer do you find the women doing the hard work on a small farm plowing, hoeing corn, milkinb o besides all the housework (carrying water from the spring, washing the clothes outside in the old iron wash kettle, churning the milk) as in those early days. Most of them had large families and the children did help but the women became old looking before the age of 30. Weaving for Arrowcraft Shop helped the women in this respect for many families long before the coming of the tourist trade with jobs opening up in restaurants, gift shops and motels and still helps women. They can stay at home, make an income, and still care for their "young-uns." No longer does one see the women walking be-hind their husbands as they come into town (as I saw some of those still living back in the mountain in 1928). All husbands and wives walk side by side as equals. Most every family has an automobile and ride to town or wherever they desire to go. Many people have gained a wrong impression of what the mountain people are like from reading some of the popular comics. We know they are pictured as always being barefooted, with hair uncut or uncombed, wearing ragged clothes, etc. How untrue! When one of my daughters went to Pi Phi Convention in 1960, the girls couldn't believe any-one from Gatlinburg ever wore shoes. When I came to teach in 1928 the children did come to school barefooted in the hot months of August and September as was true at this time in many rural schools. Today the children all dress as the children in any other city school. Back in 1928 because of their isolation and because of their low income, the people did not dress in the newest styles of the day. However, many of the young people had gone off to college and were as well dressed as any other college girl or boy. Today you will find the citizens of Gatlinburg as well dressed as anyone anywhere in our U.S.A. Visit our churches any Sunday and you will find out for yourself. As Gatlinburg has grown in population, it has grown in the number of churches. In 1928 there was one Baptist church. Now there are ten churches: 3 Baptist, 1 Methodist, 1 Episcopal, 1 Catholic, 1 Lutheran, 1 Church of Christ, 1 Presbyterian and 1 Christian Scientist. I will say little about our Health work since this service is no longer needed. Gatlinburg now has a medical center with two fine doctors. There is also an osteopath in town and two dentists. But I must THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 11 say that the influence of our Jennie Nicol Health Center and the help it has meant to every family far and near over the years cannot be measured. The nurses through the years have meant happier, healthier lives for the people. With no doctor in Gatlin-burg in the first few years of my marriage (the first doctor came in 1935), I turned to the nurse for ad-vice many times. I have heard so many speak of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham, the first nurse, that I feel as though she were a long time friend. I finally met her in person on a recent visit here. Two former nurses have now retired and are living in Gatlinburg. Frances Moore, came to the Health Center in 1928, the same year I came to teach, and was school nurse for three years. While she was here she married O. J. Mattil, our Smith-Hughes Agriculture teacher from 1922 to 1929 at which time he started a woodworking shop and taught woodworking to the high school boys. He is now an officer in the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild of which Arrowcraft Shop is a member. The other nurse is Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta Delta Convention Initiate in 1958) who was the nurse here longer than any other nurse from 1935 to 1965 30 years in all. How she has come to be loved through the years by all of us and what a service she has performed cannot be measured! She is still active in civic projects and on the advisory board of the County Welfare Department. I would say the most exciting and most satisfying changes are those made in our Craft Program. My introduction to this Craft Program was on my second day in. Gatlinburg when Miss Evelyn asked me whether I would like to visit some of our weavers for Arrowcraft Shop. How thrilled I was to walk up Baskins Creek with Miss Onken, Grand President of Pi Beta Phi, Miss Mary Pollard, Miss Evelyn and Alice Williams (a new Pi Phi teacher, also) to see Izora Keener and her sister-in-law, Myrtle Conner. What beautiful articles they have woven through the years. Myrtle is still weaving and looks younger now than she did then. Although Izora has had to stop weaving due to age, I still see her in church almost every Sunday with her son and his family. We have read how Carolyn McKnight Hughes, Minnesota Alpha, revived the lost art of weaving and basket-making and how these articles were soldto Alumnae Clubs to bring in a small income for those people back in 1914 and 1915. And then how Miss Evelyn Bishop promoted this work, finally se-curing in 1925 Winogene Redding to assume full time charge of the weaving department (Gene held that position for 20 years. She walked miles upon miles through the cold winter months in those early years and later rode horseback to instruct the women at their looms. Much credit goes to Gene for her work with the mountain women. She designed some beautiful articles for Arrowcraft Shop through the years); how Arrowcraft Shop was started in 1926 in a room in Stuart Cottage by Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor (Pi Phis from Texas) and then moved to Teachers' Cottage and finally in 1927 to the original school building on. Baskens Creek and the road. I really went wild over the lovely articles on display in this shop and spent most of my salary for the beautiful linens and a coverlet. La Delle Allen (Pi Phi from Arkansas) was manager of the Arrowcraft Shop from 1927 to 1934. Mrs. Ethel Snow followed her and served for seven-teen years. Then came Marion Mueller (Indiana Gamma now director of School), Elizabeth Rue (Iowa Gamma now in charge of the branch shop in Mountain View Hotel), Nevada Christian (Nevada Alpha) and now Maria Tate (Florida Beta). All wonderful Pi Phis and each giving fine contribution to our Arrowcraft Shop. Now that our educational mission in this mountain community has been accomplished, we are now ready for our new philanthropy which has an even greater prospect for service to mankind the expansion of our Centennial Project the Arts and Crafts Center honoring our Founders anew. The Creative Arts are found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also as Alumnae Clubs we can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Senior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. To achieve this goal will take large amounts of money through the years. May each Pi Phi GIVE and GIVE and GIVE to our Centennial Fund. 4Settlement School Panorama 1945 1967 by Marion Webb Mueller, Indiana Gamma Director, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School The panoramic view of our Settlement School necessarily will be a mental picture of a series of images and events. Myriads of pictures and articles have been presented to our Alumna: Club members through the years. Yet, it seems most timely to pause for reflection in this, our Pi Beta Phi Centennial year. During this interim thousands of Pi Phis have been to our Settlement School, and those first visitors who came would wonder now at the many changes in the village during these two decades. Tourism attracted an estimated 6,466,000 persons in the adjoining Smoky Mountain National Park during the summer of 1966 as compared with 750,090 in 1945. An omen of spring is the local residents `checking up' on the new additions for the following tourist season. Each spring when I think the ultimate expansion has been made, I soon learn that more dreams are in the making. Gatlinburg adjoins the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and has an altitude of less than thirteen hundred feet while Mt. Le Conte which is visible and only a few miles distant by crow flight boasts the third highest altitude of the area over 6500 feet. As one drives a distance of approximately twelve miles to the Newfound Gap into North Carolina there is a kaleidoscopic scene of beauty and nature's wonder which is protected from commercial-ism by. the Park authorities. Gatlinburg at last count had 153 motels and 6 hotels, providing accommodations for over 13,000 tourists an unusual number for a town with a population of approximately 2300. Circa 1962 a nearby Ski Resort, a hospital and industrial attractions were added in the County, thus giving employment to several hundred people. Within the last twenty-five years the number of one-room schools has dwindled from twenty to one at present. From those entering school the percentage of high school graduates in 1962 was approximately thirty-five per cent. A determined effort to improve this record is being made by local and state authorities. Many new schools with innovations are being planned in eastern Tennessee. 014 Pi Beta Phi Settlement School which is located on Parkway in the heart of Gatlinburg has played an integral part in this development through the years. In so doing a development has taken place= at our school the development of a Craft Program. We must look at our topography to understand the development. In the background is an undeveloped wooded area. Twelve buildings are nestled together to form our Settlement School Campus. Approaching the school on Parkway one sees the Pi Beta Phi Craft Office (or administration building), next door across an expanse of lawn is Arrowcraft Shop. Back of Arrowcraft Shop is the Emma Harper Turner Building, presently used as a jewelry classroom. The old high school building further back on the campus houses four or five classrooms of our Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Workshop. Next to this building are three buildings used only by the County. At the left of our school lane is the Art and Craft Center, including the Evelyn Bishop Lounge, Loom House and Lolita Prouty Pottery Wing. Emily Helmick House, Pollard Dormitory (obsolete) and Stuart Cottage are on the lane leading to the popular Red Barn and Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House. At present these buildings are inadequate for our work-shops to expand. Even though our Pi Beta Phi and University of Tennessee Craft Workshop is well established and well-known there is competition with other craft schools with modern equipment, thus making our Centennial Craft Development Program most timely. Before we look to the future we must review some of the highlights of the last two decades. Having participated in three-fourths of that era, I can say that Pi Phis can justly be proud of the many accomplishments of this Memorial to our Founders. The discontinuance of the Dormitory Program in 1965 was with regret in many ways, yet with the aforesaid development of the area one can see why Pi Phi should look to other areas. However, it is a thrill to see the living evidence of our program evidence of helping in some way that not even a `thank you' may be given until years later. I recall two instances where unpaid accounts were paid in full after the student had been gone over five years. Many return for calls with their brides and the young mothers frequently come to introduce a babe in arms. Many of the boys return in uniform on leave. The most recent a handsome, tall youth whose name I could not recall was completing his service in Vietnam, but had signed up for another year. When I expressed my regret that we had to have this war, he said without hesitation "if you were there, you would understand." One of the girls we helped through the longest period is now in the Air Force. Christmas I received a lovely `crafty' looking card from her at Travis Air Force Base. Having lived at the dormitory since the seventh grade and having served as Kitchen-Aide several summers she knew crafts. In 1965 Pi Beta Phi discontinued the Health Service, having a registered nurse since 1920. Forty-five years of service! Here, too, chapters could be writ-ten, however, recognition has been given this project 12 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 13 in recent ARROWS. Another immeasureable service! The administration office now occupies that building on Parkway. In 1963 the Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlin-burg consolidated with Pittman Center High School five miles east. The elementary school still carries the name of Pi Beta Phi, although there are no teachers furnished by Pi Beta Phi beginning with 1966 fiscal school year. Plans for a new elementary building are completed by the County, also sufficient land to build traded with Pi Beta Phi. 1962 was an eventful year. ARROWS of that year carry details of the celebration of the fiftieth Anniversary of Settlement School. All Pi Phis should be thrilled to read of these events, however, there is one which is almost a `thrill of a lifetime' to me the Exhibit of Weaving from our Arrowcraft Shop and Workshop at the Smithsonian Institution. After much preparation to have this exhibit for one month I simply `burst with pride' when I saw this display. There was an additional honor after the display was dismantled, the Institution asked for seven pieces of the early weaving for their permanent collection (not for permanent exhibit). Pi Phi has thus received recognition for posterity. Our Grace Coolidge Collection of books is now housed at Staff House. All appropriate school books were given to the high school or the elementary school with the consolidation, however, books of the area, travel books, and craft books are in this Collection. A Jeanette Mitchell Minor Collection of Craft Books is being purchased for our craft classes. Several other memorial books have been given by others among them Mrs. Dorothy Lexau (daughter of Mrs. Ethel Trainer), and Mrs. Fred Van Aken in memory of her mother. Each building has memorials or gifts in honor of Pi Phis or some interested per-son. There are innumerable stories of these many, many gifts. We must keep faith with these generous donors of gifts by preserving them. The Red Barn was remodelled due to a bequest of a Pi Phi. Even though I had the privilege of helping with this project, ldid not realize (and I doubt if others who were working in this project realized) the scope of its popularity serving for youth groups for retreats, for our Pi Phi groups, and educational groups, as well as workshop students. The Red Barn has many tales to relate considering that it not only served as a barn in the literal sense, but also housed the first movies and basketball games in Gatlinburg. Arrowcraft Shop still serves as a multipurpose project giving an outlet to the many craftsmen who make these products and serving as a unifying contact with our Pi Beta Phi Clubs throughout the United States. There is a great economic benefit to the weavers and craftsmen because all the folks of the area do not wish to participate directly in tour-ism. There is inherent talent among many of the craftsmen which gives a certain satisfaction in making something with the hands. I trust there is mutual benefit with the Alumnre Clubs and Arrowcraft in the sale of the crafts. Clubs send clippings of unusual pictures with their `mountain crafts.' Having become very craft conscious in this area (tourism attracts more people, however, unquestionably it is a craft area which is renowned) we can be proud of our specialty of Arrowcraft, the weaving. I have found no production weaving which surpasses that of the cottage industry of our Arrowcraft Shop. In 1945 there was a momentous decision made for Pi Beta Phi. Due to the efforts of many Pi Phis and Dean Harris of the University of Tennessee there was a craft workshop on the Settlement School campus. Doubtless, they said they would try it for a year. There was an enrollment of 52 students! Al-most one-third of our present capacity. The following year our present Workshop Director, Marian Heard, became co-director and has since served as director through twenty-one summers. Having worked with Marian fifteen of those summers I will say that it is due largely to her efforts through constant vigilance that our 1967 Workshop can boast of its high standards of both design and craftsmanship the top characteristic of our school. Each year I am amazed at the tremendous results of the students with varying backgrounds ranging from the professional designer-craftsman to the highly skilled amateur. Many of them, especially the beginner, surprise themselves. The various aspects of our workshop development have far-reaching results. There are several scholar-ships provided by Alumni Clubs (and deeply appreciated). Virginia Alpha Scholarship is presented annually to a Pi Phi. The Southern California Area Council has provided scholarships biennially for The busy Gatlinburg of today with some of the 153 motels and 6 hotels in the foreground. 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI several years. There have been several Rehabilitation and Study Grants given by states, also foreign students studying in various capacities. Our seven assistantships providing for one credit course are consid-, ered a scholarship with board and room and tuition. Outside sources sometimes provide for supplemental teaching salary. The Southern Highland Handicraft Guild has donated $100 toward a scholarship for 1967. Each year twenty-five or more states are represented among our personnel and one or more foreign countries. Even though we advertise nationally there has been much evidence of growth with the experiences passed on by our students. In 1955 and 1958 Marian Heard conducted a European Craft Tour sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee. Yes, interest is still shown in having another such tour perhaps in the United States. Several of our students and staff attended the first International Craft meeting in June 1965. Our roots are deep in the craft program. Crafts are not new. The cavepaintings 40,000 years ago tell a story of the beginning of crafts. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. In 1967 we find young and old, seeking a satisfaction in doing something with their hands because creative crafts: develop skill provide an outlet for self-expressionmay be a form of recreation increase sensitiveness as to surroundings and give dignity to common things frequently bring out unsuspected abilities furnish aesthetic satisfaction and are pathways to wonder and beauty that form a link between nature and art explain and help rationalize the machine (many designer-craftsmen are in demand in industry) bring the handicapped into better adjustment are a delight to the adventuresome This panoramic view of our Settlement School in this land of a great natural beauty and hope, and a cultural heritage of several generations is very, very brief. However, it does bring us to our Centennial year where again we must pause to look at the future a moment. We must look at the coming of the new! All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. The path ahead is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi, to surpass the accomplishments of our first hundred years accomplishments which would have been impossible without the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. Beacon in a Mountain Village by Mrs. Sue (Huff) Cox, Tennessee Gamma It has been with profound interest that I have watched the growth of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. From the very beginning this missionary project, always sparked with the enthusiasm on the part of many dedicated women, has been a beacon in this mountain village. It has truly proved the way, beginning in the pioneering days, toward making Gatlinburg the cultural center that it is proud to be today. Now that we have become an incorporated town with our thousands of seasonal visitors, Pi Beta Phi continues to strengthen and widen its efforts through its craft program which can be meaningful to people all over the world. As a former pupil and teacher of the school, and, for the past ten years an honorary member of Pi Beta Phi, I wish to express my deep appreciation to the many, many Pi Phis whom I have loved and have worked with in this Gatlinburg project which I certainly believe will continue for generations to come. Settlement School Committee 1962-1967 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE-seated from left Sally Wild Gordon, Wis. Alpha, Editor, "Little Pigeon News" (1962-67); Dorothy Coleman Thorman, Ill. Epsilon, Chairman (1963-67); and Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, Slides and Movie films (1964-67). Standing Sally Bosman Schneiter, Ind. Alpha, Treasurer (1962-67); and Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha, Secretary (1961-67). The first Settlement School was organized at the Alumnae Session of Convention held June 28th, 1910, at Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. The last Settlement School Committee will complete its business at the June Convention of 1967 to be held at the Edge-water Beach Hotel in Chicago, Illinois. Settlement School Committee has served the fraternity for 57 years. Many dedicated members of Pi Beta Phi have worked on the Committee and are responsible for making Settlement School the most outstanding philanthropic venture undertaken by a fraternity. The years 1962 to 1967 have been challenging and educational for the members of the final committee. It has been the responsibility of the commit-tee to carry on during what have been called the transitional years. In 1962-63, the question was "transitional to what ?" All the members of the committee and members of the Settlement School Staff felt strongly that Settlement School was too well established in the field of crafts to let the fraternity move away and abandon the program for something entirely different for a new philanthropic project. There was unanimous agreement in wanting to continue Summer Craft Workshop and Arrow-craft Shop. Marian Heard, Director of Summer Craft Workshop, could see the establishment of a great Art and Craft Center. This idea had been the dream of Jessie Harris, Vice-Dean of the College of Home Economics, University of Tennessee, when the first Summer Craft Workshop was organized in 1945. Here was the foundation for a new program of expansion. To inform the fraternity about the extensiveness of the current Settlement School programs, a 16 mm movie film was made, in color. This film showed Arrowcraft Shop and all activities related to it. The major part of the film was devoted to showing the work done in classes of Craft Workshop. The film was shown at the 1964 convention and has been widely circulated for three years among clubs and charters, with excellent reception. Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics of the University of Tennesseeand Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design, University of Tennessee were guests of the fraternity at the 1964 convention, as speakers at the Settlement School night program. Dean Odland spoke of the mutual interest in the further development of the summer Craft Workshop program by the Ad-ministration of the University of Tennessee. She ex-pressed its willingness to cooperate in every way possible to make it a success. She said, "it would seem that with an historical background of successful pioneering on the part of Pi Beta Phi in the area of craft development programs, there would be an ideal opportunity to provide continued leadership in the utilization of human resources, through judicious, sound, yet inspired programs." This association of a great State University and a fraternity is unique and inspiring. Pi Beta Phi met the challenge and voted to establish an Art and Craft Center on the Settlement School property in Gatlinburg, as the Centennial Project. With Settlement School established as the foundation of the Centennial Project, the committee made every effort to inform the fraternity of how strong this foundation was. All forms of communication were used to present the present day pro-grams. Little Pigeon News in the ARROW, featured articles on Craft Workshop. Students told of their experiences and how much it meant to be a student under outstanding craftsmen. The May L. Keller Award was given for the pro-grams that showed the progress of Settlement School program from one of providing education on the elementary school level to one of providing education on the college level. Pi Beta Phi severed all responsibility for educational and Health Center programs, they have been assumed by Sevier County and the City of Gatlin-burg. These programs included: Dormitory for boy and girls, Health Center and providing salaries fa] special teachers. Pi Beta Phi has shown its deef (Continued on page 18) 15 1963-1967 Settle ent School Art and Craft Center by Dorothy Coleman Thor an, Illinois Epsilon Chairman of Settlement School Committee 1963-67 The Fiftieth Anniversary of Settlement School, an altruistic project, and Memorial to the Founders of Pi Beta Phi, was celebrated in 1962. A complete history of Settlement School, through the convention of 1962, was published and distributed by the fraternity. The last sentence in the history was the following quotation: "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." The Settlement School Committee of 1963-1967 picked up the torch and continued to develop the Settlement School program towards a great future, the establishment of an Art and Craft Center. In 1964, Pi Beta Phi voted to establish an Art and Craft Center on the foundation of Settlement School, as the Centennial Project. The development of Settlement School as an Art and Craft Center goes as far back as 1914-15 when the first handcrafted articles were sold to Alumnae clubs to bring in a small income for the mountain people. The establishment of Arrowcraft Shop in 1926 was a big step forward. The beauty and appreciation of native crafts led to a demand which has been met by Pi Beta Phi Alumnx Clubs, through the distribution of hand weaving and crafts in almost every state in the United States through Arrowcraft Shop. The second step towards development of an Art and Craft Center was made with the opening of the first Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, in 1945. Under the Di-rectorship of Marian G. Heard, Tennessee Gamma, Professor of Craft Design, the Summer Craft Work-shop has become well established nationally and is a school of great renown. Since 1962 the Summer Craft Workshop program has been expanded and strengthened through the following: The construction of the Weaving Studio in 1962. The construction of the Ceramic Studio in 1966 (considered the best of its kind, today). The addition of a one week short session, offering. Concentrated instruction under outstanding craftsmen. Increase'd salaries, making it possible to have excellent faculties. Increased publicity in national magazines, in-creasing enrollment. The Centennial Project will continue to build on the present program so that it can be expanded into a year-round program. It is planned that there will be new and well equipped dormitories, new class-room facilities and a multi-purpose building. This expansion will offer a comfortable and inspiring environment in which students will create new ideas, learn new techniques and skills, and acquire information that can be used to help others help them-selves. Credit for the strong foundation upon which the Centennial Project will be established belongs to hundreds of people, over a long period of time, but those most recently responsible, who deserve recognition are: Dr. Holt, President of the University of Tennessee; Dr. Lura M. Odland, Dean of the College of Home Economics; Marian G. Heard, Tenn. Ga., Professor of Craft Design and Director of Summer Craft Workshop for 21 years; Marion W. Mueller, Ind. Ga., Director of Settlement School for 15 years; and Maria H. Tate, Fla. B., Manager of Arrowcraft Shop for 5 years. Mary Mintich, Belmont, N. C. art teacher and student at Craft workshop for many years, in an article in the Winter ARROW 1966, said, "The influence of Craft Workshop clearly extends beyond the range of those fortunate to study there. We, the students, are looking forward to its increased growth and development." The Centennial Project has now picked up the torch and will carry on to make the former Settlement School the greatest Art and Craft Center, and a wonderful Memorial to the Founders of PI BETA PHI DURING ITS SECOND CENTURY.

When We Were Young by Barbara Mills Dewell Wood, Iowa Gamma I was attending the Settlement School sale in the fall of 1966 with my daughter-in-law. As we wandered from room to room inspecting the beautiful hand made articles we came to a group of pictures of the school as it looks today. "My," I said, "how it has changed since I taught there." Sally Gordon, editor of "News From Little Pigeon," was standing near-by and asked when I had taught there. I fumbled in my mind for dates and said, "I was there twenty or twenty-five years ago, from 1924 to 1926," and then I gasped, "over forty years ago! Why, that makes me an old timer." I hastened to add that I was barely 19 years old and had had just two years at Iowa State College at Ames when I arrived at Gatlinburg for my first year as a teacher of Home Economics. "The cookin"n' sewin' teacher," the mountain people called me. Sally asked if I would reminisce a bit about the school in the earlier years, so if my sisters will bear with my memories, refreshed a bit by a very poorly kept diary, I will try to tell you about the school and two of the happiest years of my life. I arrived in Gatlinburg the end of July 1924, after a long trip by train from Missouri Valley, Iowa to Chicago; another train from Chicago to Cincinnati, another train from Cincinnati to Knoxville, Tennessee and then a little trolley from Knoxville to Sevierville. There I was met by a handsome young man, Jim Huff, who drove me in his Ford from Sevierville, over a winding, rocky road 200 feet or so above the Little Pigeon River to Gatlin-burg. My diary gives a list of all the people I met at the Teachers' cottage that first day, but I will mention only a few. Miss Evelyn Bishop, head resident, whom. I was to grow to love, as everyone who knew her did. Mrs. Dowell, who purchased all foodstuffs. Helen Chew, the teacher who was to open the "new branch division of the Settlement School" up the Sugarlands. Miss Phyllis Higginbothom, Nurse. Aunt Lizzie Reagan, Housekeeper, who asked me when I met her if I had ever heard of her, and when I said, "Yes," chuckled and patted me on the cheek so hard it felt like a slap. There were many others that first day, Mr. Mattel, agriculture teacher; Mr. Dentin Lean-der, farm manager, postman and general helper for all the teachers; Mary Ann, etc. My diary states, "The cottages have hot and cold running water, electric light (from the school's own plant). I will live in the girls' dormitory, I guess I'llbe the chaperone ! There will be other teachers in the other two cottages, one on each side of mine. The teachers and dormitory girls are to prepare our dinners every night." Jim Huff, who met me, is one of Andy Huff's children. Mr. and Mrs. Huff played an important part in persuading the school to go to Gatlinburg. Jim told me the story of the earliest years as he drove me to the school. He said when the Pi Phis finally chose Gatlinburg for their school, the Gatlin-burg people had guaranteed a certain number of pupils. The 'first day of school opened, there was one pupil less than they had promised, so Andy Huff carried his little four year old daughter, Mattie, to school every day so that the Pi Phi teachers would stay. It seems natural that one day Mattie would go to college (Iowa State at Ames) and become a Pi Phi herself. Jack Huff, Stella Huff and Jim were out of the Pi Phi School when I was there, but Mattie was in high school and Blanche was in 5th or 6th grade. Many happy times, and delicious meals, were enjoyed at the Huff's Hotel, The Mountain View. Shortly after I arrived a big room with a huge stone fireplace at one end was added, where the teachers often gathered to enjoy the warmth of the fire and the "tall tales" Jack and Jim were always telling us. I arrived earlier than most of the other teachers, as the Home Economics Department was just being organized. I had to make plans for my cooking laboratory, go into Knoxville and buy supplies, get material for the curtains at the windows and plan how my morning cooking classes could prepare every school day the lunch for all of the teachers. Besides that I had to plan for the cooking class I would have at the Sugarlands one afternoon each week. I would ride Lady, my horse, the six miles there. Then one afternoon a week I rode to Cartertown for a sewing class. That school had no desks, only benches and when the children wrote they sat on the floor and used their benches as desks. By the middle of August when the school opened, the other teachers had arrived. There was Margaret White, Harmo Taylor, Helen Barrett, Marian Folsom, Emily Burton, Gene Redding and Lois Rogers. In reading over my diary I find many references to our school truck, or station wagon. It was our only means, other than by foot or horse back, to go anywhere, and often nine or ten teachers would go, for a day, to some other community or into Knoxville for a taste of city living and a big dinner of meat at the Farragut Hotel. B.Y.P.U. (Baptist Young People Union) was a part of our life too. I remember when I applied for a position at the school, one of the questions I had 17 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI to answer was, "will you be willing to take part in church activities ?" We all did take part, every Sun-day evening in the little white Baptist Church house, so close to the school. The teachers often led the young peoples meetings. We played the organ and helped lead the singing. Sunday evening and church were an important part of our lives. The Barn was more than a barn. On Friday nights fast and rough basketball games were held in the loft and on Saturday nights "old movies" were shown. All the teachers, students, townspeople and summer people came to these. If you think TV shows old movies, you should have seen the "old movies" of 1925. But it was Social Life and fun. In September we had our Fair. My diary tells of the canned fruits and tomatoes and jelly my cooking classes exhibited and the sewing classes had note-books of samples of stitches and seams. The Fair was more than a school project, it was a community project. I was clerk at the Fair and note that we took our exhibit to the County Fair at Sevierville, where our school exhibit won 1st place, then on to the Knoxville Fair. We always went to the fairs of other communities and I was judge many times of canned goods, baked foods, butter, etc. Once I was even asked at the Pittman Fair to judge 1st and 2nd place of two old old hand woven coverlets. They were both perfectly beautiful and intricate. How could I judge? I finally gave the Blue Ribbon to the one I liked best and the Red Ribbon to the other. I remembered our laundress, Martha Clabo, with one crippled hand, who washed all of our clothes on a washboard, and boiled them outside in a big black kettle over a wood fire. She ironed them all too and we paid fifty cents a week, no matter how few or many pieces we had in the wash. Then there were the "Harp singin's." I went the first time expecting to see harps, but discovered it was so called because Mr. Harp wrote the song book. The notes are all different shapes, triangles, circles, squares, etc. Each shape tells whether it is for the soprano, bass, alto or tenor. How those mountain people could sing. The leader sounded his tuning fork and away they went. It really was beautiful. I wonder if harp singing has been forgotten, if so it is too bad to lose such an interesting art. I remember mounting "Lady" with my saddlebags full of new style patterns and riding off up Roarin' Fork, or Baskin's Creek, or once a week in the summer fifteen miles away to conduct adult classes in community the meadow City of Gatlinburg. as a public parking lot and for Chamber of Commerce building. Pi Beta Phi has deeded land to Sevier County, for the construction of a new elementary school building. The White School building built in 1914 and the Rock building built in 1928 by Pi Beta Phi havesewing. Really, most of the women sewed very well, but they were hungry for new style dresses and they loved the patterns I brought. Then there were our weekend trips, usually on foot, to Alum Cave over the mountain to North Carolina on foot to Elkmont. We climbed Mt. Le Conte with jack and Jim to guide us straight up the mountainside. There was no easy trail then, we just climbed up. the mountain, with Jack urging us on. When we would ask how much farther to the top, he'd say, "It's just around the corner." Teaching at Gatlinburg gave us an opportunity to meet many interesting wonderful people. Aunt Lydia lived in a little one room house up the mountainside. She kept her potatoes from freezing by putting them under the floor boards in front of her fireplace. When we went to see her we always wore skirts and a hat to cover our bobbed hair, for she would take us to task and quote from the Bible where "It is an abomination unto the Lord for a woman to put on the raiment of man or to be shorn of her hair." Mr. and Mrs. Hall were retired and lived in a lovely house overlooking Gatlinburg and the Little Pigeon River. They often invited us teachers to their home and served us delicacies we would never have otherwise. Mrs. Duffield, who had an adorable little house, would invite us up occasionally for waffles and sausages and a pleasant evening around her fire. Of course, when the Settlement School Commit-tee came, we loved it. Nita Hill Stark was Chairman then and Mr. Stark would drive us in his big car to Knoxville for a wonderful dinner. There were trips to the Sugarlands and a night in Helen Chew's little three room cabin, furnished entirely with handmade mountain furniture. Our life as teachers at the school was very simple, but fun and healthful. Some evenings we would all sing to Miss Evelyn's playing, or listen to her read some book aloud. We took on mountain ways and went to bed early. We got up early too. Some of us had looms in our rooms. I still have the first towel I ever wove. It has very uneven edges. Anyone who has been to the Smoky Mountain National Park knows of its beauty. It is good to know the lovely holly, balsam, laurel and rhododendron, galax leaves and bear moss are being saved. I like to think that the school, besides all of it's other accomplishments, was instrumental in bringing this beautiful area to the attention of the world. rooted interest in the selling 2.2 acres of House to the (Continued from page 1 S) of Gatlinburg by served their original purpose well and will be re-in front of Staff placed.

Her Dedication Leads to Canadian Bench Marjorie Montgomery Bowker, Alberta Alpha, Is First Woman to Hold Such an Office Dedicated interest in problems ranging from child welfare to penal institution conditions has led an Alberta Alpha Pi Phi, to the post and responsibility of Judge of the Juvenile and Family Courts for the Province of Alberta, Canada, the highest judicial post ever to be held by a woman in Canada. A Pi Phi sister, Ruth Bowen, Women's Editor of the Edmonton journal, is the one who points out that Judge Bowker's direction toward this high honor was involuntary. She wrote, "Her steps had no conscious direction toward a judge's chair . . . but Mrs. W. F. Bowker is one woman with the social conscience to have impelled her to make voluntary investigations into the problems of child welfare, juvenile delinquency, the state of prisons in Alberta." Judge Bowker's appointment came in June, 1966. Prior to her appointment Canada had known three woman magistrates, two appointed in 1916 and an-other appointed in 1964. Under a former judicial system, all magistrates had the powers of a juvenile Court Judge for the locality where they served. In 1952, a new structure of juvenile and Family Courts was established in the Province and Mrs. Bowker is the first woman to be appointed judge in this provincial court. She has said that she feels her experience in three areas has been useful to her in her new position. These are her study and research over a number of years in the field of juvenile delinquency and penal reform; her visitation, with official approval, of all correctional institutions in Alberta in 1963; her rather thorough study of the Child Welfare situation in Alberta, through membership on the Provincial Adoption Committee, which included visitation of all child-care and youth-serving facilities in the Province. (She was the only woman on this three-member committee). Her visitation to every jail and custodial institution in Alberta was at her own request in an effort to see first hand the conditions under which both women and juvenile delinquents lived in these institutions. Ruth Bowen wrote, "Her own research led her all over the province to consult with welfare workers in the field and to gain an education in human problems . . . she knocked on doors to see living conditions for herself . . . out of this grew another area of concern, the problems of the retarded. Her report on preventive health services is now being studied by the premier and minister of health." Mrs. Bowker graduated from the University of Alberta in Arts and Law, and was admitted to the bar Judge Marjorie Montgomery Bowker of Alberta in 1940. She met her husband, Wilbur F. Bowker, Dean of Law, University of Alberta, while both were practicing with an Edmonton law firm. She carried on her husband's practice with the firm while he was in active service during World War II. The Bowkers have three children, sons, Blair, 18 and Keith Wilbur, 14, and daughter, Lorna Ethel, 16. Across the years she has been active in Y.W.C.A. activities; has served as an executive member of two major social concern agencies in Edmonton; and is the first woman to be appointed to the University of Alberta Hospital Board. She is a member of the junior League and was to be one of the guest panelists at the Junior League of America's national convention in Montreal, May, 1967. Mrs. Bowker has been a loyal and active Pi Phi since her initiation in 1936. She was secretary of her chapter; she served two different terms as president of the Edmonton Alumnae Club. She was active in initiating the Canadian Project and served as its first Western Representative following its establishment. She was on the Alberta Alpha Alumnae Advisory Committee for six years. 19
