The chairman had written that ieeting would take all of a week. She not imagine what could fill that much However she soon found out. For seven the committee met, morning, noon and , with the final meeting on the morning eighth day. st the minutes of last year's meeting read after which it was noted that the )vements and repairs ordered had all made. Everyone was pleased with the al appearance of the buildings and ids. The reports of the members of the iittee were read and their recommendadiscussed. Reports were given by the or and other members of the staff and recommendations considered. These reports showed the excellent work done and they reflected the fine spirit of the staff. Several resignations were received and accepted with regret. The buildings were all inspected and the most needed repairs allowed after costs had been carefully considered. The crowded condition of the grade and high school buildings was considered and it was decided to move the weaving into the woodcraft building, thus relieving the congestion. At a meeting with the local committee, the question of the third and fourth years of high school was brought up and discussed. After careful investigation, it was decided that, if the local people would get the required number, which is fifty, of high school pupils and the county would furnish another teacher, the third year would be added. The articles of incorporation of the South THE NOVEMBER ARROW ern Highlanders, Inc., were carefully studied and it was decided to buy the shares of stock which allow our products to be sold at the Norris shop. The budgets for the school and for Arrow Craft were carefully worked out. Applications for teaching positions were gone over and all vacancies filled. Winogene Redding was employed as weaving supervisor. County and state officials were consulted and as much financial aid as possible was obtained. Many matters of less importance were taken up and settled. It was the great pleasure of the committee to have the Grand Council at several of the meetings and their advice was most valuable. Visits with them around the dining table and on the porches in rest periods were delightful. The committee enjoyed with them the dinner given by Stella Huff at the Moun-taro View Hotel and the firs Gatlinburg Alumni Club.

THE STAFF By EUNICE WEAVER Let us introduce to you the new members of our staff for 1935-36, a most interesting and welcome group. Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher at the Claiborne county high school last year, is our vocational agriculture teacher, and is very shy and dignified. Gussie Smith, Tennessee University, our home economics teacher, who has had four years of elementary experience in the state, is small, vivacious, and much interested in her work. Ben Fleming, one of our own former dormitory students, who worked his way through the Settlement School six years ago, graduated at Tusculum College with honors last spring and is now one of our high school teachers. He lives at Pigeon Forge and brings six students with him every morning to school. Mary Louise Durkee, Nevada A, Reno, Nevada, came a long way to take charge of the third and fourth grades, and Pauline Camp-bell, Oregon B, whose former home was California, has second and third grades. These attractive western girls have adjusted them-selves to the settlement work easily, and Mary Louise plays accompaniments to the children's songs. Rosemary Moorehead, Illinois H, fifth andsixth grade teacher, and 13; Illinois H, our new bookk Decatur, Illinois, graduates t University last spring. They from the start and Rosemary Those who returned to us troduction are William Kin) anor Brabson, primary; Mil grade; and Stella Huff, hig all Tennesseeans.

The weaving on display comes from as many as six different localities, but I was glad to add one of our prize winning peasant runners along with others not quite so famous. It was nice to have someone come in to our Arrow Craft shop not long after and tell us how well our natural linen luncheon set had looked on the table. I am sure there must have been some hot days there this summer from the number of fans of Arlena's making that were carried away. I hope many of you this coming year may see this Norris shop in person and it is my greatest wish that you all come to "The Great Smoky Mountain Park" and say hello to your Settlement School in pdssing.

A letter to Mrs. Roosevelt brought the following reply: THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON September 19, 1935 MY DEAR MRS.

REDDING G Gatlinburg again! And how happy I am to be back here in my old job. Since I came back, I have been thinking of the changes that have taken place since I came here ten years ago. Then the new road was completed as far as our front gate and a journey beyond there was an endurance test for the most hardy. The road has gone through various stages since then. It has been widened twice, each time taking off a slice of Pi Phi land. Then the "black road" came with a bridge over Baskin's Creek down by the Arrow Craft Shop and we could count ourselves as actually being a part of the world. Now they tell us that we are to have another newer road that will be a modern concrete highway. We are hoping that sidewalks will be provided, be-cause our winding, narrow road through the Burg is a dangerous highway for both pedestrians and cars, and wrecks are frequent occurrences. When I think of the lovely little country road that wound along beside the Little Pigeon river with no views obstructed by buildings, and now walk along our road cluttered with the hot-dog stands, four filling stations, seven gift shops not including two of Arrow Craft, dance halls, tea rooms, and tourist camps, I wonder if the world has not descended upon us too rapidly. Is it possible for the hundreds of young people living here to have the highest ideals of life among it all ? Pi Phi has the greatest opportunity for service that has ever been here, to work among the young people who are through school and to show them how much healthy and clean recreation can mean in their lives. Almost more amazing than the change in the road is the growth of the rest of the town. From the hill above the hotel overlooking the Roaring Fork valley road where ten years ago we could see four houses, one can now see sixty-five. It looks like a city subdivision, and that is only one small section. Last year when a survey of the town was made for telephone service purposes, they found 1,000 people living within a half mile of the post office. Now we have a telephone exchange and the school number is Gatlinburg 64. As the Park bought up the land and homes in the mountains, the families have moved into the burg or to better mountain farms in nearby sections that are not included in the Park area.

Our )eople worked assiduously and by the chool started fifty-eight enrolled. The contests of corn shucking, wrestling, horse-shoe pitching, target, and baseball took place. One of the most interesting contests was when twenty beautiful babies were carried on to the stage by proud mothers and a group of men had to decide which was the prettiest. Much credit for the fine and sturdy appearance of these youngsters should go to Virginia Moore, the school nurse, and her health program. A group, of the oldest of the settlers were entertained at the school for a noonday dinner. Others enjoyed picnic dinners. The pro-gram was resumed in the afternoon. Mr. E. N. Clabo, president of the organization, made an excellent presiding officer. This day, which was started by the school in order to preserve the old time customs, is a most interesting and worthwhile community project. D YEA county furnished the teacher, Ben Fleming, so the third year is an accomplished fact. The moving of the weaving to Wood Craft made room available for the extra classes. Next year these third year pupils will be ready for the fourth. In order to add the fourth year and get county funds for the teachers' salaries there must be seventy-five enrolled in high school.

The chairman had written that ieeting would take all of a week. She not imagine what could fill that much However she soon found out. For seven the committee met, morning, noon and , with the final meeting on the morning eighth day. st the minutes of last year's meeting read after which it was noted that the )vements and repairs ordered had all made. Everyone was pleased with the al appearance of the buildings and ids. The reports of the members of the iittee were read and their recommendadiscussed. Reports were given by the or and other members of the staff and recommendations considered. These reports showed the excellent work done and they reflected the fine spirit of the staff. Several resignations were received and accepted with regret. The buildings were all inspected and the most needed repairs allowed after costs had been carefully considered. The crowded condition of the grade and high school buildings was considered and it was decided to move the weaving into the woodcraft building, thus relieving the congestion. At a meeting with the local committee, the question of the third and fourth years of high school was brought up and discussed. After careful investigation, it was decided that, if the local people would get the required number, which is fifty, of high school pupils and the county would furnish another teacher, the third year would be added. The articles of incorporation of the South THE NOVEMBER ARROW ern Highlanders, Inc., were carefully studied and it was decided to buy the shares of stock which allow our products to be sold at the Norris shop. The budgets for the school and for Arrow Craft were carefully worked out. Applications for teaching positions were gone over and all vacancies filled. Winogene Redding was employed as weaving supervisor. County and state officials were consulted and as much financial aid as possible was obtained. Many matters of less importance were taken up and settled. It was the great pleasure of the committee to have the Grand Council at several of the meetings and their advice was most valuable. Visits with them around the dining table and on the porches in rest periods were delightful. The committee enjoyed with them the dinner given by Stella Huff at the Moun-taro View Hotel and the firs Gatlinburg Alumni Club.

THE STAFF By EUNICE WEAVER Let us introduce to you the new members of our staff for 1935-36, a most interesting and welcome group. Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher at the Claiborne county high school last year, is our vocational agriculture teacher, and is very shy and dignified. Gussie Smith, Tennessee University, our home economics teacher, who has had four years of elementary experience in the state, is small, vivacious, and much interested in her work. Ben Fleming, one of our own former dormitory students, who worked his way through the Settlement School six years ago, graduated at Tusculum College with honors last spring and is now one of our high school teachers. He lives at Pigeon Forge and brings six students with him every morning to school. Mary Louise Durkee, Nevada A, Reno, Nevada, came a long way to take charge of the third and fourth grades, and Pauline Camp-bell, Oregon B, whose former home was California, has second and third grades. These attractive western girls have adjusted them-selves to the settlement work easily, and Mary Louise plays accompaniments to the children's songs. Rosemary Moorehead, Illinois H, fifth andsixth grade teacher, and 13; Illinois H, our new bookk Decatur, Illinois, graduates t University last spring. They from the start and Rosemary Those who returned to us troduction are William Kin) anor Brabson, primary; Mil grade; and Stella Huff, hig all Tennesseeans.

The furniture comes from the different centers. There are artistic shelves with carved animals, hand-hammered pewter, and lovely pottery. The weaving on display comes from as many as six different localities, but I was glad to add one of our prize winning peasant runners along with others not quite so famous. It was nice to have someone come in to our Arrow Craft shop not long after and tell us how well our natural linen luncheon set had looked on the table. I am sure there must have been some hot days there this summer from the number of fans of Arlena's making that were carried away. I hope many of you this coming year may see this Norris shop in person and it is my greatest wish that you all come to "The Great Smoky Mountain Park" and say hello to your Settlement School in pdssing.

A letter to Mrs. Roosevelt brought the following reply: THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON September 19, 1935 MY DEAR MRS. HOLTON: Mrs. Roosevelt asks me to tell you in reply to your letter of September 12 that one of the out-fits was made of material woven in your Arrow Craft shop, the other was made here.

REDDING G Gatlinburg again! And how happy I am to be back here in my old job. Since I came back, I have been thinking of the changes that have taken place since I came here ten years ago. Then the new road was completed as far as our front gate and a journey beyond there was an endurance test for the most hardy. The road has gone through various stages since then. It has been widened twice, each time taking off a slice of Pi Phi land. Then the "black road" came with a bridge over Baskin's Creek down by the Arrow Craft Shop and we could count ourselves as actually being a part of the world. Now they tell us that we are to have another newer road that will be a modern concrete highway. We are hoping that sidewalks will be provided, be-cause our winding, narrow road through the Burg is a dangerous highway for both pedestrians and cars, and wrecks are frequent occurrences. When I think of the lovely little country road that wound along beside the Little Pigeon river with no views obstructed by buildings, and now walk along our road cluttered with the hot-dog stands, four filling stations, seven gift shops not including two of Arrow Craft, dance halls, tea rooms, and tourist camps, I wonder if the world has not descended upon us too rapidly. Is it possible for the hundreds of young people living here to have the highest ideals of life among it all ? Pi Phi has the greatest opportunity for service that has ever been here, to work among the young people who are through school and to show them how much healthy and clean recreation can mean in their lives. Almost more amazing than the change in the road is the growth of the rest of the town. From the hill above the hotel overlooking the Roaring Fork valley road where ten years ago we could see four houses, one can now see sixty-five. It looks like a city subdivision, and that is only one small section. Last year when a survey of the town was made for telephone service purposes, they found 1,000 people living within a half mile of the post office. Now we have a telephone exchange and the school number is Gatlinburg 64. As the Park bought up the land and homes in the mountains, the families have moved into the burg or to better mountain farms in nearby sections that are not included in the Park area. The Smoky Mountain National Park offices are located in the yard c Huff's Mountain View Hotel, there an CCC camps nearby, Knoxville people summer homes here, and tourists pour ii town by thousands during the year, f Winogene Redding, at left, in her office talk a weaver. mountains are still unspoiled and be All this contributes to the hustle and of this little town. No wonder Arro,N sales increase each year. We have the c tion of being the only people with twc in town, one in the lobby of the Mc View Hotel, and our little white, tree-: shop at the junction of the Mill Cree and the main highway. To me the most interesting grow been in the Arrow Craft Shop. It was ten years ago, now it is a very importand of the lives of these mountain people. I came, there were about twelve people ing for the school. Last year there were five. I started teaching under the porch of Cottage and my office was any chair pened to be sitting in at the moment. li years I progressed to fine quarters in ti high school, and now we have just into the wonderfully equipped bu formerly the Woodcraft Shop, that Mi Voorheis so generously gave to the We have five well-lighted and ver rooms for our supplies, office, waiting for the women, and the large loom to.

OLD TIME S' DAY , nd Council and the committee were ted that Old Timers' Day was scheduled me 22, making it possible for all of :o attend. The weather was fine and at A.M. people could be seen coming from ections, although the program did not until nine. At that time the school rium was full to capacity, with every ken and as many more standing. There two or three hundred more in the is, making close to a thousand in at-Ice. program was varied, the various con-;Lich as hog calling, husband calling, man, oldest woman, spinning, weaved carding were interspersed with all of mountain singing. The ballad and inging, and the guitar and banjo play-!re most popular. The address was given ige Paine of Sevierville. Out-of-door THE THI committee agreed to add the third year high school if the local committee canvass the community and obtain the x of pupils required, and if the county pay for the additional teacher required. ate law of Tennessee requires fifty pu-)r a high school in transitional stage two-year to a four-year course. Our )eople worked assiduously and by the chool started fifty-eight enrolled. The contests of corn shucking, wrestling, horse-shoe pitching, target, and baseball took place. One of the most interesting contests was when twenty beautiful babies were carried on to the stage by proud mothers and a group of men had to decide which was the prettiest. Much credit for the fine and sturdy appearance of these youngsters should go to Virginia Moore, the school nurse, and her health program. A group, of the oldest of the settlers were entertained at the school for a noonday dinner. Others enjoyed picnic dinners. The pro-gram was resumed in the afternoon. Mr. E. N. Clabo, president of the organization, made an excellent presiding officer. This day, which was started by the school in order to preserve the old time customs, is a most interesting and worthwhile community project. D YEA county furnished the teacher, Ben Fleming, so the third year is an accomplished fact. The moving of the weaving to Wood Craft made room available for the extra classes. Next year these third year pupils will be ready for the fourth. In order to add the fourth year and get county funds for the teachers' salaries there must be seventy-five enrolled in high school. The local committee is working toward that end. SCHOOL N TES From MRS. WEAVER'S LETTERS Kendall, Northwestern bacteriologist, 1. fine address on opening day, and the sham was filled.

Miss Ambrose, state supervisor of home demonstration, had THE NOVEMBER ARROW charge and short talks were given by Mrs. Weaver, Mr. King, and Gussie Smith. The women saw the shops, the hotel and the school and left saying they had had a good time and would be back next year. There was just one Pi Phi among them, Mrs. Raymond Mitchell, Virginia A, Union City, Tennessee. She had not been to the school before and had not seen a Pi Phi since 1920, so the visit gave her quite a thrill. Dorothy MacLean, who now lives in Gat linburg, does excellent photography.
