        78 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI The following data compiled as of April 1, 1927 illustrates the re suits for the year to that date: 1. Living in owned or rented houses Living in apartments NO houses or apartments 2. Collecting dues monthly Collecting dues quarterly 3. Making regular financial reports Making irregular financial reports Making no reports 4. Total owing by delinquent members (under $100) Total owing by delinquent members (over $100) Total owing by delinquent members (none) Chapters not reporting 5. Total cash gain to date (over $200) Total cash gain to date (under $200) Loss to date (over $200) Loss to date (under $200) Chapters not reporting 6. 6 chapters received a grade of 100-sending in absolutely correct reports on time. 44 more chapters received a grade of 90 or better-sending in reports with minor errcrs on time. 11 more chapters received a grade of 80 or better-sending in late reports or incorrect ones. 10 more chapters received a grade under 80-principally on account of late reports. 7. Only two chapters started the year 1926-1927 with a red balance amounting tc $132.81. Six had a red balance April 1st, amounting to $2014.89. Total opening cash balances for school year ..$18,318.84 Total balances April 1, 1927 29,279.17 Gain of $10,960.33 Sixteen chapters operating houses showed a gain to April 1 of from $400 to $3000, while 3 chapters not operating houses showed a gain of from $200 to $350. The experience of this office during the past two years has shown that the majority of chapters failing to obtain a, high grade, has been due to their lack of cooperation, either by failing to send in their re ports on time, or by neglecting to put the correct information on the report. We would suggest that the president of each chapter make it her duty to see that the finance committee meets with the house treasurer and corrects each report before it is sent to this office. As a result of this conference, the finance committee can not only see that the de tails of the report are correct, but can advise the treasurer as to necessary adjustments in income and expenditures. One message we hope the delegates will take with them from their Financial Accounting Supervisor is the danger of special assessments. The majority of well organized chapters have no special assessment REPORTS Or OFTICERS 79 outside telephone tolls, all entertainments being budgeted in the chap-ter department and fully covered by the chapter income. It is advised to designate one member of the finance committee, social treasurer, and pay over to her from each chapter assessment, whether monthly or quarterly, a specified amount per girl for entertainment purposes. She can then keep her own 'bank account, and record of receipts of expenditures. This is good training for a future treasurer. In concluding I wish to thank the members of the Grand Council and all chapters for their splendid cooperation and encouragement during the past two years. MARIE FREEMAN PALMER Report of Chairman of Settlement School Committee V term, as Chairman of the Settlement School of Pi Beta Phi, is ended. My love, my interest, and my work as an individual, will continue so long as I have strength in mp body and mind to carry on. Each year I have handed in my report with happiness knowing that there were further goals to conquer, but this year it comes with regrets, not that this term has not been more successful than usual, but because I shall miss that intimate touch with those who have laboured so devotedly with me in this greatest of achievements. If I have given anything of merit, I ,am pleased. The personal contacts with everyone connected with the interests of the School have surely benefitted me. To all who have served so unselfishly, especially the Committee and the School staff, 1 can only say that in my heart is the deepest and sincerest feelings of gratitude and love. With appreciation I acknowledge the work of the Grand Officers, for without their confidence and counsel we should have been greatly handicapped. The Province Presidents and Vice Presidents, alumnte clubs and active chapters as well as individuals by their untiring efforts have enabled the committee to succeed in its plans. The School is becoming a real problem, not that it has not always been one, but more so naw, especially the Industrial Department which I shall speak of further on in my report. We commenced the school year with a change in handling of the finances by placing at Gatlinburg the bookkeeping and collecting, and leaving the control of finances and investments with the treasurer. In another year all unfortunate problems that have arisen will be successfully worked out. No radical change is ever without difficulties its first year. The treasurer has been greatly handicapped 'by certain officers failing to send in their donation until after the books have been closed. One Province Vice President sent in a donation, which had been received some months earlier, quite a time after the treasurer had closed her books. Miss Curryer, in trying to make all contented when such THE ARROW OP' PI BETA PHI ,es have arisen, has reopened her books. The committee feels as she that all late contributions from now on will have to receive recogion the following year. Miss Curryer has been painstaking, conscientious and faithful in treasury work, and her ideas have been valuable to the School. It 3 caused her no little work to reorganize completely the treasury de-!tment. Mrs. Agnes Miller Turner, secretary and publicity member for the :tlement School Committee, reports that she feels that a more conitrated effort should be made, educating actives for alunan mems. I know in Dallas, Texas there are over eighty-five alumnae, but y twenty-four take any interest in the club. If the active chapters re required to, hold two Settlement School programs annually, they uld be better acquainted with this splendid work, thereby taking ,re interest in alumnte club activities. Mrs. Turner has been an in-ration to the committee. Her ardent zeal combined with ability kes her a valuable asset to any organization. The School shall miss as she retires from the committee this year. If you have read the row articles that she has edited, you have certainly become more ightened concerning the Settlement School. Mrs. Geare has continued her work of interesting Pi Phis who ve not been connected with any alunmm club. She reports that 'ough the efforts of Miss Margaret White and herself 29 new clubs re been organized, and by this time probably a few more. This has gin. a praiseworthy achievement because all members of Pi Beta Phi mld have the chance to take part in such an undertaking. 'To Mrs. are, the School feels deeply indebted. Mrs. Freeman, the Ways and Means member of the committee has 1 charge of the slides. She strongly urges that province officers ar-Ige an itinerary of these slides for their respective clubs or chapters order to, expedite delivery and save expenses. By the time an 3wer goes to the far West clubs and back, a nearby club has the les, this entailing more correspondence. Mrs. Freeman has served acting chairman during my prolonged stay abroad, carrying on her n work on the committee, besides being president of the active xeland Club and doing my work too, cheerful, willing and efficient has been. Her services cannot be measured other than to say when has a task to do, it is done the best way. It has been the aims of the committee to foster several new ideas s year. For four years we have needed an industrial building, and ay our dreams are being realized. It is started and our hopes ex t to be ready for use in October. Had ,we .more funds, we could aplete the building so badly needed. The Hazel Todd Meaden cot-e at the Emma Harper Turner Center in the Sugarlands is now be-used, and we of the committee "modestly" assert that it is a dear. have striven to place the industrial department on paying basis, REPORTS Or OrrICERS 81 our woven goods are very nearly perfect, and by their excellence and attractiveness the sales have jumped by leaps and bounds. Four years ago we sold about $1000 worth of products ; three years ago the sales were about $4000 ; last year $7000; and this year over $14,000. I can-not quote accurately as I have not the exact figures here on the boat with me. Let me add that this does not mean profit but it could be so had we the space for more looms and storage. Miss Redding is most efficient, and has the happy faculty of getting the women to take advantage of her instructions. Their loyalty to the School is commend-able. The school work on the whole has been good, weak in spots 'tis true, due entirely to congested quarters. The time is now ripe for a high type man principal who can revise and supervise the entire curriculum. The attendance despite continuous epidemics of every known disease has been good. Congested conditions, no auditorium, primary work in the teacher's cottage, inadequate agriculture and home economics quarters have had to be overcome, but not without a great deal of distress to the teachers. To say they were handicapped does not ex-press the true situation, but to say that they were efficient, willing and wonderfully good sports might convey in a small degree the high regard the committee holds for them. Miss Bishop in her usual modest way has conducted the School through trying circumstances. Her patience and personality are attributes not often found in one person. Her leadership has certainly made the duties of the committee easier. Mr. Mattil, director of the Smith-Hughes Agriculture Department a proven friend to the School in every way, Miss Steele, domestic economy instructor, and Miss Ryman the nurse, have done much in their respective lines, and though not members of Pi Beta Phi, they have been as faithful. It was with deep regret that the committee had to accept the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higginbotham, who left us to become supervisor of nurses for the State of Tennessee. Miss Bishop's report is as usual so full of interesting details that it shall be printed in full in the Arrow. I shall not take your time here to read it, if each of you promise to read it 'when published. Whenever we think of our extensive work, we just "burst with pride." When we think of the opposition in years past, and now, those natives clamour for Pi Beta Phi to direct, we naturally feel that we have accomplished something. The Emma Harper Turner center at Sugarlands is only the beginning, some day when we shall have sufficient funds, we shall develop other fields demanding Pi Phi super-vision, as we have at Gatlinburg. Do you know that the Department of Education of Tennessee considers Miss Chew the most capable teacher of rural adult education. Five o'clock each morning she arises in order to carry out her very full program for the day. In age her 82 THE ARROW PI BETA PHI pupils range from sixteen to forty-two, they adore her and counsel with her. Her value to the community is immeasureable. During the past year she has been ably assisted by two teachers, one a Pi Phi, the other a graduate of Gatlinburg. The new school building and the cottage named in honor of Mrs. Hazel Todd Meaden, certainly afford these girls comfort, though living in so isolated a section deserves the highest commendation. This report has been more or less a general survey of all, and below, I shall enumerate concisely a few of the outstanding achievements of the past year: 1 .Constructing the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage. 2. The New Sugarlands' School building by the County, but fostered by the committee. 3. Farming on a more businesslike basis with efficient supervision and direction of school boys doing the work. 4. Community work done by all. 5. Extension work in Sugarlands and other isolated centers. G. Health Clinics, vaccinations, innoculations (even of 300 dogs for rabies), first aid and hygiene classes, dental clinics. 7. Improving the Industrial Department. a. Excellence of work. b. Establishing better business methods. 8. Encouraging the raising of pedigreed stock and poultry. 9. Beautifying around the property. 10. Publicity of the School throughout the Pi Beta Phi realm. 11. Installing bookkeeping and collecting department at Gatlinburg. 12. Opening Arrowcraft business. 13. Installing incubator and brooder houses. 14. Central Dining rooms started. Thus concisely stating these achievements we realize our efforts have not been in vain. In, closing this, my last report, after five years of intimate con-tact with the Settlement School, I would feel derelict in my duties, did I not gaze into the future and make a few suggestions as to what I hope may be accomplished. The School was organized to do Settlement work and this aim has never been lost to view. While the problems of today are not those of yesterday, the needs are just as pressing. The time has probably come to turn over to the people the lower grade work, so that they might organize a consolidated school. This does not mean a cessation of effort but a redoubled one along the line of health and industry. The people are beginning to feel the effects of business direction in basketry and weaving, and it is no far-fetched dream to see the bur-den of expense carried by these industries. The higher educational REPORTS OP OrrICERS influences are yet to be developed and probably will never be ale academic lines. Better health and better babies are things the communities seeking, and Gatlinburg, Sugarlands and other places within our fluenee are not behind the rest of the world in wanting them. Ext^ sion is still calling and while the frontiers will never be as primit as was Gatlinburg, yet conditions are still indescribably bad. I do not see the time when Pi Beta Phi will leave Tenness but I do see the time when our great work will be known, valued a praised throughout the country. Things will never go smoothly for us and I hasten to say that hope they never will, because things are worth little more than wl they cost us in time, effort and heartache. The Settlement School id is a .success that I know you will join me in proclaiming. That will continue to be so I am sure you will join me in pledging. If I have failed to thank by name in this report all who have h a part in our labours, I include them here, and add to them the nan of the whole fraternity who have given me the opportunity to serve Beta Phi. With this I bid you goodbye and join the ranks of 1 pasts, who are working for the best interests of our fraternity. NITA HILL STARK Report of Head Resident Pi Beta Phi Settlement Scho( 19264927 N submitting the report for the year 1926-27 I find that the have been fewer changes or outstanding events than in alm any year previous. It has not been necessary to make a changes in staff during the year, the different departments hi carried on about as usual and at the close of the year I feel we ( say it has been a year of good average work. The staff has been : Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident. Mabel Schuckman a'nd Ruby RS man, nurses. Margaret White, Principal of School, high school teacher. Marion Folsom, high school teacher. Dora Chapin, 3rd and 4th grades. Elmer Watson, 5th and 6th grades, athletics. Emily Burton, 1st and 2nd grades. ,Dorothy Trainer, Kindergarten and primer. Jean Steele, Home Economics. O. J. Mattil, Smith Hughes Agriculture. Winogene Redding, Weaving. LaDelle Allen, Bookkeeper and office assistant. Anna Dowell, Supervisor, boys' dormitory, noon lunch for prim children. Mrs. E. A.

Cora McCarter, Sugarlands School. Lillie Reagan, Assistant to the nurse. Otha Reagan, Supervisor of student labor, farmer. Leander McCarter, General Labor. Lizzie Reagan, Cook. Mrs. McCarter, Ccok. ScHoor, The enrollment for the past year falls a very little below the nunilast year as there has been no consolidation whatever. The at-mace from our local community has been a little larger. The only reason we cannot show a much better attendance is be e of the epidemics that have visited us. Measles were raging school opened in the fall and continued for a good part of the chicken pox, flu and mumps followed and practically everyone, tnd young, had them. The school work has gone on easier than usual, no doubt due to few changes in the teaching staff. Miss Burton returned, after a 's absence, for her ninth school year and taught the first and see-grades. Her work was made easier because of the kindergarten primer classes carried on in the dining-room of the Teacher's Cot-by Miss Trainer. This experiment was tried out this past year while we have no doubt of the need and of the good work done I eel that with finances low we should try to get along without it year. Mrs. Chapin taught the third and fourth grades and did splendid She came with the understanding she would supervise the es up to the seventh, but it proved very hard to do as that had Been the custom in the past. lean Steele taught one double period high school class in hotde omics each school day. Cdr. Mattil taught two double period high school classes each day. Winogene Redding taught one double period high. school class each With the full schedule of regular work the boys and girls were very busy in school and it seemed as though every minute was pied out of school hours. [t does not seem wise to carry more than two years of high school : for the present. .Our first year class is large but the second class the past year had only two pupils in it. The roads are good gh now so pupils can go to Sevierville to school without much :nifty. We had four pupils going back and forth this year. the county superintendent tells us that the two years of high )l work here is accredited but we have not official acknowledge-of this. So far our pupils have had to take ea aminations when .ing accredited high schools in the state. REPORTS OP OFFICERS 85 Elmer Watson does not return next year Margaret White does not expect to, nor does Marion Folsom. If these changes have to come it seems to me it would be the time to put a strong man into the high school department, preferably as principal. I feel strongly that we should have a man in the School. While Mr. Mattil teaches agriculture his work keeps him away from the School practically all of the time, even the classes he conducts are in a separate building and he never has time to be on the play ground even at recess. Were a man put in as principal his work should not be too heavy for him really to have supervision of the whole School. The weak place has always been in regard to supervision, in trying to keep each room a separate unit instead of holding everything together as a whole. Were ,conditions a little different in Sevierville I would make the recommendation this year that we turn back to the county the first six grades. With an eight month's school term, better teachers and salaries in the county and as much improvement as has been made in the past two or three years I believe we should give back to the county the grade work. It would take a year or more for the county to pre-pare to take this but I believe if it did it would make 'Gatlinburg a consolidated school, as it probably never will under present conditions. This does not mean. that I would advise giving up all super-vision of the School, we would not be asked to, the county is glad to employ Pi Phi teachers and would pay as good salaries as we are pay--lug. I firmly believe there is danger of schools of this kind holding on-to work after the county is able to take it over. We would have a big task left if we carried the next four grades, the home economics, agriculture, weaving, health, and community work, and the industrial department. During the year health plays were given by the grade children. At the close of the eight months of school Miss Burton's, Mrs. Chapin's and Mr. Watson's pupils gave three short plays. The usual Christmas program was given. The closing exercises for eighth grades and high schoOl consisted of a play in the nature of a minstrel show, given by the boys glee club, on May 10 and May 20 an address was given by Mr. Charles Sharp of Sevierville. The Red Cross certificates were given to the twelve girls completing the course in Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick and eighth grade certificates were given to twenty-one pupils. This was followed by a little banquet. With school opening as late as September it was necessary to continue until May 20, later than any school in Sevier county. This was tried as an experiment. The pupils have stayed in well as they possibly could but I feel that next year it will be better to open earlier, then if time has to be lost it can be during the first month instead of the last. Surely the first seven grades must begin August 1. In the winter the New York Club obtained passes to New York for Helen Chew so she could be present for the February meeting.

HOME ECONOI\.IICS his department has continued in much the same way as last The outstanding development has been in the community work. lornings are taken up with high school classes in the School. The .00ns are given to classes in different communities. New cornies have been added to the list and more classes held in the Gat-g school for the women and girls. :iss Steele's report gives in detail her work and also shows what of riding it requires. She is faithful to the last degree and no day is bad enough for her to think she should give up a trip for s. M4iss Steele has accomplished almost the impossible in inter-the women in these classes. She also has organized a club that twice a month, the nurse giving a health program one time ; she .ng a home economics one the next meeting. Usually they show (gotten from the University of Tennessee) and have! a special These clubs are well attended and the women do so well. read papers and give talks on the subjects and take a great deal nest. Several feel that we are really meeting a community need :se meetings. REPORTS Or OrricERs 87 Miss White, the State SupervisOr of Home Economics, has recommended to the state that the home economics teacher here be put on full time for community work, the state paying the entire salary. This year the state has been allowing us $1000.00 but on the other hand they asked that we raise Miss, Steele's salary in proportion. Were we to release Miss Steele from school work it would be necessary to have the school home economics taught by one of the other teachers. Last year Barbara Dewell did half-time teaching in the School during the winter months and relieved the other teachers very much but at that time we were carrying three years of high school classes. My definite recommendation regarding this cannot be made until I know surely what the state will do. AGRICULTURE Mr. Mattil's report gives such a detailed account of the activities of this department I will not attempt to list them in my report. The mornings are given to school work, as well as a lot of calls people make here, the afternoons, to community work. Three new communities havel been added to the list of those having evening school work. Much time has to be put into the planning and carrying on of fairs each fall. Before the fairs there are community meetings in a great many schools and these are not only agricultural but usually show pictures relative to better homes and better health. The real development of the work is shown in the number of calls made on Mr. Mattil to advise regarding orchards, stock, farm crops, etc. The chicken business takes much time, too. There are calls to see sick animals, to know what to spray with, what kind of chicken house to build and numberless other questions. Mr. Mattil spent six weeks in Cornell University last summer. I surely hope he will feel he can remain here another year. Boys' DORMITORY The boys' dormitory has been managed better this year than ever before and the end of the year shows the good results. Mrs. Dowell has been faithful to her task, which means a lot when you remember that no other teachers live in the cottage so there never is anyone to relieve her of her cares for even a single night. . With better supervision of the boys' work we have had little trouble. During the fall there were eight boys on the hill but the the close of school found only four there. One boy dropped out of school in the spring, another stayed with a relative, another couldn't keep the smoking regulations, another one was in seventh grade so left as soon as that closed. The only question of discipline has come in regard to smoking. THE ARROW or PI BETA PHI Sirs. Dowell supervised the noon lunch for the children in Dorothy ner's and Emily Burton's rooms, lunch was served in the kindrten room. GIRLS' .DoRmITORY The year has passed unusually well here. There have been from to seven girls in the dormitory and there has been no trouble Lever. Mrs. McCarter and Aunt Lizzie have done the cooking for the .e family, boys, girls and teachers. The plan has worked out very and has proved to be the best way to manage. The changes in fall required comparatively little financial outlay and no changes ny amount in the cottages. The meals have been well balanced and appetizing and I feel we better cared for than those in the average boarding school. While the girls have not had much chance to help with the cooking have done other house work that has kept them busy. The boys stayed week-ends more than the girls have as Saturday farm ^ was always pressing. In both girls' and boys' dormitories there should be a way for those L arge to be relieved as every day and every night makes a pretty [ strain. It was my idea this year to relieve ourselves as much as possible try to have the Burg help bear the burden of the boarding pupils at the end of the year I feel I have made a mistake. Some of our t promising pupils are in homes in the Burg. With the little super-)n the average family gives, the results are not what they should The work for students has been better planned this year and posy we can improve still more another year and have more under our FARM The farm work has been looked after and partially done by Otha gala, under the planning and supervision of Mr. Mattil. Otha has red to be quite a good hand to look after the boys and their work the result has been that the farm is in better condition and the k and chickens have done better this year than ever before. Stu-help is hard to handle, hours are more uncertain, work has to be fully checked up and lots of patience and encouragement used. The reports of the farm, as submitted by Mr. Mattil, show that '0 has been a good amount of production toward the living. We have been able to sell quite a little. The chicken business has e to be quite a thing. During the spring a great many baby chicks e sold and settings given out around the district. These are paid by people returning pullets in the fall. More hay was raised this REPORTS OF' OrrIaRS 89 past year but we are not able to raise all we need yet. Last year we hoped to but failed. Each year, however, shows an improvement in the farm products. STUDENT LABOR Both boys and girls put in most of the out of school hours in work on the place. During the year the boys have their baseball and basketbal to take some outside time but the boys look after the horses, chick-ens, cows, pigs, carrying in the wood, cleaning the schoolhouse, and a great many odd jobs. The girls wait on table, set table, help with the dishes, keep the cottages clean, etc. It is a . big expense to keep the dormitories open but the school shows that those boys and girls living on the place hold out best in their school work. This past year we have felt that the grade of work done by the students was better than ever before and the work better organized. HEALTH The report from this department shows that there have been several changes during the year. Phyllis Higinbotham left in the early spring of 1926. Mabel Sthuckman' came at once and remained four months. She was a fine nurse and hard worker and had she been con-tent in the country might have remained. She did not, however, care to stay so Ruby Ryman took her place in the fall of 1926. She came just in time to assist with the largest tonsil and, adenoid clinic we have ever had and to be with Miss Schuckman long enough to get a good idea of the work and to become somewhat acquainted. Miss Ryman has carried out an extensive health program in the schools. The toxin, antitoxin, and typhoid clinics were very large. During much of the winter time both Sevierville and Pittman Center were without nurses so many long trips were made by our nurse, giving inoculations to school children in 'Green Briar, Emerts Cove, Smoky Mountain and Wears Valley. It was possible to make longer trips this year as roads were bet-ter, where they had been improved, and a car could be used quite a good deal. On the other hand, the roads that were bad were awful as we had a rainy winter. The transportation problem was acute during the time' Mr. Matti, Jean Steele and Ruby Ryman all needed horses the same afternoons, but they all lived through, even the horses and cars, and now the family is on very good terms again. With better roads it is much easier for the doctors to keep their afternoons at the office. The dentist comes twice a month now and always has full work. There have been several very successful clinics. There has been quite a change in the nature of work done at the center and through the community. This change has been coming for 90 THE ARROW OF' PI BETA PHI several years. While we would not want too much of the home and bedside work to stop we are glad to see the work on a health educatinal basis. Night calls for the nurse are few now and calls that should be for a doctor instead of a nurse are fewer. Having telephone connections with Sevierville and Knoxville has helped tremendously. Miss Hyman likes and understands the mountain people and if she is satisfied to continue I feel she can do well. She will have to be in college six weeks this summer taking a public health course and I am not sure she will return after that. We must continue trying to locate a Pi Phi nurse, one who will come with the idea of staying more than a few months. Frequent changes in any department handicap the work very much. During all these changes we have been very fortunate in having Lillie Reagan, a local girl, in the office. Lillie has been familiar with the work, the people and their needs , has taken care of all correspondence; ordering of supplies ; all care of the Center , and what is more, Dr. Ogle made the statement the other day that he had never known anyone with a finer sense of when to be present and when to be absent. We have tried to have a school girl help a little with the cleaning, to relieve Lillie some, as she finds more work than she is able to do. I feel strongly that we have been unfair this year. We have paid $50.00, home and travel for this work, the girls having shorter hours and really less responsibility. Now we are paying $30.00 and Lillie boarding at home. It seems to me we have taken advantage of a willing spirit. My recommendation for this department is that we pay Lillie Reagan $40.00 per month with a reimbursement of $50.00 as the salary should have been raised the first of the year. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Due to changes in county health physicians and nurses the year has been a hard one for the unit. We have had three different nurses within the year, Pittman had a change and was for several weeks 'with-out a nurse, Sevierville was several weeks without a nurse. The present doctor has been in very poor health ever since he came. While I do not doubt the wisdom of continuing with the Unit I do feel this year the work has been going on under difficulties. Whenever there is any help available we are sure of getting our share and I feel we should continue with the Unit. It is rather of a surprise each year that the county court votes the necessary appropriation as always there are those who are opposed but it passes with a good majority. If we gained nothing more than the free serums and the help from the county unit in holding large school clinics I would say it was worth while. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 9 WEAVING Much of the report of this department is covered in the report o] industrial work. Miss Redding has had one high school class in weaving. This claa meets each day one double period. Little is done by these girls fa market but practically all the time is used for definite instruction b weaving, patterns, colors, etc. A great deal of time is given to the women who weave in their homes or on school looms. This year more women came to the housl to see Miss Redding, calls here taking the place of long trips by Mis Redding to their homes. Weaving was done in not less than thirt homes. In spite of the large amount of weaving we had on hand last sum mer and early fall we found it almost impossible to keep up with the Christmas orders. School did not open until September and that lef little time to prepare for the unusually large amount of business. Afte Christmas there was time to work' out some new things and this sum mer we have some really lovely weaving in the Shop. During the year we sent several exhibits away and found tha the work from our school compared well with that from other wel known places. The Mountain Conference in Knoxville made much o the mountain industries. While there may not be much financial profi in sending these there is a certain amount of advertising done and 'w, also are showing our interest in the mountain work. The financial system of this year has helped to carry this tremend ous increase of business, yet it has not been perfect by any means any I am sure that the detailed report of Miss Redding explains every thing. Also it was impossible to do all we would have liked to for tin, was not to be had. Before Christmas all who could devoted prat tically all their time to this work and even then found it impossible t keep up with the orders or with the products. With one definitel: in charge next fall and with the financial system so we can start ou out in a businesslike way at once I feel sure we will carry the depart went much better. The business can be carried much better when we have more root for shipping, for finished products and for materials. INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT The growth of this department has been so rapid that in spite a the plans we make each year to handle the business we and ourselve simply swamped, all who possibly can neglect their duties giving fu] time to filling orders, doing up bundles and taking care of endless coi respondence. On May 1, 1926, Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor opened the Gil Shop in the Stuart Cottage. Each girl had a third interest, the Scho( keeping one third stock, too. The Shop not only took care of the man 92 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI tourists who came but also took over all correspondence and shipping. It not only was a wonderful relief to us who had been doing it all but the financial results were beyond expectations. With the first of September, the Shop closed and baskets, weaving, chairs and stools were again deposited in the attic, the basement, the offices, the upstairs hall and the girls' trunks in the Teacher's Cottage. Visitors and customers continued to visit us and always when we were the deepest in daily work. From September 1 to January 1 we shipped from here nearly $10,000 worth of products. It took the combined efforts of Miss Red-ding, Miss Allen and myself, to say nothing of those who packed baskets. Had there been room in the house for another person we surely would have had one to help but we were too crowded to put another person in the office. Lois Rogers returned the middle of April and we surely were de-lighted to see her. We closed the kindergarten work two weeks early in order to be able to open a Gift Shop, called the Arrowcraft Shop. That was the only place available and really our ex-dining room, kindergarten room, made a very attractive shop. Eugenia Dilworth, of Austin, comes the first of June to help Lois, and at that time the girls will move the shop back in the Stuart Cottage. It would be better to have it on the road but we cannot plan on using the agriculture building until we know more definitely whether it will have to be used the same in the fall. We are sure, however, that there must be a person here all the time to manage the industrial work. During the summer months the Arrowcraft girls purchased $3,131.-43 and sold $3,990.76. From September to May the School bought $9,274.59 and shipped $13,804.16. Of course a good deal was returned p.t the end of the club yeaii but this gives some idea of the amount of business done. While the new business system was not entirely satisfactory any of the time it was such an improvement over the old way that I feel we never could have carried on under old conditions and I feel sure, too, that another year we will be able to have things go satisfactorily. SUG.A.RLANDS Sugarlands, like Gatlinburg has to be considered on the twelve months basis, rather than on the eight months school term. During the summer of 1926 Miss Chew had adult classes and as early as July 1, she and Cora McCarter commenced school, teaching a half day session until the county 'school opened the middle of July. From the middle of July to September the girls carried on a full school program, night school classes and all the house work. This. made entirely too heavy a schedule. In September, Martha Flowers came. she was to look after the house in the morning, prepare the noon meal ind then 'Van two hours in the afternoon Miss Chew did corn R] PORTS or OrricERs 93 munity work and held some adult classes. This was carried out after a fashion through the year but was not entirely satisfactory. It was upsetting to the teachers and fully as much so to the pupils to have their day divided up in that manner. The night classes were well attended, they require much preparation as it is impossible to secure satisfactory text books for that kind of teaching. After each evening class there was a period of recreation, all three teachers helping with that. Having school from eight in the morning until nine-thirty at night may not sound like so much but on the weeks that Miss Chew had to be up at five o'clock to prepare breakfast it proved to be a whole lot. The community work and adult teaching could easily take all the time of one person. But this was only a part of the worry, the new schoolhouse was not completed until after Christmas. The county did not want to put repairs into the old building so bitter winter weather found the girls teaching in a room with practically no window panes, a house so frail that on very windy days school had to be dismissed in safety to the children. Finally window panes were put in but it was a joy when school finally was moved into the new building. In addition to this was the anxiety regarding the Teacher's Cottage. But for the promise made to the people I doubt if we would have tried to build before spring. The roads were terrible, no one wanted to take the job, the local men wanted work by the day but none of them could supervise or read the plans. Finally two men from Gatlinburg said they would take the job, using some Sugarlands men, if Mr. Mattil would help them. In this way the -cottage was finally completed. The house is very attractive and convenient and while it has cost more than planned it has cost less than any contract price submitted. The building has made a hole in our finances but I think it probably is better to have built well in the beginning. During this summer Helen Chew. is continuing night classes and the people have a community gathering each Saturday night. . Miss Steele continues her Home Economics class with the women and Mr. Mattil makes frequent visits in the community. The county bears the expense of two teachers and the state has allowed quite a liberal amount toward the adult work so the running expenses of the Sugarlands Extension are not so heavy. Miss Chew is not sure she can return another year but if she is able to, I feel she should have full time for adult and community work. Two teachers can take care of the school work. It is necessary to have an experienced teacher and a Pi Phi in the school. We have no one on the Gatlinburg staff who could be transferred to this place and put in charge of the Extension. Not only from my observations here but in what I have gathered from attending conferences have I been convinced that Helen Chew is carrying on one of the best pieces of adult education and community THE ARROW' Or PI BETA PHI Not a great deal is said about it but it is accomplishing some-g. Anyone who is familiar with teaching knows how hard it is to est those above the school age. I' surely feel we should continue part of the Sugarlands program if possible but if Miss Chew does ? to leave it will be hard to fill her place. GENERAL EXTENSION WORK During the past year Miss Steele has had classes in Laurel Lick, arlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River and Gatlinburg. Mr. Mattil has had classes in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Wears Val-Middle Creek, New Era and Gatlinburg. The nurse has had clinics in all schools in the district and has also to Wears Valley, Green Briar, Emerts Cove and Smoky Mountain school clinics. Mr. M[attil had many meetings during the fall, preparatory to the in different school districts. The work in the Sugarlands is outstanding, especially along the of adult education. The past two years have proved to me that our field lies in this ion program, giving the people something the county school cannot these rural schools for years to ,come. What we are doing for bet-homes, better farms, better health and broader lives fully justifies expenditures and our being here. OFFICE With the opening of the school year LaDelle came to take over h of the bookkeeping connected with the School and to help with a. office work. Everything was new to her and to me and at first ras impossible to know what, when or how. Six weeks or more t by before the books could be opened. There were, however, plenty hings to keep all hands busy. On September the Shop closed and all that business, as well as I orders, visitors, people to buy from and everything were dumped the office we had moved into. We had thought we would have ty of room by taking what had been the down stairs office for La e's and my office but it soon was filled with weaving and many r things. A new typewriter, adding machine and some other smaller office Anent were purchased. LaDelle Allen has done well with the work and in. spite of the unt of time we had to put into the industrial business during the she has kept up the book work very well. With the increased amount of business done in the industrial dement I am sure we never could have handled it all had not much he business been handled entirely from here. Much correspondenc e REPORTS 01 01TICERS 95 has been saved and time in attending to the accounts. While there are quite a good many accounts not yet closed collections have been made fairly easily. In checking up the reports it becomes clear why the monthly bank allowance does not cover expenses. The months we do the heaviest buying are the months the least cash comes in. That explains why we were behind month after month and still are. If we continue to buy industrial supplies and products at this rate the fixed bank balance will have to be increased. It takes a year to try out these things and I think that probably another year we can get along pretty well but the fall was terribly trying. Practically no time has been given to letters to the clubs or chapters, to constructive planning for the School, or even to enough committee letters, yet more hours have been spent in the office than ever before. With the correspondence relative to the industrial business and the other work connected with that the office time has been entirely taken up. The Gatlinburg News .has gone to each club, officer and to the isolated Pi Phis who have sent in their contributions through Dorothy Geare. In the April News I enclosed a club letter, giving a brief summary of the year's work. These club letters should go out every month and I surely plan to see that it is done next year. Letters direct from the School do bring results. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAJRS MADE DURING 1926-27 Sugarlands Teacher's Cottage built. Plans secured for industrial building in Gatlinburg. New entrance made to the grounds and iron gate hung. Telephone installed, school furnishing 50 poles. New chicken house built. Brooder house enlarged. Small barn built on Sims place. Sims place surveyed and fenced. New typewriter, adding machine, broad shelves, etc., gotten for of-fiCe. Small changes made in Pollard Cottage to take care of the dormitory boys, girls and teachers for meals. All plumbing, heating, etc., thoroughly looked over during the vacation. Some furniture made : tables, shelves, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1927-28 New building for industrial departments. Plans for community hall. Continuation of Gift Shop through entire year, THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them. I am sure all could rather wait even longer and finally get a plan that will call for building within our means. In closing my report I want again to thank the committee for the plendid support and cooperation. Our problems are many, the School as grown beyond any early dreams and the development is the result f the splendid service given by those Pi Phis on the committee and way from the School who continue to have such a deep interest in the cork. thiVELYN BisHor REPORTS or OrF'ICERS 97 Report of Treasurer of Settlement School We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, T6nnessee, for the period 1926-1927 ending May 16, 1927.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres

        THE ARROW OP' PI BETA PHI ,es have arisen, has reopened her books. The committee feels as she that all late contributions from now on will have to receive recogion the following year. Miss Curryer has been painstaking, conscientious and faithful in treasury work, and her ideas have been valuable to the School. It 3 caused her no little work to reorganize completely the treasury de-!tment. Mrs. Agnes Miller Turner, secretary and publicity member for the :tlement School Committee, reports that she feels that a more conitrated effort should be made, educating actives for alunan mems. I know in Dallas, Texas there are over eighty-five alumnae, but y twenty-four take any interest in the club. If the active chapters re required to, hold two Settlement School programs annually, they uld be better acquainted with this splendid work, thereby taking ,re interest in alumnte club activities. Mrs. Turner has been an in-ration to the committee. Her ardent zeal combined with ability kes her a valuable asset to any organization. The School shall miss as she retires from the committee this year. If you have read the row articles that she has edited, you have certainly become more ightened concerning the Settlement School. Mrs. Geare has continued her work of interesting Pi Phis who ve not been connected with any alunmm club. She reports that 'ough the efforts of Miss Margaret White and herself 29 new clubs re been organized, and by this time probably a few more. This has gin. a praiseworthy achievement because all members of Pi Beta Phi mld have the chance to take part in such an undertaking. 'To Mrs. are, the School feels deeply indebted. Mrs. Freeman, the Ways and Means member of the committee has 1 charge of the slides. She strongly urges that province officers ar-Ige an itinerary of these slides for their respective clubs or chapters order to, expedite delivery and save expenses. By the time an 3wer goes to the far West clubs and back, a nearby club has the les, this entailing more correspondence. Mrs. Freeman has served acting chairman during my prolonged stay abroad, carrying on her n work on the committee, besides being president of the active xeland Club and doing my work too, cheerful, willing and efficient has been. Her services cannot be measured other than to say when has a task to do, it is done the best way. It has been the aims of the committee to foster several new ideas s year. For four years we have needed an industrial building, and ay our dreams are being realized. It is started and our hopes ex t to be ready for use in October. Had ,we .more funds, we could aplete the building so badly needed. The Hazel Todd Meaden cot-e at the Emma Harper Turner Center in the Sugarlands is now be-used, and we of the committee "modestly" assert that it is a dear. have striven to place the industrial department on paying basis, REPORTS Or OrrICERS 81 our woven goods are very nearly perfect, and by their excellence and attractiveness the sales have jumped by leaps and bounds. Four years ago we sold about $1000 worth of products ; three years ago the sales were about $4000 ; last year $7000; and this year over $14,000. I can-not quote accurately as I have not the exact figures here on the boat with me. Let me add that this does not mean profit but it could be so had we the space for more looms and storage. Miss Redding is most efficient, and has the happy faculty of getting the women to take advantage of her instructions. Their loyalty to the School is commend-able. The school work on the whole has been good, weak in spots 'tis true, due entirely to congested quarters. The time is now ripe for a high type man principal who can revise and supervise the entire curriculum. The attendance despite continuous epidemics of every known disease has been good. Congested conditions, no auditorium, primary work in the teacher's cottage, inadequate agriculture and home economics quarters have had to be overcome, but not without a great deal of distress to the teachers. To say they were handicapped does not ex-press the true situation, but to say that they were efficient, willing and wonderfully good sports might convey in a small degree the high regard the committee holds for them. Miss Bishop in her usual modest way has conducted the School through trying circumstances. Her patience and personality are attributes not often found in one person. Her leadership has certainly made the duties of the committee easier. Mr. Mattil, director of the Smith-Hughes Agriculture Department a proven friend to the School in every way, Miss Steele, domestic economy instructor, and Miss Ryman the nurse, have done much in their respective lines, and though not members of Pi Beta Phi, they have been as faithful. It was with deep regret that the committee had to accept the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higginbotham, who left us to become supervisor of nurses for the State of Tennessee. Miss Bishop's report is as usual so full of interesting details that it shall be printed in full in the Arrow. I shall not take your time here to read it, if each of you promise to read it 'when published. Whenever we think of our extensive work, we just "burst with pride." When we think of the opposition in years past, and now, those natives clamour for Pi Beta Phi to direct, we naturally feel that we have accomplished something. The Emma Harper Turner center at Sugarlands is only the beginning, some day when we shall have sufficient funds, we shall develop other fields demanding Pi Phi super-vision, as we have at Gatlinburg. Do you know that the Department of Education of Tennessee considers Miss Chew the most capable teacher of rural adult education. Five o'clock each morning she arises in order to carry out her very full program for the day. In age her 82 THE ARROW PI BETA PHI pupils range from sixteen to forty-two, they adore her and counsel with her. Her value to the community is immeasureable. During the past year she has been ably assisted by two teachers, one a Pi Phi, the other a graduate of Gatlinburg. The new school building and the cottage named in honor of Mrs. Hazel Todd Meaden, certainly afford these girls comfort, though living in so isolated a section deserves the highest commendation. This report has been more or less a general survey of all, and below, I shall enumerate concisely a few of the outstanding achievements of the past year: 1 .Constructing the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage. 2. The New Sugarlands' School building by the County, but fostered by the committee. 3. Farming on a more businesslike basis with efficient supervision and direction of school boys doing the work. 4. Community work done by all. 5. Extension work in Sugarlands and other isolated centers. G. Health Clinics, vaccinations, innoculations (even of 300 dogs for rabies), first aid and hygiene classes, dental clinics. 7. Improving the Industrial Department. a. Excellence of work. b. Establishing better business methods. 8. Encouraging the raising of pedigreed stock and poultry. 9. Beautifying around the property. 10. Publicity of the School throughout the Pi Beta Phi realm. 11. Installing bookkeeping and collecting department at Gatlinburg. 12. Opening Arrowcraft business. 13. Installing incubator and brooder houses. 14. Central Dining rooms started. Thus concisely stating these achievements we realize our efforts have not been in vain. In, closing this, my last report, after five years of intimate con-tact with the Settlement School, I would feel derelict in my duties, did I not gaze into the future and make a few suggestions as to what I hope may be accomplished. The School was organized to do Settlement work and this aim has never been lost to view. While the problems of today are not those of yesterday, the needs are just as pressing. The time has probably come to turn over to the people the lower grade work, so that they might organize a consolidated school. This does not mean a cessation of effort but a redoubled one along the line of health and industry. The people are beginning to feel the effects of business direction in basketry and weaving, and it is no far-fetched dream to see the bur-den of expense carried by these industries. The higher educational REPORTS OP OrrICERS influences are yet to be developed and probably will never be ale academic lines. Better health and better babies are things the communities seeking, and Gatlinburg, Sugarlands and other places within our fluenee are not behind the rest of the world in wanting them. Ext^ sion is still calling and while the frontiers will never be as primit as was Gatlinburg, yet conditions are still indescribably bad. I do not see the time when Pi Beta Phi will leave Tenness but I do see the time when our great work will be known, valued a praised throughout the country. Things will never go smoothly for us and I hasten to say that hope they never will, because things are worth little more than wl they cost us in time, effort and heartache. The Settlement School id is a .success that I know you will join me in proclaiming. That will continue to be so I am sure you will join me in pledging. If I have failed to thank by name in this report all who have h a part in our labours, I include them here, and add to them the nan of the whole fraternity who have given me the opportunity to serve Beta Phi. With this I bid you goodbye and join the ranks of 1 pasts, who are working for the best interests of our fraternity. NITA HILL STARK Report of Head Resident Pi Beta Phi Settlement Scho( 19264927 N submitting the report for the year 1926-27 I find that the have been fewer changes or outstanding events than in alm any year previous. It has not been necessary to make a changes in staff during the year, the different departments hi carried on about as usual and at the close of the year I feel we ( say it has been a year of good average work. The staff has been : Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident. Mabel Schuckman a'nd Ruby RS man, nurses. Margaret White, Principal of School, high school teacher. Marion Folsom, high school teacher.

ScHoor, The enrollment for the past year falls a very little below the nunilast year as there has been no consolidation whatever. The at-mace from our local community has been a little larger. The only reason we cannot show a much better attendance is be e of the epidemics that have visited us. Measles were raging school opened in the fall and continued for a good part of the chicken pox, flu and mumps followed and practically everyone, tnd young, had them. The school work has gone on easier than usual, no doubt due to few changes in the teaching staff. Miss Burton returned, after a 's absence, for her ninth school year and taught the first and see-grades. Her work was made easier because of the kindergarten primer classes carried on in the dining-room of the Teacher's Cot-by Miss Trainer. This experiment was tried out this past year while we have no doubt of the need and of the good work done I eel that with finances low we should try to get along without it year. Mrs. Chapin taught the third and fourth grades and did splendid She came with the understanding she would supervise the es up to the seventh, but it proved very hard to do as that had Been the custom in the past. lean Steele taught one double period high school class in hotde omics each school day. Cdr. Mattil taught two double period high school classes each day. Winogene Redding taught one double period high. school class each With the full schedule of regular work the boys and girls were very busy in school and it seemed as though every minute was pied out of school hours. [t does not seem wise to carry more than two years of high school : for the present. .Our first year class is large but the second class the past year had only two pupils in it. The roads are good gh now so pupils can go to Sevierville to school without much :nifty. We had four pupils going back and forth this year. the county superintendent tells us that the two years of high )l work here is accredited but we have not official acknowledge-of this. So far our pupils have had to take ea aminations when .ing accredited high schools in the state. REPORTS OP OFFICERS 85 Elmer Watson does not return next year Margaret White does not expect to, nor does Marion Folsom. If these changes have to come it seems to me it would be the time to put a strong man into the high school department, preferably as principal. I feel strongly that we should have a man in the School. While Mr. Mattil teaches agriculture his work keeps him away from the School practically all of the time, even the classes he conducts are in a separate building and he never has time to be on the play ground even at recess. Were a man put in as principal his work should not be too heavy for him really to have supervision of the whole School. The weak place has always been in regard to supervision, in trying to keep each room a separate unit instead of holding everything together as a whole. Were ,conditions a little different in Sevierville I would make the recommendation this year that we turn back to the county the first six grades. With an eight month's school term, better teachers and salaries in the county and as much improvement as has been made in the past two or three years I believe we should give back to the county the grade work. It would take a year or more for the county to pre-pare to take this but I believe if it did it would make 'Gatlinburg a consolidated school, as it probably never will under present conditions. This does not mean. that I would advise giving up all super-vision of the School, we would not be asked to, the county is glad to employ Pi Phi teachers and would pay as good salaries as we are pay--lug. I firmly believe there is danger of schools of this kind holding on-to work after the county is able to take it over. We would have a big task left if we carried the next four grades, the home economics, agriculture, weaving, health, and community work, and the industrial department. During the year health plays were given by the grade children. At the close of the eight months of school Miss Burton's, Mrs. Chapin's and Mr. Watson's pupils gave three short plays. The usual Christmas program was given. The closing exercises for eighth grades and high schoOl consisted of a play in the nature of a minstrel show, given by the boys glee club, on May 10 and May 20 an address was given by Mr. Charles Sharp of Sevierville. The Red Cross certificates were given to the twelve girls completing the course in Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick and eighth grade certificates were given to twenty-one pupils. This was followed by a little banquet. With school opening as late as September it was necessary to continue until May 20, later than any school in Sevier county. This was tried as an experiment. The pupils have stayed in well as they possibly could but I feel that next year it will be better to open earlier, then if time has to be lost it can be during the first month instead of the last. Surely the first seven grades must begin August 1. In the winter the New York Club obtained passes to New York for Helen Chew so she could be present for the February meeting.

HOME ECONOI\.IICS his department has continued in much the same way as last The outstanding development has been in the community work. lornings are taken up with high school classes in the School. The .00ns are given to classes in different communities. New cornies have been added to the list and more classes held in the Gat-g school for the women and girls. :iss Steele's report gives in detail her work and also shows what of riding it requires. She is faithful to the last degree and no day is bad enough for her to think she should give up a trip for s. M4iss Steele has accomplished almost the impossible in inter-the women in these classes. She also has organized a club that twice a month, the nurse giving a health program one time ; she .ng a home economics one the next meeting. Usually they show (gotten from the University of Tennessee) and have! a special These clubs are well attended and the women do so well. read papers and give talks on the subjects and take a great deal nest. Several feel that we are really meeting a community need :se meetings. REPORTS Or OrricERs 87 Miss White, the State SupervisOr of Home Economics, has recommended to the state that the home economics teacher here be put on full time for community work, the state paying the entire salary. This year the state has been allowing us $1000.00 but on the other hand they asked that we raise Miss, Steele's salary in proportion. Were we to release Miss Steele from school work it would be necessary to have the school home economics taught by one of the other teachers. Last year Barbara Dewell did half-time teaching in the School during the winter months and relieved the other teachers very much but at that time we were carrying three years of high school classes. My definite recommendation regarding this cannot be made until I know surely what the state will do. AGRICULTURE Mr. Mattil's report gives such a detailed account of the activities of this department I will not attempt to list them in my report. The mornings are given to school work, as well as a lot of calls people make here, the afternoons, to community work. Three new communities havel been added to the list of those having evening school work. Much time has to be put into the planning and carrying on of fairs each fall. Before the fairs there are community meetings in a great many schools and these are not only agricultural but usually show pictures relative to better homes and better health. The real development of the work is shown in the number of calls made on Mr. Mattil to advise regarding orchards, stock, farm crops, etc. The chicken business takes much time, too. There are calls to see sick animals, to know what to spray with, what kind of chicken house to build and numberless other questions. Mr. Mattil spent six weeks in Cornell University last summer. I surely hope he will feel he can remain here another year. Boys' DORMITORY The boys' dormitory has been managed better this year than ever before and the end of the year shows the good results. Mrs. Dowell has been faithful to her task, which means a lot when you remember that no other teachers live in the cottage so there never is anyone to relieve her of her cares for even a single night. . With better supervision of the boys' work we have had little trouble. During the fall there were eight boys on the hill but the the close of school found only four there. One boy dropped out of school in the spring, another stayed with a relative, another couldn't keep the smoking regulations, another one was in seventh grade so left as soon as that closed. The only question of discipline has come in regard to smoking. THE ARROW or PI BETA PHI Sirs. Dowell supervised the noon lunch for the children in Dorothy ner's and Emily Burton's rooms, lunch was served in the kindrten room. GIRLS' .DoRmITORY The year has passed unusually well here. There have been from to seven girls in the dormitory and there has been no trouble Lever. Mrs. McCarter and Aunt Lizzie have done the cooking for the .e family, boys, girls and teachers. The plan has worked out very and has proved to be the best way to manage. The changes in fall required comparatively little financial outlay and no changes ny amount in the cottages. The meals have been well balanced and appetizing and I feel we better cared for than those in the average boarding school. While the girls have not had much chance to help with the cooking have done other house work that has kept them busy. The boys stayed week-ends more than the girls have as Saturday farm ^ was always pressing. In both girls' and boys' dormitories there should be a way for those L arge to be relieved as every day and every night makes a pretty [ strain. It was my idea this year to relieve ourselves as much as possible try to have the Burg help bear the burden of the boarding pupils at the end of the year I feel I have made a mistake. Some of our t promising pupils are in homes in the Burg. With the little super-)n the average family gives, the results are not what they should The work for students has been better planned this year and posy we can improve still more another year and have more under our FARM The farm work has been looked after and partially done by Otha gala, under the planning and supervision of Mr. Mattil. Otha has red to be quite a good hand to look after the boys and their work the result has been that the farm is in better condition and the k and chickens have done better this year than ever before. Stu-help is hard to handle, hours are more uncertain, work has to be fully checked up and lots of patience and encouragement used. The reports of the farm, as submitted by Mr. Mattil, show that '0 has been a good amount of production toward the living. We have been able to sell quite a little. The chicken business has e to be quite a thing. During the spring a great many baby chicks e sold and settings given out around the district. These are paid by people returning pullets in the fall. More hay was raised this REPORTS OF' OrrIaRS 89 past year but we are not able to raise all we need yet. Last year we hoped to but failed. Each year, however, shows an improvement in the farm products. STUDENT LABOR Both boys and girls put in most of the out of school hours in work on the place. During the year the boys have their baseball and basketbal to take some outside time but the boys look after the horses, chick-ens, cows, pigs, carrying in the wood, cleaning the schoolhouse, and a great many odd jobs. The girls wait on table, set table, help with the dishes, keep the cottages clean, etc. It is a . big expense to keep the dormitories open but the school shows that those boys and girls living on the place hold out best in their school work. This past year we have felt that the grade of work done by the students was better than ever before and the work better organized. HEALTH The report from this department shows that there have been several changes during the year. Phyllis Higinbotham left in the early spring of 1926. Mabel Sthuckman' came at once and remained four months. She was a fine nurse and hard worker and had she been con-tent in the country might have remained. She did not, however, care to stay so Ruby Ryman took her place in the fall of 1926. She came just in time to assist with the largest tonsil and, adenoid clinic we have ever had and to be with Miss Schuckman long enough to get a good idea of the work and to become somewhat acquainted. Miss Ryman has carried out an extensive health program in the schools. The toxin, antitoxin, and typhoid clinics were very large. During much of the winter time both Sevierville and Pittman Center were without nurses so many long trips were made by our nurse, giving inoculations to school children in 'Green Briar, Emerts Cove, Smoky Mountain and Wears Valley. It was possible to make longer trips this year as roads were bet-ter, where they had been improved, and a car could be used quite a good deal. On the other hand, the roads that were bad were awful as we had a rainy winter. The transportation problem was acute during the time' Mr. Matti, Jean Steele and Ruby Ryman all needed horses the same afternoons, but they all lived through, even the horses and cars, and now the family is on very good terms again. With better roads it is much easier for the doctors to keep their afternoons at the office. The dentist comes twice a month now and always has full work. There have been several very successful clinics. There has been quite a change in the nature of work done at the center and through the community. This change has been coming for 90 THE ARROW OF' PI BETA PHI several years. While we would not want too much of the home and bedside work to stop we are glad to see the work on a health educatinal basis. Night calls for the nurse are few now and calls that should be for a doctor instead of a nurse are fewer. Having telephone connections with Sevierville and Knoxville has helped tremendously. Miss Hyman likes and understands the mountain people and if she is satisfied to continue I feel she can do well. She will have to be in college six weeks this summer taking a public health course and I am not sure she will return after that. We must continue trying to locate a Pi Phi nurse, one who will come with the idea of staying more than a few months. Frequent changes in any department handicap the work very much. During all these changes we have been very fortunate in having Lillie Reagan, a local girl, in the office. Lillie has been familiar with the work, the people and their needs , has taken care of all correspondence; ordering of supplies ; all care of the Center , and what is more, Dr. Ogle made the statement the other day that he had never known anyone with a finer sense of when to be present and when to be absent. We have tried to have a school girl help a little with the cleaning, to relieve Lillie some, as she finds more work than she is able to do. I feel strongly that we have been unfair this year. We have paid $50.00, home and travel for this work, the girls having shorter hours and really less responsibility. Now we are paying $30.00 and Lillie boarding at home. It seems to me we have taken advantage of a willing spirit. My recommendation for this department is that we pay Lillie Reagan $40.00 per month with a reimbursement of $50.00 as the salary should have been raised the first of the year. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Due to changes in county health physicians and nurses the year has been a hard one for the unit. We have had three different nurses within the year, Pittman had a change and was for several weeks 'with-out a nurse, Sevierville was several weeks without a nurse. The present doctor has been in very poor health ever since he came. While I do not doubt the wisdom of continuing with the Unit I do feel this year the work has been going on under difficulties. Whenever there is any help available we are sure of getting our share and I feel we should continue with the Unit. It is rather of a surprise each year that the county court votes the necessary appropriation as always there are those who are opposed but it passes with a good majority. If we gained nothing more than the free serums and the help from the county unit in holding large school clinics I would say it was worth while. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 9 WEAVING Much of the report of this department is covered in the report o] industrial work. Miss Redding has had one high school class in weaving. This claa meets each day one double period. Little is done by these girls fa market but practically all the time is used for definite instruction b weaving, patterns, colors, etc. A great deal of time is given to the women who weave in their homes or on school looms. This year more women came to the housl to see Miss Redding, calls here taking the place of long trips by Mis Redding to their homes. Weaving was done in not less than thirt homes. In spite of the large amount of weaving we had on hand last sum mer and early fall we found it almost impossible to keep up with the Christmas orders. School did not open until September and that lef little time to prepare for the unusually large amount of business. Afte Christmas there was time to work' out some new things and this sum mer we have some really lovely weaving in the Shop. During the year we sent several exhibits away and found tha the work from our school compared well with that from other wel known places. The Mountain Conference in Knoxville made much o the mountain industries. While there may not be much financial profi in sending these there is a certain amount of advertising done and 'w, also are showing our interest in the mountain work. The financial system of this year has helped to carry this tremend ous increase of business, yet it has not been perfect by any means any I am sure that the detailed report of Miss Redding explains every thing. Also it was impossible to do all we would have liked to for tin, was not to be had. Before Christmas all who could devoted prat tically all their time to this work and even then found it impossible t keep up with the orders or with the products. With one definitel: in charge next fall and with the financial system so we can start ou out in a businesslike way at once I feel sure we will carry the depart went much better. The business can be carried much better when we have more root for shipping, for finished products and for materials. INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT The growth of this department has been so rapid that in spite a the plans we make each year to handle the business we and ourselve simply swamped, all who possibly can neglect their duties giving fu] time to filling orders, doing up bundles and taking care of endless coi respondence. On May 1, 1926, Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor opened the Gil Shop in the Stuart Cottage. Each girl had a third interest, the Scho( keeping one third stock, too. The Shop not only took care of the man 92 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI tourists who came but also took over all correspondence and shipping. It not only was a wonderful relief to us who had been doing it all but the financial results were beyond expectations. With the first of September, the Shop closed and baskets, weaving, chairs and stools were again deposited in the attic, the basement, the offices, the upstairs hall and the girls' trunks in the Teacher's Cottage. Visitors and customers continued to visit us and always when we were the deepest in daily work. From September 1 to January 1 we shipped from here nearly $10,000 worth of products. It took the combined efforts of Miss Red-ding, Miss Allen and myself, to say nothing of those who packed baskets. Had there been room in the house for another person we surely would have had one to help but we were too crowded to put another person in the office. Lois Rogers returned the middle of April and we surely were de-lighted to see her. We closed the kindergarten work two weeks early in order to be able to open a Gift Shop, called the Arrowcraft Shop. That was the only place available and really our ex-dining room, kindergarten room, made a very attractive shop. Eugenia Dilworth, of Austin, comes the first of June to help Lois, and at that time the girls will move the shop back in the Stuart Cottage. It would be better to have it on the road but we cannot plan on using the agriculture building until we know more definitely whether it will have to be used the same in the fall. We are sure, however, that there must be a person here all the time to manage the industrial work. During the summer months the Arrowcraft girls purchased $3,131.-43 and sold $3,990.76. From September to May the School bought $9,274.59 and shipped $13,804.16. Of course a good deal was returned p.t the end of the club yeaii but this gives some idea of the amount of business done. While the new business system was not entirely satisfactory any of the time it was such an improvement over the old way that I feel we never could have carried on under old conditions and I feel sure, too, that another year we will be able to have things go satisfactorily. SUG.A.RLANDS Sugarlands, like Gatlinburg has to be considered on the twelve months basis, rather than on the eight months school term. During the summer of 1926 Miss Chew had adult classes and as early as July 1, she and Cora McCarter commenced school, teaching a half day session until the county 'school opened the middle of July. From the middle of July to September the girls carried on a full school program, night school classes and all the house work. This. made entirely too heavy a schedule. In September, Martha Flowers came. she was to look after the house in the morning, prepare the noon meal ind then 'Van two hours in the afternoon Miss Chew did corn R] PORTS or OrricERs 93 munity work and held some adult classes. This was carried out after a fashion through the year but was not entirely satisfactory. It was upsetting to the teachers and fully as much so to the pupils to have their day divided up in that manner. The night classes were well attended, they require much preparation as it is impossible to secure satisfactory text books for that kind of teaching. After each evening class there was a period of recreation, all three teachers helping with that. Having school from eight in the morning until nine-thirty at night may not sound like so much but on the weeks that Miss Chew had to be up at five o'clock to prepare breakfast it proved to be a whole lot. The community work and adult teaching could easily take all the time of one person. But this was only a part of the worry, the new schoolhouse was not completed until after Christmas. The county did not want to put repairs into the old building so bitter winter weather found the girls teaching in a room with practically no window panes, a house so frail that on very windy days school had to be dismissed in safety to the children. Finally window panes were put in but it was a joy when school finally was moved into the new building. In addition to this was the anxiety regarding the Teacher's Cottage. But for the promise made to the people I doubt if we would have tried to build before spring. The roads were terrible, no one wanted to take the job, the local men wanted work by the day but none of them could supervise or read the plans. Finally two men from Gatlinburg said they would take the job, using some Sugarlands men, if Mr. Mattil would help them. In this way the -cottage was finally completed. The house is very attractive and convenient and while it has cost more than planned it has cost less than any contract price submitted. The building has made a hole in our finances but I think it probably is better to have built well in the beginning. During this summer Helen Chew. is continuing night classes and the people have a community gathering each Saturday night. . Miss Steele continues her Home Economics class with the women and Mr. Mattil makes frequent visits in the community. The county bears the expense of two teachers and the state has allowed quite a liberal amount toward the adult work so the running expenses of the Sugarlands Extension are not so heavy. Miss Chew is not sure she can return another year but if she is able to, I feel she should have full time for adult and community work. Two teachers can take care of the school work. It is necessary to have an experienced teacher and a Pi Phi in the school. We have no one on the Gatlinburg staff who could be transferred to this place and put in charge of the Extension. Not only from my observations here but in what I have gathered from attending conferences have I been convinced that Helen Chew is carrying on one of the best pieces of adult education and community THE ARROW' Or PI BETA PHI Not a great deal is said about it but it is accomplishing some-g. Anyone who is familiar with teaching knows how hard it is to est those above the school age. I' surely feel we should continue part of the Sugarlands program if possible but if Miss Chew does ? to leave it will be hard to fill her place. GENERAL EXTENSION WORK During the past year Miss Steele has had classes in Laurel Lick, arlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River and Gatlinburg. Mr. Mattil has had classes in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Wears Val-Middle Creek, New Era and Gatlinburg. The nurse has had clinics in all schools in the district and has also to Wears Valley, Green Briar, Emerts Cove and Smoky Mountain school clinics. Mr. M[attil had many meetings during the fall, preparatory to the in different school districts. The work in the Sugarlands is outstanding, especially along the of adult education. The past two years have proved to me that our field lies in this ion program, giving the people something the county school cannot these rural schools for years to ,come. What we are doing for bet-homes, better farms, better health and broader lives fully justifies expenditures and our being here. OFFICE With the opening of the school year LaDelle came to take over h of the bookkeeping connected with the School and to help with a. office work. Everything was new to her and to me and at first ras impossible to know what, when or how. Six weeks or more t by before the books could be opened. There were, however, plenty hings to keep all hands busy. On September the Shop closed and all that business, as well as I orders, visitors, people to buy from and everything were dumped the office we had moved into. We had thought we would have ty of room by taking what had been the down stairs office for La e's and my office but it soon was filled with weaving and many r things. A new typewriter, adding machine and some other smaller office Anent were purchased. LaDelle Allen has done well with the work and in. spite of the unt of time we had to put into the industrial business during the she has kept up the book work very well. With the increased amount of business done in the industrial dement I am sure we never could have handled it all had not much he business been handled entirely from here. Much correspondenc e REPORTS 01 01TICERS 95 has been saved and time in attending to the accounts. While there are quite a good many accounts not yet closed collections have been made fairly easily. In checking up the reports it becomes clear why the monthly bank allowance does not cover expenses. The months we do the heaviest buying are the months the least cash comes in. That explains why we were behind month after month and still are. If we continue to buy industrial supplies and products at this rate the fixed bank balance will have to be increased. It takes a year to try out these things and I think that probably another year we can get along pretty well but the fall was terribly trying. Practically no time has been given to letters to the clubs or chapters, to constructive planning for the School, or even to enough committee letters, yet more hours have been spent in the office than ever before. With the correspondence relative to the industrial business and the other work connected with that the office time has been entirely taken up. The Gatlinburg News .has gone to each club, officer and to the isolated Pi Phis who have sent in their contributions through Dorothy Geare. In the April News I enclosed a club letter, giving a brief summary of the year's work. These club letters should go out every month and I surely plan to see that it is done next year. Letters direct from the School do bring results. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAJRS MADE DURING 1926-27 Sugarlands Teacher's Cottage built. Plans secured for industrial building in Gatlinburg. New entrance made to the grounds and iron gate hung. Telephone installed, school furnishing 50 poles. New chicken house built. Brooder house enlarged. Small barn built on Sims place. Sims place surveyed and fenced. New typewriter, adding machine, broad shelves, etc., gotten for of-fiCe. Small changes made in Pollard Cottage to take care of the dormitory boys, girls and teachers for meals. All plumbing, heating, etc., thoroughly looked over during the vacation. Some furniture made : tables, shelves, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1927-28 New building for industrial departments. Plans for community hall. Continuation of Gift Shop through entire year, THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them. I am sure all could rather wait even longer and finally get a plan that will call for building within our means. In closing my report I want again to thank the committee for the plendid support and cooperation. Our problems are many, the School as grown beyond any early dreams and the development is the result f the splendid service given by those Pi Phis on the committee and way from the School who continue to have such a deep interest in the cork. thiVELYN BisHor REPORTS or OrF'ICERS 97 Report of Treasurer of Settlement School We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, T6nnessee, for the period 1926-1927 ending May 16, 1927.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres

        82 THE ARROW PI BETA PHI pupils range from sixteen to forty-two, they adore her and counsel with her. Her value to the community is immeasureable. During the past year she has been ably assisted by two teachers, one a Pi Phi, the other a graduate of Gatlinburg. The new school building and the cottage named in honor of Mrs. Hazel Todd Meaden, certainly afford these girls comfort, though living in so isolated a section deserves the highest commendation. This report has been more or less a general survey of all, and below, I shall enumerate concisely a few of the outstanding achievements of the past year: 1 .Constructing the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage. 2. The New Sugarlands' School building by the County, but fostered by the committee. 3. Farming on a more businesslike basis with efficient supervision and direction of school boys doing the work. 4. Community work done by all. 5. Extension work in Sugarlands and other isolated centers. G. Health Clinics, vaccinations, innoculations (even of 300 dogs for rabies), first aid and hygiene classes, dental clinics. 7. Improving the Industrial Department. a. Excellence of work. b. Establishing better business methods. 8. Encouraging the raising of pedigreed stock and poultry. 9. Beautifying around the property. 10. Publicity of the School throughout the Pi Beta Phi realm. 11. Installing bookkeeping and collecting department at Gatlinburg. 12. Opening Arrowcraft business. 13. Installing incubator and brooder houses. 14. Central Dining rooms started. Thus concisely stating these achievements we realize our efforts have not been in vain. In, closing this, my last report, after five years of intimate con-tact with the Settlement School, I would feel derelict in my duties, did I not gaze into the future and make a few suggestions as to what I hope may be accomplished. The School was organized to do Settlement work and this aim has never been lost to view. While the problems of today are not those of yesterday, the needs are just as pressing. The time has probably come to turn over to the people the lower grade work, so that they might organize a consolidated school. This does not mean a cessation of effort but a redoubled one along the line of health and industry. The people are beginning to feel the effects of business direction in basketry and weaving, and it is no far-fetched dream to see the bur-den of expense carried by these industries. The higher educational REPORTS OP OrrICERS influences are yet to be developed and probably will never be ale academic lines. Better health and better babies are things the communities seeking, and Gatlinburg, Sugarlands and other places within our fluenee are not behind the rest of the world in wanting them. Ext^ sion is still calling and while the frontiers will never be as primit as was Gatlinburg, yet conditions are still indescribably bad. I do not see the time when Pi Beta Phi will leave Tenness but I do see the time when our great work will be known, valued a praised throughout the country. Things will never go smoothly for us and I hasten to say that hope they never will, because things are worth little more than wl they cost us in time, effort and heartache. The Settlement School id is a .success that I know you will join me in proclaiming. That will continue to be so I am sure you will join me in pledging. If I have failed to thank by name in this report all who have h a part in our labours, I include them here, and add to them the nan of the whole fraternity who have given me the opportunity to serve Beta Phi. With this I bid you goodbye and join the ranks of 1 pasts, who are working for the best interests of our fraternity. NITA HILL STARK Report of Head Resident Pi Beta Phi Settlement Scho( 19264927 N submitting the report for the year 1926-27 I find that the have been fewer changes or outstanding events than in alm any year previous. It has not been necessary to make a changes in staff during the year, the different departments hi carried on about as usual and at the close of the year I feel we ( say it has been a year of good average work. The staff has been : Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident. Mabel Schuckman a'nd Ruby RS man, nurses. Margaret White, Principal of School, high school teacher. Marion Folsom, high school teacher. Dora Chapin, 3rd and 4th grades. Elmer Watson, 5th and 6th grades, athletics. Emily Burton, 1st and 2nd grades. ,Dorothy Trainer, Kindergarten and primer. Jean Steele, Home Economics. O. J. Mattil, Smith Hughes Agriculture. Winogene Redding, Weaving. LaDelle Allen, Bookkeeper and office assistant. Anna Dowell, Supervisor, boys' dormitory, noon lunch for prim children. Mrs. E. A. Bishop, Superintendent girls' dormitory. Manager of boa ing department. THE ARROW OP' PI BETA PHI Helen Chew, Sugarlands Schcol, adult teaching. Martha Flowers, Sugarlands School. Cora McCarter, Sugarlands School. Lillie Reagan, Assistant to the nurse. Otha Reagan, Supervisor of student labor, farmer. Leander McCarter, General Labor. Lizzie Reagan, Cook. Mrs. McCarter, Ccok. ScHoor, The enrollment for the past year falls a very little below the nunilast year as there has been no consolidation whatever. The at-mace from our local community has been a little larger. The only reason we cannot show a much better attendance is be e of the epidemics that have visited us. Measles were raging school opened in the fall and continued for a good part of the chicken pox, flu and mumps followed and practically everyone, tnd young, had them. The school work has gone on easier than usual, no doubt due to few changes in the teaching staff. Miss Burton returned, after a 's absence, for her ninth school year and taught the first and see-grades. Her work was made easier because of the kindergarten primer classes carried on in the dining-room of the Teacher's Cot-by Miss Trainer. This experiment was tried out this past year while we have no doubt of the need and of the good work done I eel that with finances low we should try to get along without it year. Mrs. Chapin taught the third and fourth grades and did splendid She came with the understanding she would supervise the es up to the seventh, but it proved very hard to do as that had Been the custom in the past. lean Steele taught one double period high school class in hotde omics each school day. Cdr. Mattil taught two double period high school classes each day. Winogene Redding taught one double period high. school class each With the full schedule of regular work the boys and girls were very busy in school and it seemed as though every minute was pied out of school hours. [t does not seem wise to carry more than two years of high school : for the present. .Our first year class is large but the second class the past year had only two pupils in it. The roads are good gh now so pupils can go to Sevierville to school without much :nifty. We had four pupils going back and forth this year. the county superintendent tells us that the two years of high )l work here is accredited but we have not official acknowledge-of this. So far our pupils have had to take ea aminations when .ing accredited high schools in the state. REPORTS OP OFFICERS 85 Elmer Watson does not return next year Margaret White does not expect to, nor does Marion Folsom. If these changes have to come it seems to me it would be the time to put a strong man into the high school department, preferably as principal. I feel strongly that we should have a man in the School. While Mr. Mattil teaches agriculture his work keeps him away from the School practically all of the time, even the classes he conducts are in a separate building and he never has time to be on the play ground even at recess. Were a man put in as principal his work should not be too heavy for him really to have supervision of the whole School. The weak place has always been in regard to supervision, in trying to keep each room a separate unit instead of holding everything together as a whole. Were ,conditions a little different in Sevierville I would make the recommendation this year that we turn back to the county the first six grades. With an eight month's school term, better teachers and salaries in the county and as much improvement as has been made in the past two or three years I believe we should give back to the county the grade work. It would take a year or more for the county to pre-pare to take this but I believe if it did it would make 'Gatlinburg a consolidated school, as it probably never will under present conditions. This does not mean. that I would advise giving up all super-vision of the School, we would not be asked to, the county is glad to employ Pi Phi teachers and would pay as good salaries as we are pay--lug. I firmly believe there is danger of schools of this kind holding on-to work after the county is able to take it over. We would have a big task left if we carried the next four grades, the home economics, agriculture, weaving, health, and community work, and the industrial department. During the year health plays were given by the grade children. At the close of the eight months of school Miss Burton's, Mrs. Chapin's and Mr. Watson's pupils gave three short plays. The usual Christmas program was given. The closing exercises for eighth grades and high schoOl consisted of a play in the nature of a minstrel show, given by the boys glee club, on May 10 and May 20 an address was given by Mr. Charles Sharp of Sevierville. The Red Cross certificates were given to the twelve girls completing the course in Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick and eighth grade certificates were given to twenty-one pupils. This was followed by a little banquet. With school opening as late as September it was necessary to continue until May 20, later than any school in Sevier county. This was tried as an experiment. The pupils have stayed in well as they possibly could but I feel that next year it will be better to open earlier, then if time has to be lost it can be during the first month instead of the last. Surely the first seven grades must begin August 1. In the winter the New York Club obtained passes to New York for Helen Chew so she could be present for the February meeting. THE ARROW Or PI BE:T.A PHI :argaret White and Whtogene Redding visited Berea Cillege. ?veral from ;he School attended the Mountain Conference 7'ille. COMMUNITY ach year we bring the same report: we have done what we felt uld but have fallen far short of meeting the needs of the con-y from a social standpoint. uring last summer we found it impossible to movies once ,k in the .barn because of lack of current. This spring we have d them again and hope we can continue. he Evening School Club, IneetnIg twice a month meets a social I] as educational need. he usual number of parties were held duril.g the year. Each in the winter there are basketball games in the barn loft.

Had we a community hall we could have more ainments, socials, etc. atlinburg fair was held again last fall and was very successful. .so sent exhibits to the Sevier county fair. or the development of the community social work I feel we would a community worker for Saturdays and Sundays and a corn-y hall. HOME ECONOI\.IICS his department has continued in much the same way as last The outstanding development has been in the community work. lornings are taken up with high school classes in the School. The .00ns are given to classes in different communities. New cornies have been added to the list and more classes held in the Gat-g school for the women and girls. :iss Steele's report gives in detail her work and also shows what of riding it requires. She is faithful to the last degree and no day is bad enough for her to think she should give up a trip for s. M4iss Steele has accomplished almost the impossible in inter-the women in these classes. She also has organized a club that twice a month, the nurse giving a health program one time ; she .ng a home economics one the next meeting. Usually they show (gotten from the University of Tennessee) and have! a special These clubs are well attended and the women do so well. read papers and give talks on the subjects and take a great deal nest. Several feel that we are really meeting a community need :se meetings. REPORTS Or OrricERs 87 Miss White, the State SupervisOr of Home Economics, has recommended to the state that the home economics teacher here be put on full time for community work, the state paying the entire salary. This year the state has been allowing us $1000.00 but on the other hand they asked that we raise Miss, Steele's salary in proportion. Were we to release Miss Steele from school work it would be necessary to have the school home economics taught by one of the other teachers. Last year Barbara Dewell did half-time teaching in the School during the winter months and relieved the other teachers very much but at that time we were carrying three years of high school classes. My definite recommendation regarding this cannot be made until I know surely what the state will do. AGRICULTURE Mr. Mattil's report gives such a detailed account of the activities of this department I will not attempt to list them in my report. The mornings are given to school work, as well as a lot of calls people make here, the afternoons, to community work. Three new communities havel been added to the list of those having evening school work. Much time has to be put into the planning and carrying on of fairs each fall. Before the fairs there are community meetings in a great many schools and these are not only agricultural but usually show pictures relative to better homes and better health. The real development of the work is shown in the number of calls made on Mr. Mattil to advise regarding orchards, stock, farm crops, etc. The chicken business takes much time, too. There are calls to see sick animals, to know what to spray with, what kind of chicken house to build and numberless other questions. Mr. Mattil spent six weeks in Cornell University last summer. I surely hope he will feel he can remain here another year. Boys' DORMITORY The boys' dormitory has been managed better this year than ever before and the end of the year shows the good results. Mrs. Dowell has been faithful to her task, which means a lot when you remember that no other teachers live in the cottage so there never is anyone to relieve her of her cares for even a single night. . With better supervision of the boys' work we have had little trouble. During the fall there were eight boys on the hill but the the close of school found only four there. One boy dropped out of school in the spring, another stayed with a relative, another couldn't keep the smoking regulations, another one was in seventh grade so left as soon as that closed. The only question of discipline has come in regard to smoking. THE ARROW or PI BETA PHI Sirs. Dowell supervised the noon lunch for the children in Dorothy ner's and Emily Burton's rooms, lunch was served in the kindrten room. GIRLS' .DoRmITORY The year has passed unusually well here. There have been from to seven girls in the dormitory and there has been no trouble Lever. Mrs. McCarter and Aunt Lizzie have done the cooking for the .e family, boys, girls and teachers. The plan has worked out very and has proved to be the best way to manage. The changes in fall required comparatively little financial outlay and no changes ny amount in the cottages. The meals have been well balanced and appetizing and I feel we better cared for than those in the average boarding school. While the girls have not had much chance to help with the cooking have done other house work that has kept them busy. The boys stayed week-ends more than the girls have as Saturday farm ^ was always pressing. In both girls' and boys' dormitories there should be a way for those L arge to be relieved as every day and every night makes a pretty [ strain. It was my idea this year to relieve ourselves as much as possible try to have the Burg help bear the burden of the boarding pupils at the end of the year I feel I have made a mistake. Some of our t promising pupils are in homes in the Burg. With the little super-)n the average family gives, the results are not what they should The work for students has been better planned this year and posy we can improve still more another year and have more under our FARM The farm work has been looked after and partially done by Otha gala, under the planning and supervision of Mr. Mattil. Otha has red to be quite a good hand to look after the boys and their work the result has been that the farm is in better condition and the k and chickens have done better this year than ever before. Stu-help is hard to handle, hours are more uncertain, work has to be fully checked up and lots of patience and encouragement used. The reports of the farm, as submitted by Mr. Mattil, show that '0 has been a good amount of production toward the living. We have been able to sell quite a little. The chicken business has e to be quite a thing. During the spring a great many baby chicks e sold and settings given out around the district. These are paid by people returning pullets in the fall. More hay was raised this REPORTS OF' OrrIaRS 89 past year but we are not able to raise all we need yet. Last year we hoped to but failed. Each year, however, shows an improvement in the farm products. STUDENT LABOR Both boys and girls put in most of the out of school hours in work on the place. During the year the boys have their baseball and basketbal to take some outside time but the boys look after the horses, chick-ens, cows, pigs, carrying in the wood, cleaning the schoolhouse, and a great many odd jobs. The girls wait on table, set table, help with the dishes, keep the cottages clean, etc. It is a . big expense to keep the dormitories open but the school shows that those boys and girls living on the place hold out best in their school work. This past year we have felt that the grade of work done by the students was better than ever before and the work better organized. HEALTH The report from this department shows that there have been several changes during the year. Phyllis Higinbotham left in the early spring of 1926. Mabel Sthuckman' came at once and remained four months. She was a fine nurse and hard worker and had she been con-tent in the country might have remained. She did not, however, care to stay so Ruby Ryman took her place in the fall of 1926. She came just in time to assist with the largest tonsil and, adenoid clinic we have ever had and to be with Miss Schuckman long enough to get a good idea of the work and to become somewhat acquainted. Miss Ryman has carried out an extensive health program in the schools. The toxin, antitoxin, and typhoid clinics were very large. During much of the winter time both Sevierville and Pittman Center were without nurses so many long trips were made by our nurse, giving inoculations to school children in 'Green Briar, Emerts Cove, Smoky Mountain and Wears Valley. It was possible to make longer trips this year as roads were bet-ter, where they had been improved, and a car could be used quite a good deal. On the other hand, the roads that were bad were awful as we had a rainy winter. The transportation problem was acute during the time' Mr. Matti, Jean Steele and Ruby Ryman all needed horses the same afternoons, but they all lived through, even the horses and cars, and now the family is on very good terms again. With better roads it is much easier for the doctors to keep their afternoons at the office. The dentist comes twice a month now and always has full work. There have been several very successful clinics. There has been quite a change in the nature of work done at the center and through the community. This change has been coming for 90 THE ARROW OF' PI BETA PHI several years. While we would not want too much of the home and bedside work to stop we are glad to see the work on a health educatinal basis. Night calls for the nurse are few now and calls that should be for a doctor instead of a nurse are fewer. Having telephone connections with Sevierville and Knoxville has helped tremendously. Miss Hyman likes and understands the mountain people and if she is satisfied to continue I feel she can do well. She will have to be in college six weeks this summer taking a public health course and I am not sure she will return after that. We must continue trying to locate a Pi Phi nurse, one who will come with the idea of staying more than a few months. Frequent changes in any department handicap the work very much. During all these changes we have been very fortunate in having Lillie Reagan, a local girl, in the office. Lillie has been familiar with the work, the people and their needs , has taken care of all correspondence; ordering of supplies ; all care of the Center , and what is more, Dr. Ogle made the statement the other day that he had never known anyone with a finer sense of when to be present and when to be absent. We have tried to have a school girl help a little with the cleaning, to relieve Lillie some, as she finds more work than she is able to do. I feel strongly that we have been unfair this year. We have paid $50.00, home and travel for this work, the girls having shorter hours and really less responsibility. Now we are paying $30.00 and Lillie boarding at home. It seems to me we have taken advantage of a willing spirit. My recommendation for this department is that we pay Lillie Reagan $40.00 per month with a reimbursement of $50.00 as the salary should have been raised the first of the year. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Due to changes in county health physicians and nurses the year has been a hard one for the unit. We have had three different nurses within the year, Pittman had a change and was for several weeks 'with-out a nurse, Sevierville was several weeks without a nurse. The present doctor has been in very poor health ever since he came. While I do not doubt the wisdom of continuing with the Unit I do feel this year the work has been going on under difficulties. Whenever there is any help available we are sure of getting our share and I feel we should continue with the Unit. It is rather of a surprise each year that the county court votes the necessary appropriation as always there are those who are opposed but it passes with a good majority. If we gained nothing more than the free serums and the help from the county unit in holding large school clinics I would say it was worth while. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 9 WEAVING Much of the report of this department is covered in the report o] industrial work. Miss Redding has had one high school class in weaving. This claa meets each day one double period. Little is done by these girls fa market but practically all the time is used for definite instruction b weaving, patterns, colors, etc. A great deal of time is given to the women who weave in their homes or on school looms. This year more women came to the housl to see Miss Redding, calls here taking the place of long trips by Mis Redding to their homes. Weaving was done in not less than thirt homes. In spite of the large amount of weaving we had on hand last sum mer and early fall we found it almost impossible to keep up with the Christmas orders. School did not open until September and that lef little time to prepare for the unusually large amount of business. Afte Christmas there was time to work' out some new things and this sum mer we have some really lovely weaving in the Shop. During the year we sent several exhibits away and found tha the work from our school compared well with that from other wel known places. The Mountain Conference in Knoxville made much o the mountain industries. While there may not be much financial profi in sending these there is a certain amount of advertising done and 'w, also are showing our interest in the mountain work. The financial system of this year has helped to carry this tremend ous increase of business, yet it has not been perfect by any means any I am sure that the detailed report of Miss Redding explains every thing. Also it was impossible to do all we would have liked to for tin, was not to be had. Before Christmas all who could devoted prat tically all their time to this work and even then found it impossible t keep up with the orders or with the products. With one definitel: in charge next fall and with the financial system so we can start ou out in a businesslike way at once I feel sure we will carry the depart went much better. The business can be carried much better when we have more root for shipping, for finished products and for materials. INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT The growth of this department has been so rapid that in spite a the plans we make each year to handle the business we and ourselve simply swamped, all who possibly can neglect their duties giving fu] time to filling orders, doing up bundles and taking care of endless coi respondence. On May 1, 1926, Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor opened the Gil Shop in the Stuart Cottage. Each girl had a third interest, the Scho( keeping one third stock, too. The Shop not only took care of the man 92 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI tourists who came but also took over all correspondence and shipping. It not only was a wonderful relief to us who had been doing it all but the financial results were beyond expectations. With the first of September, the Shop closed and baskets, weaving, chairs and stools were again deposited in the attic, the basement, the offices, the upstairs hall and the girls' trunks in the Teacher's Cottage. Visitors and customers continued to visit us and always when we were the deepest in daily work. From September 1 to January 1 we shipped from here nearly $10,000 worth of products. It took the combined efforts of Miss Red-ding, Miss Allen and myself, to say nothing of those who packed baskets. Had there been room in the house for another person we surely would have had one to help but we were too crowded to put another person in the office. Lois Rogers returned the middle of April and we surely were de-lighted to see her. We closed the kindergarten work two weeks early in order to be able to open a Gift Shop, called the Arrowcraft Shop. That was the only place available and really our ex-dining room, kindergarten room, made a very attractive shop. Eugenia Dilworth, of Austin, comes the first of June to help Lois, and at that time the girls will move the shop back in the Stuart Cottage. It would be better to have it on the road but we cannot plan on using the agriculture building until we know more definitely whether it will have to be used the same in the fall. We are sure, however, that there must be a person here all the time to manage the industrial work. During the summer months the Arrowcraft girls purchased $3,131.-43 and sold $3,990.76. From September to May the School bought $9,274.59 and shipped $13,804.16. Of course a good deal was returned p.t the end of the club yeaii but this gives some idea of the amount of business done. While the new business system was not entirely satisfactory any of the time it was such an improvement over the old way that I feel we never could have carried on under old conditions and I feel sure, too, that another year we will be able to have things go satisfactorily. SUG.A.RLANDS Sugarlands, like Gatlinburg has to be considered on the twelve months basis, rather than on the eight months school term. During the summer of 1926 Miss Chew had adult classes and as early as July 1, she and Cora McCarter commenced school, teaching a half day session until the county 'school opened the middle of July. From the middle of July to September the girls carried on a full school program, night school classes and all the house work. This. made entirely too heavy a schedule. In September, Martha Flowers came. she was to look after the house in the morning, prepare the noon meal ind then 'Van two hours in the afternoon Miss Chew did corn R] PORTS or OrricERs 93 munity work and held some adult classes. This was carried out after a fashion through the year but was not entirely satisfactory. It was upsetting to the teachers and fully as much so to the pupils to have their day divided up in that manner. The night classes were well attended, they require much preparation as it is impossible to secure satisfactory text books for that kind of teaching. After each evening class there was a period of recreation, all three teachers helping with that. Having school from eight in the morning until nine-thirty at night may not sound like so much but on the weeks that Miss Chew had to be up at five o'clock to prepare breakfast it proved to be a whole lot. The community work and adult teaching could easily take all the time of one person. But this was only a part of the worry, the new schoolhouse was not completed until after Christmas. The county did not want to put repairs into the old building so bitter winter weather found the girls teaching in a room with practically no window panes, a house so frail that on very windy days school had to be dismissed in safety to the children. Finally window panes were put in but it was a joy when school finally was moved into the new building. In addition to this was the anxiety regarding the Teacher's Cottage. But for the promise made to the people I doubt if we would have tried to build before spring. The roads were terrible, no one wanted to take the job, the local men wanted work by the day but none of them could supervise or read the plans. Finally two men from Gatlinburg said they would take the job, using some Sugarlands men, if Mr. Mattil would help them. In this way the -cottage was finally completed. The house is very attractive and convenient and while it has cost more than planned it has cost less than any contract price submitted. The building has made a hole in our finances but I think it probably is better to have built well in the beginning. During this summer Helen Chew. is continuing night classes and the people have a community gathering each Saturday night. . Miss Steele continues her Home Economics class with the women and Mr. Mattil makes frequent visits in the community. The county bears the expense of two teachers and the state has allowed quite a liberal amount toward the adult work so the running expenses of the Sugarlands Extension are not so heavy. Miss Chew is not sure she can return another year but if she is able to, I feel she should have full time for adult and community work. Two teachers can take care of the school work. It is necessary to have an experienced teacher and a Pi Phi in the school. We have no one on the Gatlinburg staff who could be transferred to this place and put in charge of the Extension. Not only from my observations here but in what I have gathered from attending conferences have I been convinced that Helen Chew is carrying on one of the best pieces of adult education and community THE ARROW' Or PI BETA PHI Not a great deal is said about it but it is accomplishing some-g. Anyone who is familiar with teaching knows how hard it is to est those above the school age. I' surely feel we should continue part of the Sugarlands program if possible but if Miss Chew does ? to leave it will be hard to fill her place. GENERAL EXTENSION WORK During the past year Miss Steele has had classes in Laurel Lick, arlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River and Gatlinburg. Mr. Mattil has had classes in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Wears Val-Middle Creek, New Era and Gatlinburg. The nurse has had clinics in all schools in the district and has also to Wears Valley, Green Briar, Emerts Cove and Smoky Mountain school clinics. Mr. M[attil had many meetings during the fall, preparatory to the in different school districts. The work in the Sugarlands is outstanding, especially along the of adult education. The past two years have proved to me that our field lies in this ion program, giving the people something the county school cannot these rural schools for years to ,come. What we are doing for bet-homes, better farms, better health and broader lives fully justifies expenditures and our being here. OFFICE With the opening of the school year LaDelle came to take over h of the bookkeeping connected with the School and to help with a. office work. Everything was new to her and to me and at first ras impossible to know what, when or how. Six weeks or more t by before the books could be opened. There were, however, plenty hings to keep all hands busy. On September the Shop closed and all that business, as well as I orders, visitors, people to buy from and everything were dumped the office we had moved into. We had thought we would have ty of room by taking what had been the down stairs office for La e's and my office but it soon was filled with weaving and many r things. A new typewriter, adding machine and some other smaller office Anent were purchased. LaDelle Allen has done well with the work and in. spite of the unt of time we had to put into the industrial business during the she has kept up the book work very well. With the increased amount of business done in the industrial dement I am sure we never could have handled it all had not much he business been handled entirely from here. Much correspondenc e REPORTS 01 01TICERS 95 has been saved and time in attending to the accounts. While there are quite a good many accounts not yet closed collections have been made fairly easily. In checking up the reports it becomes clear why the monthly bank allowance does not cover expenses. The months we do the heaviest buying are the months the least cash comes in. That explains why we were behind month after month and still are. If we continue to buy industrial supplies and products at this rate the fixed bank balance will have to be increased. It takes a year to try out these things and I think that probably another year we can get along pretty well but the fall was terribly trying. Practically no time has been given to letters to the clubs or chapters, to constructive planning for the School, or even to enough committee letters, yet more hours have been spent in the office than ever before. With the correspondence relative to the industrial business and the other work connected with that the office time has been entirely taken up. The Gatlinburg News .has gone to each club, officer and to the isolated Pi Phis who have sent in their contributions through Dorothy Geare. In the April News I enclosed a club letter, giving a brief summary of the year's work. These club letters should go out every month and I surely plan to see that it is done next year. Letters direct from the School do bring results. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAJRS MADE DURING 1926-27 Sugarlands Teacher's Cottage built. Plans secured for industrial building in Gatlinburg. New entrance made to the grounds and iron gate hung. Telephone installed, school furnishing 50 poles. New chicken house built. Brooder house enlarged. Small barn built on Sims place. Sims place surveyed and fenced. New typewriter, adding machine, broad shelves, etc., gotten for of-fiCe. Small changes made in Pollard Cottage to take care of the dormitory boys, girls and teachers for meals. All plumbing, heating, etc., thoroughly looked over during the vacation. Some furniture made : tables, shelves, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1927-28 New building for industrial departments. Plans for community hall. Continuation of Gift Shop through entire year, THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them. I am sure all could rather wait even longer and finally get a plan that will call for building within our means. In closing my report I want again to thank the committee for the plendid support and cooperation. Our problems are many, the School as grown beyond any early dreams and the development is the result f the splendid service given by those Pi Phis on the committee and way from the School who continue to have such a deep interest in the cork. thiVELYN BisHor REPORTS or OrF'ICERS 97 Report of Treasurer of Settlement School We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, T6nnessee, for the period 1926-1927 ending May 16, 1927.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres

Otha Reagan, Supervisor of student labor, farmer. Leander McCarter, General Labor. Lizzie Reagan, Cook. Mrs. McCarter, Ccok. ScHoor, The enrollment for the past year falls a very little below the nunilast year as there has been no consolidation whatever. The at-mace from our local community has been a little larger. The only reason we cannot show a much better attendance is be e of the epidemics that have visited us. Measles were raging school opened in the fall and continued for a good part of the chicken pox, flu and mumps followed and practically everyone, tnd young, had them. The school work has gone on easier than usual, no doubt due to few changes in the teaching staff. Miss Burton returned, after a 's absence, for her ninth school year and taught the first and see-grades. Her work was made easier because of the kindergarten primer classes carried on in the dining-room of the Teacher's Cot-by Miss Trainer. This experiment was tried out this past year while we have no doubt of the need and of the good work done I eel that with finances low we should try to get along without it year. Mrs. Chapin taught the third and fourth grades and did splendid She came with the understanding she would supervise the es up to the seventh, but it proved very hard to do as that had Been the custom in the past. lean Steele taught one double period high school class in hotde omics each school day. Cdr. Mattil taught two double period high school classes each day. Winogene Redding taught one double period high. school class each With the full schedule of regular work the boys and girls were very busy in school and it seemed as though every minute was pied out of school hours. [t does not seem wise to carry more than two years of high school : for the present. .Our first year class is large but the second class the past year had only two pupils in it. The roads are good gh now so pupils can go to Sevierville to school without much :nifty. We had four pupils going back and forth this year. the county superintendent tells us that the two years of high )l work here is accredited but we have not official acknowledge-of this. So far our pupils have had to take ea aminations when .ing accredited high schools in the state. REPORTS OP OFFICERS 85 Elmer Watson does not return next year Margaret White does not expect to, nor does Marion Folsom. If these changes have to come it seems to me it would be the time to put a strong man into the high school department, preferably as principal. I feel strongly that we should have a man in the School. While Mr. Mattil teaches agriculture his work keeps him away from the School practically all of the time, even the classes he conducts are in a separate building and he never has time to be on the play ground even at recess. Were a man put in as principal his work should not be too heavy for him really to have supervision of the whole School. The weak place has always been in regard to supervision, in trying to keep each room a separate unit instead of holding everything together as a whole. Were ,conditions a little different in Sevierville I would make the recommendation this year that we turn back to the county the first six grades. With an eight month's school term, better teachers and salaries in the county and as much improvement as has been made in the past two or three years I believe we should give back to the county the grade work. It would take a year or more for the county to pre-pare to take this but I believe if it did it would make 'Gatlinburg a consolidated school, as it probably never will under present conditions. This does not mean. that I would advise giving up all super-vision of the School, we would not be asked to, the county is glad to employ Pi Phi teachers and would pay as good salaries as we are pay--lug. I firmly believe there is danger of schools of this kind holding on-to work after the county is able to take it over. We would have a big task left if we carried the next four grades, the home economics, agriculture, weaving, health, and community work, and the industrial department. During the year health plays were given by the grade children. At the close of the eight months of school Miss Burton's, Mrs. Chapin's and Mr. Watson's pupils gave three short plays. The usual Christmas program was given. The closing exercises for eighth grades and high schoOl consisted of a play in the nature of a minstrel show, given by the boys glee club, on May 10 and May 20 an address was given by Mr. Charles Sharp of Sevierville. The Red Cross certificates were given to the twelve girls completing the course in Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick and eighth grade certificates were given to twenty-one pupils. This was followed by a little banquet. With school opening as late as September it was necessary to continue until May 20, later than any school in Sevier county. This was tried as an experiment. The pupils have stayed in well as they possibly could but I feel that next year it will be better to open earlier, then if time has to be lost it can be during the first month instead of the last.

HOME ECONOI\.IICS his department has continued in much the same way as last The outstanding development has been in the community work. lornings are taken up with high school classes in the School. The .00ns are given to classes in different communities. New cornies have been added to the list and more classes held in the Gat-g school for the women and girls. :iss Steele's report gives in detail her work and also shows what of riding it requires. She is faithful to the last degree and no day is bad enough for her to think she should give up a trip for s. M4iss Steele has accomplished almost the impossible in inter-the women in these classes. She also has organized a club that twice a month, the nurse giving a health program one time ; she .ng a home economics one the next meeting. Usually they show (gotten from the University of Tennessee) and have! a special These clubs are well attended and the women do so well. read papers and give talks on the subjects and take a great deal nest. Several feel that we are really meeting a community need :se meetings. REPORTS Or OrricERs 87 Miss White, the State SupervisOr of Home Economics, has recommended to the state that the home economics teacher here be put on full time for community work, the state paying the entire salary. This year the state has been allowing us $1000.00 but on the other hand they asked that we raise Miss, Steele's salary in proportion. Were we to release Miss Steele from school work it would be necessary to have the school home economics taught by one of the other teachers. Last year Barbara Dewell did half-time teaching in the School during the winter months and relieved the other teachers very much but at that time we were carrying three years of high school classes. My definite recommendation regarding this cannot be made until I know surely what the state will do. AGRICULTURE Mr. Mattil's report gives such a detailed account of the activities of this department I will not attempt to list them in my report. The mornings are given to school work, as well as a lot of calls people make here, the afternoons, to community work. Three new communities havel been added to the list of those having evening school work. Much time has to be put into the planning and carrying on of fairs each fall. Before the fairs there are community meetings in a great many schools and these are not only agricultural but usually show pictures relative to better homes and better health. The real development of the work is shown in the number of calls made on Mr. Mattil to advise regarding orchards, stock, farm crops, etc. The chicken business takes much time, too. There are calls to see sick animals, to know what to spray with, what kind of chicken house to build and numberless other questions. Mr. Mattil spent six weeks in Cornell University last summer. I surely hope he will feel he can remain here another year. Boys' DORMITORY The boys' dormitory has been managed better this year than ever before and the end of the year shows the good results. Mrs. Dowell has been faithful to her task, which means a lot when you remember that no other teachers live in the cottage so there never is anyone to relieve her of her cares for even a single night. . With better supervision of the boys' work we have had little trouble. During the fall there were eight boys on the hill but the the close of school found only four there. One boy dropped out of school in the spring, another stayed with a relative, another couldn't keep the smoking regulations, another one was in seventh grade so left as soon as that closed. The only question of discipline has come in regard to smoking. THE ARROW or PI BETA PHI Sirs. Dowell supervised the noon lunch for the children in Dorothy ner's and Emily Burton's rooms, lunch was served in the kindrten room. GIRLS' .DoRmITORY The year has passed unusually well here. There have been from to seven girls in the dormitory and there has been no trouble Lever. Mrs. McCarter and Aunt Lizzie have done the cooking for the .e family, boys, girls and teachers. The plan has worked out very and has proved to be the best way to manage. The changes in fall required comparatively little financial outlay and no changes ny amount in the cottages. The meals have been well balanced and appetizing and I feel we better cared for than those in the average boarding school. While the girls have not had much chance to help with the cooking have done other house work that has kept them busy. The boys stayed week-ends more than the girls have as Saturday farm ^ was always pressing. In both girls' and boys' dormitories there should be a way for those L arge to be relieved as every day and every night makes a pretty [ strain. It was my idea this year to relieve ourselves as much as possible try to have the Burg help bear the burden of the boarding pupils at the end of the year I feel I have made a mistake. Some of our t promising pupils are in homes in the Burg. With the little super-)n the average family gives, the results are not what they should The work for students has been better planned this year and posy we can improve still more another year and have more under our FARM The farm work has been looked after and partially done by Otha gala, under the planning and supervision of Mr. Mattil. Otha has red to be quite a good hand to look after the boys and their work the result has been that the farm is in better condition and the k and chickens have done better this year than ever before. Stu-help is hard to handle, hours are more uncertain, work has to be fully checked up and lots of patience and encouragement used. The reports of the farm, as submitted by Mr. Mattil, show that '0 has been a good amount of production toward the living. We have been able to sell quite a little. The chicken business has e to be quite a thing. During the spring a great many baby chicks e sold and settings given out around the district. These are paid by people returning pullets in the fall. More hay was raised this REPORTS OF' OrrIaRS 89 past year but we are not able to raise all we need yet. Last year we hoped to but failed. Each year, however, shows an improvement in the farm products. STUDENT LABOR Both boys and girls put in most of the out of school hours in work on the place. During the year the boys have their baseball and basketbal to take some outside time but the boys look after the horses, chick-ens, cows, pigs, carrying in the wood, cleaning the schoolhouse, and a great many odd jobs. The girls wait on table, set table, help with the dishes, keep the cottages clean, etc. It is a . big expense to keep the dormitories open but the school shows that those boys and girls living on the place hold out best in their school work. This past year we have felt that the grade of work done by the students was better than ever before and the work better organized. HEALTH The report from this department shows that there have been several changes during the year. Phyllis Higinbotham left in the early spring of 1926. Mabel Sthuckman' came at once and remained four months. She was a fine nurse and hard worker and had she been con-tent in the country might have remained. She did not, however, care to stay so Ruby Ryman took her place in the fall of 1926. She came just in time to assist with the largest tonsil and, adenoid clinic we have ever had and to be with Miss Schuckman long enough to get a good idea of the work and to become somewhat acquainted. Miss Ryman has carried out an extensive health program in the schools. The toxin, antitoxin, and typhoid clinics were very large. During much of the winter time both Sevierville and Pittman Center were without nurses so many long trips were made by our nurse, giving inoculations to school children in 'Green Briar, Emerts Cove, Smoky Mountain and Wears Valley. It was possible to make longer trips this year as roads were bet-ter, where they had been improved, and a car could be used quite a good deal. On the other hand, the roads that were bad were awful as we had a rainy winter. The transportation problem was acute during the time' Mr. Matti, Jean Steele and Ruby Ryman all needed horses the same afternoons, but they all lived through, even the horses and cars, and now the family is on very good terms again. With better roads it is much easier for the doctors to keep their afternoons at the office. The dentist comes twice a month now and always has full work. There have been several very successful clinics. There has been quite a change in the nature of work done at the center and through the community. This change has been coming for 90 THE ARROW OF' PI BETA PHI several years. While we would not want too much of the home and bedside work to stop we are glad to see the work on a health educatinal basis. Night calls for the nurse are few now and calls that should be for a doctor instead of a nurse are fewer. Having telephone connections with Sevierville and Knoxville has helped tremendously. Miss Hyman likes and understands the mountain people and if she is satisfied to continue I feel she can do well. She will have to be in college six weeks this summer taking a public health course and I am not sure she will return after that. We must continue trying to locate a Pi Phi nurse, one who will come with the idea of staying more than a few months. Frequent changes in any department handicap the work very much. During all these changes we have been very fortunate in having Lillie Reagan, a local girl, in the office. Lillie has been familiar with the work, the people and their needs , has taken care of all correspondence; ordering of supplies ; all care of the Center , and what is more, Dr. Ogle made the statement the other day that he had never known anyone with a finer sense of when to be present and when to be absent. We have tried to have a school girl help a little with the cleaning, to relieve Lillie some, as she finds more work than she is able to do. I feel strongly that we have been unfair this year. We have paid $50.00, home and travel for this work, the girls having shorter hours and really less responsibility. Now we are paying $30.00 and Lillie boarding at home. It seems to me we have taken advantage of a willing spirit. My recommendation for this department is that we pay Lillie Reagan $40.00 per month with a reimbursement of $50.00 as the salary should have been raised the first of the year. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Due to changes in county health physicians and nurses the year has been a hard one for the unit. We have had three different nurses within the year, Pittman had a change and was for several weeks 'with-out a nurse, Sevierville was several weeks without a nurse. The present doctor has been in very poor health ever since he came. While I do not doubt the wisdom of continuing with the Unit I do feel this year the work has been going on under difficulties. Whenever there is any help available we are sure of getting our share and I feel we should continue with the Unit. It is rather of a surprise each year that the county court votes the necessary appropriation as always there are those who are opposed but it passes with a good majority. If we gained nothing more than the free serums and the help from the county unit in holding large school clinics I would say it was worth while. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 9 WEAVING Much of the report of this department is covered in the report o] industrial work. Miss Redding has had one high school class in weaving. This claa meets each day one double period. Little is done by these girls fa market but practically all the time is used for definite instruction b weaving, patterns, colors, etc. A great deal of time is given to the women who weave in their homes or on school looms. This year more women came to the housl to see Miss Redding, calls here taking the place of long trips by Mis Redding to their homes. Weaving was done in not less than thirt homes. In spite of the large amount of weaving we had on hand last sum mer and early fall we found it almost impossible to keep up with the Christmas orders. School did not open until September and that lef little time to prepare for the unusually large amount of business. Afte Christmas there was time to work' out some new things and this sum mer we have some really lovely weaving in the Shop. During the year we sent several exhibits away and found tha the work from our school compared well with that from other wel known places. The Mountain Conference in Knoxville made much o the mountain industries. While there may not be much financial profi in sending these there is a certain amount of advertising done and 'w, also are showing our interest in the mountain work. The financial system of this year has helped to carry this tremend ous increase of business, yet it has not been perfect by any means any I am sure that the detailed report of Miss Redding explains every thing. Also it was impossible to do all we would have liked to for tin, was not to be had. Before Christmas all who could devoted prat tically all their time to this work and even then found it impossible t keep up with the orders or with the products. With one definitel: in charge next fall and with the financial system so we can start ou out in a businesslike way at once I feel sure we will carry the depart went much better. The business can be carried much better when we have more root for shipping, for finished products and for materials. INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT The growth of this department has been so rapid that in spite a the plans we make each year to handle the business we and ourselve simply swamped, all who possibly can neglect their duties giving fu] time to filling orders, doing up bundles and taking care of endless coi respondence. On May 1, 1926, Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor opened the Gil Shop in the Stuart Cottage. Each girl had a third interest, the Scho( keeping one third stock, too. The Shop not only took care of the man 92 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI tourists who came but also took over all correspondence and shipping. It not only was a wonderful relief to us who had been doing it all but the financial results were beyond expectations. With the first of September, the Shop closed and baskets, weaving, chairs and stools were again deposited in the attic, the basement, the offices, the upstairs hall and the girls' trunks in the Teacher's Cottage. Visitors and customers continued to visit us and always when we were the deepest in daily work. From September 1 to January 1 we shipped from here nearly $10,000 worth of products. It took the combined efforts of Miss Red-ding, Miss Allen and myself, to say nothing of those who packed baskets. Had there been room in the house for another person we surely would have had one to help but we were too crowded to put another person in the office. Lois Rogers returned the middle of April and we surely were de-lighted to see her. We closed the kindergarten work two weeks early in order to be able to open a Gift Shop, called the Arrowcraft Shop. That was the only place available and really our ex-dining room, kindergarten room, made a very attractive shop. Eugenia Dilworth, of Austin, comes the first of June to help Lois, and at that time the girls will move the shop back in the Stuart Cottage. It would be better to have it on the road but we cannot plan on using the agriculture building until we know more definitely whether it will have to be used the same in the fall. We are sure, however, that there must be a person here all the time to manage the industrial work. During the summer months the Arrowcraft girls purchased $3,131.-43 and sold $3,990.76. From September to May the School bought $9,274.59 and shipped $13,804.16. Of course a good deal was returned p.t the end of the club yeaii but this gives some idea of the amount of business done. While the new business system was not entirely satisfactory any of the time it was such an improvement over the old way that I feel we never could have carried on under old conditions and I feel sure, too, that another year we will be able to have things go satisfactorily. SUG.A.RLANDS Sugarlands, like Gatlinburg has to be considered on the twelve months basis, rather than on the eight months school term. During the summer of 1926 Miss Chew had adult classes and as early as July 1, she and Cora McCarter commenced school, teaching a half day session until the county 'school opened the middle of July. From the middle of July to September the girls carried on a full school program, night school classes and all the house work. This. made entirely too heavy a schedule. In September, Martha Flowers came. she was to look after the house in the morning, prepare the noon meal ind then 'Van two hours in the afternoon Miss Chew did corn R] PORTS or OrricERs 93 munity work and held some adult classes. This was carried out after a fashion through the year but was not entirely satisfactory. It was upsetting to the teachers and fully as much so to the pupils to have their day divided up in that manner. The night classes were well attended, they require much preparation as it is impossible to secure satisfactory text books for that kind of teaching. After each evening class there was a period of recreation, all three teachers helping with that. Having school from eight in the morning until nine-thirty at night may not sound like so much but on the weeks that Miss Chew had to be up at five o'clock to prepare breakfast it proved to be a whole lot. The community work and adult teaching could easily take all the time of one person. But this was only a part of the worry, the new schoolhouse was not completed until after Christmas. The county did not want to put repairs into the old building so bitter winter weather found the girls teaching in a room with practically no window panes, a house so frail that on very windy days school had to be dismissed in safety to the children. Finally window panes were put in but it was a joy when school finally was moved into the new building. In addition to this was the anxiety regarding the Teacher's Cottage. But for the promise made to the people I doubt if we would have tried to build before spring. The roads were terrible, no one wanted to take the job, the local men wanted work by the day but none of them could supervise or read the plans. Finally two men from Gatlinburg said they would take the job, using some Sugarlands men, if Mr. Mattil would help them. In this way the -cottage was finally completed. The house is very attractive and convenient and while it has cost more than planned it has cost less than any contract price submitted. The building has made a hole in our finances but I think it probably is better to have built well in the beginning. During this summer Helen Chew. is continuing night classes and the people have a community gathering each Saturday night. . Miss Steele continues her Home Economics class with the women and Mr. Mattil makes frequent visits in the community. The county bears the expense of two teachers and the state has allowed quite a liberal amount toward the adult work so the running expenses of the Sugarlands Extension are not so heavy. Miss Chew is not sure she can return another year but if she is able to, I feel she should have full time for adult and community work. Two teachers can take care of the school work. It is necessary to have an experienced teacher and a Pi Phi in the school. We have no one on the Gatlinburg staff who could be transferred to this place and put in charge of the Extension. Not only from my observations here but in what I have gathered from attending conferences have I been convinced that Helen Chew is carrying on one of the best pieces of adult education and community THE ARROW' Or PI BETA PHI Not a great deal is said about it but it is accomplishing some-g. Anyone who is familiar with teaching knows how hard it is to est those above the school age. I' surely feel we should continue part of the Sugarlands program if possible but if Miss Chew does ? to leave it will be hard to fill her place. GENERAL EXTENSION WORK During the past year Miss Steele has had classes in Laurel Lick, arlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River and Gatlinburg. Mr. Mattil has had classes in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Wears Val-Middle Creek, New Era and Gatlinburg. The nurse has had clinics in all schools in the district and has also to Wears Valley, Green Briar, Emerts Cove and Smoky Mountain school clinics. Mr. M[attil had many meetings during the fall, preparatory to the in different school districts. The work in the Sugarlands is outstanding, especially along the of adult education. The past two years have proved to me that our field lies in this ion program, giving the people something the county school cannot these rural schools for years to ,come. What we are doing for bet-homes, better farms, better health and broader lives fully justifies expenditures and our being here. OFFICE With the opening of the school year LaDelle came to take over h of the bookkeeping connected with the School and to help with a. office work. Everything was new to her and to me and at first ras impossible to know what, when or how. Six weeks or more t by before the books could be opened. There were, however, plenty hings to keep all hands busy. On September the Shop closed and all that business, as well as I orders, visitors, people to buy from and everything were dumped the office we had moved into. We had thought we would have ty of room by taking what had been the down stairs office for La e's and my office but it soon was filled with weaving and many r things. A new typewriter, adding machine and some other smaller office Anent were purchased. LaDelle Allen has done well with the work and in. spite of the unt of time we had to put into the industrial business during the she has kept up the book work very well. With the increased amount of business done in the industrial dement I am sure we never could have handled it all had not much he business been handled entirely from here. Much correspondenc e REPORTS 01 01TICERS 95 has been saved and time in attending to the accounts. While there are quite a good many accounts not yet closed collections have been made fairly easily. In checking up the reports it becomes clear why the monthly bank allowance does not cover expenses. The months we do the heaviest buying are the months the least cash comes in. That explains why we were behind month after month and still are. If we continue to buy industrial supplies and products at this rate the fixed bank balance will have to be increased. It takes a year to try out these things and I think that probably another year we can get along pretty well but the fall was terribly trying. Practically no time has been given to letters to the clubs or chapters, to constructive planning for the School, or even to enough committee letters, yet more hours have been spent in the office than ever before. With the correspondence relative to the industrial business and the other work connected with that the office time has been entirely taken up. The Gatlinburg News .has gone to each club, officer and to the isolated Pi Phis who have sent in their contributions through Dorothy Geare. In the April News I enclosed a club letter, giving a brief summary of the year's work. These club letters should go out every month and I surely plan to see that it is done next year. Letters direct from the School do bring results. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAJRS MADE DURING 1926-27 Sugarlands Teacher's Cottage built. Plans secured for industrial building in Gatlinburg. New entrance made to the grounds and iron gate hung. Telephone installed, school furnishing 50 poles. New chicken house built. Brooder house enlarged. Small barn built on Sims place. Sims place surveyed and fenced. New typewriter, adding machine, broad shelves, etc., gotten for of-fiCe. Small changes made in Pollard Cottage to take care of the dormitory boys, girls and teachers for meals. All plumbing, heating, etc., thoroughly looked over during the vacation. Some furniture made : tables, shelves, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1927-28 New building for industrial departments. Plans for community hall. Continuation of Gift Shop through entire year, THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them. I am sure all could rather wait even longer and finally get a plan that will call for building within our means. In closing my report I want again to thank the committee for the plendid support and cooperation. Our problems are many, the School as grown beyond any early dreams and the development is the result f the splendid service given by those Pi Phis on the committee and way from the School who continue to have such a deep interest in the cork. thiVELYN BisHor REPORTS or OrF'ICERS 97 Report of Treasurer of Settlement School We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, T6nnessee, for the period 1926-1927 ending May 16, 1927.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres

COMMUNITY ach year we bring the same report: we have done what we felt uld but have fallen far short of meeting the needs of the con-y from a social standpoint. uring last summer we found it impossible to movies once ,k in the .barn because of lack of current. This spring we have d them again and hope we can continue. he Evening School Club, IneetnIg twice a month meets a social I] as educational need. he usual number of parties were held duril.g the year. Each in the winter there are basketball games in the barn loft. 'Mile we do quite a little church work I do not think it is any than anyone should do in the community in which they are liv-The people carry much of their church burden the'mselves. ewer young people come to the cottage, no doubt because of at-)ns elsewhere. Had we a community hall we could have more ainments, socials, etc. atlinburg fair was held again last fall and was very successful. .so sent exhibits to the Sevier county fair. or the development of the community social work I feel we would a community worker for Saturdays and Sundays and a corn-y hall. HOME ECONOI\.IICS his department has continued in much the same way as last The outstanding development has been in the community work. lornings are taken up with high school classes in the School. The .00ns are given to classes in different communities. New cornies have been added to the list and more classes held in the Gat-g school for the women and girls. :iss Steele's report gives in detail her work and also shows what of riding it requires. She is faithful to the last degree and no day is bad enough for her to think she should give up a trip for s. M4iss Steele has accomplished almost the impossible in inter-the women in these classes. She also has organized a club that twice a month, the nurse giving a health program one time ; she .ng a home economics one the next meeting. Usually they show (gotten from the University of Tennessee) and have! a special These clubs are well attended and the women do so well. read papers and give talks on the subjects and take a great deal nest. Several feel that we are really meeting a community need :se meetings. REPORTS Or OrricERs 87 Miss White, the State SupervisOr of Home Economics, has recommended to the state that the home economics teacher here be put on full time for community work, the state paying the entire salary. This year the state has been allowing us $1000.00 but on the other hand they asked that we raise Miss, Steele's salary in proportion. Were we to release Miss Steele from school work it would be necessary to have the school home economics taught by one of the other teachers. Last year Barbara Dewell did half-time teaching in the School during the winter months and relieved the other teachers very much but at that time we were carrying three years of high school classes. My definite recommendation regarding this cannot be made until I know surely what the state will do. AGRICULTURE Mr. Mattil's report gives such a detailed account of the activities of this department I will not attempt to list them in my report. The mornings are given to school work, as well as a lot of calls people make here, the afternoons, to community work. Three new communities havel been added to the list of those having evening school work. Much time has to be put into the planning and carrying on of fairs each fall. Before the fairs there are community meetings in a great many schools and these are not only agricultural but usually show pictures relative to better homes and better health. The real development of the work is shown in the number of calls made on Mr. Mattil to advise regarding orchards, stock, farm crops, etc. The chicken business takes much time, too. There are calls to see sick animals, to know what to spray with, what kind of chicken house to build and numberless other questions. Mr. Mattil spent six weeks in Cornell University last summer. I surely hope he will feel he can remain here another year. Boys' DORMITORY The boys' dormitory has been managed better this year than ever before and the end of the year shows the good results. Mrs. Dowell has been faithful to her task, which means a lot when you remember that no other teachers live in the cottage so there never is anyone to relieve her of her cares for even a single night. . With better supervision of the boys' work we have had little trouble. During the fall there were eight boys on the hill but the the close of school found only four there. One boy dropped out of school in the spring, another stayed with a relative, another couldn't keep the smoking regulations, another one was in seventh grade so left as soon as that closed. The only question of discipline has come in regard to smoking. THE ARROW or PI BETA PHI Sirs. Dowell supervised the noon lunch for the children in Dorothy ner's and Emily Burton's rooms, lunch was served in the kindrten room. GIRLS' .DoRmITORY The year has passed unusually well here. There have been from to seven girls in the dormitory and there has been no trouble Lever. Mrs. McCarter and Aunt Lizzie have done the cooking for the .e family, boys, girls and teachers. The plan has worked out very and has proved to be the best way to manage. The changes in fall required comparatively little financial outlay and no changes ny amount in the cottages. The meals have been well balanced and appetizing and I feel we better cared for than those in the average boarding school. While the girls have not had much chance to help with the cooking have done other house work that has kept them busy. The boys stayed week-ends more than the girls have as Saturday farm ^ was always pressing. In both girls' and boys' dormitories there should be a way for those L arge to be relieved as every day and every night makes a pretty [ strain. It was my idea this year to relieve ourselves as much as possible try to have the Burg help bear the burden of the boarding pupils at the end of the year I feel I have made a mistake. Some of our t promising pupils are in homes in the Burg. With the little super-)n the average family gives, the results are not what they should The work for students has been better planned this year and posy we can improve still more another year and have more under our FARM The farm work has been looked after and partially done by Otha gala, under the planning and supervision of Mr. Mattil. Otha has red to be quite a good hand to look after the boys and their work the result has been that the farm is in better condition and the k and chickens have done better this year than ever before. Stu-help is hard to handle, hours are more uncertain, work has to be fully checked up and lots of patience and encouragement used. The reports of the farm, as submitted by Mr. Mattil, show that '0 has been a good amount of production toward the living. We have been able to sell quite a little. The chicken business has e to be quite a thing. During the spring a great many baby chicks e sold and settings given out around the district. These are paid by people returning pullets in the fall. More hay was raised this REPORTS OF' OrrIaRS 89 past year but we are not able to raise all we need yet. Last year we hoped to but failed. Each year, however, shows an improvement in the farm products. STUDENT LABOR Both boys and girls put in most of the out of school hours in work on the place. During the year the boys have their baseball and basketbal to take some outside time but the boys look after the horses, chick-ens, cows, pigs, carrying in the wood, cleaning the schoolhouse, and a great many odd jobs. The girls wait on table, set table, help with the dishes, keep the cottages clean, etc. It is a . big expense to keep the dormitories open but the school shows that those boys and girls living on the place hold out best in their school work. This past year we have felt that the grade of work done by the students was better than ever before and the work better organized. HEALTH The report from this department shows that there have been several changes during the year. Phyllis Higinbotham left in the early spring of 1926. Mabel Sthuckman' came at once and remained four months. She was a fine nurse and hard worker and had she been con-tent in the country might have remained. She did not, however, care to stay so Ruby Ryman took her place in the fall of 1926. She came just in time to assist with the largest tonsil and, adenoid clinic we have ever had and to be with Miss Schuckman long enough to get a good idea of the work and to become somewhat acquainted. Miss Ryman has carried out an extensive health program in the schools. The toxin, antitoxin, and typhoid clinics were very large. During much of the winter time both Sevierville and Pittman Center were without nurses so many long trips were made by our nurse, giving inoculations to school children in 'Green Briar, Emerts Cove, Smoky Mountain and Wears Valley. It was possible to make longer trips this year as roads were bet-ter, where they had been improved, and a car could be used quite a good deal. On the other hand, the roads that were bad were awful as we had a rainy winter. The transportation problem was acute during the time' Mr. Matti, Jean Steele and Ruby Ryman all needed horses the same afternoons, but they all lived through, even the horses and cars, and now the family is on very good terms again. With better roads it is much easier for the doctors to keep their afternoons at the office. The dentist comes twice a month now and always has full work. There have been several very successful clinics. There has been quite a change in the nature of work done at the center and through the community. This change has been coming for 90 THE ARROW OF' PI BETA PHI several years. While we would not want too much of the home and bedside work to stop we are glad to see the work on a health educatinal basis. Night calls for the nurse are few now and calls that should be for a doctor instead of a nurse are fewer. Having telephone connections with Sevierville and Knoxville has helped tremendously. Miss Hyman likes and understands the mountain people and if she is satisfied to continue I feel she can do well. She will have to be in college six weeks this summer taking a public health course and I am not sure she will return after that. We must continue trying to locate a Pi Phi nurse, one who will come with the idea of staying more than a few months. Frequent changes in any department handicap the work very much. During all these changes we have been very fortunate in having Lillie Reagan, a local girl, in the office. Lillie has been familiar with the work, the people and their needs , has taken care of all correspondence; ordering of supplies ; all care of the Center , and what is more, Dr. Ogle made the statement the other day that he had never known anyone with a finer sense of when to be present and when to be absent. We have tried to have a school girl help a little with the cleaning, to relieve Lillie some, as she finds more work than she is able to do. I feel strongly that we have been unfair this year. We have paid $50.00, home and travel for this work, the girls having shorter hours and really less responsibility. Now we are paying $30.00 and Lillie boarding at home. It seems to me we have taken advantage of a willing spirit. My recommendation for this department is that we pay Lillie Reagan $40.00 per month with a reimbursement of $50.00 as the salary should have been raised the first of the year. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Due to changes in county health physicians and nurses the year has been a hard one for the unit. We have had three different nurses within the year, Pittman had a change and was for several weeks 'with-out a nurse, Sevierville was several weeks without a nurse. The present doctor has been in very poor health ever since he came. While I do not doubt the wisdom of continuing with the Unit I do feel this year the work has been going on under difficulties. Whenever there is any help available we are sure of getting our share and I feel we should continue with the Unit. It is rather of a surprise each year that the county court votes the necessary appropriation as always there are those who are opposed but it passes with a good majority. If we gained nothing more than the free serums and the help from the county unit in holding large school clinics I would say it was worth while. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 9 WEAVING Much of the report of this department is covered in the report o] industrial work. Miss Redding has had one high school class in weaving. This claa meets each day one double period. Little is done by these girls fa market but practically all the time is used for definite instruction b weaving, patterns, colors, etc. A great deal of time is given to the women who weave in their homes or on school looms. This year more women came to the housl to see Miss Redding, calls here taking the place of long trips by Mis Redding to their homes. Weaving was done in not less than thirt homes. In spite of the large amount of weaving we had on hand last sum mer and early fall we found it almost impossible to keep up with the Christmas orders. School did not open until September and that lef little time to prepare for the unusually large amount of business. Afte Christmas there was time to work' out some new things and this sum mer we have some really lovely weaving in the Shop. During the year we sent several exhibits away and found tha the work from our school compared well with that from other wel known places. The Mountain Conference in Knoxville made much o the mountain industries. While there may not be much financial profi in sending these there is a certain amount of advertising done and 'w, also are showing our interest in the mountain work. The financial system of this year has helped to carry this tremend ous increase of business, yet it has not been perfect by any means any I am sure that the detailed report of Miss Redding explains every thing. Also it was impossible to do all we would have liked to for tin, was not to be had. Before Christmas all who could devoted prat tically all their time to this work and even then found it impossible t keep up with the orders or with the products. With one definitel: in charge next fall and with the financial system so we can start ou out in a businesslike way at once I feel sure we will carry the depart went much better. The business can be carried much better when we have more root for shipping, for finished products and for materials. INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT The growth of this department has been so rapid that in spite a the plans we make each year to handle the business we and ourselve simply swamped, all who possibly can neglect their duties giving fu] time to filling orders, doing up bundles and taking care of endless coi respondence. On May 1, 1926, Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor opened the Gil Shop in the Stuart Cottage. Each girl had a third interest, the Scho( keeping one third stock, too. The Shop not only took care of the man 92 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI tourists who came but also took over all correspondence and shipping. It not only was a wonderful relief to us who had been doing it all but the financial results were beyond expectations. With the first of September, the Shop closed and baskets, weaving, chairs and stools were again deposited in the attic, the basement, the offices, the upstairs hall and the girls' trunks in the Teacher's Cottage. Visitors and customers continued to visit us and always when we were the deepest in daily work. From September 1 to January 1 we shipped from here nearly $10,000 worth of products. It took the combined efforts of Miss Red-ding, Miss Allen and myself, to say nothing of those who packed baskets. Had there been room in the house for another person we surely would have had one to help but we were too crowded to put another person in the office. Lois Rogers returned the middle of April and we surely were de-lighted to see her. We closed the kindergarten work two weeks early in order to be able to open a Gift Shop, called the Arrowcraft Shop. That was the only place available and really our ex-dining room, kindergarten room, made a very attractive shop. Eugenia Dilworth, of Austin, comes the first of June to help Lois, and at that time the girls will move the shop back in the Stuart Cottage. It would be better to have it on the road but we cannot plan on using the agriculture building until we know more definitely whether it will have to be used the same in the fall. We are sure, however, that there must be a person here all the time to manage the industrial work. During the summer months the Arrowcraft girls purchased $3,131.-43 and sold $3,990.76. From September to May the School bought $9,274.59 and shipped $13,804.16. Of course a good deal was returned p.t the end of the club yeaii but this gives some idea of the amount of business done. While the new business system was not entirely satisfactory any of the time it was such an improvement over the old way that I feel we never could have carried on under old conditions and I feel sure, too, that another year we will be able to have things go satisfactorily. SUG.A.RLANDS Sugarlands, like Gatlinburg has to be considered on the twelve months basis, rather than on the eight months school term. During the summer of 1926 Miss Chew had adult classes and as early as July 1, she and Cora McCarter commenced school, teaching a half day session until the county 'school opened the middle of July. From the middle of July to September the girls carried on a full school program, night school classes and all the house work. This. made entirely too heavy a schedule. In September, Martha Flowers came. she was to look after the house in the morning, prepare the noon meal ind then 'Van two hours in the afternoon Miss Chew did corn R] PORTS or OrricERs 93 munity work and held some adult classes. This was carried out after a fashion through the year but was not entirely satisfactory. It was upsetting to the teachers and fully as much so to the pupils to have their day divided up in that manner. The night classes were well attended, they require much preparation as it is impossible to secure satisfactory text books for that kind of teaching. After each evening class there was a period of recreation, all three teachers helping with that. Having school from eight in the morning until nine-thirty at night may not sound like so much but on the weeks that Miss Chew had to be up at five o'clock to prepare breakfast it proved to be a whole lot. The community work and adult teaching could easily take all the time of one person. But this was only a part of the worry, the new schoolhouse was not completed until after Christmas. The county did not want to put repairs into the old building so bitter winter weather found the girls teaching in a room with practically no window panes, a house so frail that on very windy days school had to be dismissed in safety to the children. Finally window panes were put in but it was a joy when school finally was moved into the new building. In addition to this was the anxiety regarding the Teacher's Cottage. But for the promise made to the people I doubt if we would have tried to build before spring. The roads were terrible, no one wanted to take the job, the local men wanted work by the day but none of them could supervise or read the plans. Finally two men from Gatlinburg said they would take the job, using some Sugarlands men, if Mr. Mattil would help them. In this way the -cottage was finally completed. The house is very attractive and convenient and while it has cost more than planned it has cost less than any contract price submitted. The building has made a hole in our finances but I think it probably is better to have built well in the beginning. During this summer Helen Chew. is continuing night classes and the people have a community gathering each Saturday night. . Miss Steele continues her Home Economics class with the women and Mr. Mattil makes frequent visits in the community. The county bears the expense of two teachers and the state has allowed quite a liberal amount toward the adult work so the running expenses of the Sugarlands Extension are not so heavy. Miss Chew is not sure she can return another year but if she is able to, I feel she should have full time for adult and community work. Two teachers can take care of the school work. It is necessary to have an experienced teacher and a Pi Phi in the school. We have no one on the Gatlinburg staff who could be transferred to this place and put in charge of the Extension. Not only from my observations here but in what I have gathered from attending conferences have I been convinced that Helen Chew is carrying on one of the best pieces of adult education and community THE ARROW' Or PI BETA PHI Not a great deal is said about it but it is accomplishing some-g. Anyone who is familiar with teaching knows how hard it is to est those above the school age. I' surely feel we should continue part of the Sugarlands program if possible but if Miss Chew does ? to leave it will be hard to fill her place. GENERAL EXTENSION WORK During the past year Miss Steele has had classes in Laurel Lick, arlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River and Gatlinburg. Mr. Mattil has had classes in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Wears Val-Middle Creek, New Era and Gatlinburg. The nurse has had clinics in all schools in the district and has also to Wears Valley, Green Briar, Emerts Cove and Smoky Mountain school clinics. Mr. M[attil had many meetings during the fall, preparatory to the in different school districts. The work in the Sugarlands is outstanding, especially along the of adult education. The past two years have proved to me that our field lies in this ion program, giving the people something the county school cannot these rural schools for years to ,come. What we are doing for bet-homes, better farms, better health and broader lives fully justifies expenditures and our being here. OFFICE With the opening of the school year LaDelle came to take over h of the bookkeeping connected with the School and to help with a. office work. Everything was new to her and to me and at first ras impossible to know what, when or how. Six weeks or more t by before the books could be opened. There were, however, plenty hings to keep all hands busy. On September the Shop closed and all that business, as well as I orders, visitors, people to buy from and everything were dumped the office we had moved into. We had thought we would have ty of room by taking what had been the down stairs office for La e's and my office but it soon was filled with weaving and many r things. A new typewriter, adding machine and some other smaller office Anent were purchased. LaDelle Allen has done well with the work and in. spite of the unt of time we had to put into the industrial business during the she has kept up the book work very well. With the increased amount of business done in the industrial dement I am sure we never could have handled it all had not much he business been handled entirely from here. Much correspondenc e REPORTS 01 01TICERS 95 has been saved and time in attending to the accounts. While there are quite a good many accounts not yet closed collections have been made fairly easily. In checking up the reports it becomes clear why the monthly bank allowance does not cover expenses. The months we do the heaviest buying are the months the least cash comes in. That explains why we were behind month after month and still are. If we continue to buy industrial supplies and products at this rate the fixed bank balance will have to be increased. It takes a year to try out these things and I think that probably another year we can get along pretty well but the fall was terribly trying. Practically no time has been given to letters to the clubs or chapters, to constructive planning for the School, or even to enough committee letters, yet more hours have been spent in the office than ever before. With the correspondence relative to the industrial business and the other work connected with that the office time has been entirely taken up. The Gatlinburg News .has gone to each club, officer and to the isolated Pi Phis who have sent in their contributions through Dorothy Geare. In the April News I enclosed a club letter, giving a brief summary of the year's work. These club letters should go out every month and I surely plan to see that it is done next year. Letters direct from the School do bring results. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAJRS MADE DURING 1926-27 Sugarlands Teacher's Cottage built. Plans secured for industrial building in Gatlinburg. New entrance made to the grounds and iron gate hung. Telephone installed, school furnishing 50 poles. New chicken house built. Brooder house enlarged. Small barn built on Sims place. Sims place surveyed and fenced. New typewriter, adding machine, broad shelves, etc., gotten for of-fiCe. Small changes made in Pollard Cottage to take care of the dormitory boys, girls and teachers for meals. All plumbing, heating, etc., thoroughly looked over during the vacation. Some furniture made : tables, shelves, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1927-28 New building for industrial departments. Plans for community hall. Continuation of Gift Shop through entire year, THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them. I am sure all could rather wait even longer and finally get a plan that will call for building within our means. In closing my report I want again to thank the committee for the plendid support and cooperation. Our problems are many, the School as grown beyond any early dreams and the development is the result f the splendid service given by those Pi Phis on the committee and way from the School who continue to have such a deep interest in the cork. thiVELYN BisHor REPORTS or OrF'ICERS 97 Report of Treasurer of Settlement School We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, T6nnessee, for the period 1926-1927 ending May 16, 1927.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres

        THE ARROW or PI BETA PHI Sirs. Dowell supervised the noon lunch for the children in Dorothy ner's and Emily Burton's rooms, lunch was served in the kindrten room. GIRLS' .DoRmITORY The year has passed unusually well here. There have been from to seven girls in the dormitory and there has been no trouble Lever. Mrs. McCarter and Aunt Lizzie have done the cooking for the .e family, boys, girls and teachers. The plan has worked out very and has proved to be the best way to manage. The changes in fall required comparatively little financial outlay and no changes ny amount in the cottages. The meals have been well balanced and appetizing and I feel we better cared for than those in the average boarding school. While the girls have not had much chance to help with the cooking have done other house work that has kept them busy. The boys stayed week-ends more than the girls have as Saturday farm ^ was always pressing. In both girls' and boys' dormitories there should be a way for those L arge to be relieved as every day and every night makes a pretty [ strain. It was my idea this year to relieve ourselves as much as possible try to have the Burg help bear the burden of the boarding pupils at the end of the year I feel I have made a mistake. Some of our t promising pupils are in homes in the Burg. With the little super-)n the average family gives, the results are not what they should The work for students has been better planned this year and posy we can improve still more another year and have more under our FARM The farm work has been looked after and partially done by Otha gala, under the planning and supervision of Mr. Mattil. Otha has red to be quite a good hand to look after the boys and their work the result has been that the farm is in better condition and the k and chickens have done better this year than ever before. Stu-help is hard to handle, hours are more uncertain, work has to be fully checked up and lots of patience and encouragement used. The reports of the farm, as submitted by Mr. Mattil, show that '0 has been a good amount of production toward the living. We have been able to sell quite a little. The chicken business has e to be quite a thing. During the spring a great many baby chicks e sold and settings given out around the district. These are paid by people returning pullets in the fall. More hay was raised this REPORTS OF' OrrIaRS 89 past year but we are not able to raise all we need yet. Last year we hoped to but failed. Each year, however, shows an improvement in the farm products. STUDENT LABOR Both boys and girls put in most of the out of school hours in work on the place. During the year the boys have their baseball and basketbal to take some outside time but the boys look after the horses, chick-ens, cows, pigs, carrying in the wood, cleaning the schoolhouse, and a great many odd jobs. The girls wait on table, set table, help with the dishes, keep the cottages clean, etc. It is a . big expense to keep the dormitories open but the school shows that those boys and girls living on the place hold out best in their school work. This past year we have felt that the grade of work done by the students was better than ever before and the work better organized. HEALTH The report from this department shows that there have been several changes during the year. Phyllis Higinbotham left in the early spring of 1926. Mabel Sthuckman' came at once and remained four months. She was a fine nurse and hard worker and had she been con-tent in the country might have remained. She did not, however, care to stay so Ruby Ryman took her place in the fall of 1926. She came just in time to assist with the largest tonsil and, adenoid clinic we have ever had and to be with Miss Schuckman long enough to get a good idea of the work and to become somewhat acquainted. Miss Ryman has carried out an extensive health program in the schools. The toxin, antitoxin, and typhoid clinics were very large. During much of the winter time both Sevierville and Pittman Center were without nurses so many long trips were made by our nurse, giving inoculations to school children in 'Green Briar, Emerts Cove, Smoky Mountain and Wears Valley. It was possible to make longer trips this year as roads were bet-ter, where they had been improved, and a car could be used quite a good deal. On the other hand, the roads that were bad were awful as we had a rainy winter. The transportation problem was acute during the time' Mr. Matti, Jean Steele and Ruby Ryman all needed horses the same afternoons, but they all lived through, even the horses and cars, and now the family is on very good terms again. With better roads it is much easier for the doctors to keep their afternoons at the office. The dentist comes twice a month now and always has full work. There have been several very successful clinics. There has been quite a change in the nature of work done at the center and through the community. This change has been coming for 90 THE ARROW OF' PI BETA PHI several years. While we would not want too much of the home and bedside work to stop we are glad to see the work on a health educatinal basis. Night calls for the nurse are few now and calls that should be for a doctor instead of a nurse are fewer. Having telephone connections with Sevierville and Knoxville has helped tremendously. Miss Hyman likes and understands the mountain people and if she is satisfied to continue I feel she can do well. She will have to be in college six weeks this summer taking a public health course and I am not sure she will return after that. We must continue trying to locate a Pi Phi nurse, one who will come with the idea of staying more than a few months. Frequent changes in any department handicap the work very much. During all these changes we have been very fortunate in having Lillie Reagan, a local girl, in the office. Lillie has been familiar with the work, the people and their needs , has taken care of all correspondence; ordering of supplies ; all care of the Center , and what is more, Dr. Ogle made the statement the other day that he had never known anyone with a finer sense of when to be present and when to be absent. We have tried to have a school girl help a little with the cleaning, to relieve Lillie some, as she finds more work than she is able to do. I feel strongly that we have been unfair this year. We have paid $50.00, home and travel for this work, the girls having shorter hours and really less responsibility. Now we are paying $30.00 and Lillie boarding at home. It seems to me we have taken advantage of a willing spirit. My recommendation for this department is that we pay Lillie Reagan $40.00 per month with a reimbursement of $50.00 as the salary should have been raised the first of the year. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Due to changes in county health physicians and nurses the year has been a hard one for the unit. We have had three different nurses within the year, Pittman had a change and was for several weeks 'with-out a nurse, Sevierville was several weeks without a nurse. The present doctor has been in very poor health ever since he came. While I do not doubt the wisdom of continuing with the Unit I do feel this year the work has been going on under difficulties. Whenever there is any help available we are sure of getting our share and I feel we should continue with the Unit. It is rather of a surprise each year that the county court votes the necessary appropriation as always there are those who are opposed but it passes with a good majority. If we gained nothing more than the free serums and the help from the county unit in holding large school clinics I would say it was worth while. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 9 WEAVING Much of the report of this department is covered in the report o] industrial work. Miss Redding has had one high school class in weaving. This claa meets each day one double period. Little is done by these girls fa market but practically all the time is used for definite instruction b weaving, patterns, colors, etc. A great deal of time is given to the women who weave in their homes or on school looms. This year more women came to the housl to see Miss Redding, calls here taking the place of long trips by Mis Redding to their homes. Weaving was done in not less than thirt homes. In spite of the large amount of weaving we had on hand last sum mer and early fall we found it almost impossible to keep up with the Christmas orders. School did not open until September and that lef little time to prepare for the unusually large amount of business. Afte Christmas there was time to work' out some new things and this sum mer we have some really lovely weaving in the Shop. During the year we sent several exhibits away and found tha the work from our school compared well with that from other wel known places. The Mountain Conference in Knoxville made much o the mountain industries. While there may not be much financial profi in sending these there is a certain amount of advertising done and 'w, also are showing our interest in the mountain work. The financial system of this year has helped to carry this tremend ous increase of business, yet it has not been perfect by any means any I am sure that the detailed report of Miss Redding explains every thing. Also it was impossible to do all we would have liked to for tin, was not to be had. Before Christmas all who could devoted prat tically all their time to this work and even then found it impossible t keep up with the orders or with the products. With one definitel: in charge next fall and with the financial system so we can start ou out in a businesslike way at once I feel sure we will carry the depart went much better. The business can be carried much better when we have more root for shipping, for finished products and for materials. INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT The growth of this department has been so rapid that in spite a the plans we make each year to handle the business we and ourselve simply swamped, all who possibly can neglect their duties giving fu] time to filling orders, doing up bundles and taking care of endless coi respondence. On May 1, 1926, Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor opened the Gil Shop in the Stuart Cottage. Each girl had a third interest, the Scho( keeping one third stock, too. The Shop not only took care of the man 92 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI tourists who came but also took over all correspondence and shipping. It not only was a wonderful relief to us who had been doing it all but the financial results were beyond expectations. With the first of September, the Shop closed and baskets, weaving, chairs and stools were again deposited in the attic, the basement, the offices, the upstairs hall and the girls' trunks in the Teacher's Cottage. Visitors and customers continued to visit us and always when we were the deepest in daily work. From September 1 to January 1 we shipped from here nearly $10,000 worth of products. It took the combined efforts of Miss Red-ding, Miss Allen and myself, to say nothing of those who packed baskets. Had there been room in the house for another person we surely would have had one to help but we were too crowded to put another person in the office. Lois Rogers returned the middle of April and we surely were de-lighted to see her. We closed the kindergarten work two weeks early in order to be able to open a Gift Shop, called the Arrowcraft Shop. That was the only place available and really our ex-dining room, kindergarten room, made a very attractive shop. Eugenia Dilworth, of Austin, comes the first of June to help Lois, and at that time the girls will move the shop back in the Stuart Cottage. It would be better to have it on the road but we cannot plan on using the agriculture building until we know more definitely whether it will have to be used the same in the fall. We are sure, however, that there must be a person here all the time to manage the industrial work. During the summer months the Arrowcraft girls purchased $3,131.-43 and sold $3,990.76. From September to May the School bought $9,274.59 and shipped $13,804.16. Of course a good deal was returned p.t the end of the club yeaii but this gives some idea of the amount of business done. While the new business system was not entirely satisfactory any of the time it was such an improvement over the old way that I feel we never could have carried on under old conditions and I feel sure, too, that another year we will be able to have things go satisfactorily. SUG.A.RLANDS Sugarlands, like Gatlinburg has to be considered on the twelve months basis, rather than on the eight months school term. During the summer of 1926 Miss Chew had adult classes and as early as July 1, she and Cora McCarter commenced school, teaching a half day session until the county 'school opened the middle of July. From the middle of July to September the girls carried on a full school program, night school classes and all the house work. This. made entirely too heavy a schedule. In September, Martha Flowers came. she was to look after the house in the morning, prepare the noon meal ind then 'Van two hours in the afternoon Miss Chew did corn R] PORTS or OrricERs 93 munity work and held some adult classes. This was carried out after a fashion through the year but was not entirely satisfactory. It was upsetting to the teachers and fully as much so to the pupils to have their day divided up in that manner. The night classes were well attended, they require much preparation as it is impossible to secure satisfactory text books for that kind of teaching. After each evening class there was a period of recreation, all three teachers helping with that. Having school from eight in the morning until nine-thirty at night may not sound like so much but on the weeks that Miss Chew had to be up at five o'clock to prepare breakfast it proved to be a whole lot. The community work and adult teaching could easily take all the time of one person. But this was only a part of the worry, the new schoolhouse was not completed until after Christmas. The county did not want to put repairs into the old building so bitter winter weather found the girls teaching in a room with practically no window panes, a house so frail that on very windy days school had to be dismissed in safety to the children. Finally window panes were put in but it was a joy when school finally was moved into the new building. In addition to this was the anxiety regarding the Teacher's Cottage. But for the promise made to the people I doubt if we would have tried to build before spring. The roads were terrible, no one wanted to take the job, the local men wanted work by the day but none of them could supervise or read the plans. Finally two men from Gatlinburg said they would take the job, using some Sugarlands men, if Mr. Mattil would help them. In this way the -cottage was finally completed. The house is very attractive and convenient and while it has cost more than planned it has cost less than any contract price submitted. The building has made a hole in our finances but I think it probably is better to have built well in the beginning. During this summer Helen Chew. is continuing night classes and the people have a community gathering each Saturday night. . Miss Steele continues her Home Economics class with the women and Mr. Mattil makes frequent visits in the community. The county bears the expense of two teachers and the state has allowed quite a liberal amount toward the adult work so the running expenses of the Sugarlands Extension are not so heavy. Miss Chew is not sure she can return another year but if she is able to, I feel she should have full time for adult and community work. Two teachers can take care of the school work. It is necessary to have an experienced teacher and a Pi Phi in the school. We have no one on the Gatlinburg staff who could be transferred to this place and put in charge of the Extension. Not only from my observations here but in what I have gathered from attending conferences have I been convinced that Helen Chew is carrying on one of the best pieces of adult education and community THE ARROW' Or PI BETA PHI Not a great deal is said about it but it is accomplishing some-g. Anyone who is familiar with teaching knows how hard it is to est those above the school age. I' surely feel we should continue part of the Sugarlands program if possible but if Miss Chew does ? to leave it will be hard to fill her place. GENERAL EXTENSION WORK During the past year Miss Steele has had classes in Laurel Lick, arlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River and Gatlinburg. Mr. Mattil has had classes in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Wears Val-Middle Creek, New Era and Gatlinburg. The nurse has had clinics in all schools in the district and has also to Wears Valley, Green Briar, Emerts Cove and Smoky Mountain school clinics. Mr. M[attil had many meetings during the fall, preparatory to the in different school districts. The work in the Sugarlands is outstanding, especially along the of adult education. The past two years have proved to me that our field lies in this ion program, giving the people something the county school cannot these rural schools for years to ,come. What we are doing for bet-homes, better farms, better health and broader lives fully justifies expenditures and our being here. OFFICE With the opening of the school year LaDelle came to take over h of the bookkeeping connected with the School and to help with a. office work. Everything was new to her and to me and at first ras impossible to know what, when or how. Six weeks or more t by before the books could be opened. There were, however, plenty hings to keep all hands busy. On September the Shop closed and all that business, as well as I orders, visitors, people to buy from and everything were dumped the office we had moved into. We had thought we would have ty of room by taking what had been the down stairs office for La e's and my office but it soon was filled with weaving and many r things. A new typewriter, adding machine and some other smaller office Anent were purchased. LaDelle Allen has done well with the work and in. spite of the unt of time we had to put into the industrial business during the she has kept up the book work very well. With the increased amount of business done in the industrial dement I am sure we never could have handled it all had not much he business been handled entirely from here. Much correspondenc e REPORTS 01 01TICERS 95 has been saved and time in attending to the accounts. While there are quite a good many accounts not yet closed collections have been made fairly easily. In checking up the reports it becomes clear why the monthly bank allowance does not cover expenses. The months we do the heaviest buying are the months the least cash comes in. That explains why we were behind month after month and still are. If we continue to buy industrial supplies and products at this rate the fixed bank balance will have to be increased. It takes a year to try out these things and I think that probably another year we can get along pretty well but the fall was terribly trying. Practically no time has been given to letters to the clubs or chapters, to constructive planning for the School, or even to enough committee letters, yet more hours have been spent in the office than ever before. With the correspondence relative to the industrial business and the other work connected with that the office time has been entirely taken up. The Gatlinburg News .has gone to each club, officer and to the isolated Pi Phis who have sent in their contributions through Dorothy Geare. In the April News I enclosed a club letter, giving a brief summary of the year's work. These club letters should go out every month and I surely plan to see that it is done next year. Letters direct from the School do bring results. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAJRS MADE DURING 1926-27 Sugarlands Teacher's Cottage built. Plans secured for industrial building in Gatlinburg. New entrance made to the grounds and iron gate hung. Telephone installed, school furnishing 50 poles. New chicken house built. Brooder house enlarged. Small barn built on Sims place. Sims place surveyed and fenced. New typewriter, adding machine, broad shelves, etc., gotten for of-fiCe. Small changes made in Pollard Cottage to take care of the dormitory boys, girls and teachers for meals. All plumbing, heating, etc., thoroughly looked over during the vacation. Some furniture made : tables, shelves, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1927-28 New building for industrial departments. Plans for community hall. Continuation of Gift Shop through entire year, THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them. I am sure all could rather wait even longer and finally get a plan that will call for building within our means. In closing my report I want again to thank the committee for the plendid support and cooperation. Our problems are many, the School as grown beyond any early dreams and the development is the result f the splendid service given by those Pi Phis on the committee and way from the School who continue to have such a deep interest in the cork. thiVELYN BisHor REPORTS or OrF'ICERS 97 Report of Treasurer of Settlement School We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, T6nnessee, for the period 1926-1927 ending May 16, 1927.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres

        90 THE ARROW OF' PI BETA PHI several years. While we would not want too much of the home and bedside work to stop we are glad to see the work on a health educatinal basis. Night calls for the nurse are few now and calls that should be for a doctor instead of a nurse are fewer. Having telephone connections with Sevierville and Knoxville has helped tremendously. Miss Hyman likes and understands the mountain people and if she is satisfied to continue I feel she can do well. She will have to be in college six weeks this summer taking a public health course and I am not sure she will return after that. We must continue trying to locate a Pi Phi nurse, one who will come with the idea of staying more than a few months. Frequent changes in any department handicap the work very much. During all these changes we have been very fortunate in having Lillie Reagan, a local girl, in the office. Lillie has been familiar with the work, the people and their needs , has taken care of all correspondence; ordering of supplies ; all care of the Center , and what is more, Dr. Ogle made the statement the other day that he had never known anyone with a finer sense of when to be present and when to be absent. We have tried to have a school girl help a little with the cleaning, to relieve Lillie some, as she finds more work than she is able to do. I feel strongly that we have been unfair this year. We have paid $50.00, home and travel for this work, the girls having shorter hours and really less responsibility. Now we are paying $30.00 and Lillie boarding at home. It seems to me we have taken advantage of a willing spirit. My recommendation for this department is that we pay Lillie Reagan $40.00 per month with a reimbursement of $50.00 as the salary should have been raised the first of the year. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Due to changes in county health physicians and nurses the year has been a hard one for the unit. We have had three different nurses within the year, Pittman had a change and was for several weeks 'with-out a nurse, Sevierville was several weeks without a nurse. The present doctor has been in very poor health ever since he came. While I do not doubt the wisdom of continuing with the Unit I do feel this year the work has been going on under difficulties. Whenever there is any help available we are sure of getting our share and I feel we should continue with the Unit. It is rather of a surprise each year that the county court votes the necessary appropriation as always there are those who are opposed but it passes with a good majority. If we gained nothing more than the free serums and the help from the county unit in holding large school clinics I would say it was worth while. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 9 WEAVING Much of the report of this department is covered in the report o] industrial work. Miss Redding has had one high school class in weaving. This claa meets each day one double period. Little is done by these girls fa market but practically all the time is used for definite instruction b weaving, patterns, colors, etc. A great deal of time is given to the women who weave in their homes or on school looms. This year more women came to the housl to see Miss Redding, calls here taking the place of long trips by Mis Redding to their homes. Weaving was done in not less than thirt homes. In spite of the large amount of weaving we had on hand last sum mer and early fall we found it almost impossible to keep up with the Christmas orders. School did not open until September and that lef little time to prepare for the unusually large amount of business. Afte Christmas there was time to work' out some new things and this sum mer we have some really lovely weaving in the Shop. During the year we sent several exhibits away and found tha the work from our school compared well with that from other wel known places. The Mountain Conference in Knoxville made much o the mountain industries. While there may not be much financial profi in sending these there is a certain amount of advertising done and 'w, also are showing our interest in the mountain work. The financial system of this year has helped to carry this tremend ous increase of business, yet it has not been perfect by any means any I am sure that the detailed report of Miss Redding explains every thing. Also it was impossible to do all we would have liked to for tin, was not to be had. Before Christmas all who could devoted prat tically all their time to this work and even then found it impossible t keep up with the orders or with the products. With one definitel: in charge next fall and with the financial system so we can start ou out in a businesslike way at once I feel sure we will carry the depart went much better. The business can be carried much better when we have more root for shipping, for finished products and for materials. INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT The growth of this department has been so rapid that in spite a the plans we make each year to handle the business we and ourselve simply swamped, all who possibly can neglect their duties giving fu] time to filling orders, doing up bundles and taking care of endless coi respondence. On May 1, 1926, Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor opened the Gil Shop in the Stuart Cottage. Each girl had a third interest, the Scho( keeping one third stock, too. The Shop not only took care of the man 92 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI tourists who came but also took over all correspondence and shipping. It not only was a wonderful relief to us who had been doing it all but the financial results were beyond expectations. With the first of September, the Shop closed and baskets, weaving, chairs and stools were again deposited in the attic, the basement, the offices, the upstairs hall and the girls' trunks in the Teacher's Cottage. Visitors and customers continued to visit us and always when we were the deepest in daily work. From September 1 to January 1 we shipped from here nearly $10,000 worth of products. It took the combined efforts of Miss Red-ding, Miss Allen and myself, to say nothing of those who packed baskets. Had there been room in the house for another person we surely would have had one to help but we were too crowded to put another person in the office. Lois Rogers returned the middle of April and we surely were de-lighted to see her. We closed the kindergarten work two weeks early in order to be able to open a Gift Shop, called the Arrowcraft Shop. That was the only place available and really our ex-dining room, kindergarten room, made a very attractive shop. Eugenia Dilworth, of Austin, comes the first of June to help Lois, and at that time the girls will move the shop back in the Stuart Cottage. It would be better to have it on the road but we cannot plan on using the agriculture building until we know more definitely whether it will have to be used the same in the fall. We are sure, however, that there must be a person here all the time to manage the industrial work. During the summer months the Arrowcraft girls purchased $3,131.-43 and sold $3,990.76. From September to May the School bought $9,274.59 and shipped $13,804.16. Of course a good deal was returned p.t the end of the club yeaii but this gives some idea of the amount of business done. While the new business system was not entirely satisfactory any of the time it was such an improvement over the old way that I feel we never could have carried on under old conditions and I feel sure, too, that another year we will be able to have things go satisfactorily. SUG.A.RLANDS Sugarlands, like Gatlinburg has to be considered on the twelve months basis, rather than on the eight months school term. During the summer of 1926 Miss Chew had adult classes and as early as July 1, she and Cora McCarter commenced school, teaching a half day session until the county 'school opened the middle of July. From the middle of July to September the girls carried on a full school program, night school classes and all the house work. This. made entirely too heavy a schedule. In September, Martha Flowers came. she was to look after the house in the morning, prepare the noon meal ind then 'Van two hours in the afternoon Miss Chew did corn R] PORTS or OrricERs 93 munity work and held some adult classes. This was carried out after a fashion through the year but was not entirely satisfactory. It was upsetting to the teachers and fully as much so to the pupils to have their day divided up in that manner. The night classes were well attended, they require much preparation as it is impossible to secure satisfactory text books for that kind of teaching. After each evening class there was a period of recreation, all three teachers helping with that. Having school from eight in the morning until nine-thirty at night may not sound like so much but on the weeks that Miss Chew had to be up at five o'clock to prepare breakfast it proved to be a whole lot. The community work and adult teaching could easily take all the time of one person. But this was only a part of the worry, the new schoolhouse was not completed until after Christmas. The county did not want to put repairs into the old building so bitter winter weather found the girls teaching in a room with practically no window panes, a house so frail that on very windy days school had to be dismissed in safety to the children. Finally window panes were put in but it was a joy when school finally was moved into the new building. In addition to this was the anxiety regarding the Teacher's Cottage. But for the promise made to the people I doubt if we would have tried to build before spring. The roads were terrible, no one wanted to take the job, the local men wanted work by the day but none of them could supervise or read the plans. Finally two men from Gatlinburg said they would take the job, using some Sugarlands men, if Mr. Mattil would help them. In this way the -cottage was finally completed. The house is very attractive and convenient and while it has cost more than planned it has cost less than any contract price submitted. The building has made a hole in our finances but I think it probably is better to have built well in the beginning. During this summer Helen Chew. is continuing night classes and the people have a community gathering each Saturday night. . Miss Steele continues her Home Economics class with the women and Mr. Mattil makes frequent visits in the community. The county bears the expense of two teachers and the state has allowed quite a liberal amount toward the adult work so the running expenses of the Sugarlands Extension are not so heavy. Miss Chew is not sure she can return another year but if she is able to, I feel she should have full time for adult and community work. Two teachers can take care of the school work. It is necessary to have an experienced teacher and a Pi Phi in the school. We have no one on the Gatlinburg staff who could be transferred to this place and put in charge of the Extension. Not only from my observations here but in what I have gathered from attending conferences have I been convinced that Helen Chew is carrying on one of the best pieces of adult education and community THE ARROW' Or PI BETA PHI Not a great deal is said about it but it is accomplishing some-g. Anyone who is familiar with teaching knows how hard it is to est those above the school age. I' surely feel we should continue part of the Sugarlands program if possible but if Miss Chew does ? to leave it will be hard to fill her place. GENERAL EXTENSION WORK During the past year Miss Steele has had classes in Laurel Lick, arlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River and Gatlinburg. Mr. Mattil has had classes in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Wears Val-Middle Creek, New Era and Gatlinburg. The nurse has had clinics in all schools in the district and has also to Wears Valley, Green Briar, Emerts Cove and Smoky Mountain school clinics. Mr. M[attil had many meetings during the fall, preparatory to the in different school districts. The work in the Sugarlands is outstanding, especially along the of adult education. The past two years have proved to me that our field lies in this ion program, giving the people something the county school cannot these rural schools for years to ,come. What we are doing for bet-homes, better farms, better health and broader lives fully justifies expenditures and our being here. OFFICE With the opening of the school year LaDelle came to take over h of the bookkeeping connected with the School and to help with a. office work. Everything was new to her and to me and at first ras impossible to know what, when or how. Six weeks or more t by before the books could be opened. There were, however, plenty hings to keep all hands busy. On September the Shop closed and all that business, as well as I orders, visitors, people to buy from and everything were dumped the office we had moved into. We had thought we would have ty of room by taking what had been the down stairs office for La e's and my office but it soon was filled with weaving and many r things. A new typewriter, adding machine and some other smaller office Anent were purchased. LaDelle Allen has done well with the work and in. spite of the unt of time we had to put into the industrial business during the she has kept up the book work very well. With the increased amount of business done in the industrial dement I am sure we never could have handled it all had not much he business been handled entirely from here. Much correspondenc e REPORTS 01 01TICERS 95 has been saved and time in attending to the accounts. While there are quite a good many accounts not yet closed collections have been made fairly easily. In checking up the reports it becomes clear why the monthly bank allowance does not cover expenses. The months we do the heaviest buying are the months the least cash comes in. That explains why we were behind month after month and still are. If we continue to buy industrial supplies and products at this rate the fixed bank balance will have to be increased. It takes a year to try out these things and I think that probably another year we can get along pretty well but the fall was terribly trying. Practically no time has been given to letters to the clubs or chapters, to constructive planning for the School, or even to enough committee letters, yet more hours have been spent in the office than ever before. With the correspondence relative to the industrial business and the other work connected with that the office time has been entirely taken up. The Gatlinburg News .has gone to each club, officer and to the isolated Pi Phis who have sent in their contributions through Dorothy Geare. In the April News I enclosed a club letter, giving a brief summary of the year's work. These club letters should go out every month and I surely plan to see that it is done next year. Letters direct from the School do bring results. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAJRS MADE DURING 1926-27 Sugarlands Teacher's Cottage built. Plans secured for industrial building in Gatlinburg. New entrance made to the grounds and iron gate hung. Telephone installed, school furnishing 50 poles. New chicken house built. Brooder house enlarged. Small barn built on Sims place. Sims place surveyed and fenced. New typewriter, adding machine, broad shelves, etc., gotten for of-fiCe. Small changes made in Pollard Cottage to take care of the dormitory boys, girls and teachers for meals. All plumbing, heating, etc., thoroughly looked over during the vacation. Some furniture made : tables, shelves, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1927-28 New building for industrial departments. Plans for community hall. Continuation of Gift Shop through entire year, THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them. I am sure all could rather wait even longer and finally get a plan that will call for building within our means. In closing my report I want again to thank the committee for the plendid support and cooperation. Our problems are many, the School as grown beyond any early dreams and the development is the result f the splendid service given by those Pi Phis on the committee and way from the School who continue to have such a deep interest in the cork. thiVELYN BisHor REPORTS or OrF'ICERS 97 Report of Treasurer of Settlement School We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, T6nnessee, for the period 1926-1927 ending May 16, 1927.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres

        92 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI tourists who came but also took over all correspondence and shipping. It not only was a wonderful relief to us who had been doing it all but the financial results were beyond expectations. With the first of September, the Shop closed and baskets, weaving, chairs and stools were again deposited in the attic, the basement, the offices, the upstairs hall and the girls' trunks in the Teacher's Cottage. Visitors and customers continued to visit us and always when we were the deepest in daily work. From September 1 to January 1 we shipped from here nearly $10,000 worth of products. It took the combined efforts of Miss Red-ding, Miss Allen and myself, to say nothing of those who packed baskets. Had there been room in the house for another person we surely would have had one to help but we were too crowded to put another person in the office. Lois Rogers returned the middle of April and we surely were de-lighted to see her. We closed the kindergarten work two weeks early in order to be able to open a Gift Shop, called the Arrowcraft Shop. That was the only place available and really our ex-dining room, kindergarten room, made a very attractive shop. Eugenia Dilworth, of Austin, comes the first of June to help Lois, and at that time the girls will move the shop back in the Stuart Cottage. It would be better to have it on the road but we cannot plan on using the agriculture building until we know more definitely whether it will have to be used the same in the fall. We are sure, however, that there must be a person here all the time to manage the industrial work. During the summer months the Arrowcraft girls purchased $3,131.-43 and sold $3,990.76. From September to May the School bought $9,274.59 and shipped $13,804.16. Of course a good deal was returned p.t the end of the club yeaii but this gives some idea of the amount of business done. While the new business system was not entirely satisfactory any of the time it was such an improvement over the old way that I feel we never could have carried on under old conditions and I feel sure, too, that another year we will be able to have things go satisfactorily. SUG.A.RLANDS Sugarlands, like Gatlinburg has to be considered on the twelve months basis, rather than on the eight months school term. During the summer of 1926 Miss Chew had adult classes and as early as July 1, she and Cora McCarter commenced school, teaching a half day session until the county 'school opened the middle of July. From the middle of July to September the girls carried on a full school program, night school classes and all the house work. This. made entirely too heavy a schedule. In September, Martha Flowers came. she was to look after the house in the morning, prepare the noon meal ind then 'Van two hours in the afternoon Miss Chew did corn R] PORTS or OrricERs 93 munity work and held some adult classes. This was carried out after a fashion through the year but was not entirely satisfactory. It was upsetting to the teachers and fully as much so to the pupils to have their day divided up in that manner. The night classes were well attended, they require much preparation as it is impossible to secure satisfactory text books for that kind of teaching. After each evening class there was a period of recreation, all three teachers helping with that. Having school from eight in the morning until nine-thirty at night may not sound like so much but on the weeks that Miss Chew had to be up at five o'clock to prepare breakfast it proved to be a whole lot. The community work and adult teaching could easily take all the time of one person. But this was only a part of the worry, the new schoolhouse was not completed until after Christmas. The county did not want to put repairs into the old building so bitter winter weather found the girls teaching in a room with practically no window panes, a house so frail that on very windy days school had to be dismissed in safety to the children. Finally window panes were put in but it was a joy when school finally was moved into the new building. In addition to this was the anxiety regarding the Teacher's Cottage. But for the promise made to the people I doubt if we would have tried to build before spring. The roads were terrible, no one wanted to take the job, the local men wanted work by the day but none of them could supervise or read the plans. Finally two men from Gatlinburg said they would take the job, using some Sugarlands men, if Mr. Mattil would help them. In this way the -cottage was finally completed. The house is very attractive and convenient and while it has cost more than planned it has cost less than any contract price submitted. The building has made a hole in our finances but I think it probably is better to have built well in the beginning. During this summer Helen Chew. is continuing night classes and the people have a community gathering each Saturday night. . Miss Steele continues her Home Economics class with the women and Mr. Mattil makes frequent visits in the community. The county bears the expense of two teachers and the state has allowed quite a liberal amount toward the adult work so the running expenses of the Sugarlands Extension are not so heavy. Miss Chew is not sure she can return another year but if she is able to, I feel she should have full time for adult and community work. Two teachers can take care of the school work. It is necessary to have an experienced teacher and a Pi Phi in the school. We have no one on the Gatlinburg staff who could be transferred to this place and put in charge of the Extension. Not only from my observations here but in what I have gathered from attending conferences have I been convinced that Helen Chew is carrying on one of the best pieces of adult education and community THE ARROW' Or PI BETA PHI Not a great deal is said about it but it is accomplishing some-g. Anyone who is familiar with teaching knows how hard it is to est those above the school age. I' surely feel we should continue part of the Sugarlands program if possible but if Miss Chew does ? to leave it will be hard to fill her place. GENERAL EXTENSION WORK During the past year Miss Steele has had classes in Laurel Lick, arlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River and Gatlinburg. Mr. Mattil has had classes in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Wears Val-Middle Creek, New Era and Gatlinburg. The nurse has had clinics in all schools in the district and has also to Wears Valley, Green Briar, Emerts Cove and Smoky Mountain school clinics. Mr. M[attil had many meetings during the fall, preparatory to the in different school districts. The work in the Sugarlands is outstanding, especially along the of adult education. The past two years have proved to me that our field lies in this ion program, giving the people something the county school cannot these rural schools for years to ,come. What we are doing for bet-homes, better farms, better health and broader lives fully justifies expenditures and our being here. OFFICE With the opening of the school year LaDelle came to take over h of the bookkeeping connected with the School and to help with a. office work. Everything was new to her and to me and at first ras impossible to know what, when or how. Six weeks or more t by before the books could be opened. There were, however, plenty hings to keep all hands busy. On September the Shop closed and all that business, as well as I orders, visitors, people to buy from and everything were dumped the office we had moved into. We had thought we would have ty of room by taking what had been the down stairs office for La e's and my office but it soon was filled with weaving and many r things. A new typewriter, adding machine and some other smaller office Anent were purchased. LaDelle Allen has done well with the work and in. spite of the unt of time we had to put into the industrial business during the she has kept up the book work very well. With the increased amount of business done in the industrial dement I am sure we never could have handled it all had not much he business been handled entirely from here. Much correspondenc e REPORTS 01 01TICERS 95 has been saved and time in attending to the accounts. While there are quite a good many accounts not yet closed collections have been made fairly easily. In checking up the reports it becomes clear why the monthly bank allowance does not cover expenses. The months we do the heaviest buying are the months the least cash comes in. That explains why we were behind month after month and still are. If we continue to buy industrial supplies and products at this rate the fixed bank balance will have to be increased. It takes a year to try out these things and I think that probably another year we can get along pretty well but the fall was terribly trying. Practically no time has been given to letters to the clubs or chapters, to constructive planning for the School, or even to enough committee letters, yet more hours have been spent in the office than ever before. With the correspondence relative to the industrial business and the other work connected with that the office time has been entirely taken up. The Gatlinburg News .has gone to each club, officer and to the isolated Pi Phis who have sent in their contributions through Dorothy Geare. In the April News I enclosed a club letter, giving a brief summary of the year's work. These club letters should go out every month and I surely plan to see that it is done next year. Letters direct from the School do bring results. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAJRS MADE DURING 1926-27 Sugarlands Teacher's Cottage built. Plans secured for industrial building in Gatlinburg. New entrance made to the grounds and iron gate hung. Telephone installed, school furnishing 50 poles. New chicken house built. Brooder house enlarged. Small barn built on Sims place. Sims place surveyed and fenced. New typewriter, adding machine, broad shelves, etc., gotten for of-fiCe. Small changes made in Pollard Cottage to take care of the dormitory boys, girls and teachers for meals. All plumbing, heating, etc., thoroughly looked over during the vacation. Some furniture made : tables, shelves, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1927-28 New building for industrial departments. Plans for community hall. Continuation of Gift Shop through entire year, THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them. I am sure all could rather wait even longer and finally get a plan that will call for building within our means. In closing my report I want again to thank the committee for the plendid support and cooperation. Our problems are many, the School as grown beyond any early dreams and the development is the result f the splendid service given by those Pi Phis on the committee and way from the School who continue to have such a deep interest in the cork. thiVELYN BisHor REPORTS or OrF'ICERS 97 Report of Treasurer of Settlement School We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, T6nnessee, for the period 1926-1927 ending May 16, 1927.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres

        THE ARROW' Or PI BETA PHI Not a great deal is said about it but it is accomplishing some-g. Anyone who is familiar with teaching knows how hard it is to est those above the school age. I' surely feel we should continue part of the Sugarlands program if possible but if Miss Chew does ? to leave it will be hard to fill her place. GENERAL EXTENSION WORK During the past year Miss Steele has had classes in Laurel Lick, arlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River and Gatlinburg. Mr. Mattil has had classes in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Wears Val-Middle Creek, New Era and Gatlinburg. The nurse has had clinics in all schools in the district and has also to Wears Valley, Green Briar, Emerts Cove and Smoky Mountain school clinics. Mr. M[attil had many meetings during the fall, preparatory to the in different school districts. The work in the Sugarlands is outstanding, especially along the of adult education. The past two years have proved to me that our field lies in this ion program, giving the people something the county school cannot these rural schools for years to ,come. What we are doing for bet-homes, better farms, better health and broader lives fully justifies expenditures and our being here. OFFICE With the opening of the school year LaDelle came to take over h of the bookkeeping connected with the School and to help with a. office work. Everything was new to her and to me and at first ras impossible to know what, when or how. Six weeks or more t by before the books could be opened. There were, however, plenty hings to keep all hands busy. On September the Shop closed and all that business, as well as I orders, visitors, people to buy from and everything were dumped the office we had moved into. We had thought we would have ty of room by taking what had been the down stairs office for La e's and my office but it soon was filled with weaving and many r things. A new typewriter, adding machine and some other smaller office Anent were purchased. LaDelle Allen has done well with the work and in. spite of the unt of time we had to put into the industrial business during the she has kept up the book work very well. With the increased amount of business done in the industrial dement I am sure we never could have handled it all had not much he business been handled entirely from here. Much correspondenc e REPORTS 01 01TICERS 95 has been saved and time in attending to the accounts. While there are quite a good many accounts not yet closed collections have been made fairly easily. In checking up the reports it becomes clear why the monthly bank allowance does not cover expenses. The months we do the heaviest buying are the months the least cash comes in. That explains why we were behind month after month and still are. If we continue to buy industrial supplies and products at this rate the fixed bank balance will have to be increased. It takes a year to try out these things and I think that probably another year we can get along pretty well but the fall was terribly trying. Practically no time has been given to letters to the clubs or chapters, to constructive planning for the School, or even to enough committee letters, yet more hours have been spent in the office than ever before. With the correspondence relative to the industrial business and the other work connected with that the office time has been entirely taken up. The Gatlinburg News .has gone to each club, officer and to the isolated Pi Phis who have sent in their contributions through Dorothy Geare. In the April News I enclosed a club letter, giving a brief summary of the year's work. These club letters should go out every month and I surely plan to see that it is done next year. Letters direct from the School do bring results. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAJRS MADE DURING 1926-27 Sugarlands Teacher's Cottage built. Plans secured for industrial building in Gatlinburg. New entrance made to the grounds and iron gate hung. Telephone installed, school furnishing 50 poles. New chicken house built. Brooder house enlarged. Small barn built on Sims place. Sims place surveyed and fenced. New typewriter, adding machine, broad shelves, etc., gotten for of-fiCe. Small changes made in Pollard Cottage to take care of the dormitory boys, girls and teachers for meals. All plumbing, heating, etc., thoroughly looked over during the vacation. Some furniture made : tables, shelves, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1927-28 New building for industrial departments. Plans for community hall. Continuation of Gift Shop through entire year, THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres

        THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them. I am sure all could rather wait even longer and finally get a plan that will call for building within our means. In closing my report I want again to thank the committee for the plendid support and cooperation. Our problems are many, the School as grown beyond any early dreams and the development is the result f the splendid service given by those Pi Phis on the committee and way from the School who continue to have such a deep interest in the cork. thiVELYN BisHor REPORTS or OrF'ICERS 97 Report of Treasurer of Settlement School We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, T6nnessee, for the period 1926-1927 ending May 16, 1927.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres

This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club.

A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments.

Living in owned or rented houses Living in apartments NO houses or apartments 2. Collecting dues monthly Collecting dues quarterly 3. Making regular financial reports Making irregular financial reports Making no reports 4.

Total cash gain to date (over $200) Total cash gain to date (under $200) Loss to date (over $200) Loss to date (under $200) Chapters not reporting 6. 6 chapters received a grade of 100-sending in absolutely correct reports on time. 44 more chapters received a grade of 90 or better-sending in reports with minor errcrs on time. 11 more chapters received a grade of 80 or better-sending in late reports or incorrect ones. 10 more chapters received a grade under 80-principally on account of late reports. 7. Only two chapters started the year 1926-1927 with a red balance amounting tc $132.81. Six had a red balance April 1st, amounting to $2014.89. Total opening cash balances for school year ..$18,318.84 Total balances April 1, 1927 29,279.17 Gain of $10,960.33 Sixteen chapters operating houses showed a gain to April 1 of from $400 to $3000, while 3 chapters not operating houses showed a gain of from $200 to $350. The experience of this office during the past two years has shown that the majority of chapters failing to obtain a, high grade, has been due to their lack of cooperation, either by failing to send in their re ports on time, or by neglecting to put the correct information on the report. We would suggest that the president of each chapter make it her duty to see that the finance committee meets with the house treasurer and corrects each report before it is sent to this office. As a result of this conference, the finance committee can not only see that the de tails of the report are correct, but can advise the treasurer as to necessary adjustments in income and expenditures. One message we hope the delegates will take with them from their Financial Accounting Supervisor is the danger of special assessments. The majority of well organized chapters have no special assessment REPORTS Or OFTICERS 79 outside telephone tolls, all entertainments being budgeted in the chap-ter department and fully covered by the chapter income. It is advised to designate one member of the finance committee, social treasurer, and pay over to her from each chapter assessment, whether monthly or quarterly, a specified amount per girl for entertainment purposes. She can then keep her own 'bank account, and record of receipts of expenditures. This is good training for a future treasurer. In concluding I wish to thank the members of the Grand Council and all chapters for their splendid cooperation and encouragement during the past two years. MARIE FREEMAN PALMER Report of Chairman of Settlement School Committee V term, as Chairman of the Settlement School of Pi Beta Phi, is ended. My love, my interest, and my work as an individual, will continue so long as I have strength in mp body and mind to carry on. Each year I have handed in my report with happiness knowing that there were further goals to conquer, but this year it comes with regrets, not that this term has not been more successful than usual, but because I shall miss that intimate touch with those who have laboured so devotedly with me in this greatest of achievements. If I have given anything of merit, I ,am pleased. The personal contacts with everyone connected with the interests of the School have surely benefitted me. To all who have served so unselfishly, especially the Committee and the School staff, 1 can only say that in my heart is the deepest and sincerest feelings of gratitude and love. With appreciation I acknowledge the work of the Grand Officers, for without their confidence and counsel we should have been greatly handicapped. The Province Presidents and Vice Presidents, alumnte clubs and active chapters as well as individuals by their untiring efforts have enabled the committee to succeed in its plans. The School is becoming a real problem, not that it has not always been one, but more so naw, especially the Industrial Department which I shall speak of further on in my report. We commenced the school year with a change in handling of the finances by placing at Gatlinburg the bookkeeping and collecting, and leaving the control of finances and investments with the treasurer. In another year all unfortunate problems that have arisen will be successfully worked out. No radical change is ever without difficulties its first year. The treasurer has been greatly handicapped 'by certain officers failing to send in their donation until after the books have been closed. One Province Vice President sent in a donation, which had been received some months earlier, quite a time after the treasurer had closed her books. Miss Curryer, in trying to make all contented when such THE ARROW OP' PI BETA PHI ,es have arisen, has reopened her books. The committee feels as she that all late contributions from now on will have to receive recogion the following year. Miss Curryer has been painstaking, conscientious and faithful in treasury work, and her ideas have been valuable to the School. It 3 caused her no little work to reorganize completely the treasury de-!tment. Mrs. Agnes Miller Turner, secretary and publicity member for the :tlement School Committee, reports that she feels that a more conitrated effort should be made, educating actives for alunan mems. I know in Dallas, Texas there are over eighty-five alumnae, but y twenty-four take any interest in the club. If the active chapters re required to, hold two Settlement School programs annually, they uld be better acquainted with this splendid work, thereby taking ,re interest in alumnte club activities. Mrs. Turner has been an in-ration to the committee. Her ardent zeal combined with ability kes her a valuable asset to any organization. The School shall miss as she retires from the committee this year. If you have read the row articles that she has edited, you have certainly become more ightened concerning the Settlement School. Mrs. Geare has continued her work of interesting Pi Phis who ve not been connected with any alunmm club. She reports that 'ough the efforts of Miss Margaret White and herself 29 new clubs re been organized, and by this time probably a few more. This has gin. a praiseworthy achievement because all members of Pi Beta Phi mld have the chance to take part in such an undertaking. 'To Mrs. are, the School feels deeply indebted. Mrs. Freeman, the Ways and Means member of the committee has 1 charge of the slides. She strongly urges that province officers ar-Ige an itinerary of these slides for their respective clubs or chapters order to, expedite delivery and save expenses. By the time an 3wer goes to the far West clubs and back, a nearby club has the les, this entailing more correspondence. Mrs. Freeman has served acting chairman during my prolonged stay abroad, carrying on her n work on the committee, besides being president of the active xeland Club and doing my work too, cheerful, willing and efficient has been. Her services cannot be measured other than to say when has a task to do, it is done the best way. It has been the aims of the committee to foster several new ideas s year. For four years we have needed an industrial building, and ay our dreams are being realized. It is started and our hopes ex t to be ready for use in October. Had ,we .more funds, we could aplete the building so badly needed. The Hazel Todd Meaden cot-e at the Emma Harper Turner Center in the Sugarlands is now be-used, and we of the committee "modestly" assert that it is a dear. have striven to place the industrial department on paying basis, REPORTS Or OrrICERS 81 our woven goods are very nearly perfect, and by their excellence and attractiveness the sales have jumped by leaps and bounds. Four years ago we sold about $1000 worth of products ; three years ago the sales were about $4000 ; last year $7000; and this year over $14,000. I can-not quote accurately as I have not the exact figures here on the boat with me. Let me add that this does not mean profit but it could be so had we the space for more looms and storage. Miss Redding is most efficient, and has the happy faculty of getting the women to take advantage of her instructions. Their loyalty to the School is commend-able. The school work on the whole has been good, weak in spots 'tis true, due entirely to congested quarters. The time is now ripe for a high type man principal who can revise and supervise the entire curriculum. The attendance despite continuous epidemics of every known disease has been good. Congested conditions, no auditorium, primary work in the teacher's cottage, inadequate agriculture and home economics quarters have had to be overcome, but not without a great deal of distress to the teachers. To say they were handicapped does not ex-press the true situation, but to say that they were efficient, willing and wonderfully good sports might convey in a small degree the high regard the committee holds for them. Miss Bishop in her usual modest way has conducted the School through trying circumstances. Her patience and personality are attributes not often found in one person. Her leadership has certainly made the duties of the committee easier. Mr. Mattil, director of the Smith-Hughes Agriculture Department a proven friend to the School in every way, Miss Steele, domestic economy instructor, and Miss Ryman the nurse, have done much in their respective lines, and though not members of Pi Beta Phi, they have been as faithful. It was with deep regret that the committee had to accept the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higginbotham, who left us to become supervisor of nurses for the State of Tennessee. Miss Bishop's report is as usual so full of interesting details that it shall be printed in full in the Arrow. I shall not take your time here to read it, if each of you promise to read it 'when published. Whenever we think of our extensive work, we just "burst with pride." When we think of the opposition in years past, and now, those natives clamour for Pi Beta Phi to direct, we naturally feel that we have accomplished something. The Emma Harper Turner center at Sugarlands is only the beginning, some day when we shall have sufficient funds, we shall develop other fields demanding Pi Phi super-vision, as we have at Gatlinburg. Do you know that the Department of Education of Tennessee considers Miss Chew the most capable teacher of rural adult education. Five o'clock each morning she arises in order to carry out her very full program for the day. In age her 82 THE ARROW PI BETA PHI pupils range from sixteen to forty-two, they adore her and counsel with her. Her value to the community is immeasureable. During the past year she has been ably assisted by two teachers, one a Pi Phi, the other a graduate of Gatlinburg. The new school building and the cottage named in honor of Mrs. Hazel Todd Meaden, certainly afford these girls comfort, though living in so isolated a section deserves the highest commendation. This report has been more or less a general survey of all, and below, I shall enumerate concisely a few of the outstanding achievements of the past year: 1 .Constructing the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage. 2. The New Sugarlands' School building by the County, but fostered by the committee. 3. Farming on a more businesslike basis with efficient supervision and direction of school boys doing the work. 4. Community work done by all. 5. Extension work in Sugarlands and other isolated centers. G. Health Clinics, vaccinations, innoculations (even of 300 dogs for rabies), first aid and hygiene classes, dental clinics. 7. Improving the Industrial Department. a. Excellence of work. b. Establishing better business methods. 8. Encouraging the raising of pedigreed stock and poultry. 9. Beautifying around the property. 10. Publicity of the School throughout the Pi Beta Phi realm. 11. Installing bookkeeping and collecting department at Gatlinburg. 12. Opening Arrowcraft business. 13. Installing incubator and brooder houses. 14. Central Dining rooms started. Thus concisely stating these achievements we realize our efforts have not been in vain. In, closing this, my last report, after five years of intimate con-tact with the Settlement School, I would feel derelict in my duties, did I not gaze into the future and make a few suggestions as to what I hope may be accomplished. The School was organized to do Settlement work and this aim has never been lost to view. While the problems of today are not those of yesterday, the needs are just as pressing. The time has probably come to turn over to the people the lower grade work, so that they might organize a consolidated school. This does not mean a cessation of effort but a redoubled one along the line of health and industry. The people are beginning to feel the effects of business direction in basketry and weaving, and it is no far-fetched dream to see the bur-den of expense carried by these industries. The higher educational REPORTS OP OrrICERS influences are yet to be developed and probably will never be ale academic lines. Better health and better babies are things the communities seeking, and Gatlinburg, Sugarlands and other places within our fluenee are not behind the rest of the world in wanting them. Ext^ sion is still calling and while the frontiers will never be as primit as was Gatlinburg, yet conditions are still indescribably bad. I do not see the time when Pi Beta Phi will leave Tenness but I do see the time when our great work will be known, valued a praised throughout the country. Things will never go smoothly for us and I hasten to say that hope they never will, because things are worth little more than wl they cost us in time, effort and heartache. The Settlement School id is a .success that I know you will join me in proclaiming. That will continue to be so I am sure you will join me in pledging. If I have failed to thank by name in this report all who have h a part in our labours, I include them here, and add to them the nan of the whole fraternity who have given me the opportunity to serve Beta Phi. With this I bid you goodbye and join the ranks of 1 pasts, who are working for the best interests of our fraternity. NITA HILL STARK Report of Head Resident Pi Beta Phi Settlement Scho( 19264927 N submitting the report for the year 1926-27 I find that the have been fewer changes or outstanding events than in alm any year previous. It has not been necessary to make a changes in staff during the year, the different departments hi carried on about as usual and at the close of the year I feel we ( say it has been a year of good average work. The staff has been : Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident. Mabel Schuckman a'nd Ruby RS man, nurses. Margaret White, Principal of School, high school teacher. Marion Folsom, high school teacher. Dora Chapin, 3rd and 4th grades. Elmer Watson, 5th and 6th grades, athletics. Emily Burton, 1st and 2nd grades. ,Dorothy Trainer, Kindergarten and primer. Jean Steele, Home Economics. O. J.

Cora McCarter, Sugarlands School. Lillie Reagan, Assistant to the nurse. Otha Reagan, Supervisor of student labor, farmer. Leander McCarter, General Labor. Lizzie Reagan, Cook. Mrs. McCarter, Ccok. ScHoor, The enrollment for the past year falls a very little below the nunilast year as there has been no consolidation whatever. The at-mace from our local community has been a little larger. The only reason we cannot show a much better attendance is be e of the epidemics that have visited us. Measles were raging school opened in the fall and continued for a good part of the chicken pox, flu and mumps followed and practically everyone, tnd young, had them. The school work has gone on easier than usual, no doubt due to few changes in the teaching staff. Miss Burton returned, after a 's absence, for her ninth school year and taught the first and see-grades. Her work was made easier because of the kindergarten primer classes carried on in the dining-room of the Teacher's Cot-by Miss Trainer. This experiment was tried out this past year while we have no doubt of the need and of the good work done I eel that with finances low we should try to get along without it year. Mrs. Chapin taught the third and fourth grades and did splendid She came with the understanding she would supervise the es up to the seventh, but it proved very hard to do as that had Been the custom in the past. lean Steele taught one double period high school class in hotde omics each school day. Cdr. Mattil taught two double period high school classes each day. Winogene Redding taught one double period high. school class each With the full schedule of regular work the boys and girls were very busy in school and it seemed as though every minute was pied out of school hours. [t does not seem wise to carry more than two years of high school : for the present. .Our first year class is large but the second class the past year had only two pupils in it. The roads are good gh now so pupils can go to Sevierville to school without much :nifty. We had four pupils going back and forth this year. the county superintendent tells us that the two years of high )l work here is accredited but we have not official acknowledge-of this. So far our pupils have had to take ea aminations when .ing accredited high schools in the state. REPORTS OP OFFICERS 85 Elmer Watson does not return next year Margaret White does not expect to, nor does Marion Folsom. If these changes have to come it seems to me it would be the time to put a strong man into the high school department, preferably as principal. I feel strongly that we should have a man in the School. While Mr. Mattil teaches agriculture his work keeps him away from the School practically all of the time, even the classes he conducts are in a separate building and he never has time to be on the play ground even at recess. Were a man put in as principal his work should not be too heavy for him really to have supervision of the whole School. The weak place has always been in regard to supervision, in trying to keep each room a separate unit instead of holding everything together as a whole. Were ,conditions a little different in Sevierville I would make the recommendation this year that we turn back to the county the first six grades. With an eight month's school term, better teachers and salaries in the county and as much improvement as has been made in the past two or three years I believe we should give back to the county the grade work. It would take a year or more for the county to pre-pare to take this but I believe if it did it would make 'Gatlinburg a consolidated school, as it probably never will under present conditions. This does not mean. that I would advise giving up all super-vision of the School, we would not be asked to, the county is glad to employ Pi Phi teachers and would pay as good salaries as we are pay--lug. I firmly believe there is danger of schools of this kind holding on-to work after the county is able to take it over. We would have a big task left if we carried the next four grades, the home economics, agriculture, weaving, health, and community work, and the industrial department. During the year health plays were given by the grade children. At the close of the eight months of school Miss Burton's, Mrs. Chapin's and Mr. Watson's pupils gave three short plays. The usual Christmas program was given. The closing exercises for eighth grades and high schoOl consisted of a play in the nature of a minstrel show, given by the boys glee club, on May 10 and May 20 an address was given by Mr. Charles Sharp of Sevierville. The Red Cross certificates were given to the twelve girls completing the course in Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick and eighth grade certificates were given to twenty-one pupils. This was followed by a little banquet. With school opening as late as September it was necessary to continue until May 20, later than any school in Sevier county. This was tried as an experiment. The pupils have stayed in well as they possibly could but I feel that next year it will be better to open earlier, then if time has to be lost it can be during the first month instead of the last. Surely the first seven grades must begin August 1. In the winter the New York Club obtained passes to New York for Helen Chew so she could be present for the February meeting. THE ARROW Or PI BE:T.A PHI :argaret White and Whtogene Redding visited Berea Cillege. ?veral from ;he School attended the Mountain Conference 7'ille. COMMUNITY ach year we bring the same report: we have done what we felt uld but have fallen far short of meeting the needs of the con-y from a social standpoint. uring last summer we found it impossible to movies once ,k in the .barn because of lack of current. This spring we have d them again and hope we can continue. he Evening School Club, IneetnIg twice a month meets a social I] as educational need. he usual number of parties were held duril.g the year.

HOME ECONOI\.IICS his department has continued in much the same way as last The outstanding development has been in the community work. lornings are taken up with high school classes in the School. The .00ns are given to classes in different communities. New cornies have been added to the list and more classes held in the Gat-g school for the women and girls. :iss Steele's report gives in detail her work and also shows what of riding it requires. She is faithful to the last degree and no day is bad enough for her to think she should give up a trip for s. M4iss Steele has accomplished almost the impossible in inter-the women in these classes. She also has organized a club that twice a month, the nurse giving a health program one time ; she .ng a home economics one the next meeting. Usually they show (gotten from the University of Tennessee) and have! a special These clubs are well attended and the women do so well. read papers and give talks on the subjects and take a great deal nest. Several feel that we are really meeting a community need :se meetings. REPORTS Or OrricERs 87 Miss White, the State SupervisOr of Home Economics, has recommended to the state that the home economics teacher here be put on full time for community work, the state paying the entire salary. This year the state has been allowing us $1000.00 but on the other hand they asked that we raise Miss, Steele's salary in proportion. Were we to release Miss Steele from school work it would be necessary to have the school home economics taught by one of the other teachers. Last year Barbara Dewell did half-time teaching in the School during the winter months and relieved the other teachers very much but at that time we were carrying three years of high school classes. My definite recommendation regarding this cannot be made until I know surely what the state will do. AGRICULTURE Mr. Mattil's report gives such a detailed account of the activities of this department I will not attempt to list them in my report. The mornings are given to school work, as well as a lot of calls people make here, the afternoons, to community work. Three new communities havel been added to the list of those having evening school work. Much time has to be put into the planning and carrying on of fairs each fall. Before the fairs there are community meetings in a great many schools and these are not only agricultural but usually show pictures relative to better homes and better health. The real development of the work is shown in the number of calls made on Mr. Mattil to advise regarding orchards, stock, farm crops, etc. The chicken business takes much time, too. There are calls to see sick animals, to know what to spray with, what kind of chicken house to build and numberless other questions. Mr. Mattil spent six weeks in Cornell University last summer. I surely hope he will feel he can remain here another year. Boys' DORMITORY The boys' dormitory has been managed better this year than ever before and the end of the year shows the good results. Mrs. Dowell has been faithful to her task, which means a lot when you remember that no other teachers live in the cottage so there never is anyone to relieve her of her cares for even a single night. . With better supervision of the boys' work we have had little trouble. During the fall there were eight boys on the hill but the the close of school found only four there. One boy dropped out of school in the spring, another stayed with a relative, another couldn't keep the smoking regulations, another one was in seventh grade so left as soon as that closed. The only question of discipline has come in regard to smoking. THE ARROW or PI BETA PHI Sirs. Dowell supervised the noon lunch for the children in Dorothy ner's and Emily Burton's rooms, lunch was served in the kindrten room. GIRLS' .DoRmITORY The year has passed unusually well here. There have been from to seven girls in the dormitory and there has been no trouble Lever. Mrs. McCarter and Aunt Lizzie have done the cooking for the .e family, boys, girls and teachers. The plan has worked out very and has proved to be the best way to manage. The changes in fall required comparatively little financial outlay and no changes ny amount in the cottages. The meals have been well balanced and appetizing and I feel we better cared for than those in the average boarding school. While the girls have not had much chance to help with the cooking have done other house work that has kept them busy. The boys stayed week-ends more than the girls have as Saturday farm ^ was always pressing. In both girls' and boys' dormitories there should be a way for those L arge to be relieved as every day and every night makes a pretty [ strain. It was my idea this year to relieve ourselves as much as possible try to have the Burg help bear the burden of the boarding pupils at the end of the year I feel I have made a mistake. Some of our t promising pupils are in homes in the Burg. With the little super-)n the average family gives, the results are not what they should The work for students has been better planned this year and posy we can improve still more another year and have more under our FARM The farm work has been looked after and partially done by Otha gala, under the planning and supervision of Mr. Mattil. Otha has red to be quite a good hand to look after the boys and their work the result has been that the farm is in better condition and the k and chickens have done better this year than ever before. Stu-help is hard to handle, hours are more uncertain, work has to be fully checked up and lots of patience and encouragement used. The reports of the farm, as submitted by Mr. Mattil, show that '0 has been a good amount of production toward the living. We have been able to sell quite a little. The chicken business has e to be quite a thing. During the spring a great many baby chicks e sold and settings given out around the district. These are paid by people returning pullets in the fall. More hay was raised this REPORTS OF' OrrIaRS 89 past year but we are not able to raise all we need yet. Last year we hoped to but failed. Each year, however, shows an improvement in the farm products. STUDENT LABOR Both boys and girls put in most of the out of school hours in work on the place. During the year the boys have their baseball and basketbal to take some outside time but the boys look after the horses, chick-ens, cows, pigs, carrying in the wood, cleaning the schoolhouse, and a great many odd jobs. The girls wait on table, set table, help with the dishes, keep the cottages clean, etc. It is a . big expense to keep the dormitories open but the school shows that those boys and girls living on the place hold out best in their school work. This past year we have felt that the grade of work done by the students was better than ever before and the work better organized. HEALTH The report from this department shows that there have been several changes during the year. Phyllis Higinbotham left in the early spring of 1926. Mabel Sthuckman' came at once and remained four months. She was a fine nurse and hard worker and had she been con-tent in the country might have remained. She did not, however, care to stay so Ruby Ryman took her place in the fall of 1926. She came just in time to assist with the largest tonsil and, adenoid clinic we have ever had and to be with Miss Schuckman long enough to get a good idea of the work and to become somewhat acquainted. Miss Ryman has carried out an extensive health program in the schools. The toxin, antitoxin, and typhoid clinics were very large. During much of the winter time both Sevierville and Pittman Center were without nurses so many long trips were made by our nurse, giving inoculations to school children in 'Green Briar, Emerts Cove, Smoky Mountain and Wears Valley. It was possible to make longer trips this year as roads were bet-ter, where they had been improved, and a car could be used quite a good deal. On the other hand, the roads that were bad were awful as we had a rainy winter. The transportation problem was acute during the time' Mr. Matti, Jean Steele and Ruby Ryman all needed horses the same afternoons, but they all lived through, even the horses and cars, and now the family is on very good terms again. With better roads it is much easier for the doctors to keep their afternoons at the office. The dentist comes twice a month now and always has full work. There have been several very successful clinics. There has been quite a change in the nature of work done at the center and through the community. This change has been coming for 90 THE ARROW OF' PI BETA PHI several years. While we would not want too much of the home and bedside work to stop we are glad to see the work on a health educatinal basis. Night calls for the nurse are few now and calls that should be for a doctor instead of a nurse are fewer. Having telephone connections with Sevierville and Knoxville has helped tremendously. Miss Hyman likes and understands the mountain people and if she is satisfied to continue I feel she can do well. She will have to be in college six weeks this summer taking a public health course and I am not sure she will return after that. We must continue trying to locate a Pi Phi nurse, one who will come with the idea of staying more than a few months. Frequent changes in any department handicap the work very much. During all these changes we have been very fortunate in having Lillie Reagan, a local girl, in the office. Lillie has been familiar with the work, the people and their needs , has taken care of all correspondence; ordering of supplies ; all care of the Center , and what is more, Dr. Ogle made the statement the other day that he had never known anyone with a finer sense of when to be present and when to be absent. We have tried to have a school girl help a little with the cleaning, to relieve Lillie some, as she finds more work than she is able to do. I feel strongly that we have been unfair this year. We have paid $50.00, home and travel for this work, the girls having shorter hours and really less responsibility. Now we are paying $30.00 and Lillie boarding at home. It seems to me we have taken advantage of a willing spirit. My recommendation for this department is that we pay Lillie Reagan $40.00 per month with a reimbursement of $50.00 as the salary should have been raised the first of the year. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Due to changes in county health physicians and nurses the year has been a hard one for the unit. We have had three different nurses within the year, Pittman had a change and was for several weeks 'with-out a nurse, Sevierville was several weeks without a nurse. The present doctor has been in very poor health ever since he came. While I do not doubt the wisdom of continuing with the Unit I do feel this year the work has been going on under difficulties. Whenever there is any help available we are sure of getting our share and I feel we should continue with the Unit. It is rather of a surprise each year that the county court votes the necessary appropriation as always there are those who are opposed but it passes with a good majority. If we gained nothing more than the free serums and the help from the county unit in holding large school clinics I would say it was worth while. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 9 WEAVING Much of the report of this department is covered in the report o] industrial work. Miss Redding has had one high school class in weaving. This claa meets each day one double period. Little is done by these girls fa market but practically all the time is used for definite instruction b weaving, patterns, colors, etc. A great deal of time is given to the women who weave in their homes or on school looms. This year more women came to the housl to see Miss Redding, calls here taking the place of long trips by Mis Redding to their homes. Weaving was done in not less than thirt homes. In spite of the large amount of weaving we had on hand last sum mer and early fall we found it almost impossible to keep up with the Christmas orders. School did not open until September and that lef little time to prepare for the unusually large amount of business. Afte Christmas there was time to work' out some new things and this sum mer we have some really lovely weaving in the Shop. During the year we sent several exhibits away and found tha the work from our school compared well with that from other wel known places. The Mountain Conference in Knoxville made much o the mountain industries. While there may not be much financial profi in sending these there is a certain amount of advertising done and 'w, also are showing our interest in the mountain work. The financial system of this year has helped to carry this tremend ous increase of business, yet it has not been perfect by any means any I am sure that the detailed report of Miss Redding explains every thing. Also it was impossible to do all we would have liked to for tin, was not to be had. Before Christmas all who could devoted prat tically all their time to this work and even then found it impossible t keep up with the orders or with the products. With one definitel: in charge next fall and with the financial system so we can start ou out in a businesslike way at once I feel sure we will carry the depart went much better. The business can be carried much better when we have more root for shipping, for finished products and for materials. INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT The growth of this department has been so rapid that in spite a the plans we make each year to handle the business we and ourselve simply swamped, all who possibly can neglect their duties giving fu] time to filling orders, doing up bundles and taking care of endless coi respondence. On May 1, 1926, Lois Rogers and Harmo Taylor opened the Gil Shop in the Stuart Cottage. Each girl had a third interest, the Scho( keeping one third stock, too. The Shop not only took care of the man 92 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI tourists who came but also took over all correspondence and shipping. It not only was a wonderful relief to us who had been doing it all but the financial results were beyond expectations. With the first of September, the Shop closed and baskets, weaving, chairs and stools were again deposited in the attic, the basement, the offices, the upstairs hall and the girls' trunks in the Teacher's Cottage. Visitors and customers continued to visit us and always when we were the deepest in daily work. From September 1 to January 1 we shipped from here nearly $10,000 worth of products. It took the combined efforts of Miss Red-ding, Miss Allen and myself, to say nothing of those who packed baskets. Had there been room in the house for another person we surely would have had one to help but we were too crowded to put another person in the office. Lois Rogers returned the middle of April and we surely were de-lighted to see her. We closed the kindergarten work two weeks early in order to be able to open a Gift Shop, called the Arrowcraft Shop. That was the only place available and really our ex-dining room, kindergarten room, made a very attractive shop. Eugenia Dilworth, of Austin, comes the first of June to help Lois, and at that time the girls will move the shop back in the Stuart Cottage. It would be better to have it on the road but we cannot plan on using the agriculture building until we know more definitely whether it will have to be used the same in the fall. We are sure, however, that there must be a person here all the time to manage the industrial work. During the summer months the Arrowcraft girls purchased $3,131.-43 and sold $3,990.76. From September to May the School bought $9,274.59 and shipped $13,804.16. Of course a good deal was returned p.t the end of the club yeaii but this gives some idea of the amount of business done. While the new business system was not entirely satisfactory any of the time it was such an improvement over the old way that I feel we never could have carried on under old conditions and I feel sure, too, that another year we will be able to have things go satisfactorily. SUG.A.RLANDS Sugarlands, like Gatlinburg has to be considered on the twelve months basis, rather than on the eight months school term. During the summer of 1926 Miss Chew had adult classes and as early as July 1, she and Cora McCarter commenced school, teaching a half day session until the county 'school opened the middle of July. From the middle of July to September the girls carried on a full school program, night school classes and all the house work. This. made entirely too heavy a schedule. In September, Martha Flowers came. she was to look after the house in the morning, prepare the noon meal ind then 'Van two hours in the afternoon Miss Chew did corn R] PORTS or OrricERs 93 munity work and held some adult classes. This was carried out after a fashion through the year but was not entirely satisfactory. It was upsetting to the teachers and fully as much so to the pupils to have their day divided up in that manner. The night classes were well attended, they require much preparation as it is impossible to secure satisfactory text books for that kind of teaching. After each evening class there was a period of recreation, all three teachers helping with that. Having school from eight in the morning until nine-thirty at night may not sound like so much but on the weeks that Miss Chew had to be up at five o'clock to prepare breakfast it proved to be a whole lot. The community work and adult teaching could easily take all the time of one person. But this was only a part of the worry, the new schoolhouse was not completed until after Christmas. The county did not want to put repairs into the old building so bitter winter weather found the girls teaching in a room with practically no window panes, a house so frail that on very windy days school had to be dismissed in safety to the children. Finally window panes were put in but it was a joy when school finally was moved into the new building. In addition to this was the anxiety regarding the Teacher's Cottage. But for the promise made to the people I doubt if we would have tried to build before spring. The roads were terrible, no one wanted to take the job, the local men wanted work by the day but none of them could supervise or read the plans. Finally two men from Gatlinburg said they would take the job, using some Sugarlands men, if Mr. Mattil would help them. In this way the -cottage was finally completed. The house is very attractive and convenient and while it has cost more than planned it has cost less than any contract price submitted. The building has made a hole in our finances but I think it probably is better to have built well in the beginning. During this summer Helen Chew. is continuing night classes and the people have a community gathering each Saturday night. . Miss Steele continues her Home Economics class with the women and Mr. Mattil makes frequent visits in the community. The county bears the expense of two teachers and the state has allowed quite a liberal amount toward the adult work so the running expenses of the Sugarlands Extension are not so heavy. Miss Chew is not sure she can return another year but if she is able to, I feel she should have full time for adult and community work. Two teachers can take care of the school work. It is necessary to have an experienced teacher and a Pi Phi in the school. We have no one on the Gatlinburg staff who could be transferred to this place and put in charge of the Extension. Not only from my observations here but in what I have gathered from attending conferences have I been convinced that Helen Chew is carrying on one of the best pieces of adult education and community THE ARROW' Or PI BETA PHI Not a great deal is said about it but it is accomplishing some-g. Anyone who is familiar with teaching knows how hard it is to est those above the school age. I' surely feel we should continue part of the Sugarlands program if possible but if Miss Chew does ? to leave it will be hard to fill her place. GENERAL EXTENSION WORK During the past year Miss Steele has had classes in Laurel Lick, arlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River and Gatlinburg. Mr. Mattil has had classes in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Wears Val-Middle Creek, New Era and Gatlinburg. The nurse has had clinics in all schools in the district and has also to Wears Valley, Green Briar, Emerts Cove and Smoky Mountain school clinics. Mr. M[attil had many meetings during the fall, preparatory to the in different school districts. The work in the Sugarlands is outstanding, especially along the of adult education. The past two years have proved to me that our field lies in this ion program, giving the people something the county school cannot these rural schools for years to ,come. What we are doing for bet-homes, better farms, better health and broader lives fully justifies expenditures and our being here. OFFICE With the opening of the school year LaDelle came to take over h of the bookkeeping connected with the School and to help with a. office work. Everything was new to her and to me and at first ras impossible to know what, when or how. Six weeks or more t by before the books could be opened. There were, however, plenty hings to keep all hands busy. On September the Shop closed and all that business, as well as I orders, visitors, people to buy from and everything were dumped the office we had moved into. We had thought we would have ty of room by taking what had been the down stairs office for La e's and my office but it soon was filled with weaving and many r things. A new typewriter, adding machine and some other smaller office Anent were purchased. LaDelle Allen has done well with the work and in. spite of the unt of time we had to put into the industrial business during the she has kept up the book work very well. With the increased amount of business done in the industrial dement I am sure we never could have handled it all had not much he business been handled entirely from here. Much correspondenc e REPORTS 01 01TICERS 95 has been saved and time in attending to the accounts. While there are quite a good many accounts not yet closed collections have been made fairly easily. In checking up the reports it becomes clear why the monthly bank allowance does not cover expenses. The months we do the heaviest buying are the months the least cash comes in. That explains why we were behind month after month and still are. If we continue to buy industrial supplies and products at this rate the fixed bank balance will have to be increased. It takes a year to try out these things and I think that probably another year we can get along pretty well but the fall was terribly trying. Practically no time has been given to letters to the clubs or chapters, to constructive planning for the School, or even to enough committee letters, yet more hours have been spent in the office than ever before. With the correspondence relative to the industrial business and the other work connected with that the office time has been entirely taken up. The Gatlinburg News .has gone to each club, officer and to the isolated Pi Phis who have sent in their contributions through Dorothy Geare. In the April News I enclosed a club letter, giving a brief summary of the year's work. These club letters should go out every month and I surely plan to see that it is done next year. Letters direct from the School do bring results. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAJRS MADE DURING 1926-27 Sugarlands Teacher's Cottage built. Plans secured for industrial building in Gatlinburg. New entrance made to the grounds and iron gate hung. Telephone installed, school furnishing 50 poles. New chicken house built. Brooder house enlarged. Small barn built on Sims place. Sims place surveyed and fenced. New typewriter, adding machine, broad shelves, etc., gotten for of-fiCe. Small changes made in Pollard Cottage to take care of the dormitory boys, girls and teachers for meals. All plumbing, heating, etc., thoroughly looked over during the vacation. Some furniture made : tables, shelves, etc. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1927-28 New building for industrial departments. Plans for community hall. Continuation of Gift Shop through entire year, THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI A man for high school teaching and principal. Garage built. This year has caused a good ninny worries out of the regular hool work. There has been a question of property line that has caused a law Lit that is not settled. It has been necessary to resurvey the Sims ace. The great worry has been the Sugarlands Cottage. It was not )ssible to get anyone to take the contract for less than around $6,0(0. fact no one wanted to do it for even that as roads were bad, it was ifficult to get materials in and few men wanted to undertake the )ck work. Finally two Gatlinburg men said they would do it, using hat Sugarlands labor they could, providing Mr. Mattil would super-Ise it all. The cottage was completed in January and is convenient, tractive and very comfortable. The expenses have run about $500.00 Dove what I figured they would and by using a little cheaper material e could have saved al:Out that much. In the long run we will be glad *the cottage as it is, but now and during the past winter it has been great 'big burden financially. With this experience it is plain we must go slowly in regard to the .pool building at Gatlinburg. All estimates have been far beyond aything we could consider. While there was one of $24,000 without eating and plumbing the others all ran between $50,000 and $65,000. 'hese did not include a community hall. Mr. White feels now that robably a group of small buildings would be better and is working on now. They could be built much cheaper and quicker and may Dive our problem. We do need more room but surely we must not insider spending such large sums, even if we had them. I am sure all could rather wait even longer and finally get a plan that will call for building within our means. In closing my report I want again to thank the committee for the plendid support and cooperation. Our problems are many, the School as grown beyond any early dreams and the development is the result f the splendid service given by those Pi Phis on the committee and way from the School who continue to have such a deep interest in the cork. thiVELYN BisHor REPORTS or OrF'ICERS 97 Report of Treasurer of Settlement School We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, T6nnessee, for the period 1926-1927 ending May 16, 1927.

Or OrrICERS 107 Report of Alpha Province President HE personal contact which is such an important factor in the work of J all Province Presidents with their chapters was established during the time of my first chapter visiting, and strengthened again soon after college opened last fall when all chapters in Alpha Province were visited for the second time by me. This personal contact has also been steadily maintained and fostered by a weekly interchange of letters between the chapters and their Province President. The same bond of sympathy and interest is also very apparent between the active chapters, their advisory committees and their alumna, and as in the case of Vermont B their Mother's Club. During the last two years, one cf our highest aims has been for each chapter to try to develop nationally and internally, for the willing acceptance of individual responsibility, and to have every girl in the chapter active on an active committee. , At the close of the last college year, each chapter was asked to send in to me an unofficial report of the year's work, with criticisms for improvement and of methods used. A copy was also filed away by each chap-ter. The incoming officers this year found these reports invaluable in avoiding pitfalls and in continuing the growth and development of last year. The girls have been very earnest in trying to improve their scholarship. This is shown, not only in their own studying, but in their attitude toward the scholarship of their rushees, and their splendid help to the pledges. Each chapter has worked out a very satisfactory pledge study. This is one of the most important steps in the development of a chapter, for changing the standards of a chapter can only be brought about through the new initiates, never the seniors. This year the eight chapters of Alpha Province maintained three ehaP-ter houses, three apartments, one log cabin and one large room fcr meetings and entertainments. The alumnae of Massachusetts A and Vermont B are seriously considering financing houses for their chapters this summer, since in both cases the dormitory situation is quite acute. The girls of Maine A seem to be enjoying very much their new log cabin which is truly II hi spirit as well as furnishings. In closing may I again thank Convention for the signal honor conferred upon me in electing me Province President of Alpha Province, an honor which has been one of happy association with Pi Phis and joy in the service cf our fraternity. VIDA H. PEENE Report of Beta Province President NCE upon a time Wamba asked Touchstone what was the most wonderful thing within his ken. Touchstone replied, "'Tis easily answered. It is the great difference there is 'twixt men." After a moment's thoughtful pause, Wamba made query, "What is the next most wonderful thing within your ken?" "Still easier answered," Touchstone replied, "'Tis the little difference there is 'twixt men." So it is with these province reports and with the chapters within the provinces. They are so much alike and yet each one presents, and strives to conquer, its own individual problems. Eight fine chapters are those in Beta Province impressing others bY their progress during the last two years, and excelling in the camaraderie that exists between them. It has been a keen pleasure for their Province Pres
