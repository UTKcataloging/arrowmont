        60 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI to Grenoble and began a special study of phonetics under Professor Rosset, the best known authority on French Phonetics in the world. This course leads to "Le Diplome d' Etudes Superieurs de Phonetique" which has not yet been granted to any American. ETHELYN HARDESTY-CLEAVER. OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL (The following is the report of Mrs. Helmick, made to the Chicago Alumnae Club on September 28, 1912, on her trip to Gatlinburg, Tenn.) I LEFT Chicago on Wednesday, September 1 8, arriving in Sevierville, Tenn., the following afternoon at 4 :20, too late to drive over to Gatlinburg. I stopped over night at the Snapp House, and on Friday morning at 7 :30 I was on the road, with John Emmert, a mountain boy of about sixteen, driving. We had a light mountain buggy; the horse was fresh, and we made good time. Leaving the fine, hard, pike road about two miles out we turned to the south and struck up into the mountains. Up, up we climbed, through rocky ravines and beside the rushing Little Pigeon river which was at times a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet directly below us, with the lofty peaks of the distant mountains ever looming up ahead. Above all this grandeur Old Smokey seemed to penetrate into the very heavens directly over us. About 10 :30 we crossed the last summit and swinging around what seemed to me the last bluff, came out upon a plateau and Gatlinburg. Seven houses were in sight, the largest settlement since leaving Pigeon Forks eight miles behind. The strains of an organ, a weird sound in this magnificent natural wonderland, came to my ears and I felt the first touch and influence of Miss Hill. She was having her daily gymnastic exercises in the school house beside the road.. I had my driver take me up to the cottage (the Pi Phi Cottage) on the hillside. Coming back, I was hailed and pursuaded to stop by Mrs. Maples, one of the neighbors, until Miss Hill came. Great excitement was visible among the children of the "burg". Emma, Miss Hill's little mountain maid, came rushing down at the first bell of dismissal, and after shyly glancing at me, passed to an inner door, and in reply to a question from her mother, said, "I promised the girls at school I would wave a towel from the upstairs window if she OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 61 had come!" This is how my arrival was announced to the school and to Miss Hill. Miss Hill soon came down, and together we went up to the cottage. Here, the sweet perfume of the honeysuckle greets one at the gate, and the air and the atmosphere seem different, and are different from anything around. The house is a three-roomed cottage, with a narrow piazza in front and in the back, covered earlier in the year with vines. Outside, rough boards, overlapping each other, cover the walls, while the roof is shingled with short boards, not thin. THE PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COTTAGE, WHERE MISS HILL LIVES Inside, the walls, ceiling and floor are of native woods, with no paint, and no varnish. The only treatment it has had was a generous drenching and scrubbing with a strong solution of lye and hot water when Miss Hill took possession in March last. The east room is the bed room, with its two single beds, dresser, two rockers and one straight back chair. A cozy fireplace suggests cheer. The west room is the dining-room. This is Miss Hill's living room and library and here is the organ when it is at home. Back of the bedroom is the kitchen, with its fine new range, kitchen cabinet, and plain, mountain-made hickory, rush bottomed chairs. The cottage is cozy, comfort62 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI able and not at all a cramped place. The floors are bare, save for a rug in the bedroom and one in the dining-room. After a cup of tea, and some of Miss Hill's delicious, home-cured ham, we went to the school. The school is now being held in the abandoned Methodist church, which is made from rough boards like a rough country barn. Great cracks are in the floor and walls and it is not a fit place for habitation during cold weather. During these four months of the public school term we are co-operating with the public schools and Miss Hill is teaching with the native teacher. She is paid partly by them and partly by us. This term expires November 30, when we will again continue our regular, independent work. `This short term is all the schooling these people have in a year from the public funds. After listening to several classes and hearing two assignments, the two schools were combined in Miss Hill's room, making over seventy pupils in all, drawn from a radius of five miles, and I gave them a talk upon education and training. Saturday, we had callers. Miss Hill did up preserves, and we busied ourselves at home and talked all the morning. In the after-noon we had a mothers' meeting. After going to bed, we talked well into the night. Sunday, it rained all day. That did not prevent callers from coming, however, for we had guests from breakfast time until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, then, after a hearty Sunday dinner at 6:30, we went for a short walk, talked some more, wrote letters, read letters, and reluctantly went to bed, continuing our talking until sleep took possession of us. Monday was a busy day. I had now met about all the people, was familiar with Miss Hill's views and wishes, and understood, as much as possible in that short time, the conditions and needs. I had examined building sites and decided upon my campaign; I wanted to meet the people publicly, and so "speaking in the school house at 2 o'clock" tacked in a conspicuous place at the store was the way the mass meeting was called, and there I stood up before these simple, earnest men, women and children the biggest meeting the town ever knew, one woman informed me and told them of Pi Beta Phi and what we proposed giving them as a permanent, lasting gift. I then asked for expressions from them, but they were silent. Waiting some time, I called Mr. Ogle, the native teacher, by name. Shambling to his feet, he asked in a determined and agitated voice, OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 63 This is the view from the piazza of the Pi Phi Cottage, looking north. The large house in the 'middle picture is the same as right center of view of Gatlinburg-residence of Squire I. L. Maples-Trees hide the school house and two stores in this picture. "what church do you folks belong to?" I replied "no one church, and yet to all the Christian churches" and gave the reasons. This brought a visible sign of relief in the audience, and the spell was broken, as one by one, they spoke earnestly and thoughtfully. "We want your school to stay with us", "no body needs your school more than we do" ; "we all love Miss Hill", "you mustn't take Miss Hill away from us" ; "if Miss Hill should go away, we will go too" ; are some of the expressions. No people could have pleaded more seriously and earnestly than they did. But, by and by, the speaking came to an end, and we dispersed, after very pleasant exchanges of expressions of good-will and fellowship. Together, a group of us walked along the road, talking and visiting, and discussing land and building sites, until we had gone about a mile or so, and then we stopped at Mr. and Mrs. E. E. Ogle's for dinner. About 8 o'clock we reached home again an unearthly hour for mountain people walking by the light of a marvelous full moon, making the scenes and events of the day long to be remembered. This was my last night with Miss Hill, and we sat on the piazza until after 12:30, spell-bound and enchanted with the quiet, peaceful surroundings of the protecting mountains, away from the exciting, rushing world. We talked of many things; some private, some of past days, but mostly of Pi Beta Phi, and our future plans and hopes. Our building sites had now been thinned out to two : Mr. E. E. Ogle's, which we are now renting, upon the hillside, 12 acres, with timber land extending to the top of the mountain behind it, valued at $1200, and Mr. Richard Ogle's, half a mile up the river, a very fine tract of twelve to fifteen acres, with timber land, a six room dwelling, a store, a big barn, a shed, a fine large orchard and plenty of cold spring water. He asks $2,000 for this. Tuesday, Miss Hill had a substitute in school, and we spent our MISS HILL AND A GROUP OF HER SCHOOL CHILDREN Taken in June 1912. There are over seventy enrolled this fall, some coming five miles by foot each morning. OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 65 entire time talking with the people and examining building sites. We dined with Mr. and Mrs. Huff, bright and progressive people. They are not natives. He has the only saw mill for miles. Four of his children are going to our school, and he will furnish us with lumber at almost cost. While at dinner, I took the opportunity to say that in the bustling, progressive west, where I had lived, when an enterprise like ours thought of coming to a town, it was customary, if the people wanted it, for the business men to get together, and offer an inducement to coming, but that I had been obliged to hunt up .properties and urge men to put a reasonable valuation upon their land when they had. a month ago expressed a desire to sell. Mr. Huff took his cue, and before I left at 2 o'clock, the men, though scattered, had "gotten together", and about three miles out of the settlement near the lumber camp, Mr. Huff was waiting for me to say; "We men have got together, and if you folks want the Richard Ogle place, and you feel $2,000 is too much, I have a man who will give you $800 for the store, and if $1,200 is more than you want to pay, we propose making up the difference among us. We want to keep your school right here. We know Miss Hill and what you have done, and we stand together to do anything you wish to keep you here. Please don't let anything influence you to go elsewhere." That was Tuesday afternoon, upon the mountain side. I reached Sevierville at 6 o'clock, and as all good people go to bed with the chickens, I followed suit. Wednesday morning, about 7:30, County Superintendent J. S. Keeble called upon me at the hotel. After talking over the long distance telephone with Mr. Huff, he made the proposition that the fraternity take the entire charge of the school management in the Gatlinburg district. He offered to give us a clear, absolute deed to all the public school property, including a new building valued at $1,000, and turn over, in cash, the pay allotted the school teachers by the school authorities, annually without a "string" of any kind, to have and to hold, and use as we wished, as long as we maintained a public and free school in the lower grades. This is exactly what is being done at Wears Valley and Juniper, under church managements, and has proven a success. It is a very fine proposition, one Miss Turner has wanted and one I now ask you to accept. The $1,000 building I speak of will have to be moved, as it is built upon the top of a hill, where there is not sufficient land. 0UR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 67 I spent all of Wednesday in Sevierville meeting the members of the school board, educators, lawyers and business men, and received the greatest courtesy and kindness. Gentlemen left their business to take me around and hunt up men I wished to see. I I wish to speak especially of Professor Drinnen, a lawyer, ex-county superintendent of schools, and a member of the state legislature. He is the gentleman who took Miss Keller over to Gatlinburg two years ago, and is a very warm friend of Pi Beta Phi. He offers us his services in legal matters, also a number of fine books for our library and assured me that he would be always happy, if at home, to drive any Pi Phi over to Gatlinburg for the pleasure it would ,give him. Mr. Ballard, an old adviser of Miss Turner's and a staunch friend of Miss Hill, is in the Bank of Sevierville, where we do our business. He has a piece of land adjoining the Richard Ogle place that I inquired about, and if the title is absolutely clear we may get it for a few hundred dollars, but there are no buildings on it. The land was taken recently for debt, and as soon as the title is proven clear he will write me, and I will take it under advisement. Miss Hill must have an assistant by December 1. Several years ago she passed through a serious nervous breakdown and she is not strong now. Pi Phi should ask no, one to do this work alone, the isolation and loneliness is too great a strain upon any one person of Miss Hill's age. She has proven herself a plucky and brave pioneer in this work of ours. Her teaching daily classes is a small part of what she is doing for us and these people. If there is any-one sick, it is Miss Hill who gives them succor and sympathy; if there is a grief stricken family, it is Miss Hill who comforts, and strengthens hope and faith; if there is a feud or ill feeling among neighbors, it has been Miss Hill who has heard the wail and given her wise judgment and advice. It is Miss Hill who gathers the mothers together Saturday afternoon for a happy mothers' meeting, where they have been made to realize that theirs is not the worst lot in life, and it is Miss Hill who shows them how to prepare and cook dishes they never heard of before. We must not permit her to over-tax her strength, which she will surely do if she continues the pace forced upon her by circumstances. My dear sisters, I am going to ask you for $5,000 before January 1, 1913. My predecessor, as treasurer, turned over to me, with the exception of $709.19, the funds of the Settlement School invested, 68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and I am instructed by her that all the moneys turned over to me were in trust as an endowment fund, hence are not available for immediate use. I heartily approve of an endowment fund, and wish to increase this nucleus as fast as possible, but our present need is a most vital one, and we must have contributions for immediate expenses. I now ask you to authorize your committee (1st) to hire an assist-ant to Miss Hill, December 1 ; (2d) to take over the public school property and obligation, as explained; (3d) to buy the necessary property; (4th) to put up the necessary buildings, with the under-standing, all this is to be done only when the money is available. Upon every member of the Chicago alumnae club there rests an especial duty and obligation, and upon every member of Pi Beta Phi in Christendom there rests an obligation. We must reach these members, and tell them of the work before us, tell them of the grand labor of love for our own needy people at home in the mountains of Tennessee, in honor of our Founders of Pi Beta Phi, who made so much joy and a better life possible for us. I ask every Pi Phi here, when writing her sister, to speak of the work and our need for universal co-operation. I ask you to lose no opportunity for telling your friends who are not Pi Phis of our work. I ask you to assume the responsibility of raising funds for your treasury in any way you can. Try to interest your philanthropic friends; your clubs; get up entertainments, musicals, any dignified means for raising this money, we shall need to continue this privilege for service given us. My dear friends, it is the work and duty of each one of you. Are you going to do your whole duty, or are you going to make excuses? ELIZABETH A. HELMICK, Chairman Settlement School Committee, and Treasurer. 4837 Kenmore Ave., Chicago, Ill. After hearing this report, the club voted to authorize the Settlement School committee to secure an assistant for Miss Hill, negotiate for a building site, and consider plans for a building as soon as funds are available. The Settlement School Committee composed of women living in Chicago has been organized as follows: chairman and treasurer, Mrs. E. A. Helmick, 4837 Kenmore Ave.; secretary, Dema Harsh HOW WE EARNED MONEY FOR OUR SCHOOL 69 barger, 4727 Kenmore Ave. ; Kate B. Miller, 112 S. Ashland Blvd., in charge of publications and publicity Mrs. Channing W. Barrett, 446 St. James Place, in charge of furnishings and supplies ; Mrs. Hermann Von Hoist, 1361 East 51st.

        0UR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 67 I spent all of Wednesday in Sevierville meeting the members of the school board, educators, lawyers and business men, and received the greatest courtesy and kindness. Gentlemen left their business to take me around and hunt up men I wished to see. I I wish to speak especially of Professor Drinnen, a lawyer, ex-county superintendent of schools, and a member of the state legislature. He is the gentleman who took Miss Keller over to Gatlinburg two years ago, and is a very warm friend of Pi Beta Phi. He offers us his services in legal matters, also a number of fine books for our library and assured me that he would be always happy, if at home, to drive any Pi Phi over to Gatlinburg for the pleasure it would ,give him. Mr. Ballard, an old adviser of Miss Turner's and a staunch friend of Miss Hill, is in the Bank of Sevierville, where we do our business. He has a piece of land adjoining the Richard Ogle place that I inquired about, and if the title is absolutely clear we may get it for a few hundred dollars, but there are no buildings on it. The land was taken recently for debt, and as soon as the title is proven clear he will write me, and I will take it under advisement. Miss Hill must have an assistant by December 1. Several years ago she passed through a serious nervous breakdown and she is not strong now. Pi Phi should ask no, one to do this work alone, the isolation and loneliness is too great a strain upon any one person of Miss Hill's age.

OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL (The following is the report of Mrs. Helmick, made to the Chicago Alumnae Club on September 28, 1912, on her trip to Gatlinburg, Tenn.) I LEFT Chicago on Wednesday, September 1 8, arriving in Sevierville, Tenn., the following afternoon at 4 :20, too late to drive over to Gatlinburg. I stopped over night at the Snapp House, and on Friday morning at 7 :30 I was on the road, with John Emmert, a mountain boy of about sixteen, driving. We had a light mountain buggy; the horse was fresh, and we made good time. Leaving the fine, hard, pike road about two miles out we turned to the south and struck up into the mountains. Up, up we climbed, through rocky ravines and beside the rushing Little Pigeon river which was at times a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet directly below us, with the lofty peaks of the distant mountains ever looming up ahead. Above all this grandeur Old Smokey seemed to penetrate into the very heavens directly over us. About 10 :30 we crossed the last summit and swinging around what seemed to me the last bluff, came out upon a plateau and Gatlinburg. Seven houses were in sight, the largest settlement since leaving Pigeon Forks eight miles behind. The strains of an organ, a weird sound in this magnificent natural wonderland, came to my ears and I felt the first touch and influence of Miss Hill. She was having her daily gymnastic exercises in the school house beside the road.. I had my driver take me up to the cottage (the Pi Phi Cottage) on the hillside. Coming back, I was hailed and pursuaded to stop by Mrs. Maples, one of the neighbors, until Miss Hill came. Great excitement was visible among the children of the "burg". Emma, Miss Hill's little mountain maid, came rushing down at the first bell of dismissal, and after shyly glancing at me, passed to an inner door, and in reply to a question from her mother, said, "I promised the girls at school I would wave a towel from the upstairs window if she OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 61 had come!" This is how my arrival was announced to the school and to Miss Hill. Miss Hill soon came down, and together we went up to the cottage. Here, the sweet perfume of the honeysuckle greets one at the gate, and the air and the atmosphere seem different, and are different from anything around. The house is a three-roomed cottage, with a narrow piazza in front and in the back, covered earlier in the year with vines. Outside, rough boards, overlapping each other, cover the walls, while the roof is shingled with short boards, not thin. THE PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COTTAGE, WHERE MISS HILL LIVES Inside, the walls, ceiling and floor are of native woods, with no paint, and no varnish. The only treatment it has had was a generous drenching and scrubbing with a strong solution of lye and hot water when Miss Hill took possession in March last. The east room is the bed room, with its two single beds, dresser, two rockers and one straight back chair. A cozy fireplace suggests cheer. The west room is the dining-room. This is Miss Hill's living room and library and here is the organ when it is at home. Back of the bedroom is the kitchen, with its fine new range, kitchen cabinet, and plain, mountain-made hickory, rush bottomed chairs. The cottage is cozy, comfort62 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI able and not at all a cramped place. The floors are bare, save for a rug in the bedroom and one in the dining-room. After a cup of tea, and some of Miss Hill's delicious, home-cured ham, we went to the school. The school is now being held in the abandoned Methodist church, which is made from rough boards like a rough country barn. Great cracks are in the floor and walls and it is not a fit place for habitation during cold weather. During these four months of the public school term we are co-operating with the public schools and Miss Hill is teaching with the native teacher. She is paid partly by them and partly by us. This term expires November 30, when we will again continue our regular, independent work. `This short term is all the schooling these people have in a year from the public funds. After listening to several classes and hearing two assignments, the two schools were combined in Miss Hill's room, making over seventy pupils in all, drawn from a radius of five miles, and I gave them a talk upon education and training. Saturday, we had callers. Miss Hill did up preserves, and we busied ourselves at home and talked all the morning. In the after-noon we had a mothers' meeting. After going to bed, we talked well into the night. Sunday, it rained all day. That did not prevent callers from coming, however, for we had guests from breakfast time until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, then, after a hearty Sunday dinner at 6:30, we went for a short walk, talked some more, wrote letters, read letters, and reluctantly went to bed, continuing our talking until sleep took possession of us. Monday was a busy day. I had now met about all the people, was familiar with Miss Hill's views and wishes, and understood, as much as possible in that short time, the conditions and needs. I had examined building sites and decided upon my campaign; I wanted to meet the people publicly, and so "speaking in the school house at 2 o'clock" tacked in a conspicuous place at the store was the way the mass meeting was called, and there I stood up before these simple, earnest men, women and children the biggest meeting the town ever knew, one woman informed me and told them of Pi Beta Phi and what we proposed giving them as a permanent, lasting gift. I then asked for expressions from them, but they were silent. Waiting some time, I called Mr. Ogle, the native teacher, by name. Shambling to his feet, he asked in a determined and agitated voice, OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 63 This is the view from the piazza of the Pi Phi Cottage, looking north. The large house in the 'middle picture is the same as right center of view of Gatlinburg-residence of Squire I. L. Maples-Trees hide the school house and two stores in this picture. "what church do you folks belong to?" I replied "no one church, and yet to all the Christian churches" and gave the reasons. This brought a visible sign of relief in the audience, and the spell was broken, as one by one, they spoke earnestly and thoughtfully. "We want your school to stay with us", "no body needs your school more than we do" ; "we all love Miss Hill", "you mustn't take Miss Hill away from us" ; "if Miss Hill should go away, we will go too" ; are some of the expressions. No people could have pleaded more seriously and earnestly than they did. But, by and by, the speaking came to an end, and we dispersed, after very pleasant exchanges of expressions of good-will and fellowship. Together, a group of us walked along the road, talking and visiting, and discussing land and building sites, until we had gone about a mile or so, and then we stopped at Mr. and Mrs. E. E. Ogle's for dinner. About 8 o'clock we reached home again an unearthly hour for mountain people walking by the light of a marvelous full moon, making the scenes and events of the day long to be remembered. This was my last night with Miss Hill, and we sat on the piazza until after 12:30, spell-bound and enchanted with the quiet, peaceful surroundings of the protecting mountains, away from the exciting, rushing world. We talked of many things; some private, some of past days, but mostly of Pi Beta Phi, and our future plans and hopes. Our building sites had now been thinned out to two : Mr. E. E. Ogle's, which we are now renting, upon the hillside, 12 acres, with timber land extending to the top of the mountain behind it, valued at $1200, and Mr. Richard Ogle's, half a mile up the river, a very fine tract of twelve to fifteen acres, with timber land, a six room dwelling, a store, a big barn, a shed, a fine large orchard and plenty of cold spring water. He asks $2,000 for this. Tuesday, Miss Hill had a substitute in school, and we spent our MISS HILL AND A GROUP OF HER SCHOOL CHILDREN Taken in June 1912. There are over seventy enrolled this fall, some coming five miles by foot each morning. OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 65 entire time talking with the people and examining building sites. We dined with Mr. and Mrs. Huff, bright and progressive people. They are not natives. He has the only saw mill for miles. Four of his children are going to our school, and he will furnish us with lumber at almost cost. While at dinner, I took the opportunity to say that in the bustling, progressive west, where I had lived, when an enterprise like ours thought of coming to a town, it was customary, if the people wanted it, for the business men to get together, and offer an inducement to coming, but that I had been obliged to hunt up .properties and urge men to put a reasonable valuation upon their land when they had. a month ago expressed a desire to sell. Mr. Huff took his cue, and before I left at 2 o'clock, the men, though scattered, had "gotten together", and about three miles out of the settlement near the lumber camp, Mr. Huff was waiting for me to say; "We men have got together, and if you folks want the Richard Ogle place, and you feel $2,000 is too much, I have a man who will give you $800 for the store, and if $1,200 is more than you want to pay, we propose making up the difference among us. We want to keep your school right here. We know Miss Hill and what you have done, and we stand together to do anything you wish to keep you here. Please don't let anything influence you to go elsewhere." That was Tuesday afternoon, upon the mountain side. I reached Sevierville at 6 o'clock, and as all good people go to bed with the chickens, I followed suit. Wednesday morning, about 7:30, County Superintendent J. S. Keeble called upon me at the hotel. After talking over the long distance telephone with Mr. Huff, he made the proposition that the fraternity take the entire charge of the school management in the Gatlinburg district. He offered to give us a clear, absolute deed to all the public school property, including a new building valued at $1,000, and turn over, in cash, the pay allotted the school teachers by the school authorities, annually without a "string" of any kind, to have and to hold, and use as we wished, as long as we maintained a public and free school in the lower grades. This is exactly what is being done at Wears Valley and Juniper, under church managements, and has proven a success. It is a very fine proposition, one Miss Turner has wanted and one I now ask you to accept. The $1,000 building I speak of will have to be moved, as it is built upon the top of a hill, where there is not sufficient land. 0UR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 67 I spent all of Wednesday in Sevierville meeting the members of the school board, educators, lawyers and business men, and received the greatest courtesy and kindness. Gentlemen left their business to take me around and hunt up men I wished to see. I I wish to speak especially of Professor Drinnen, a lawyer, ex-county superintendent of schools, and a member of the state legislature.
