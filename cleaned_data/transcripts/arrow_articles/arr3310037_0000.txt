ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL BOARD Gatlinburg, Tennessee, July 4, 1916. To the Grand Council: I take pleasure in submitting the following report of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement for the school year ending March 31, 1916: Our school year began August 8, 1915, with Caroline McKnight Hughes, Minnesota A, as head resident in charge of the industrial work; Mary 0. Pollard, Vermont A, principal of school; Marie Ditmars, Indiana A, in charge of Kindergarten and lowest grades; and Bernice Good, Indiana B, assistant. On January 3, the corps of teachers was increased by Elva Plank, of Bloom-field, Iowa, who gave her services to the school. During the year the enrollment was as follows: In 1st Grade 17 boys, 2d " 3d " 8 4th " 11 5th " 12 6th and 7th Grades 8th Grade Total Enrollment 69 " 64 The enrollment by studies for the year was as follows: In Spelling 69 boys, 64 girls, Reading 6g Writing 55 Arithmetic 69 Grammar 14 Geography 37 History of Tennessee 4 History of United States 37 Physiology 11 Algebra 1 Sewing o Drawing 31 Manual Training 52 CC It might be interesting to know that of our Number from 6 to 8 years of age....

The failure of so large a percentage may be attributed to lack of attendance, many new pupils who came to us poorly grounded, and sickness. The Library has over 1,800 books and is satisfactorily patronized, and appreciated by the townspeople. This past year a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 was furnished, giving instruction to 52 boys with satisfactory success, as a beginning of a department we hope will in time be of great benefit to the community and the school. During the year, $282.03 was spent by the school in purchasing materials and articles for the industrial work, from which we have received $338.37, besides having on hand quite a supply of baskets, etc., not sold. This department should in time bring to the school a large income. We have in bank today to the credit of the school $4,348.10, with $500 already paid upon lumber and $1,450 in pledges to pay when needed for the building, making in round numbers $6,300 available for building, and it is our purpose to begin the new residence at once, and also to make every effort to equip the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital before next convention. During the past year the cottage now used as a teachers' residence has been remodeled, adding two sleeping rooms upstairs, wide piazzas front and back, new chimney, and the buildings freshly painted with three coats except the school building, which did not need it. Our property is' in excellent condition. During the coming year Elva Plank will be in charge of the business of the school 'at Gatlinburg. The correspondence and actual business necessary to carry on this work successfully at this end has grown to large proportions and to do this very important work it requires the time of one person almost daily. Miss Plank will teach if it becomes necessary, but she will primarily be the business manager here at Gatlinburg, and I feel that we have found a very valuable and eminently capable Pi Phi for this important work in Miss Plank. Miss Helen Ikerd, Indiana B, who has been teaching for two years, will have the supervision of the school work in the school, assisted by Helen Weinberg, Illinois A, and Julia Barksdale, Michigan B. For the industrial work we have secured the services of Margaret L. Brown, a graduate of Berea College, and a woman of some practical experience in the mountains, being a mountain girl, familiar with the resources of the mountains and the capabilities of its people. She is not 'a Pi Phi. She comes highly recommended by Dr. Frost of Berea College and Dr. Campbell of the Sage Foundation, whose advices influenced us to engage her. We believe this industrial work is going to be the salvation of our coming generation around Gatlinburg, and we hope to work up an industry which will give our young people an agreeable employment at home and furnish them a means of earning a living, and also, as I have said before, add to the income of the school. This year we are including in our regular course the first year of high school, and will continue to follow the prescribed Tennessee high school course as we have pupils ready for the work. In this we hope to equip and train our pupils to enable them to go out to teach in other mountain schools, and thus carry the influence and gifts of Pi Beta Phi to larger numbers. I feel that I am justified in stating that the very last vestige of suspicion or opposition to us has been eliminated, and that the most genuine pride in our school is felt by every man, woman and child in and around Gatlinburg. Their appreciation for all Pi Beta Phi has done for them knows no bounds and they are not backward in telling of it. I enclose herewith my financial report from June x, 1915, to April 30, 19I6, which shows many interesting facts. Next year will be Convention year and my next report will show the state of affairs to that date. I call your attention to the large number of clubs who failed to get their gifts in before the books closed for the year. You will also note that the gifts from active chapters were very small this year. While I have never encouraged active chapters in giving to the school, it has heretofore been a much larger voluntary offering. I call your especial attention to the work of the alumna; clubs. Their cordial support 38 THE ARROIV OF PI BETA PHI and delightful letters of encouragement and deep interest have been great incentives throughout the year, and I feel that the school, while it is helping our needy mountain sisters in gaining a sadly needed education, it is also helping our national organization and every Pi Phi alumna who has interested herself in the work. The report of the Settlement School would not be complete without mention of the splendid work done by its Board Members: their cordial and unstinted labors for the school, their faithful and generous eodperation with the chair-man, and their zeal and devotion to its every interest have gone a long way in making the past year one of the happiest and most profitable in my connection with this work.

The failure of so large a percentage may be attributed to lack of attendance, many new pupils who came to us poorly grounded, and sickness. The Library has over 1,800 books and is satisfactorily patronized, and appreciated by the townspeople. This past year a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 was furnished, giving instruction to 52 boys with satisfactory success, as a beginning of a department we hope will in time be of great benefit to the community and the school. During the year, $282.03 was spent by the school in purchasing materials and articles for the industrial work, from which we have received $338.37, besides having on hand quite a supply of baskets, etc., not sold. This department should in time bring to the school a large income. We have in bank today to the credit of the school $4,348.10, with $500 already paid upon lumber and $1,450 in pledges to pay when needed for the building, making in round numbers $6,300 available for building, and it is our purpose to begin the new residence at once, and also to make every effort to equip the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital before next convention. During the past year the cottage now used as a teachers' residence has been remodeled, adding two sleeping rooms upstairs, wide piazzas front and back, new chimney, and the buildings freshly painted with three coats except the school building, which did not need it. Our property is' in excellent condition. During the coming year Elva Plank will be in charge of the business of the school 'at Gatlinburg. The correspondence and actual business necessary to carry on this work successfully at this end has grown to large proportions and to do this very important work it requires the time of one person almost daily. Miss Plank will teach if it becomes necessary, but she will primarily be the business manager here at Gatlinburg, and I feel that we have found a very valuable and eminently capable Pi Phi for this important work in Miss Plank. Miss Helen Ikerd, Indiana B, who has been teaching for two years, will have the supervision of the school work in the school, assisted by Helen Weinberg, Illinois A, and Julia Barksdale, Michigan B. For the industrial work we have secured the services of Margaret L. Brown, a graduate of Berea College, and a woman of some practical experience in the mountains, being a mountain girl, familiar with the resources of the mountains and the capabilities of its people. She is not 'a Pi Phi. She comes highly recommended by Dr. Frost of Berea College and Dr. Campbell of the Sage Foundation, whose advices influenced us to engage her. We believe this industrial work is going to be the salvation of our coming generation around Gatlinburg, and we hope to work up an industry which will give our young people an agreeable employment at home and furnish them a means of earning a living, and also, as I have said before, add to the income of the school. This year we are including in our regular course the first year of high school, and will continue to follow the prescribed Tennessee high school course as we have pupils ready for the work. In this we hope to equip and train our pupils to enable them to go out to teach in other mountain schools, and thus carry the influence and gifts of Pi Beta Phi to larger numbers. I feel that I am justified in stating that the very last vestige of suspicion or opposition to us has been eliminated, and that the most genuine pride in our school is felt by every man, woman and child in and around Gatlinburg. Their appreciation for all Pi Beta Phi has done for them knows no bounds and they are not backward in telling of it. I enclose herewith my financial report from June x, 1915, to April 30, 19I6, which shows many interesting facts. Next year will be Convention year and my next report will show the state of affairs to that date. I call your attention to the large number of clubs who failed to get their gifts in before the books closed for the year. You will also note that the gifts from active chapters were very small this year. While I have never encouraged active chapters in giving to the school, it has heretofore been a much larger voluntary offering. I call your especial attention to the work of the alumna; clubs. Their cordial support 38 THE ARROIV OF PI BETA PHI and delightful letters of encouragement and deep interest have been great incentives throughout the year, and I feel that the school, while it is helping our needy mountain sisters in gaining a sadly needed education, it is also helping our national organization and every Pi Phi alumna who has interested herself in the work. The report of the Settlement School would not be complete without mention of the splendid work done by its Board Members: their cordial and unstinted labors for the school, their faithful and generous eodperation with the chair-man, and their zeal and devotion to its every interest have gone a long way in making the past year one of the happiest and most profitable in my connection with this work.

ANNOUNCEMENTS Harriet Briggs, Michigan B, is returning to Ann Arbor this fall to continue her work in the university. During the past year Miss Briggs has been a very earnest and successful officer and it is with much regret we find it necessary to accept her resignation as Gamma Province Vice-president. Elsa_Schlicht Ohio has been appointed to fill the unexpired term. Having held the office of Gamma Province Vice-president during the years 1912 and 1915 Miss Schlicht needs no further introduction to the fraternity. She takes up the alumnae work in her province with all the enthusiasm of a new officer, yet with the experience of one trusted and tried by years of faithful, efficient service. Every II (I) should read and heed the Special Announcement OTI page 43. Who will be the winning chapter?
