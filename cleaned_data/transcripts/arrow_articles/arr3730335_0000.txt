NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON BY PHYLLIS HIGGENBOTHAN We have just come home from a ten mile trip Dan and I--into the unknown. This time we have been up into the "Sugar Lands" so called in years gone by because of the number of sugar maple trees there. Last night on returning from visits to several. sick people I found Dr. Massey had called, but could not wait as he was anxious to get "down off the mountain" before dark. He had been up to see a boy who was "pretty sick" with pneumonia, and he.left word to go upand see him if possible, that be would not come back unless we sent word as it was a long, hard trip (over forty miles for him, six-teen teen of which he can make in his car, and the remaining twenty-six--f rom Pigeon Forge on horse-back). Before starting, Dan was treated to a few of the hard candies which came in two huge buckets sent the children for Christmas by one of the clubs. We saved out a few for him when filling the candy bags. I know he very much appreciates them and sends his thanks for he is always looking for more. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 335 The roads at present are terrible; Dan's feet went "squishy squashy" through the dreadful, muddy clay of Mill Creek hill. A solid curtain of mist hung before everything ahead of us, and shut Out the usual, wonderful view of the mountains into which we were riding. Three times we found the road obstructed by fallen trees, and once a rail fence had blown across our path and had to be moved before Dan could proceed; an unpleasant occurrence, for when I'm trying to mount, Dan always stands at right angles to the stone I choose. On either side we saw the havoc wrought by "the mountain wind" which blew with such terrific violence last night (everywhere trees THE ANDREW OGLE HOUSE blown down and broken off) and underneath, the result of the terrible rain, for the springs and streams, following the line of least resistance were running down the road in many places, so that Dan spent a good deal of his time wading. Our progress was slow, for the road beside being very rocky was constantly ascending; finally we began to descend the mountain unbroken woods on either side, no one to ask if this were the right road, and no noise except the distant roar of water. At last we came in sight of our destination; Dan, tied to the fence, viewed what he could of the landscape while I went in to see the sick boy. It was a home of three rooms ; seven small children besides the grown-ups, but the kindness and hospitality shown by these mountain people is truly an inspiration. Though I had had a 336 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI sandwich they insisted that I should have some dinner with them; and the invariable remark on leaving is "Better spend the night with us." To my great relief the sick boy was better and well on the road to recovery. I also discovered that he was one of a number of boys I had met while taking care of a desperately ill lad, and I shall al-ways maintain that they are among the finest lads I have ever met. He suggested a shorter way home just four miles of more level road, so we arrived home as school was being let out, in time to meet one of the high school girls with a noticeably swollen jaw. Very reluctantly she can back with me, after a solemn promise not to hurt. A TYPICAL WAYSIDE MILL The small children are filled with importance if the need arises for them to see the nurse. Several days ago, while playing, one of the boys had his finger cut ; Miss Ditmars found him with a stocking of uncertain age tied round it and sent him over to the office. It was dressed and he returned to the school, finger prominently displaying the white bandage, and wonder of wonders he returned next day with the bandage still white. I'm afraid some-one else must have provided fire-wood, for that finger was never near the wood-pile that night. After consultation with a number of representative women we decided on a definite fee to be charged: 50c for a home visit and .25c for an office visit. Last month the fees collected amounted to $14.75 so this will help very materially toward the cost of supplies, NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 337 and I was told by one of my committee that the people are very well satisfied with the fees. This last week most of my spare time has been spent over in the school examining the sight and hearing of the children in the primary grades; (at least doing routine work that will save a specialist's time). It is quite a novelty to them, and, far from being afraid, they usually say "niy turn next" a classroom examination of eyes and mouths showed 79% needing attention of some kind teeth, tonsils, etc.; the result of the eye and hearing tests will probably swell this number still more. There is urgent need of a dentist's services, and we are hoping to have one come in for a few days or a week when the roads are passable. The accompanying picture of the "Andrew Ogle house," taken from our porch, will give you some idea of what will eventually be the office. We are hoping to have possession in March, and when the necessary changes are made this ought to be very useful as a central place to which the people can come to see the doctors for we are hoping that in the spring it will be possible to have a doctor here at least one afternoon each week. With a definite schedule this will enable those who wish to see a certain doctor to come his particular afternoon. I cannot say enough for the help and cooperation I have received from the doctors. These are splendid people and it is indeed a privilege to be able to work with them. I feel that they are in no wise different from us an independent, fine people that Uncle Sam has just reason to be proud of. With Mr. Whaley ploughing the fields, Christmas seems rather a long way off, except for the memory of how good the clubs were to us. The boxes were wonderful, and so many, that from the beginning as they piled up in Miss Evelyn's office there was never a doubt of there not being enough to go round. No one was forgotten there were lovely presents for all the children and the little visitors; there were even presents for the teachers and the cottage, and so many nice things for my work. In fact one great big heavy box (I carried it up from the store myself, so I speak feelingly) from Ames, Iowa, club was so full of sheets, towels, etc., that more than a beginning has been" made in the line of such equipment. With papers and old clean pieces of linen scarce, it was a joy to receive a big package of old table-napkins. 338 THE ARROW OF. PI BETA PHI The entertainment was splendid; our only regret was that it. rained so hard that all the parents and friends were not able to come. If you had been with me, one day on a visit, and been shown, with great glee a tiny scrubby tree, very wobbly, but nevertheless planted after a fashion in the back yard, and decorated with an .almanac, the wrapper off a cake of laundry soap, and a few such articles, you would have felt the joy of those same children on seeing the huge Christmas tree in the schoolroom trimmed with tiny colored electric lights, and, nearby, baskets full of presents that every boy and girl whether in the mountain or the city loves to get. The clubs can all be very sure that the time and money spent on those Christmas-boxes have been amply repaid.

If you had been with me, one day on a visit, and been shown, with great glee a tiny scrubby tree, very wobbly, but nevertheless planted after a fashion in the back yard, and decorated with an .almanac, the wrapper off a cake of laundry soap, and a few such articles, you would have felt the joy of those same children on seeing the huge Christmas tree in the schoolroom trimmed with tiny colored electric lights, and, nearby, baskets full of presents that every boy and girl whether in the mountain or the city loves to get. The clubs can all be very sure that the time and money spent on those Christmas-boxes have been amply repaid.
