AT SUGARLANDS THE HAZEL, TODD MEADEN COTTAGE OW *at the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage is prat finished you will want to see some pictures and 17 little something about it. Helen Chew, Ohio A, was the first one to have a visi a center in the Sugarlands, six miles above Gatlinburg. Sh so interested that one summer she taught school there, from Gatlinburg each day, and did it all for just her "1 The people wanted her to teach the county school there i fall but she thought it better to continue here one more yea in the meantime the people would have more time to think it. The next year they came to us with the proposition tha would give two acres of land adjoining the county school p ty if we would put a Pi Phi teacher in the school for four and would build a teacher's cottage on the land. None of things are done in a minute in this land but finally the d( the land was signed and that much settled. The first year Helen Chew and Cora McCarter, one Gatlinburg girls, taught the school and lived in a little cotta people let them have, and which we fixed up so it was really liveable.

Her husband started a fund which has been added to by the Ohio Alphas from year to year. The only stipulation in regard to its use was that Hazel Todd Meaden's name should be perpetuated. The fund has been kept intact, not even the interest used. When the decision was made to build a Teachers' Cottage in the Sugarlands we felt that that was the very place to put that money, especially as an Ohio Alpha was carrying on the work in that center. In our anxiety to make the building come within our means the first plans called for a kitchen, bath room (with plumbing to be put in in later years), and a living room with disappearing bed. This never would have been satisfactOry for a community house so plans were, altered to provide three small bed rooms. Then instead of leaving the rooms open to the rafters we celled them so that an attic was made for storing things and also to pro-vide extra sleeping space if we should need it later on. These things called for extra expense, we had to get water to the house, so one thing after another has made the house cost more than we wanted it to. Not the least of our troubles was the lack of a road. The house stands on quite a rise and the nearest road is one that never was made for a wagon, to say nothing of trucks. No one wanted to bid on the job so finally two of our Gatlinburg men said they would build the house, Mr. Mattil, supervising. Late fall had come be-fore work could be started. The miserable summer road became almost impassable. But in January the girls moved into a nice rock cottage, comfortable and convenient. Miss Chew's old fashion6d cherry furniture she has gotten in the Community has a perfect setting. The county has built a new schoolhouse, and. as you no doubt know, pays two teachers. The state helps with the salary of the third because of the adult work done. The current expenses of maintaining the center are not heavy, The cottage is darling, the girls love it and it will last forever. But take my advice if possible build a house where there is a road and you can use a wagon to get supplies in a flat sled sliding over the boulders and one mule can't haul much of a load and your stock of patience will be exhausted before the work is finished.
