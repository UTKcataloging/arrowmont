        Elisabeth Sawyer Von KleinSmid Word has come of the passing of another great woman and great Pi Phi, distinguished especially in California for fine service to college women. From the News Bureau of the University of Southern California comes an evaluation of her life and work which expresses all we might say, and more ; it was written by Franklin B. Skeele, husband of Violet Stuart Skeele, California Gamma. "A `noble and gracious alumnae of Pi Beta Phi,' Elisabeth Sawyer von KleinSmid, wife of Chancellor Rufus B. von KleinSmid of the University of Southern California, died January 20 at the family residence, 17 Chester Place in Los Angeles, after several years of illness. "Affectionately known as `First Lady of the Campus,' her influence in behalf of the students of the university `will forever endear her to Southern California,' declared Rev. Wendell Miller, pastor of the University Methodist Church, at her services. "Mrs. von KleinSmid was made a member of Iowa Alpha of Pi Beta Phi in 1888, and at Wesleyan University where she was graduated with the Bachelor of Music degree. She kept her interest in sorority life throughout her years and in addition to her many interests at S.C. frequently loaned her home in Chester Place to Pi Phi alumnae and was fre quently honored by the active chapter of California Gamma. Her sister, Mrs. Fletcher Linn of Portland, Oregon is credited with originating the famed `Ring Ching Ching' song. "As Elisabeth Sawyer began her musical career she first entered Wolf Hall of Denver. In addition to degrees from Iowa Wesleyan University she was graduated from the New England Conservatory of Music and the Boston Conservatory of Music, later becoming affiliated with the American College of Musicians in New York City. Prior to entering a brilliant career as a concert pianist and instructor at DePauw University she spent four years abroad studying with masters in Berlin and Vienna. "In 1911 she was married in Portland, Oregon to Professor Rufus B. von KleinSmid who at that time held a chair of philosophy at DePauw University. Together with her husband she spent two years in psychological research work in Indiana, moving with him to Tucson where he served for seven years as President of the University of Arizona. "In 1921 the von KleinSmids came to the University of Southern California and for the past twenty-five years she devoted her activities to campus life. She founded Town and Gown (and was its president for a quarter, of a century) , an organization sponsoring student housing and scholarship. The Elisabeth von KleinSmid Hall, women's dormitory, was named in her honor as were several scholarships. The Town and Gown award is given annually to the most out-standing senior woman. Under her leadership the Foyer building of Town and Gown was constructed as a cultural gathering place for outstanding banquet events. She also joined her husband in establishing the Elisabeth S. and Rufus B. von KleinSmid Libiary of World Affairs. Her affiliations likewise included activities in the campus Y.W.C.A., and the Faculty Wives Club. "To perpetuate her memory, many campus groups as well as alumni and friends have already offered contributions for numerous projects in which Mrs. von KleinSmid was interested. In addition to establishing a memorial lounge. in the new Y.W.C.A. building now being planned: additional scholarships and the von KleinSmid Library of World Affairs are receiving gifts." Of New Members We can ill afford to lose such devoted members, such distinguished women, as these two whom we have honored here. Every chapter in the land has new members and so this is the right time to take stock of those members, and of our responsibility to them. What are we doing to make them Pi Phis of the type of these women? How are we, working to 'develop them, so that perhaps from their ranks may come women of such distinction? Here is food for thought for chapters and advisory boards: "Think on These Things !"
