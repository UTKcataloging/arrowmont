EPORT OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL CHM It MA T HE ONE and only success which is man's to command is to bring to his work a mighty heart." This one item toward success has surely been the basic quality with which the SettleMent School Committee members have met their various responsibilities this past year, and to "the mighty heart" probably goes a major part of the credit for the partial success of some of the achievements which have been hopes and dreams for years. This has been another year of harmonious working by Settlement School Committee members, with each one attending to her individual duties with enthusiasm and ability, and assisting materially in every phase of general committee functioning. Summer Workshop at Success! Paramount among the fulfilled dreams was the actuality of the Summer Workshop, opening June 11 and dosing July 18 a craft course on university level with outstanding artists in their respective fields to lead it. While not the development of the original concept of the artist colony at Gatlinburg, it proved to be a most successful venture in all aspects for which the committee had hoped. With the cooperation of the University of Tennessee, and specifically the interest, enthusiasm, and vision of their Head of the Home Economics Department, Jessie W. Harris, Pi Beta Phi convention initiate of 1938, university credit was given for four courses: weaving, recreational crafts, woodworking, and community recreation. Classes were conducted on a work-shop basis with each individual attending certain prescribed lectures and then branching into creative work of her own choice. Some fifty students from nineteen states, ranging as far away as California, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and New Mexico, were housed in local homes, tourist cabins, and hotels under the direction of our Settlement School Director, Ruth Dyer, and were so enthusiastic that it was only with difficulty that the staff could close the Workshop doors long enough to get to Pollard Cottage for those delicious Settlement School meals, the specialty of Miss Hodgens, House Manager. The personality of the staff and their manner of teaching were such that each student was able to secure help on the individual problems she was most interested in, whether she be a Craft teacher wanting to know the best way to teach handcraft to children in the lower grades, or a Home Demonstration agent desiring to interest women in a variety of crafts for home decoration, or a person not interested in credit but attending only to make beautiful things for the joy of making and the pleasure of using them, or a recreational leader anxious to show a community how best to enjoy themselves through social recreation all this and much more was taught at the Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop at Gatlinburg this summer, combined with a philosophy which encouraged individuality and the flowering of the student's creative ability to its utmost. Small wonder that our advertising for a second session will be aided by the personal praise of these students from this year's classes. Pi Beta Phi's "jewel" the work it has done in Gatlinburg for so many years to aid the mountain people there and to sponsor beautiful handcrafts now glistens with a newbrilliance, for its influence and scope hav( larged in almost untold measure, each stud( as a newly-cut facet, reflecting in her home ( the enthusiasm felt at Gatlinburg, and thanks to Pi Beta Phi and the University o. for making this opportunity possible. Much of the success for this venture was Director and weaving instructor, Eha Ulbri organizing abilities were responsible for a varied craft school, utilizing the faciliti high school and Craft department, and addii most generous loans from the Milwaul Project, developed by Miss Ulbricht in re, Pi Beta Phi's sincerest thanks go to her co-workers, Josephine Arnquist Bakke, thoroughly understood and carried out tt recreational program envisioned by us, G ford, talented artist and woodworker "Woodshed" in the Arts and Crafts Cente of machinery was always heard, and Hazel teacher of recreational crafts, who had to ten to twelve students on entirely differe at the same time from leather gloves, thr^ prints, to plastics. Plans are already under way for anotl next year. This will follow much the saJ as proved so successful in this first Woi it will be well for all interested Pi Beta 1 reservations in early for 1946 as, in all it will be necessary to limit enrollment. Additions to the School Curriculum Two other goals were achieved this pas lesser degree perhaps, and with similar cc to the original plan, but with good resultsing of physical education by an additiona teacher, Lon Moneyhun, and the second si elusion of music in the curriculum, wit McWilliams Young, Pi Beta Phi of Ohic vising music with regular periods in each teaching a chorus of high school students. that both of these additions to the scho continued in the future, and if possible, el The County-Pi Beta Phi agreement has satisfactory as in the preceding year. We approximately the same support of th budget, and added to our assistance in the teachers, paying all costs of the music tea( semester, the part-time physical education t the Arts and Crafts department, consists former full-time teacher, Elizabeth Petrie, a part-time teacher, Mr. Carl Huskey, in ing. The county continued to use the gr building as well as the high school, takii step towards the erection of their own gi building by asking the state school archit Gatlinburg and see the proposed site in for drafting the first plans. Enrollment was again heavy in the lo-and the County secured an additional gi teacher, to be continued this coming year enrollment in the grades reached 328, teachers provided by county funds. The 1C the high school were taught by five teachers, augmented by those furnished by ] A full-time janitor has been employed by 37 38 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW who, this summer, has been doing the necessary paint and repair work in the high school building and keeping the school lawn and playground mowed. Pi Beta Phi used part of the high school building for the summer workshop, providing the necessary janitorial service during that period. Several resignations among the staff this spring have been filled with the only vacancy at the present time in the first grade room. The position of music supervisor has not yet been filled by Pi Beta Phi. The PTA was revived this past year, joining the state and national associations. They were responsible for carrying out a most successful hot lunch program, assisted by the county who donated paint and materials for redecorating the room, and by Pi Beta Phi, who built a new entrance to the room which fulfilled the state regulations for fire exits of dining-rooms. During the fall visit of the chairman, Pi Beta Phi's gift to the school, the lovely stage curtain and cyclorama, was officially dedicated. At a well-planned evening program including musical numbers by grade and high school students, acceptance thank-yous were given by students and a representative of the community, 'Mr. Medlin. This seemed to serve as a splendid opportunity for stressing the cooperation between Pi Beta Phi and the community in this Settlement School program. Emma Harper Turner Craft Center Dedication Two open houses were given during the Summer Workshop one at the end of each three-week period. Students worked on actual projects, explaining the process to the many interested tourists and towns-people who attended. At the second of these, on July 16, a short outdoor program preceded the tour of the workshop, presided over by Emma Woerner, Committee member, and during which a pantomime was presented by the Community Recreation class and the Arts and Crafts building was dedicated by Miss Amy Onken, Grand President, as the Emma Harper Turner Crafts Center, a beautifully carved wooden sign made by George Barford being placed on the building at that time. Here in the Crafts Center this past year was developed an enlarged program for grade and high school students which, according to Miss Petrie's repOrt, "was successful both in pleasure and in the knowledge gained." High school girls worked at a variety of crafts, but weaving retained first place in their interest and some really splendid articles were made. Boys worked under Carl Huskey making attractive small wooden articles and even completing four table looms for use in the Summer Workshop. They will make more of these this coming year so that each grade room may have one for demonstration and practice. Art work in the grades showed marked improvement over the preceding year, which as you remember was the first year this had been offered in the school. The members of Committee were interested in an exhibit of some of the work done, ranging from the simple designs made by first grade children by arrangjng and pasting cut pieces of colored paper, to the original posters and masks made in the upper' grades. The same goal continued this year that of making things which could be duplicated at home with little expense so that this new ability might be utilized in the home life of the students. Rationing at Arrowcraft' While the joyous news of V-J Day's approach makes us hopeful that there will soon be relief evenfor our much-troubled but ever-capable manager of Arrowcraft, Ethel Snow, it is going to be necessary to "ration" articles sent to the alumnae clubs this coming fall. Even with Arrowcraft producing far more than ever before, though it has often been necessary to discontinue certain items because of lack of materials, impossibility of producing under the OPA ceiling, or a similar wartime cause, production has been unable to keep up with the greatly increased demands. Arrowcraft Shop itself cannot keep a large enough supply on hand to meet the requests of the buying tourist trade there, Every effort will be made on the part of the Pi Beta Phi staff to see that as many clubs are served with as large a percentage of their orders as is possible; cheerful acceptance of this situation is the contribution we of the alumna clubs must make until such time as conditions change. Regular Staff Personnel The regular staff at the Settlement School has remained the same this past year. Miss Ruth Dyer, Director, continues to direct the thousand and one activities that such an establishment includes, and keeps the School as a whole functioning miraculously well during these times when it is so difficult to secure adequate or qualified help. Under her super-vision, and oft-times with the assistance of our maintenance man, Arlie Watson, repairs authorized by the committee have been made, including the addition of a partition between the front and back rooms at the Arts and Crafts Center, a double door at the back to allow easy moving of looms, roof repairs of the barn and sheds, repair of gates and some rebuilding of fences, necessary minor repairs and painting. No major building was done this past year, although plans are now being started for a new Health Center building. Lean Hodgins, House Manager, has added to her regular duties the chaperoning of the girl's dormitory. Carl Ogle and Elvin Trentham have continued their care of the demonstration farm during this period without an Agriculture teacher. Arrowcraft Shop added two salesgirls, Arbutus Ogle and Lois Watson, to the former staff consisting of Ethel Snow, Winogene Redding, Lura Owenby, and Bess Chance; and Georgia Duffield continues in charge of the Mountain View Hotel shop. Health Center is the busy domain of the nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, whose full report is included in this issue, in spite of the fact that the building itself demands almost immediate replacement. This, we hope, will be possible in the near future. "The Mighty Hearts" The Settlement School Committee personnel, also, has remained the same this year as last. Secretary Ann Munn, also Contact Member for Arts and Crafts, visited the school in the spring to see the craft classes in operation and to assist with the detailed planning for the summer session. Conferences were held with staff members of the University of Tennessee, and with Miss Ulbricht, then in Milwaukee. Mrs. Munn also attended meetings of the Mountain Workers and the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild in Montreat, at the latter of which plans were made for the incorporation of the Guild as a non-profit organization. Arrowcraft has been an integral part of the Guild since its founding and it was fitting that it was during the presidency of our Weaving Supervisor, Winogene Redding, that this step was taken, and by virtue thereof became the recipients of a three year grant from the General Education Board THE SEPTEMBER ARROW which will aid in furthering the development of handcrafts in the entire Southern Highland area. Beth LeRoy, publicity member on Committee, continued her interesting monthly letters to province vice-presidents and sent a most enlightening and entertaining letter to all active chapter and alumnae clubs, describing a visit to the School, arranged so that it could be used as a basis for talks given in conjunction with the place mat maps. We shall miss Beth on the Committee, for her term expired at this last meeting time; we shall miss her enthusiasm, her love of Settlement School work, and her building spirits. We welcomed Eugenia Smith (Mrs. G. Herbert), as new Committee member, member of Indiana r, who brings a rich heritage of Pi Beta Phi experiences, most recent of which was the installation of the new chapter on the campus of Willamette University, where her husband is president. Lolita Prouty, treasurer, has continued to meet difficult days with the bother of withholding taxes, Social Security, and other regulations and reports now imposed on anyone taking charge of accounts; but her fine attention to all details have given us accurate and complete reports regularly. Emma Woerner has been busy keeping engagements Community FOGRESS is the law of life." Pi Beta Phi is living up to its past achievements in bringing to Gatlin-burg, in conjunction with the University of Tennessee, a Summer Workshop in Crafts. We look forward to almost endless possibilities to be derived from this new program in wonderful development for the school and the whole region. Changes in village life are taking place. Perhaps the one most far reaching in its scope is the incorporation of the village, voted in the spring. Better sanitation and law enforcement will certainly result from this step. Pi Beta Phi will have some say in town affairs since we now have two representatives, Miss Evelyn Bishop and Mrs. Ethel Snow, on the Chamber of Commerce Board. During the winter a Lion's Club was organized and the American Legion members living in town withdrew from the Sevierville Post to start one of their own. The Methodist congregation have been given a site for a church building which will be built as soon as conditions permit. One Sunday this congregation and the one from Pigeon Forge used our Auditorium for morning service when Bishop Kern spoke. School Sevier County has cooperated well with us this past year. They have provided a janitor, now on a twelve months' basis. While certain repairs have not been made to the buildings .the fault lies not with the wish of the county board but with war time shortages of materials and labor. Greater interest in school activities has been evidenced all year in the crowds attending any and all functions connected with the school program. Basket-ball crowds made us long for a larger gym. The plays given by the senior and junior classes, the big Halloween Carnival, the Open House evening, the program given by the elementary school children and the graduation exercises for both the eighth grade and the high school were all well attended by parents and friends of the school. These various entertainments were of the same high quality as those given for her films, and some twenty chapters and c: had their inspiration this past year. Charact comments received from alumnae clubs is ing: "The films (of the Settlement Schoc greatly enjoyed, in fact, I think I am safe they made the hit of the year at our alue meeting. The photography is beautiful, and immensely more interesting than any previl taken of the Settlement School, everyone agrc "Every club should see them." This has not been a year without some t tribulations, but we cannot expect to ever otherwise in such a project; yet even with has been a successful year for the Settlemen There are still numerous small problems the including that of getting every thing done i be done without increasing the cost of up1 have a good loyal staff, and they are doi to help us with our plans; with them and fine Settlement School Committee and Grant all with that "mighty heart" to make thin while, we cannot help but succeed. Respectfully submitted, MILDREI REPORT OF DIRECTOR in the past. One big contributing factor to the has been the new stage curtains and cycle stalled last fall. These make it possible to proper background, add dignity and have t. influence on the deportment of the children. Sale was here for a Dedicatory Program in At that time she gave a very fine talk on Pi for the future of the school. For the last few months of the term ti had music instruction given by a charming Dorothy McWilliams Young of Ohio A chs did wonders with the children in the short she was here. Her work was of much vale teachers in preparation for their programs a to the commencement activities. The girls in the different Home Economic under Sue Landrum, worked on some iJ projects. A High School Home Economics organized.

A dramatic club was organized by th( teacher, Miss Lois Fenn. They gave a deligl gram of choral readings at the Christina program. They also presented a clever one at the Open House. This was repeated at church night of the Methodists. Twenty six children finished the eighth j 40 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW twelve graduated from the high school. Through aid given by us in transportation, eleven children from Elkmont were enrolled in our lower grades. PTA cooperation with the school program has been especially fine all year. Their main project was serving a hot meal at noon to the children in the elementary school. Government aid made it possible to serve one hot dish, with milk, for ten cents a day per child. It was necessary to clean up the old basement room and to buy a new stove. Pi Phi helped with the repair and a big rummage sale plus individual contributions provided the needed equipment. Different mothers helped to make the project a success. At the Commencement Exercises Mrs. J. Donahoe, president of PTA, presented four awards of five dollars each to the student in each class who had shown the most improvement in their studies during the year. For the first time this organization affiliated with the national organization. Farm With food shortages in so many places we are fortunate to be able to produce so much of the necessary food for our school family and to have a surplus to sell. The milk, cream, eggs, chickens, honey, vegetables, blackberries that grow on our own hill-sides, strawberries from our own bed, apples from the orchard help to supply our table with the finest of food. Weekly sales of eggs and all the fryers we could spare to the Mountain View Hotel, the sale of sixteen young pigs and surplus vegetables have added cash, much needed to offset the high feed costs. All departments of the farm will show a small profit this year. We were able to grow enough hay for the live-stock. The mules have done their bit in helping many a person with garden plowing or extra farm work. They have earned over $150.00 for us by this service. We sold one of our old Jersey cows and replaced her with a good grade cow, half Jersey and half Holstein. This cow will be sold after our three fine pure bred jersey heifers begin to produce. The gates on the place were old and in need of replacement. This was done in the bad weather in the winter. As much fence was built as could be done with the help that we had. The barn roof was reshingled. Dormitory For the most of the year we had seven girls and three boys in the school family. It is worth while to note the changes that take place in the individual students during nine months of living in our dormitories. They gain poise and confidence in themselves, their personal appearance changes for the better and they usually gain in weight. One boy gained twenty five pounds this past nine months. Much credit is due Miss Hodgen for the very fine way in which she trains the girls in their housekeeping duties. They are in demand as waitresses. Probably due to the fact that there is more money in the community than ever before, more of the students are meeting their financial obligations to the school. One former Dormitory boy, looking very smart in his uniform with overseas ribbons, came and settled an old bill that had been running for two years. A girl who graduated last year and has since been working in a defense plant, sent a check for $86.25 to cover her entire bill. Her appreciation to Pi Beta Phi was expressed thus "If it were possible money could not buy the many helpful things I learned at the School. Many thanks to the Dormitory, School and congenial instructors." Several times during the semester the girls haveplanned parties to which other high school students and boys home on leave were invited. All the young people seem to love to come to Stewart Cottage. The girls plan the decorations, games and refreshments, often bringing sugar from home to make the cakes and cookies that they serve. Health Center The Pi Phi nurse has such varied duties that words seem inadequate to report them. She visits the homes where there is illness; gives advice and help in maternity and infant welfare; inspects regularly the children of our school and other surrounding ones; gives the necessary inoculations; treats injuries not serious enough for a doctor's care; conducts classes in Home Nursing and First Aid; takes patients in town to the different hospitals, has a regular clinic day and even helps the tourists in such emergencies as heart attacks and acute sunburn. In the elementary school the children were weighed and talks on nutrition given at the beginning of the school lunch program. Charts were made for each room. Both children and parents were interested in progress made and recorded as the program developed. Mrs. Chalmers had a nice honor come to her in that she was chosen as the representative from Sevier County to attend a short course in the treatment of the after effects of. Infantile Paralysis at Warm Springs, Georgia. This course was sponsored by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. Several generous gifts have been made to further the health program. The Dallas Evening group sent boxes of needed surgical dressings. Through Beth LeRoy a Chase doll was secured for demonstration purposes. Sigma Phi Gamma again sent $50.00 which was used for eye correction work and to purchase glasses for needy children. The largest gift of all, $200.00 from the Chicago North Alumnae Club, is awaiting the time when certain equipment may be purchased. Arrowcraft We still have what economists call a Seller's Market. This makes the yearly report of our shop quite a different story from the ones in the years in which we were trying to establish a market and urging all the clubs to help sell our products. Now, production cannot keep up with the demand, Ethel Snow has had to refuse to sell anything to the many small dealers who helped out by selling Arrowcraft products in the lean years. Both of the Southern Highlands Inc: Shops, one in Radio City and the other at Norris Dam, Tennessee or the Shop of the Southern High-land Handicraft Guild in Asheville could have taken our full output. Instead they have been rationed in order to keep goods to sell to the people who come direct to the shop and to send to our alumnie clubs. The gross sales for eleven months of the year came to an all time high of $85,093.67, This is $16,387.93 more than the total for last year. This clearly proves that in spite of war" time restrictions, shortages in materials and labor that our humble beginnings have blossomed into a real business. The many club chair-men have helped to swell these totals. Eight clubs have sold over one thousand dollars worth of Arrow-craft goods. These are, Kansas City, Missouri, Port-land, Oregon, Champaign, Illinois, San Francisco, Berkeley, Denver, Franklin, Indiana, and Milwaukee. Ten other clubs have sales above $700.00. These are Dallas, Tulsa, Boston plus LeRoy, Albany, St. Louis, Cleveland, Marin County, California, Lafayette, Indiana, Madison and Manhattan, Kansas. It should be remembered that these figures do not paint a true THE SEPTEMBER ARROW picture for some clubs would have sold much more if they could have obtained the goods. Will we have to follow Government practices and work out a ration system so that all may share alike? The shop is still the most attractive one in the village, one that every Pi Phi can be proud of, knowing that it represents the fraternity to the tourists and stands for the things we have done to improve the economic life of our coiner of the Southern Highland Area. Conclusion Every day we are reminded of the intere loyal Pi Phis all over the country are taking project. Their gifts, so carefully packed, bring p and profit to many of the individuals we are to help. I wish to express my gratitude to the especially to Council and Committee for their hl consideration at all times. Respectfully submitted, RUTH I OWC AFT W EBSTER says a report is "to give an account of" but I am sure that would be repetition as that is given each month in Ruth Dyer's letter and other sources. Instead I am writing down some of the problems that come up during the year knowing there should be a solution that I have not found so far. The War Years have been hard for us too but it has done one good thing for Arrowcraft, proven that it is not necessary for the Clubs to send back quantities of goods. By keeping the quality good we should never have to go back to that. To encourage sales we have given the Clubs many privileges that no business firm would countenance. We can not begin to send them all they are going to want this year so I think it is the time to get on a still firmer foundation. Why should it not be a requirement that in order for a province to be 100% all bills to Arrowcraft must have been paid. Each year brings at least one headache over an account that has run on for a number of years, this year there have been two such. If there was that yearly accounting it would automatically bring anything wrong to the attention of the Province Officer and the Club itself. We used to preach early orders but by that was meant September and early October and not all in November and December. More people are expected to visit Gatlinburg in the years to come than ever before. There is not much point in having the lovely shop if we do not sell to these people. But that simply can not be done if we start saving for the Clubs in May. I have already had many inquiries. My manual reads "a letter to the Clubs in September telling about prospective things and including a new price list with thanks for what they have done." I have written it much earlier the past years to save myself so many personal letters. As you know it is not possible to be sure of all the things lasting through shipping that go on the price list in July. This year I am not sure of any thing so how can I tell them I will send large quantities of goods at a certain time. It is not fair to the small Clubs who also want small sales, big in their eyes, to send thirty six to fifty baby blankets to one Club. That might be the last thirty six the way things look right now. Rationing may come late to Arrowcraft but it looks as if it may be the fair thing to do. I have tried to be fair but it is the ones whoare most demanding that are the least underst It helps however to get bits like this from a chairman "I continue to be amazed at the gra you've been able to do with all the Iimitati, know exists." Most clubs do not get started again befog tember so as far as big sales are concernec should be an understanding that none can b until after that and that it is not possible tl in May and expect us to put the things away disappointment of summer trade and many sin orders. Allanstand and Southern Highlanders In been rationed this year. These days they could entire output and are glad to take it any time the year.

REPORT OF THE JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HEALTF CENTER MAX 1944 MAY 1945 WENTY-FIVE years ago, during the season of T 1919-20, a "visiting nurses for the community" was engaged by the Settlement School Committee. By patience and understanding, confidence was established. The district of service was .purposely keptsmall, for travel by horseback was slow, as trips cut down sharply on the amount of w person could do. The eight years that Miss stayed at the Health Center, set the pattern years that followed.

And reading the reports cars, one sees growth, slowly, but steadily. ons are giving way to knowledge, and the ways are modified and integrated with the nit Charity says, "Life wags on, sortie like '' at the Health Center.

"Books take up" in the autumn, .ush of little feet is again heard on the path o the hospital.

Our knowledge of A disease is still too limited to spurn any ity that might be beneficial to the corn-The course will come just at the beginning rw fiscal year, and we sincerely hope that it ve to be a good insurance against possibletrouble, rather than needed aid. Classes in Home Nursing for adults did not work out as we had hoped. Scarcity of Mother's helpers, and the press of war time living prevented regular group meetings for such a period. Nevertheless, two sets of classes were taught, one at Pi Beta Phi, and the other at Sevier County High School. Both groups were Home Economics classes, and were taught with the assistance of the Home Economics teachers. Certificates have been issued by the Red Cross, and some of the girls. have already been accepted into the Cadet Nurse Corps. Melinda Ogle Wadley, whose entire life has been spent in Gatlin-burg, will be graduated soon from a hospital in Memphis the first of our girls to complete nurses training. One of the most interesting events of the school year was the running of the Lunch Room. The excitement of remodeling and redecorating aroused interest to a high pitch. The day lunch was served for the first time, every child in the elementary school was weighed and measured. Charts were made for each room, showing each child's standing average, over or under weight. Three months later, when the Lunch Room closed, every child was rechecked and the results tabulated. Present for the entire test were 223 children. Of that number, 163 had gained a total of 428 lbs. from 1/2 to 9 lbs.. apiece. 107 had grown taller, from 1/4 to 13% inches. 26 had lost and 18 showed no change. In January, 51 were underweight. In April, 20 had gained up to or beyond their average, and 18 of the rest were gaining. The period of testing was short, and a child's weight varies quickly with illness, lack of sleep, or overactivity. So the results seem very satisfactory. Two children are now under treatment of an Orthopedic Surgeon for the correction of club feet. Both are wearing special shoes held in rigid position by metal rods. The three months old baby is nearly normal, and the other is improving. Margaret .was corrected when she was tiny, but the braced shoes were not worn long enough. Four years old is Margaret almost too old to make things right without surgery. Yes, life wags on "sortie like common" at the Health Center. The days are very full and very interesting. We are grateful for our friends here and all over the country, in the profession and out of it. There are so many of them, and together, we are making life a little easier, a little safer for each other. Following are the figures for the past year, and for the preceding period: Class of.

It really is something to be able to say that I have served Pi Beta Phi longer than any other person in the history of the Settlement School and I am not a Pi Phi. That fact has not kept me from giving to the school and the community my interest, my service, nor my loyalty through the years. Out of the twenty that have passed all too quickly, I have been employed at the Settlement School for 16 years. This has been in three periods, the last one being the longest 10 years this July. When I first came to Gatlinburg in September 1925 after a very hot and dusty ride over the new road that reached just to the front gate, I can re-member that the first thing I wanted was a bath with lots of water; but Gatlinburg was in the midst oft, a drought and as the electricity was made by a little come and go plant on the river in which there was not enough water to make it and consequently our pump run, I had to be satisfied with as little water as decency and the need required. We didn't have lights much either, nor any way to have refrigeration to keep meat, so not much meat was on our menu, nor any telephone. That did not come for many years after that time. But I did have a cordial welcome from all hands on the staff. Aunt Lizzie Reagan cooked for us then, those of us who lived at Teachers' Cottage, and kept us well in hand. Life was not unpleasant even without much electricity, telephone and radio. Gatlinburg wasn't much in those days. There was Charlie Ogle's store, the Squire's house and Jim Reagan's "Swinkey" where we could get ice cream in our immediate range of vision. The Mountain View. Hotel was just a little green frame building with a few rooms for guests and the Riverside Hotel had even less room. Hardy souls came to Gatlinburg for vacations in those days. I can remember three cars in town, Miss Evelyn's, 0. J. Mattil's and the Huff boys, those constant ,squires to the young teachers in the early days. Both of them later married Pi Phis. Then the cows roamed everywhere, sometimes it seemed as if there were profusions of cows. We were forever chasing our neighbors' mules out of our front yard as well as his chickens. The town could not boast of a lawn mower, baby carriage, church every Sunday, coal or electric stove, and only the Teachers' Cottage had both a bathroom and furnace. Otherwise modern plumbing was practically non-existent. When we wanted fun we made it ourselves, or went on a real binge and spent the week-end in Knoxville. Now and then there were flickering movies given in the top of the then new barn with the audience seated on bales of hay and sound effects provided by the cows, goats, and horses housed below. Power for the movies was made by hooking onto the motor of the venerable old Ford Station Wagon that was the special responsibility of Shot Reagan Shot who was to give his life for his country in this war. Trips to the Teachers' Cottage in the Sugarlands were planned with thoroughness and foresight for a ride up there by horseback or in a car that could hopfrom boulder to boulder was an event not to be taken lightly. In contrast to this picture of a sleepy little mountain village is our bustling tourist town, the Gatlin-burg of today, that adjoins the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I can count only 27 houses in the entire town that were being lived in in 1925 and are still occupied twenty years later. Everything else in the town has been built in the intervening years, most of it since 1932. Now our permanent population is about 1600 and there are hotel and cabin accommodations for three times that many, which are filled to capacity during the summer. We have a telephone exchange, public library, post office, four churches, a four-lane highway with sidewalks; and this year the town incorporated. The county runs the school now, with an attendance of 425 pupils quite a growth from the original 13 of the first Pi Beta Phi school. The first household convenience my weavers "wove out" after electricity was brought in from the outside was an electric iron, with washing ma-chines and bathrooms following. Now to go back to my story. After the effects from my trip down wore off, I asked Miss Evelyn what I was to do. Her reply was a masterpiece of understatement but I have never forgotten it, nor failed to appreciate the wisdom behind it. She said I was to teach weaving. My next question was "how and to whom" and she left me to my own devices when she said I was to find my job and make it. It was either sink or swim from then on. I chose swimming and the results will have to speak for themselves. Miss Phyllis helped me out with another bit of sage advice when in reply to my question "of what to talk about to these strange mountain women, she replied, "Flowers." The subject of flowers was my conversational backlog for many months to come. My first call in the community was to the home of Lulu Mae Ogle to see her mother who wove cover-lets. She was the oldest weaver in these parts and was a rich source for much interesting mountain history. She passed on her art of coverlet weaving to her daughter who now makes all our beautiful coverlets. I also made the acquaintance of my first mountain baby ' and a cute one he was, Van Ogle, who now rides in bombers. Of those first 8 or 10 weavers I found in the next few weeks, 2 of them are still making things for Arrowcraft. Shortly after this Nita Stark came in for her semi-annual Committee visit and there were many discussions about where my weaving apparatus and I were to be located. The looms were then in the old log cabin which did not provide sufficient resistance to the elements, so we decided, and proper space just did not seem to be available. Finally someone had a bright idea! Move the laundry from under the porch of the oTd Stuart Cottage and put me in there. No sooner said than done and I was moved in with 7 old looms; warping bars and a box or two in which to keep some supplies. Heat was supplied by a little old wood stove with the pipe stuck out a' window. We managed pretty well up there for the next three years until we moved again into the new high school building with lots and lots of room (now the 8th grade manages to squeeze into the same space). My greatest problem during those years was whether or not I would acquire a permanent stoop THE SEPTEMBER ARROW am very tall and the porch was very low rs lower than the floor above. My journeys end to the other were a bobbing sort of and between those rafters. There was no a table or desk so I carried all my records arm and my office was everywhere I hap-;it down. weaving had been done before I arrived on Not much, though, but still enough for ve a few women who were interested in ow to make ,new things. Our entire stock on the shelf in back of the door in what [iss Dyer's room. In a few months we hat space and had to put the towels and eon sets (nothing but blue or red borders) shelves in Miss Evelyn's office. I taught o the eighth grade girls and I never had a more interesting class than that first one of 't long before I began to see possibilities. e beginning to talk about a National Park -ea and if that came we could see where ple would come to this region. Lois Rogers, lylor, Miss Evelyn and I had long sessions [rig about it knowing full well that if it we were sitting in the midst of opporwas during the winter of 1926 that Arrow-born and I helped name the baby. Lois and Ln the shop that first summer up in the ttage with a preponderance of baskets in father, who happened to be visiting me le, made the first official sale from the new L wooden salad fork and spoon. After that vcraft Shop moved to whatever space was e at the time from Stuart Cottage to the )m and porch of Teachers cottage and tuart Cottage, then finally into the building the road that was made of the old schoolth a new room added on the back.

What few weavers we lived distances from the school that were by rocky or muddy roads, depending on a, way up beyond the old Baskins school-id gradually as more women learned to )r the school," up into the Sugarlands. That I walked and walked, sometimes as much es a week to reach the women who wanted weaving. It took constant supervision to standards. Not only did I teach them how but how to hem, wash and iron and made lize that people actually used the articles e. The next year I decided to save myself walking so I ,rode a horse to the most )mes. The roads I went on were impassable itomobile, even if there had been an auto-: was not until 1928 that I did start to drive y that time there were more and more nd less and less time to make the rounds. in 1927 that I decided that part of my job to bring something beyond just weaving lives of the women with whom I was work-making friends. My first attempt at social a tea given at the Teachers' Cottage one ternoon. It was the only time we ever served Lountain women, coffee drinkers that they are. They were good sports and drank it though. One old woman said, "Law, if we're goin' to eat, I'll have to spit out my backy" and she did out the front door. From that small beginning grew our weaving meetings of later years, meetings to which the women looked forward from month to month. Through the years a variety of subjects and speakers have been brought to the women, from butter making to picture painting, from chicken raising to piano playing. We had Christmas parties with Christmas trees and presents, tacky parties, dinner at the hotel, picnics, and once a big banquet with all the fixings. There is no doubt in my mind that these varied educational and recreational programs have made our weavers broader in vision and background than those who have not had an opportunity to attend. They have been systematically exposed to University Extension lecturers, preachers, artists, and anyone else who could bring a message on some subject with which they were not familiar. In the fall of 1932 the group organized into the Gatlinburg Weavers Guild. This was always an in-formal set-up but the women felt from that time on that they were a definite unit and they started to sponsor community projects. The first one was the Wayside Market which had some measure of success for two years in selling farm produce at their stand on the main highway. The group next started the Gatlin-burg Garden Club in 1936. Until the war and Red Cross work took up the time of the women of the town, the Garden Club conducted a flourishing pro-gram. They were instrumental in having the State Highway Department plant the dogwood trees along the highway through the town, they planted and still maintain the little park opposite the Arrowcraft Shop and they cleaned off and keep in order the island in the river. They had several flower shows that before their discontinuance gained a wide reputation in East Tennessee. The activities of the Club have been suspended until times are again normal. The next project of the Weavers Guild was "play-acting." A desire for some money in their treasury prompted their play writing and acting. They gave four plays in all over a period of six years. The last one "Store Britches" which was written and acted by the weavers and members of their families, ran for three highly successful summer seasons. Tourists and townspeople alike enjoyed the fun and the old-timey mountain story. The money they made has been used by the weavers for a self-help fund from which they can borrow for medical attention and family emergencies. As much as $250 has been loaned at one time to different women. They have taken trips with expenses paid from the fund, the high-light being a trip to Norris Dam where many of them saw their first motor boat and had their first ride in one. They have made donations to the Red Cross and local charities from it and have helped some of their less fortunate members with gifts in periods of stress. When gas rationing . started our meetings were limited to one every two or three months. Perhaps at this point it would be interesting to go back and include some selections from my old yearly reports. They give an idea of the progress of the weaving department from year to year. In May 1926, I wrote, "The weaving situation in Gatlinburg is gradually but steadily growing into a commercial project of great economic value to the women in their homes. Just how extensive the development is to become depends upon the amount of weaving the school can and will handle. Our greatest problem THE SEPTEMBER ARROW .45 is that of supply and demand. The women can weave more than we are selling at the present time. It would be a great help to know just how extensive the , Committee wishes this department to be. There is room for growth and development." In May 1927 this came along. "As I look back upon this year's work in comparison with that of last year, I find that my problems of conducting the weaving department have changed a great deal. The greatest reason for this has been the amazing growth of sales of the weaving due to a greater interest shown by the Alumnae Clubs and to the Arrowcraft Shop which has been the only solution to the large tourist trade that has come to Gatlinburg for five spring and summer months. We were shipping a truck load of baskets and a dozen or so packages of weaving every day for two months before Christmas. The school handles the entire output of 41 looms. This does not include any of the looms that supply weaving for the three weaving shops that have started in Gatlinburg the past year." Then in May, 1928, "In looking over another year's development of the weaving department, it is interesting to note changes that have come through the increased commercial demands. There has been about a 33% increase in the business which has meant more organization among the women. There have been 40 women weaving for us during the year. The plan of selling materials to the women has kept our weaving of uniform quality. This amount of weaving can be increased many times as there are more women pleading for weaving than we can supply." My report of May 1929 is amusing in the light of subsequent events. I said, "This year I feel as if something definite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal has been reached than it is a condition that can be expiessed in so many words. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instructions. They are becoming experts in the mechanics of weaving. I have tried to . spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school this fall making a total of 50 weavers this year. This work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else." I did leave and Victoria Strand took over for the next 2 years. When she did not return in the fall of 1931, Miss Evelyn asked me to come back again. I was happy to do so. This was in the midst of the depression and in June 1932 I wrote, "In spite of the fact that all the weaving centers of the South have been turning off their weavers for the past year, we have had our usual number of women working for us. It is not easy to make hand-woven articles that will sell at a price that one considers inexpensive but that is the trend of the times. There have been 46 women weaving for the school this year with never less than 38 weaving at one time. Thirty new articles have been designed. This has required an almost complete turn-over of the stock but we hope that by offering a new line of articles to the Clubs this fall our trade will be stimulated." Then in June 1933 I wrote, "This has been a year of ups and downs for the weaving department. In November and December we had more weavers working than at any time since I first came here 8 years ago, then in January to March we had less weaversat work than when I started with the old faithful six or seven women. When the Bank in Sevierville closed in January we had to curtail our weaving pro-gram. In order not to weave beyond our income, it has been necessary to keep down the number of women weaving and yet keep a safe balance between the weaving in stock at the Shop and that being made by the women. We have tried to meet this situation by giving a short warp to two women instead of one long warp to one woman." With the general recovery from the depression, Arrowcraft and the weaving department had another boom. I stayed with it until Christmas of 1934 when again I left, this time for good so I thought. Miss Carr and then Mrs. Mitchell carried on the department until June 1935. Then Mrs. Weaver persuaded me to return once again so I came back to the same old job in a brand new place. This last 10 year period from June 1935 to June 1945 has been one of steady progress upward. It was with our move into the Voorheis Building in 1935 that the weaving department came into its own and no matter where it goes in the future, never will the weavers feel so at home nor as if they had a place all their own as they did during the five years we stayed in that building. It gave us the opportunity to have our meetings and all our many social activities in our own building and the women, as well as myself, loved it. I doubt if they will ever again feel as much a part of the school as they did during those years. We had the facilities for serving refreshments at the meetings and could do many extra things that have not, since been possible. They "wove for the school" as much for the activities we carried on as a group as they did for the money they earned. Each year they earned more and more money as the weaving demand kept increasing and we had to keep raising their pay to comply with the demands of the Wage and Hour Law. Although the average earnings at the present are lower than this, it is not unusual for a weaver to earn from $60 to $75 a month in her spare time at home. That represents a lot of weaving but one must remember that these women are very experienced and very fast. With the move from the Voorheis Building to the new Arrowcraft Shop building in 1940, the department became more streamlined as the business kept increasing from a slow pace when the war started to a skyrocketing period during the war when consumer goods were scarce and money plentiful. As I write this in May 1945, we are not meeting by half the possibilities for business that would be ours if we had the facilities, the weavers and the materials with which to meet it. It was necessary as time went on and the women were more busy at home when their men went to war, to drop all the extra activities that we had enjoyed so much during the preceding years. Figures are always interesting in a report so here are a few. In the ten years from June 1935 to June 1945, we have had a total of 242 women weave for us. Two of these have died. Of this total 138 wove for us last year, the greatest number in our history. We keep between 80 and 90 women weaving all the time. As women drop out we try to' fill their places with other women who already know how to weave. There is no time now to teach weaving to inexperienced women. The weavers have had 104 babies during this period including two sets of twins. This one fact has meant the loss of much time from their weaving as one of our rules requires that no woman can weave two months before or after the birth of a .baby, and only then with the permission of her 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW doctor, and most of the women take off more time than that. At one time four generations of Aunt ,Lizzie Reagan's family were weaving for us including Aunt Lizzie at the age of 85 years. Since the war started 29 weavers have had their husbands and 43 of their children enter the armed forces, one has been killed in action. One weaver had five children in service at the same time. Along in the early thirties we started the practise of supplying all the materials to the weavers and paying them for their labor by the piece. In 1939 we paid them $11,187.79 and for the 11 months just ending we have paid them $24,721.47. Our weaving has increased 105% in the past two years alone. Last year we wove 21,630 luncheon doilies and 17,621 luncheon napkins, 2,108 neck scarfs, 1482 square scarfs, 4202 bibs and 1085 baby blankets. Since 1935 we have women 26,287 underarm bags, 6011 last year alone and I am being conservative in saying we are hundreds behind on our orders. It is impossible to find weavers and materials for more than we are doing, In the last ten years I have designed 246 different woven articles in hundreds of color combinations. In the past seven years we have paid the weavers $109,417.18 for their work. Pi Beta Phi has reason to be proud of this record and I am proud to have had' a part in it with my women. This past year might well be called "Passing Previous Peaks." All of our records have been broken. There have been more weavers, more weaving made .and more money earned by the, weavers than ever before in our history. Our inventory of weaving supplies has had to be our largest in order to take advantage of buying materials when they were avail-able. In spite of planning at least 6 months ahead shortages of necessary materials have occurred. With both cotton and wool frozen for the first six months of 1945, it has been more difficult to operate. Fortunately I had placed large orders before the freeze went into effect and they were delivered in time to keep us going except for a period through the winter when our supply of wool was practically gone. By substituting odd lots of materials that I was able to buy and redesigning a few articles in order to use them, we have kept up as well as possible under the circumstances. It helped a great deal not to take the December inventory of weaving supplies. The weavers were very glad not to stop weaving for a month in the middle of the winter and it meant that we could build up our stock more than usual after the very heavy shipping season before Christmas. It has been possible to do this extra amount of weaving' only by eliminating the extra community activities of the past years for both the women and myself. One contributing factor in large measure has been the fact that the women have had to stay at home more with gas rationing and the absence of so many of their men. They have been weaving to fill up their time and as one of the young mothers told me, "It helps meforget Charlie is at war because I get so tired I just have to sleep." I have had to caution many of them not to overdo with the extra burdens they are carrying. With the coming of winter and muddy roads we discontinued our weekly trips to the Glades and Boogertown to take supplies and pick up weaving. Since then we have been relying on the mails and occasional trips to town by the women. I often wonder what the post-war period will do to Gatlinburg, the tourist travel in this region and the handicrafts of this whole area. With the educational program that will soon be started by the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild, of which we are a member, the summer school in crafts here at the school and all the other handicraft rehabilitation projects that are being started, it will no doubt mean that the Southern Highland area will lead in this country in the production of handicrafts of high standards. It will also mean continually keeping be-fore our workers the dignity of working with their hands, heads, and hearts for it takes all three to produce hand-made articles. The people in this section have more money than ever before in their lives, and as more tourists come into the region, more and more money will find its way into the homes of the mountain people. It might well be that this fact alone will , influence many women in their desire for and against weaving. This reconversion period and the future years will provide an excellent opportunity for the school to give supplementary programs that will keep the women stimulated and fill their need of more educational background. I still am on the Board of Trustees of the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild after completing 2 years as president. I am also on the Board of Directors of the Gatlinburg Public Library. The library continues to increase its service to the town and is building good reading habits in the children who use it with fervor. And so twenty years have passed for me. I am grateful to have had the privilege of working with the mountain women of this section. They have given me their trust and friendship and in turn I have tried to be fair and understanding with their problems. My department never could have succeeded without the encouragement and understanding given to me by the Grand Council and Settlement School Commit-tee members. Through the years they have helped me with their unfailing enthusiasm and sound judgments I am very grateful for that too. To have seen Gatlin-burg progress from an isolated mountain village to a modern incorporated town has been an unusual experience in this day and age when anything can and does happen. The people of this immediate area have acquired in one generation what usually takes two to three generations to accomplish. Then too, there has always been the friendship and loyalty of my co-workers to provide inspiration. It has been a privilege to be a part of it and it has been Fun! Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B.

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4. Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57

        38 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW who, this summer, has been doing the necessary paint and repair work in the high school building and keeping the school lawn and playground mowed. Pi Beta Phi used part of the high school building for the summer workshop, providing the necessary janitorial service during that period. Several resignations among the staff this spring have been filled with the only vacancy at the present time in the first grade room. The position of music supervisor has not yet been filled by Pi Beta Phi. The PTA was revived this past year, joining the state and national associations. They were responsible for carrying out a most successful hot lunch program, assisted by the county who donated paint and materials for redecorating the room, and by Pi Beta Phi, who built a new entrance to the room which fulfilled the state regulations for fire exits of dining-rooms. During the fall visit of the chairman, Pi Beta Phi's gift to the school, the lovely stage curtain and cyclorama, was officially dedicated. At a well-planned evening program including musical numbers by grade and high school students, acceptance thank-yous were given by students and a representative of the community, 'Mr. Medlin. This seemed to serve as a splendid opportunity for stressing the cooperation between Pi Beta Phi and the community in this Settlement School program. Emma Harper Turner Craft Center Dedication Two open houses were given during the Summer Workshop one at the end of each three-week period. Students worked on actual projects, explaining the process to the many interested tourists and towns-people who attended. At the second of these, on July 16, a short outdoor program preceded the tour of the workshop, presided over by Emma Woerner, Committee member, and during which a pantomime was presented by the Community Recreation class and the Arts and Crafts building was dedicated by Miss Amy Onken, Grand President, as the Emma Harper Turner Crafts Center, a beautifully carved wooden sign made by George Barford being placed on the building at that time. Here in the Crafts Center this past year was developed an enlarged program for grade and high school students which, according to Miss Petrie's repOrt, "was successful both in pleasure and in the knowledge gained." High school girls worked at a variety of crafts, but weaving retained first place in their interest and some really splendid articles were made. Boys worked under Carl Huskey making attractive small wooden articles and even completing four table looms for use in the Summer Workshop. They will make more of these this coming year so that each grade room may have one for demonstration and practice. Art work in the grades showed marked improvement over the preceding year, which as you remember was the first year this had been offered in the school. The members of Committee were interested in an exhibit of some of the work done, ranging from the simple designs made by first grade children by arrangjng and pasting cut pieces of colored paper, to the original posters and masks made in the upper' grades. The same goal continued this year that of making things which could be duplicated at home with little expense so that this new ability might be utilized in the home life of the students. Rationing at Arrowcraft' While the joyous news of V-J Day's approach makes us hopeful that there will soon be relief evenfor our much-troubled but ever-capable manager of Arrowcraft, Ethel Snow, it is going to be necessary to "ration" articles sent to the alumnae clubs this coming fall. Even with Arrowcraft producing far more than ever before, though it has often been necessary to discontinue certain items because of lack of materials, impossibility of producing under the OPA ceiling, or a similar wartime cause, production has been unable to keep up with the greatly increased demands. Arrowcraft Shop itself cannot keep a large enough supply on hand to meet the requests of the buying tourist trade there, Every effort will be made on the part of the Pi Beta Phi staff to see that as many clubs are served with as large a percentage of their orders as is possible; cheerful acceptance of this situation is the contribution we of the alumna clubs must make until such time as conditions change. Regular Staff Personnel The regular staff at the Settlement School has remained the same this past year. Miss Ruth Dyer, Director, continues to direct the thousand and one activities that such an establishment includes, and keeps the School as a whole functioning miraculously well during these times when it is so difficult to secure adequate or qualified help. Under her super-vision, and oft-times with the assistance of our maintenance man, Arlie Watson, repairs authorized by the committee have been made, including the addition of a partition between the front and back rooms at the Arts and Crafts Center, a double door at the back to allow easy moving of looms, roof repairs of the barn and sheds, repair of gates and some rebuilding of fences, necessary minor repairs and painting. No major building was done this past year, although plans are now being started for a new Health Center building. Lean Hodgins, House Manager, has added to her regular duties the chaperoning of the girl's dormitory. Carl Ogle and Elvin Trentham have continued their care of the demonstration farm during this period without an Agriculture teacher. Arrowcraft Shop added two salesgirls, Arbutus Ogle and Lois Watson, to the former staff consisting of Ethel Snow, Winogene Redding, Lura Owenby, and Bess Chance; and Georgia Duffield continues in charge of the Mountain View Hotel shop. Health Center is the busy domain of the nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, whose full report is included in this issue, in spite of the fact that the building itself demands almost immediate replacement. This, we hope, will be possible in the near future. "The Mighty Hearts" The Settlement School Committee personnel, also, has remained the same this year as last. Secretary Ann Munn, also Contact Member for Arts and Crafts, visited the school in the spring to see the craft classes in operation and to assist with the detailed planning for the summer session. Conferences were held with staff members of the University of Tennessee, and with Miss Ulbricht, then in Milwaukee. Mrs. Munn also attended meetings of the Mountain Workers and the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild in Montreat, at the latter of which plans were made for the incorporation of the Guild as a non-profit organization. Arrowcraft has been an integral part of the Guild since its founding and it was fitting that it was during the presidency of our Weaving Supervisor, Winogene Redding, that this step was taken, and by virtue thereof became the recipients of a three year grant from the General Education Board THE SEPTEMBER ARROW which will aid in furthering the development of handcrafts in the entire Southern Highland area. Beth LeRoy, publicity member on Committee, continued her interesting monthly letters to province vice-presidents and sent a most enlightening and entertaining letter to all active chapter and alumnae clubs, describing a visit to the School, arranged so that it could be used as a basis for talks given in conjunction with the place mat maps. We shall miss Beth on the Committee, for her term expired at this last meeting time; we shall miss her enthusiasm, her love of Settlement School work, and her building spirits. We welcomed Eugenia Smith (Mrs. G. Herbert), as new Committee member, member of Indiana r, who brings a rich heritage of Pi Beta Phi experiences, most recent of which was the installation of the new chapter on the campus of Willamette University, where her husband is president. Lolita Prouty, treasurer, has continued to meet difficult days with the bother of withholding taxes, Social Security, and other regulations and reports now imposed on anyone taking charge of accounts; but her fine attention to all details have given us accurate and complete reports regularly. Emma Woerner has been busy keeping engagements Community FOGRESS is the law of life." Pi Beta Phi is living up to its past achievements in bringing to Gatlin-burg, in conjunction with the University of Tennessee, a Summer Workshop in Crafts. We look forward to almost endless possibilities to be derived from this new program in wonderful development for the school and the whole region. Changes in village life are taking place. Perhaps the one most far reaching in its scope is the incorporation of the village, voted in the spring. Better sanitation and law enforcement will certainly result from this step. Pi Beta Phi will have some say in town affairs since we now have two representatives, Miss Evelyn Bishop and Mrs. Ethel Snow, on the Chamber of Commerce Board. During the winter a Lion's Club was organized and the American Legion members living in town withdrew from the Sevierville Post to start one of their own. The Methodist congregation have been given a site for a church building which will be built as soon as conditions permit. One Sunday this congregation and the one from Pigeon Forge used our Auditorium for morning service when Bishop Kern spoke. School Sevier County has cooperated well with us this past year. They have provided a janitor, now on a twelve months' basis. While certain repairs have not been made to the buildings .the fault lies not with the wish of the county board but with war time shortages of materials and labor. Greater interest in school activities has been evidenced all year in the crowds attending any and all functions connected with the school program. Basket-ball crowds made us long for a larger gym. The plays given by the senior and junior classes, the big Halloween Carnival, the Open House evening, the program given by the elementary school children and the graduation exercises for both the eighth grade and the high school were all well attended by parents and friends of the school. These various entertainments were of the same high quality as those given for her films, and some twenty chapters and c: had their inspiration this past year. Charact comments received from alumnae clubs is ing: "The films (of the Settlement Schoc greatly enjoyed, in fact, I think I am safe they made the hit of the year at our alue meeting. The photography is beautiful, and immensely more interesting than any previl taken of the Settlement School, everyone agrc "Every club should see them." This has not been a year without some t tribulations, but we cannot expect to ever otherwise in such a project; yet even with has been a successful year for the Settlemen There are still numerous small problems the including that of getting every thing done i be done without increasing the cost of up1 have a good loyal staff, and they are doi to help us with our plans; with them and fine Settlement School Committee and Grant all with that "mighty heart" to make thin while, we cannot help but succeed. Respectfully submitted, MILDREI REPORT OF DIRECTOR in the past. One big contributing factor to the has been the new stage curtains and cycle stalled last fall. These make it possible to proper background, add dignity and have t. influence on the deportment of the children.

For the last few months of the term ti had music instruction given by a charming Dorothy McWilliams Young of Ohio A chs did wonders with the children in the short she was here. Her work was of much vale teachers in preparation for their programs a to the commencement activities. The girls in the different Home Economic under Sue Landrum, worked on some iJ projects. A High School Home Economics organized.

A dramatic club was organized by th( teacher, Miss Lois Fenn. They gave a deligl gram of choral readings at the Christina program. They also presented a clever one at the Open House. This was repeated at church night of the Methodists. Twenty six children finished the eighth j 40 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW twelve graduated from the high school. Through aid given by us in transportation, eleven children from Elkmont were enrolled in our lower grades. PTA cooperation with the school program has been especially fine all year. Their main project was serving a hot meal at noon to the children in the elementary school. Government aid made it possible to serve one hot dish, with milk, for ten cents a day per child. It was necessary to clean up the old basement room and to buy a new stove. Pi Phi helped with the repair and a big rummage sale plus individual contributions provided the needed equipment. Different mothers helped to make the project a success. At the Commencement Exercises Mrs. J. Donahoe, president of PTA, presented four awards of five dollars each to the student in each class who had shown the most improvement in their studies during the year. For the first time this organization affiliated with the national organization. Farm With food shortages in so many places we are fortunate to be able to produce so much of the necessary food for our school family and to have a surplus to sell. The milk, cream, eggs, chickens, honey, vegetables, blackberries that grow on our own hill-sides, strawberries from our own bed, apples from the orchard help to supply our table with the finest of food. Weekly sales of eggs and all the fryers we could spare to the Mountain View Hotel, the sale of sixteen young pigs and surplus vegetables have added cash, much needed to offset the high feed costs. All departments of the farm will show a small profit this year. We were able to grow enough hay for the live-stock. The mules have done their bit in helping many a person with garden plowing or extra farm work. They have earned over $150.00 for us by this service. We sold one of our old Jersey cows and replaced her with a good grade cow, half Jersey and half Holstein. This cow will be sold after our three fine pure bred jersey heifers begin to produce. The gates on the place were old and in need of replacement. This was done in the bad weather in the winter. As much fence was built as could be done with the help that we had. The barn roof was reshingled. Dormitory For the most of the year we had seven girls and three boys in the school family. It is worth while to note the changes that take place in the individual students during nine months of living in our dormitories. They gain poise and confidence in themselves, their personal appearance changes for the better and they usually gain in weight. One boy gained twenty five pounds this past nine months. Much credit is due Miss Hodgen for the very fine way in which she trains the girls in their housekeeping duties. They are in demand as waitresses. Probably due to the fact that there is more money in the community than ever before, more of the students are meeting their financial obligations to the school. One former Dormitory boy, looking very smart in his uniform with overseas ribbons, came and settled an old bill that had been running for two years. A girl who graduated last year and has since been working in a defense plant, sent a check for $86.25 to cover her entire bill. Her appreciation to Pi Beta Phi was expressed thus "If it were possible money could not buy the many helpful things I learned at the School. Many thanks to the Dormitory, School and congenial instructors." Several times during the semester the girls haveplanned parties to which other high school students and boys home on leave were invited. All the young people seem to love to come to Stewart Cottage. The girls plan the decorations, games and refreshments, often bringing sugar from home to make the cakes and cookies that they serve. Health Center The Pi Phi nurse has such varied duties that words seem inadequate to report them. She visits the homes where there is illness; gives advice and help in maternity and infant welfare; inspects regularly the children of our school and other surrounding ones; gives the necessary inoculations; treats injuries not serious enough for a doctor's care; conducts classes in Home Nursing and First Aid; takes patients in town to the different hospitals, has a regular clinic day and even helps the tourists in such emergencies as heart attacks and acute sunburn. In the elementary school the children were weighed and talks on nutrition given at the beginning of the school lunch program. Charts were made for each room. Both children and parents were interested in progress made and recorded as the program developed. Mrs. Chalmers had a nice honor come to her in that she was chosen as the representative from Sevier County to attend a short course in the treatment of the after effects of. Infantile Paralysis at Warm Springs, Georgia. This course was sponsored by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. Several generous gifts have been made to further the health program. The Dallas Evening group sent boxes of needed surgical dressings. Through Beth LeRoy a Chase doll was secured for demonstration purposes. Sigma Phi Gamma again sent $50.00 which was used for eye correction work and to purchase glasses for needy children. The largest gift of all, $200.00 from the Chicago North Alumnae Club, is awaiting the time when certain equipment may be purchased. Arrowcraft We still have what economists call a Seller's Market. This makes the yearly report of our shop quite a different story from the ones in the years in which we were trying to establish a market and urging all the clubs to help sell our products. Now, production cannot keep up with the demand, Ethel Snow has had to refuse to sell anything to the many small dealers who helped out by selling Arrowcraft products in the lean years. Both of the Southern Highlands Inc: Shops, one in Radio City and the other at Norris Dam, Tennessee or the Shop of the Southern High-land Handicraft Guild in Asheville could have taken our full output. Instead they have been rationed in order to keep goods to sell to the people who come direct to the shop and to send to our alumnie clubs. The gross sales for eleven months of the year came to an all time high of $85,093.67, This is $16,387.93 more than the total for last year. This clearly proves that in spite of war" time restrictions, shortages in materials and labor that our humble beginnings have blossomed into a real business. The many club chair-men have helped to swell these totals. Eight clubs have sold over one thousand dollars worth of Arrow-craft goods. These are, Kansas City, Missouri, Port-land, Oregon, Champaign, Illinois, San Francisco, Berkeley, Denver, Franklin, Indiana, and Milwaukee. Ten other clubs have sales above $700.00. These are Dallas, Tulsa, Boston plus LeRoy, Albany, St. Louis, Cleveland, Marin County, California, Lafayette, Indiana, Madison and Manhattan, Kansas. It should be remembered that these figures do not paint a true THE SEPTEMBER ARROW picture for some clubs would have sold much more if they could have obtained the goods. Will we have to follow Government practices and work out a ration system so that all may share alike? The shop is still the most attractive one in the village, one that every Pi Phi can be proud of, knowing that it represents the fraternity to the tourists and stands for the things we have done to improve the economic life of our coiner of the Southern Highland Area. Conclusion Every day we are reminded of the intere loyal Pi Phis all over the country are taking project. Their gifts, so carefully packed, bring p and profit to many of the individuals we are to help. I wish to express my gratitude to the especially to Council and Committee for their hl consideration at all times. Respectfully submitted, RUTH I OWC AFT W EBSTER says a report is "to give an account of" but I am sure that would be repetition as that is given each month in Ruth Dyer's letter and other sources. Instead I am writing down some of the problems that come up during the year knowing there should be a solution that I have not found so far. The War Years have been hard for us too but it has done one good thing for Arrowcraft, proven that it is not necessary for the Clubs to send back quantities of goods. By keeping the quality good we should never have to go back to that. To encourage sales we have given the Clubs many privileges that no business firm would countenance. We can not begin to send them all they are going to want this year so I think it is the time to get on a still firmer foundation. Why should it not be a requirement that in order for a province to be 100% all bills to Arrowcraft must have been paid. Each year brings at least one headache over an account that has run on for a number of years, this year there have been two such. If there was that yearly accounting it would automatically bring anything wrong to the attention of the Province Officer and the Club itself. We used to preach early orders but by that was meant September and early October and not all in November and December. More people are expected to visit Gatlinburg in the years to come than ever before. There is not much point in having the lovely shop if we do not sell to these people. But that simply can not be done if we start saving for the Clubs in May. I have already had many inquiries. My manual reads "a letter to the Clubs in September telling about prospective things and including a new price list with thanks for what they have done." I have written it much earlier the past years to save myself so many personal letters. As you know it is not possible to be sure of all the things lasting through shipping that go on the price list in July. This year I am not sure of any thing so how can I tell them I will send large quantities of goods at a certain time. It is not fair to the small Clubs who also want small sales, big in their eyes, to send thirty six to fifty baby blankets to one Club. That might be the last thirty six the way things look right now. Rationing may come late to Arrowcraft but it looks as if it may be the fair thing to do. I have tried to be fair but it is the ones whoare most demanding that are the least underst It helps however to get bits like this from a chairman "I continue to be amazed at the gra you've been able to do with all the Iimitati, know exists." Most clubs do not get started again befog tember so as far as big sales are concernec should be an understanding that none can b until after that and that it is not possible tl in May and expect us to put the things away disappointment of summer trade and many sin orders. Allanstand and Southern Highlanders In been rationed this year. These days they could entire output and are glad to take it any time the year. Also I have had to tell all the small have been selling to that we can not send an until times are back to normal. I have tried them down easy as they are all old friends may need them again later on. Along w, headaches I am glad to report that more chi] settled their accounts in full than ever beft there is still another month before the audi Cole was able to draw the first red line for them in all the years I have been here and it h running for years before that. It has become a habit to list the ten highe in relation to sales but it is not a true picture respects as many of them could not get as muc: as they would have liked to have had. There were eight clubs who sold over a tl dollars worth: Kansas City, Missouri 1,686.4 land, Oregon 1,630.93, Champaign 1,496. Francisco 1,484.76, Berkeley 1,395.82, 1,177.56, Franklin, Indiana 1,065.57, and Mi: 1,025.34. In the next bracket there are ten Club: seven hundred dollars: Dallas 921.78, Tulsa Boston and Beth LeRoy together 861.48, 893.85, St. Louis 826.42, Cleveland 807.65, County, California 792.65, Lafayette 780.56, son 773.56 and Manhattan, Kansas 706.33. EN all the difficulties in filling orders, gross sales an all time high of $85,093.67 which was 1( more than last year. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL M. REPORT OF THE JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HEALTF CENTER MAX 1944 MAY 1945 WENTY-FIVE years ago, during the season of T 1919-20, a "visiting nurses for the community" was engaged by the Settlement School Committee. By patience and understanding, confidence was established. The district of service was .purposely keptsmall, for travel by horseback was slow, as trips cut down sharply on the amount of w person could do.

Classes in Home Nursing for adults did not work out as we had hoped. Scarcity of Mother's helpers, and the press of war time living prevented regular group meetings for such a period. Nevertheless, two sets of classes were taught, one at Pi Beta Phi, and the other at Sevier County High School. Both groups were Home Economics classes, and were taught with the assistance of the Home Economics teachers. Certificates have been issued by the Red Cross, and some of the girls. have already been accepted into the Cadet Nurse Corps. Melinda Ogle Wadley, whose entire life has been spent in Gatlin-burg, will be graduated soon from a hospital in Memphis the first of our girls to complete nurses training. One of the most interesting events of the school year was the running of the Lunch Room. The excitement of remodeling and redecorating aroused interest to a high pitch. The day lunch was served for the first time, every child in the elementary school was weighed and measured. Charts were made for each room, showing each child's standing average, over or under weight. Three months later, when the Lunch Room closed, every child was rechecked and the results tabulated. Present for the entire test were 223 children. Of that number, 163 had gained a total of 428 lbs. from 1/2 to 9 lbs.. apiece. 107 had grown taller, from 1/4 to 13% inches. 26 had lost and 18 showed no change. In January, 51 were underweight. In April, 20 had gained up to or beyond their average, and 18 of the rest were gaining. The period of testing was short, and a child's weight varies quickly with illness, lack of sleep, or overactivity. So the results seem very satisfactory. Two children are now under treatment of an Orthopedic Surgeon for the correction of club feet. Both are wearing special shoes held in rigid position by metal rods. The three months old baby is nearly normal, and the other is improving. Margaret .was corrected when she was tiny, but the braced shoes were not worn long enough. Four years old is Margaret almost too old to make things right without surgery. Yes, life wags on "sortie like common" at the Health Center. The days are very full and very interesting. We are grateful for our friends here and all over the country, in the profession and out of it. There are so many of them, and together, we are making life a little easier, a little safer for each other. Following are the figures for the past year, and for the preceding period: Class of.

It really is something to be able to say that I have served Pi Beta Phi longer than any other person in the history of the Settlement School and I am not a Pi Phi. That fact has not kept me from giving to the school and the community my interest, my service, nor my loyalty through the years. Out of the twenty that have passed all too quickly, I have been employed at the Settlement School for 16 years. This has been in three periods, the last one being the longest 10 years this July. When I first came to Gatlinburg in September 1925 after a very hot and dusty ride over the new road that reached just to the front gate, I can re-member that the first thing I wanted was a bath with lots of water; but Gatlinburg was in the midst oft, a drought and as the electricity was made by a little come and go plant on the river in which there was not enough water to make it and consequently our pump run, I had to be satisfied with as little water as decency and the need required. We didn't have lights much either, nor any way to have refrigeration to keep meat, so not much meat was on our menu, nor any telephone. That did not come for many years after that time. But I did have a cordial welcome from all hands on the staff. Aunt Lizzie Reagan cooked for us then, those of us who lived at Teachers' Cottage, and kept us well in hand. Life was not unpleasant even without much electricity, telephone and radio. Gatlinburg wasn't much in those days. There was Charlie Ogle's store, the Squire's house and Jim Reagan's "Swinkey" where we could get ice cream in our immediate range of vision. The Mountain View. Hotel was just a little green frame building with a few rooms for guests and the Riverside Hotel had even less room. Hardy souls came to Gatlinburg for vacations in those days. I can remember three cars in town, Miss Evelyn's, 0. J. Mattil's and the Huff boys, those constant ,squires to the young teachers in the early days. Both of them later married Pi Phis. Then the cows roamed everywhere, sometimes it seemed as if there were profusions of cows. We were forever chasing our neighbors' mules out of our front yard as well as his chickens. The town could not boast of a lawn mower, baby carriage, church every Sunday, coal or electric stove, and only the Teachers' Cottage had both a bathroom and furnace. Otherwise modern plumbing was practically non-existent. When we wanted fun we made it ourselves, or went on a real binge and spent the week-end in Knoxville. Now and then there were flickering movies given in the top of the then new barn with the audience seated on bales of hay and sound effects provided by the cows, goats, and horses housed below. Power for the movies was made by hooking onto the motor of the venerable old Ford Station Wagon that was the special responsibility of Shot Reagan Shot who was to give his life for his country in this war. Trips to the Teachers' Cottage in the Sugarlands were planned with thoroughness and foresight for a ride up there by horseback or in a car that could hopfrom boulder to boulder was an event not to be taken lightly. In contrast to this picture of a sleepy little mountain village is our bustling tourist town, the Gatlin-burg of today, that adjoins the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I can count only 27 houses in the entire town that were being lived in in 1925 and are still occupied twenty years later. Everything else in the town has been built in the intervening years, most of it since 1932. Now our permanent population is about 1600 and there are hotel and cabin accommodations for three times that many, which are filled to capacity during the summer. We have a telephone exchange, public library, post office, four churches, a four-lane highway with sidewalks; and this year the town incorporated. The county runs the school now, with an attendance of 425 pupils quite a growth from the original 13 of the first Pi Beta Phi school. The first household convenience my weavers "wove out" after electricity was brought in from the outside was an electric iron, with washing ma-chines and bathrooms following. Now to go back to my story. After the effects from my trip down wore off, I asked Miss Evelyn what I was to do. Her reply was a masterpiece of understatement but I have never forgotten it, nor failed to appreciate the wisdom behind it. She said I was to teach weaving. My next question was "how and to whom" and she left me to my own devices when she said I was to find my job and make it. It was either sink or swim from then on. I chose swimming and the results will have to speak for themselves. Miss Phyllis helped me out with another bit of sage advice when in reply to my question "of what to talk about to these strange mountain women, she replied, "Flowers." The subject of flowers was my conversational backlog for many months to come. My first call in the community was to the home of Lulu Mae Ogle to see her mother who wove cover-lets. She was the oldest weaver in these parts and was a rich source for much interesting mountain history. She passed on her art of coverlet weaving to her daughter who now makes all our beautiful coverlets. I also made the acquaintance of my first mountain baby ' and a cute one he was, Van Ogle, who now rides in bombers. Of those first 8 or 10 weavers I found in the next few weeks, 2 of them are still making things for Arrowcraft. Shortly after this Nita Stark came in for her semi-annual Committee visit and there were many discussions about where my weaving apparatus and I were to be located. The looms were then in the old log cabin which did not provide sufficient resistance to the elements, so we decided, and proper space just did not seem to be available. Finally someone had a bright idea! Move the laundry from under the porch of the oTd Stuart Cottage and put me in there. No sooner said than done and I was moved in with 7 old looms; warping bars and a box or two in which to keep some supplies. Heat was supplied by a little old wood stove with the pipe stuck out a' window. We managed pretty well up there for the next three years until we moved again into the new high school building with lots and lots of room (now the 8th grade manages to squeeze into the same space). My greatest problem during those years was whether or not I would acquire a permanent stoop THE SEPTEMBER ARROW am very tall and the porch was very low rs lower than the floor above. My journeys end to the other were a bobbing sort of and between those rafters. There was no a table or desk so I carried all my records arm and my office was everywhere I hap-;it down. weaving had been done before I arrived on Not much, though, but still enough for ve a few women who were interested in ow to make ,new things. Our entire stock on the shelf in back of the door in what [iss Dyer's room. In a few months we hat space and had to put the towels and eon sets (nothing but blue or red borders) shelves in Miss Evelyn's office. I taught o the eighth grade girls and I never had a more interesting class than that first one of 't long before I began to see possibilities. e beginning to talk about a National Park -ea and if that came we could see where ple would come to this region. Lois Rogers, lylor, Miss Evelyn and I had long sessions [rig about it knowing full well that if it we were sitting in the midst of opporwas during the winter of 1926 that Arrow-born and I helped name the baby. Lois and Ln the shop that first summer up in the ttage with a preponderance of baskets in father, who happened to be visiting me le, made the first official sale from the new L wooden salad fork and spoon. After that vcraft Shop moved to whatever space was e at the time from Stuart Cottage to the )m and porch of Teachers cottage and tuart Cottage, then finally into the building the road that was made of the old schoolth a new room added on the back. This k place in the fall of 1927 and the Shop there' until our fine new building was built With the activities of the weaving depart-the Arrowcraft Shop so closely interwoven, [ous moves to gain more room show how :pansion developed. ras rather rugged in those old days, espeyour weaving teacher. What few weavers we lived distances from the school that were by rocky or muddy roads, depending on a, way up beyond the old Baskins school-id gradually as more women learned to )r the school," up into the Sugarlands. That I walked and walked, sometimes as much es a week to reach the women who wanted weaving. It took constant supervision to standards. Not only did I teach them how but how to hem, wash and iron and made lize that people actually used the articles e. The next year I decided to save myself walking so I ,rode a horse to the most )mes. The roads I went on were impassable itomobile, even if there had been an auto-: was not until 1928 that I did start to drive y that time there were more and more nd less and less time to make the rounds. in 1927 that I decided that part of my job to bring something beyond just weaving lives of the women with whom I was work-making friends. My first attempt at social a tea given at the Teachers' Cottage one ternoon. It was the only time we ever served Lountain women, coffee drinkers that they are. They were good sports and drank it though. One old woman said, "Law, if we're goin' to eat, I'll have to spit out my backy" and she did out the front door. From that small beginning grew our weaving meetings of later years, meetings to which the women looked forward from month to month. Through the years a variety of subjects and speakers have been brought to the women, from butter making to picture painting, from chicken raising to piano playing. We had Christmas parties with Christmas trees and presents, tacky parties, dinner at the hotel, picnics, and once a big banquet with all the fixings. There is no doubt in my mind that these varied educational and recreational programs have made our weavers broader in vision and background than those who have not had an opportunity to attend. They have been systematically exposed to University Extension lecturers, preachers, artists, and anyone else who could bring a message on some subject with which they were not familiar. In the fall of 1932 the group organized into the Gatlinburg Weavers Guild. This was always an in-formal set-up but the women felt from that time on that they were a definite unit and they started to sponsor community projects. The first one was the Wayside Market which had some measure of success for two years in selling farm produce at their stand on the main highway. The group next started the Gatlin-burg Garden Club in 1936. Until the war and Red Cross work took up the time of the women of the town, the Garden Club conducted a flourishing pro-gram. They were instrumental in having the State Highway Department plant the dogwood trees along the highway through the town, they planted and still maintain the little park opposite the Arrowcraft Shop and they cleaned off and keep in order the island in the river. They had several flower shows that before their discontinuance gained a wide reputation in East Tennessee. The activities of the Club have been suspended until times are again normal. The next project of the Weavers Guild was "play-acting." A desire for some money in their treasury prompted their play writing and acting. They gave four plays in all over a period of six years. The last one "Store Britches" which was written and acted by the weavers and members of their families, ran for three highly successful summer seasons. Tourists and townspeople alike enjoyed the fun and the old-timey mountain story. The money they made has been used by the weavers for a self-help fund from which they can borrow for medical attention and family emergencies. As much as $250 has been loaned at one time to different women. They have taken trips with expenses paid from the fund, the high-light being a trip to Norris Dam where many of them saw their first motor boat and had their first ride in one. They have made donations to the Red Cross and local charities from it and have helped some of their less fortunate members with gifts in periods of stress. When gas rationing . started our meetings were limited to one every two or three months. Perhaps at this point it would be interesting to go back and include some selections from my old yearly reports. They give an idea of the progress of the weaving department from year to year. In May 1926, I wrote, "The weaving situation in Gatlinburg is gradually but steadily growing into a commercial project of great economic value to the women in their homes. Just how extensive the development is to become depends upon the amount of weaving the school can and will handle. Our greatest problem THE SEPTEMBER ARROW .45 is that of supply and demand. The women can weave more than we are selling at the present time. It would be a great help to know just how extensive the , Committee wishes this department to be. There is room for growth and development." In May 1927 this came along. "As I look back upon this year's work in comparison with that of last year, I find that my problems of conducting the weaving department have changed a great deal. The greatest reason for this has been the amazing growth of sales of the weaving due to a greater interest shown by the Alumnae Clubs and to the Arrowcraft Shop which has been the only solution to the large tourist trade that has come to Gatlinburg for five spring and summer months. We were shipping a truck load of baskets and a dozen or so packages of weaving every day for two months before Christmas. The school handles the entire output of 41 looms. This does not include any of the looms that supply weaving for the three weaving shops that have started in Gatlinburg the past year." Then in May, 1928, "In looking over another year's development of the weaving department, it is interesting to note changes that have come through the increased commercial demands. There has been about a 33% increase in the business which has meant more organization among the women. There have been 40 women weaving for us during the year. The plan of selling materials to the women has kept our weaving of uniform quality. This amount of weaving can be increased many times as there are more women pleading for weaving than we can supply." My report of May 1929 is amusing in the light of subsequent events. I said, "This year I feel as if something definite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal has been reached than it is a condition that can be expiessed in so many words. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instructions. They are becoming experts in the mechanics of weaving. I have tried to . spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school this fall making a total of 50 weavers this year. This work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else." I did leave and Victoria Strand took over for the next 2 years. When she did not return in the fall of 1931, Miss Evelyn asked me to come back again. I was happy to do so. This was in the midst of the depression and in June 1932 I wrote, "In spite of the fact that all the weaving centers of the South have been turning off their weavers for the past year, we have had our usual number of women working for us. It is not easy to make hand-woven articles that will sell at a price that one considers inexpensive but that is the trend of the times. There have been 46 women weaving for the school this year with never less than 38 weaving at one time. Thirty new articles have been designed. This has required an almost complete turn-over of the stock but we hope that by offering a new line of articles to the Clubs this fall our trade will be stimulated." Then in June 1933 I wrote, "This has been a year of ups and downs for the weaving department. In November and December we had more weavers working than at any time since I first came here 8 years ago, then in January to March we had less weaversat work than when I started with the old faithful six or seven women. When the Bank in Sevierville closed in January we had to curtail our weaving pro-gram. In order not to weave beyond our income, it has been necessary to keep down the number of women weaving and yet keep a safe balance between the weaving in stock at the Shop and that being made by the women. We have tried to meet this situation by giving a short warp to two women instead of one long warp to one woman." With the general recovery from the depression, Arrowcraft and the weaving department had another boom. I stayed with it until Christmas of 1934 when again I left, this time for good so I thought. Miss Carr and then Mrs. Mitchell carried on the department until June 1935. Then Mrs. Weaver persuaded me to return once again so I came back to the same old job in a brand new place. This last 10 year period from June 1935 to June 1945 has been one of steady progress upward. It was with our move into the Voorheis Building in 1935 that the weaving department came into its own and no matter where it goes in the future, never will the weavers feel so at home nor as if they had a place all their own as they did during the five years we stayed in that building. It gave us the opportunity to have our meetings and all our many social activities in our own building and the women, as well as myself, loved it. I doubt if they will ever again feel as much a part of the school as they did during those years. We had the facilities for serving refreshments at the meetings and could do many extra things that have not, since been possible. They "wove for the school" as much for the activities we carried on as a group as they did for the money they earned. Each year they earned more and more money as the weaving demand kept increasing and we had to keep raising their pay to comply with the demands of the Wage and Hour Law. Although the average earnings at the present are lower than this, it is not unusual for a weaver to earn from $60 to $75 a month in her spare time at home. That represents a lot of weaving but one must remember that these women are very experienced and very fast. With the move from the Voorheis Building to the new Arrowcraft Shop building in 1940, the department became more streamlined as the business kept increasing from a slow pace when the war started to a skyrocketing period during the war when consumer goods were scarce and money plentiful. As I write this in May 1945, we are not meeting by half the possibilities for business that would be ours if we had the facilities, the weavers and the materials with which to meet it. It was necessary as time went on and the women were more busy at home when their men went to war, to drop all the extra activities that we had enjoyed so much during the preceding years. Figures are always interesting in a report so here are a few. In the ten years from June 1935 to June 1945, we have had a total of 242 women weave for us. Two of these have died. Of this total 138 wove for us last year, the greatest number in our history. We keep between 80 and 90 women weaving all the time. As women drop out we try to' fill their places with other women who already know how to weave. There is no time now to teach weaving to inexperienced women. The weavers have had 104 babies during this period including two sets of twins. This one fact has meant the loss of much time from their weaving as one of our rules requires that no woman can weave two months before or after the birth of a .baby, and only then with the permission of her 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW doctor, and most of the women take off more time than that. At one time four generations of Aunt ,Lizzie Reagan's family were weaving for us including Aunt Lizzie at the age of 85 years. Since the war started 29 weavers have had their husbands and 43 of their children enter the armed forces, one has been killed in action. One weaver had five children in service at the same time. Along in the early thirties we started the practise of supplying all the materials to the weavers and paying them for their labor by the piece. In 1939 we paid them $11,187.79 and for the 11 months just ending we have paid them $24,721.47. Our weaving has increased 105% in the past two years alone. Last year we wove 21,630 luncheon doilies and 17,621 luncheon napkins, 2,108 neck scarfs, 1482 square scarfs, 4202 bibs and 1085 baby blankets. Since 1935 we have women 26,287 underarm bags, 6011 last year alone and I am being conservative in saying we are hundreds behind on our orders. It is impossible to find weavers and materials for more than we are doing, In the last ten years I have designed 246 different woven articles in hundreds of color combinations. In the past seven years we have paid the weavers $109,417.18 for their work. Pi Beta Phi has reason to be proud of this record and I am proud to have had' a part in it with my women. This past year might well be called "Passing Previous Peaks." All of our records have been broken. There have been more weavers, more weaving made .and more money earned by the, weavers than ever before in our history. Our inventory of weaving supplies has had to be our largest in order to take advantage of buying materials when they were avail-able. In spite of planning at least 6 months ahead shortages of necessary materials have occurred. With both cotton and wool frozen for the first six months of 1945, it has been more difficult to operate. Fortunately I had placed large orders before the freeze went into effect and they were delivered in time to keep us going except for a period through the winter when our supply of wool was practically gone. By substituting odd lots of materials that I was able to buy and redesigning a few articles in order to use them, we have kept up as well as possible under the circumstances. It helped a great deal not to take the December inventory of weaving supplies. The weavers were very glad not to stop weaving for a month in the middle of the winter and it meant that we could build up our stock more than usual after the very heavy shipping season before Christmas. It has been possible to do this extra amount of weaving' only by eliminating the extra community activities of the past years for both the women and myself. One contributing factor in large measure has been the fact that the women have had to stay at home more with gas rationing and the absence of so many of their men. They have been weaving to fill up their time and as one of the young mothers told me, "It helps meforget Charlie is at war because I get so tired I just have to sleep." I have had to caution many of them not to overdo with the extra burdens they are carrying. With the coming of winter and muddy roads we discontinued our weekly trips to the Glades and Boogertown to take supplies and pick up weaving. Since then we have been relying on the mails and occasional trips to town by the women. I often wonder what the post-war period will do to Gatlinburg, the tourist travel in this region and the handicrafts of this whole area. With the educational program that will soon be started by the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild, of which we are a member, the summer school in crafts here at the school and all the other handicraft rehabilitation projects that are being started, it will no doubt mean that the Southern Highland area will lead in this country in the production of handicrafts of high standards. It will also mean continually keeping be-fore our workers the dignity of working with their hands, heads, and hearts for it takes all three to produce hand-made articles. The people in this section have more money than ever before in their lives, and as more tourists come into the region, more and more money will find its way into the homes of the mountain people. It might well be that this fact alone will , influence many women in their desire for and against weaving. This reconversion period and the future years will provide an excellent opportunity for the school to give supplementary programs that will keep the women stimulated and fill their need of more educational background. I still am on the Board of Trustees of the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild after completing 2 years as president. I am also on the Board of Directors of the Gatlinburg Public Library. The library continues to increase its service to the town and is building good reading habits in the children who use it with fervor. And so twenty years have passed for me. I am grateful to have had the privilege of working with the mountain women of this section. They have given me their trust and friendship and in turn I have tried to be fair and understanding with their problems. My department never could have succeeded without the encouragement and understanding given to me by the Grand Council and Settlement School Commit-tee members. Through the years they have helped me with their unfailing enthusiasm and sound judgments I am very grateful for that too. To have seen Gatlin-burg progress from an isolated mountain village to a modern incorporated town has been an unusual experience in this day and age when anything can and does happen. The people of this immediate area have acquired in one generation what usually takes two to three generations to accomplish. Then too, there has always been the friendship and loyalty of my co-workers to provide inspiration. It has been a privilege to be a part of it and it has been Fun! Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B.

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4. Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57

        40 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW twelve graduated from the high school. Through aid given by us in transportation, eleven children from Elkmont were enrolled in our lower grades. PTA cooperation with the school program has been especially fine all year. Their main project was serving a hot meal at noon to the children in the elementary school. Government aid made it possible to serve one hot dish, with milk, for ten cents a day per child. It was necessary to clean up the old basement room and to buy a new stove. Pi Phi helped with the repair and a big rummage sale plus individual contributions provided the needed equipment. Different mothers helped to make the project a success. At the Commencement Exercises Mrs. J. Donahoe, president of PTA, presented four awards of five dollars each to the student in each class who had shown the most improvement in their studies during the year. For the first time this organization affiliated with the national organization. Farm With food shortages in so many places we are fortunate to be able to produce so much of the necessary food for our school family and to have a surplus to sell. The milk, cream, eggs, chickens, honey, vegetables, blackberries that grow on our own hill-sides, strawberries from our own bed, apples from the orchard help to supply our table with the finest of food. Weekly sales of eggs and all the fryers we could spare to the Mountain View Hotel, the sale of sixteen young pigs and surplus vegetables have added cash, much needed to offset the high feed costs. All departments of the farm will show a small profit this year. We were able to grow enough hay for the live-stock. The mules have done their bit in helping many a person with garden plowing or extra farm work. They have earned over $150.00 for us by this service. We sold one of our old Jersey cows and replaced her with a good grade cow, half Jersey and half Holstein. This cow will be sold after our three fine pure bred jersey heifers begin to produce. The gates on the place were old and in need of replacement. This was done in the bad weather in the winter. As much fence was built as could be done with the help that we had. The barn roof was reshingled. Dormitory For the most of the year we had seven girls and three boys in the school family. It is worth while to note the changes that take place in the individual students during nine months of living in our dormitories. They gain poise and confidence in themselves, their personal appearance changes for the better and they usually gain in weight. One boy gained twenty five pounds this past nine months. Much credit is due Miss Hodgen for the very fine way in which she trains the girls in their housekeeping duties. They are in demand as waitresses. Probably due to the fact that there is more money in the community than ever before, more of the students are meeting their financial obligations to the school. One former Dormitory boy, looking very smart in his uniform with overseas ribbons, came and settled an old bill that had been running for two years. A girl who graduated last year and has since been working in a defense plant, sent a check for $86.25 to cover her entire bill. Her appreciation to Pi Beta Phi was expressed thus "If it were possible money could not buy the many helpful things I learned at the School. Many thanks to the Dormitory, School and congenial instructors." Several times during the semester the girls haveplanned parties to which other high school students and boys home on leave were invited. All the young people seem to love to come to Stewart Cottage. The girls plan the decorations, games and refreshments, often bringing sugar from home to make the cakes and cookies that they serve. Health Center The Pi Phi nurse has such varied duties that words seem inadequate to report them. She visits the homes where there is illness; gives advice and help in maternity and infant welfare; inspects regularly the children of our school and other surrounding ones; gives the necessary inoculations; treats injuries not serious enough for a doctor's care; conducts classes in Home Nursing and First Aid; takes patients in town to the different hospitals, has a regular clinic day and even helps the tourists in such emergencies as heart attacks and acute sunburn. In the elementary school the children were weighed and talks on nutrition given at the beginning of the school lunch program. Charts were made for each room. Both children and parents were interested in progress made and recorded as the program developed. Mrs. Chalmers had a nice honor come to her in that she was chosen as the representative from Sevier County to attend a short course in the treatment of the after effects of. Infantile Paralysis at Warm Springs, Georgia. This course was sponsored by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. Several generous gifts have been made to further the health program. The Dallas Evening group sent boxes of needed surgical dressings. Through Beth LeRoy a Chase doll was secured for demonstration purposes. Sigma Phi Gamma again sent $50.00 which was used for eye correction work and to purchase glasses for needy children. The largest gift of all, $200.00 from the Chicago North Alumnae Club, is awaiting the time when certain equipment may be purchased. Arrowcraft We still have what economists call a Seller's Market. This makes the yearly report of our shop quite a different story from the ones in the years in which we were trying to establish a market and urging all the clubs to help sell our products. Now, production cannot keep up with the demand, Ethel Snow has had to refuse to sell anything to the many small dealers who helped out by selling Arrowcraft products in the lean years. Both of the Southern Highlands Inc: Shops, one in Radio City and the other at Norris Dam, Tennessee or the Shop of the Southern High-land Handicraft Guild in Asheville could have taken our full output. Instead they have been rationed in order to keep goods to sell to the people who come direct to the shop and to send to our alumnie clubs. The gross sales for eleven months of the year came to an all time high of $85,093.67, This is $16,387.93 more than the total for last year. This clearly proves that in spite of war" time restrictions, shortages in materials and labor that our humble beginnings have blossomed into a real business. The many club chair-men have helped to swell these totals. Eight clubs have sold over one thousand dollars worth of Arrow-craft goods. These are, Kansas City, Missouri, Port-land, Oregon, Champaign, Illinois, San Francisco, Berkeley, Denver, Franklin, Indiana, and Milwaukee. Ten other clubs have sales above $700.00. These are Dallas, Tulsa, Boston plus LeRoy, Albany, St. Louis, Cleveland, Marin County, California, Lafayette, Indiana, Madison and Manhattan, Kansas. It should be remembered that these figures do not paint a true THE SEPTEMBER ARROW picture for some clubs would have sold much more if they could have obtained the goods. Will we have to follow Government practices and work out a ration system so that all may share alike? The shop is still the most attractive one in the village, one that every Pi Phi can be proud of, knowing that it represents the fraternity to the tourists and stands for the things we have done to improve the economic life of our coiner of the Southern Highland Area. Conclusion Every day we are reminded of the intere loyal Pi Phis all over the country are taking project. Their gifts, so carefully packed, bring p and profit to many of the individuals we are to help. I wish to express my gratitude to the especially to Council and Committee for their hl consideration at all times. Respectfully submitted, RUTH I OWC AFT W EBSTER says a report is "to give an account of" but I am sure that would be repetition as that is given each month in Ruth Dyer's letter and other sources. Instead I am writing down some of the problems that come up during the year knowing there should be a solution that I have not found so far. The War Years have been hard for us too but it has done one good thing for Arrowcraft, proven that it is not necessary for the Clubs to send back quantities of goods. By keeping the quality good we should never have to go back to that. To encourage sales we have given the Clubs many privileges that no business firm would countenance. We can not begin to send them all they are going to want this year so I think it is the time to get on a still firmer foundation. Why should it not be a requirement that in order for a province to be 100% all bills to Arrowcraft must have been paid. Each year brings at least one headache over an account that has run on for a number of years, this year there have been two such. If there was that yearly accounting it would automatically bring anything wrong to the attention of the Province Officer and the Club itself. We used to preach early orders but by that was meant September and early October and not all in November and December. More people are expected to visit Gatlinburg in the years to come than ever before. There is not much point in having the lovely shop if we do not sell to these people. But that simply can not be done if we start saving for the Clubs in May. I have already had many inquiries. My manual reads "a letter to the Clubs in September telling about prospective things and including a new price list with thanks for what they have done." I have written it much earlier the past years to save myself so many personal letters. As you know it is not possible to be sure of all the things lasting through shipping that go on the price list in July. This year I am not sure of any thing so how can I tell them I will send large quantities of goods at a certain time. It is not fair to the small Clubs who also want small sales, big in their eyes, to send thirty six to fifty baby blankets to one Club. That might be the last thirty six the way things look right now. Rationing may come late to Arrowcraft but it looks as if it may be the fair thing to do. I have tried to be fair but it is the ones whoare most demanding that are the least underst It helps however to get bits like this from a chairman "I continue to be amazed at the gra you've been able to do with all the Iimitati, know exists." Most clubs do not get started again befog tember so as far as big sales are concernec should be an understanding that none can b until after that and that it is not possible tl in May and expect us to put the things away disappointment of summer trade and many sin orders. Allanstand and Southern Highlanders In been rationed this year. These days they could entire output and are glad to take it any time the year. Also I have had to tell all the small have been selling to that we can not send an until times are back to normal. I have tried them down easy as they are all old friends may need them again later on. Along w, headaches I am glad to report that more chi] settled their accounts in full than ever beft there is still another month before the audi Cole was able to draw the first red line for them in all the years I have been here and it h running for years before that.

REPORT OF THE JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HEALTF CENTER MAX 1944 MAY 1945 WENTY-FIVE years ago, during the season of T 1919-20, a "visiting nurses for the community" was engaged by the Settlement School Committee. By patience and understanding, confidence was established. The district of service was .purposely keptsmall, for travel by horseback was slow, as trips cut down sharply on the amount of w person could do. The eight years that Miss stayed at the Health Center, set the pattern years that followed.

Classes in Home Nursing for adults did not work out as we had hoped. Scarcity of Mother's helpers, and the press of war time living prevented regular group meetings for such a period. Nevertheless, two sets of classes were taught, one at Pi Beta Phi, and the other at Sevier County High School. Both groups were Home Economics classes, and were taught with the assistance of the Home Economics teachers. Certificates have been issued by the Red Cross, and some of the girls. have already been accepted into the Cadet Nurse Corps. Melinda Ogle Wadley, whose entire life has been spent in Gatlin-burg, will be graduated soon from a hospital in Memphis the first of our girls to complete nurses training. One of the most interesting events of the school year was the running of the Lunch Room. The excitement of remodeling and redecorating aroused interest to a high pitch. The day lunch was served for the first time, every child in the elementary school was weighed and measured. Charts were made for each room, showing each child's standing average, over or under weight. Three months later, when the Lunch Room closed, every child was rechecked and the results tabulated. Present for the entire test were 223 children. Of that number, 163 had gained a total of 428 lbs. from 1/2 to 9 lbs.. apiece. 107 had grown taller, from 1/4 to 13% inches. 26 had lost and 18 showed no change. In January, 51 were underweight. In April, 20 had gained up to or beyond their average, and 18 of the rest were gaining. The period of testing was short, and a child's weight varies quickly with illness, lack of sleep, or overactivity. So the results seem very satisfactory. Two children are now under treatment of an Orthopedic Surgeon for the correction of club feet. Both are wearing special shoes held in rigid position by metal rods. The three months old baby is nearly normal, and the other is improving. Margaret .was corrected when she was tiny, but the braced shoes were not worn long enough. Four years old is Margaret almost too old to make things right without surgery. Yes, life wags on "sortie like common" at the Health Center. The days are very full and very interesting. We are grateful for our friends here and all over the country, in the profession and out of it. There are so many of them, and together, we are making life a little easier, a little safer for each other. Following are the figures for the past year, and for the preceding period: Class of.

It really is something to be able to say that I have served Pi Beta Phi longer than any other person in the history of the Settlement School and I am not a Pi Phi. That fact has not kept me from giving to the school and the community my interest, my service, nor my loyalty through the years. Out of the twenty that have passed all too quickly, I have been employed at the Settlement School for 16 years. This has been in three periods, the last one being the longest 10 years this July. When I first came to Gatlinburg in September 1925 after a very hot and dusty ride over the new road that reached just to the front gate, I can re-member that the first thing I wanted was a bath with lots of water; but Gatlinburg was in the midst oft, a drought and as the electricity was made by a little come and go plant on the river in which there was not enough water to make it and consequently our pump run, I had to be satisfied with as little water as decency and the need required. We didn't have lights much either, nor any way to have refrigeration to keep meat, so not much meat was on our menu, nor any telephone. That did not come for many years after that time. But I did have a cordial welcome from all hands on the staff. Aunt Lizzie Reagan cooked for us then, those of us who lived at Teachers' Cottage, and kept us well in hand. Life was not unpleasant even without much electricity, telephone and radio. Gatlinburg wasn't much in those days. There was Charlie Ogle's store, the Squire's house and Jim Reagan's "Swinkey" where we could get ice cream in our immediate range of vision. The Mountain View. Hotel was just a little green frame building with a few rooms for guests and the Riverside Hotel had even less room. Hardy souls came to Gatlinburg for vacations in those days. I can remember three cars in town, Miss Evelyn's, 0. J. Mattil's and the Huff boys, those constant ,squires to the young teachers in the early days. Both of them later married Pi Phis. Then the cows roamed everywhere, sometimes it seemed as if there were profusions of cows. We were forever chasing our neighbors' mules out of our front yard as well as his chickens. The town could not boast of a lawn mower, baby carriage, church every Sunday, coal or electric stove, and only the Teachers' Cottage had both a bathroom and furnace. Otherwise modern plumbing was practically non-existent. When we wanted fun we made it ourselves, or went on a real binge and spent the week-end in Knoxville. Now and then there were flickering movies given in the top of the then new barn with the audience seated on bales of hay and sound effects provided by the cows, goats, and horses housed below. Power for the movies was made by hooking onto the motor of the venerable old Ford Station Wagon that was the special responsibility of Shot Reagan Shot who was to give his life for his country in this war. Trips to the Teachers' Cottage in the Sugarlands were planned with thoroughness and foresight for a ride up there by horseback or in a car that could hopfrom boulder to boulder was an event not to be taken lightly. In contrast to this picture of a sleepy little mountain village is our bustling tourist town, the Gatlin-burg of today, that adjoins the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I can count only 27 houses in the entire town that were being lived in in 1925 and are still occupied twenty years later. Everything else in the town has been built in the intervening years, most of it since 1932. Now our permanent population is about 1600 and there are hotel and cabin accommodations for three times that many, which are filled to capacity during the summer. We have a telephone exchange, public library, post office, four churches, a four-lane highway with sidewalks; and this year the town incorporated. The county runs the school now, with an attendance of 425 pupils quite a growth from the original 13 of the first Pi Beta Phi school. The first household convenience my weavers "wove out" after electricity was brought in from the outside was an electric iron, with washing ma-chines and bathrooms following. Now to go back to my story. After the effects from my trip down wore off, I asked Miss Evelyn what I was to do. Her reply was a masterpiece of understatement but I have never forgotten it, nor failed to appreciate the wisdom behind it. She said I was to teach weaving. My next question was "how and to whom" and she left me to my own devices when she said I was to find my job and make it. It was either sink or swim from then on. I chose swimming and the results will have to speak for themselves. Miss Phyllis helped me out with another bit of sage advice when in reply to my question "of what to talk about to these strange mountain women, she replied, "Flowers." The subject of flowers was my conversational backlog for many months to come. My first call in the community was to the home of Lulu Mae Ogle to see her mother who wove cover-lets. She was the oldest weaver in these parts and was a rich source for much interesting mountain history. She passed on her art of coverlet weaving to her daughter who now makes all our beautiful coverlets. I also made the acquaintance of my first mountain baby ' and a cute one he was, Van Ogle, who now rides in bombers. Of those first 8 or 10 weavers I found in the next few weeks, 2 of them are still making things for Arrowcraft. Shortly after this Nita Stark came in for her semi-annual Committee visit and there were many discussions about where my weaving apparatus and I were to be located. The looms were then in the old log cabin which did not provide sufficient resistance to the elements, so we decided, and proper space just did not seem to be available. Finally someone had a bright idea! Move the laundry from under the porch of the oTd Stuart Cottage and put me in there. No sooner said than done and I was moved in with 7 old looms; warping bars and a box or two in which to keep some supplies. Heat was supplied by a little old wood stove with the pipe stuck out a' window. We managed pretty well up there for the next three years until we moved again into the new high school building with lots and lots of room (now the 8th grade manages to squeeze into the same space). My greatest problem during those years was whether or not I would acquire a permanent stoop THE SEPTEMBER ARROW am very tall and the porch was very low rs lower than the floor above. My journeys end to the other were a bobbing sort of and between those rafters. There was no a table or desk so I carried all my records arm and my office was everywhere I hap-;it down. weaving had been done before I arrived on Not much, though, but still enough for ve a few women who were interested in ow to make ,new things. Our entire stock on the shelf in back of the door in what [iss Dyer's room. In a few months we hat space and had to put the towels and eon sets (nothing but blue or red borders) shelves in Miss Evelyn's office. I taught o the eighth grade girls and I never had a more interesting class than that first one of 't long before I began to see possibilities. e beginning to talk about a National Park -ea and if that came we could see where ple would come to this region. Lois Rogers, lylor, Miss Evelyn and I had long sessions [rig about it knowing full well that if it we were sitting in the midst of opporwas during the winter of 1926 that Arrow-born and I helped name the baby.

After that vcraft Shop moved to whatever space was e at the time from Stuart Cottage to the )m and porch of Teachers cottage and tuart Cottage, then finally into the building the road that was made of the old schoolth a new room added on the back.

What few weavers we lived distances from the school that were by rocky or muddy roads, depending on a, way up beyond the old Baskins school-id gradually as more women learned to )r the school," up into the Sugarlands. That I walked and walked, sometimes as much es a week to reach the women who wanted weaving. It took constant supervision to standards. Not only did I teach them how but how to hem, wash and iron and made lize that people actually used the articles e. The next year I decided to save myself walking so I ,rode a horse to the most )mes. The roads I went on were impassable itomobile, even if there had been an auto-: was not until 1928 that I did start to drive y that time there were more and more nd less and less time to make the rounds. in 1927 that I decided that part of my job to bring something beyond just weaving lives of the women with whom I was work-making friends. My first attempt at social a tea given at the Teachers' Cottage one ternoon. It was the only time we ever served Lountain women, coffee drinkers that they are. They were good sports and drank it though. One old woman said, "Law, if we're goin' to eat, I'll have to spit out my backy" and she did out the front door. From that small beginning grew our weaving meetings of later years, meetings to which the women looked forward from month to month. Through the years a variety of subjects and speakers have been brought to the women, from butter making to picture painting, from chicken raising to piano playing. We had Christmas parties with Christmas trees and presents, tacky parties, dinner at the hotel, picnics, and once a big banquet with all the fixings. There is no doubt in my mind that these varied educational and recreational programs have made our weavers broader in vision and background than those who have not had an opportunity to attend. They have been systematically exposed to University Extension lecturers, preachers, artists, and anyone else who could bring a message on some subject with which they were not familiar. In the fall of 1932 the group organized into the Gatlinburg Weavers Guild. This was always an in-formal set-up but the women felt from that time on that they were a definite unit and they started to sponsor community projects. The first one was the Wayside Market which had some measure of success for two years in selling farm produce at their stand on the main highway. The group next started the Gatlin-burg Garden Club in 1936. Until the war and Red Cross work took up the time of the women of the town, the Garden Club conducted a flourishing pro-gram. They were instrumental in having the State Highway Department plant the dogwood trees along the highway through the town, they planted and still maintain the little park opposite the Arrowcraft Shop and they cleaned off and keep in order the island in the river. They had several flower shows that before their discontinuance gained a wide reputation in East Tennessee. The activities of the Club have been suspended until times are again normal. The next project of the Weavers Guild was "play-acting." A desire for some money in their treasury prompted their play writing and acting. They gave four plays in all over a period of six years. The last one "Store Britches" which was written and acted by the weavers and members of their families, ran for three highly successful summer seasons. Tourists and townspeople alike enjoyed the fun and the old-timey mountain story. The money they made has been used by the weavers for a self-help fund from which they can borrow for medical attention and family emergencies. As much as $250 has been loaned at one time to different women. They have taken trips with expenses paid from the fund, the high-light being a trip to Norris Dam where many of them saw their first motor boat and had their first ride in one. They have made donations to the Red Cross and local charities from it and have helped some of their less fortunate members with gifts in periods of stress. When gas rationing . started our meetings were limited to one every two or three months. Perhaps at this point it would be interesting to go back and include some selections from my old yearly reports. They give an idea of the progress of the weaving department from year to year. In May 1926, I wrote, "The weaving situation in Gatlinburg is gradually but steadily growing into a commercial project of great economic value to the women in their homes. Just how extensive the development is to become depends upon the amount of weaving the school can and will handle. Our greatest problem THE SEPTEMBER ARROW .45 is that of supply and demand. The women can weave more than we are selling at the present time. It would be a great help to know just how extensive the , Committee wishes this department to be. There is room for growth and development." In May 1927 this came along. "As I look back upon this year's work in comparison with that of last year, I find that my problems of conducting the weaving department have changed a great deal. The greatest reason for this has been the amazing growth of sales of the weaving due to a greater interest shown by the Alumnae Clubs and to the Arrowcraft Shop which has been the only solution to the large tourist trade that has come to Gatlinburg for five spring and summer months. We were shipping a truck load of baskets and a dozen or so packages of weaving every day for two months before Christmas. The school handles the entire output of 41 looms. This does not include any of the looms that supply weaving for the three weaving shops that have started in Gatlinburg the past year." Then in May, 1928, "In looking over another year's development of the weaving department, it is interesting to note changes that have come through the increased commercial demands. There has been about a 33% increase in the business which has meant more organization among the women. There have been 40 women weaving for us during the year. The plan of selling materials to the women has kept our weaving of uniform quality. This amount of weaving can be increased many times as there are more women pleading for weaving than we can supply." My report of May 1929 is amusing in the light of subsequent events. I said, "This year I feel as if something definite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal has been reached than it is a condition that can be expiessed in so many words. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instructions. They are becoming experts in the mechanics of weaving. I have tried to . spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school this fall making a total of 50 weavers this year. This work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else." I did leave and Victoria Strand took over for the next 2 years. When she did not return in the fall of 1931, Miss Evelyn asked me to come back again. I was happy to do so. This was in the midst of the depression and in June 1932 I wrote, "In spite of the fact that all the weaving centers of the South have been turning off their weavers for the past year, we have had our usual number of women working for us. It is not easy to make hand-woven articles that will sell at a price that one considers inexpensive but that is the trend of the times. There have been 46 women weaving for the school this year with never less than 38 weaving at one time. Thirty new articles have been designed. This has required an almost complete turn-over of the stock but we hope that by offering a new line of articles to the Clubs this fall our trade will be stimulated." Then in June 1933 I wrote, "This has been a year of ups and downs for the weaving department. In November and December we had more weavers working than at any time since I first came here 8 years ago, then in January to March we had less weaversat work than when I started with the old faithful six or seven women. When the Bank in Sevierville closed in January we had to curtail our weaving pro-gram. In order not to weave beyond our income, it has been necessary to keep down the number of women weaving and yet keep a safe balance between the weaving in stock at the Shop and that being made by the women. We have tried to meet this situation by giving a short warp to two women instead of one long warp to one woman." With the general recovery from the depression, Arrowcraft and the weaving department had another boom. I stayed with it until Christmas of 1934 when again I left, this time for good so I thought. Miss Carr and then Mrs. Mitchell carried on the department until June 1935. Then Mrs. Weaver persuaded me to return once again so I came back to the same old job in a brand new place. This last 10 year period from June 1935 to June 1945 has been one of steady progress upward. It was with our move into the Voorheis Building in 1935 that the weaving department came into its own and no matter where it goes in the future, never will the weavers feel so at home nor as if they had a place all their own as they did during the five years we stayed in that building. It gave us the opportunity to have our meetings and all our many social activities in our own building and the women, as well as myself, loved it. I doubt if they will ever again feel as much a part of the school as they did during those years. We had the facilities for serving refreshments at the meetings and could do many extra things that have not, since been possible. They "wove for the school" as much for the activities we carried on as a group as they did for the money they earned. Each year they earned more and more money as the weaving demand kept increasing and we had to keep raising their pay to comply with the demands of the Wage and Hour Law. Although the average earnings at the present are lower than this, it is not unusual for a weaver to earn from $60 to $75 a month in her spare time at home. That represents a lot of weaving but one must remember that these women are very experienced and very fast. With the move from the Voorheis Building to the new Arrowcraft Shop building in 1940, the department became more streamlined as the business kept increasing from a slow pace when the war started to a skyrocketing period during the war when consumer goods were scarce and money plentiful. As I write this in May 1945, we are not meeting by half the possibilities for business that would be ours if we had the facilities, the weavers and the materials with which to meet it. It was necessary as time went on and the women were more busy at home when their men went to war, to drop all the extra activities that we had enjoyed so much during the preceding years. Figures are always interesting in a report so here are a few. In the ten years from June 1935 to June 1945, we have had a total of 242 women weave for us. Two of these have died. Of this total 138 wove for us last year, the greatest number in our history. We keep between 80 and 90 women weaving all the time. As women drop out we try to' fill their places with other women who already know how to weave. There is no time now to teach weaving to inexperienced women. The weavers have had 104 babies during this period including two sets of twins. This one fact has meant the loss of much time from their weaving as one of our rules requires that no woman can weave two months before or after the birth of a .baby, and only then with the permission of her 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW doctor, and most of the women take off more time than that. At one time four generations of Aunt ,Lizzie Reagan's family were weaving for us including Aunt Lizzie at the age of 85 years. Since the war started 29 weavers have had their husbands and 43 of their children enter the armed forces, one has been killed in action. One weaver had five children in service at the same time. Along in the early thirties we started the practise of supplying all the materials to the weavers and paying them for their labor by the piece. In 1939 we paid them $11,187.79 and for the 11 months just ending we have paid them $24,721.47. Our weaving has increased 105% in the past two years alone. Last year we wove 21,630 luncheon doilies and 17,621 luncheon napkins, 2,108 neck scarfs, 1482 square scarfs, 4202 bibs and 1085 baby blankets. Since 1935 we have women 26,287 underarm bags, 6011 last year alone and I am being conservative in saying we are hundreds behind on our orders. It is impossible to find weavers and materials for more than we are doing, In the last ten years I have designed 246 different woven articles in hundreds of color combinations. In the past seven years we have paid the weavers $109,417.18 for their work. Pi Beta Phi has reason to be proud of this record and I am proud to have had' a part in it with my women. This past year might well be called "Passing Previous Peaks." All of our records have been broken. There have been more weavers, more weaving made .and more money earned by the, weavers than ever before in our history. Our inventory of weaving supplies has had to be our largest in order to take advantage of buying materials when they were avail-able. In spite of planning at least 6 months ahead shortages of necessary materials have occurred. With both cotton and wool frozen for the first six months of 1945, it has been more difficult to operate. Fortunately I had placed large orders before the freeze went into effect and they were delivered in time to keep us going except for a period through the winter when our supply of wool was practically gone. By substituting odd lots of materials that I was able to buy and redesigning a few articles in order to use them, we have kept up as well as possible under the circumstances. It helped a great deal not to take the December inventory of weaving supplies. The weavers were very glad not to stop weaving for a month in the middle of the winter and it meant that we could build up our stock more than usual after the very heavy shipping season before Christmas. It has been possible to do this extra amount of weaving' only by eliminating the extra community activities of the past years for both the women and myself. One contributing factor in large measure has been the fact that the women have had to stay at home more with gas rationing and the absence of so many of their men. They have been weaving to fill up their time and as one of the young mothers told me, "It helps meforget Charlie is at war because I get so tired I just have to sleep." I have had to caution many of them not to overdo with the extra burdens they are carrying. With the coming of winter and muddy roads we discontinued our weekly trips to the Glades and Boogertown to take supplies and pick up weaving. Since then we have been relying on the mails and occasional trips to town by the women. I often wonder what the post-war period will do to Gatlinburg, the tourist travel in this region and the handicrafts of this whole area. With the educational program that will soon be started by the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild, of which we are a member, the summer school in crafts here at the school and all the other handicraft rehabilitation projects that are being started, it will no doubt mean that the Southern Highland area will lead in this country in the production of handicrafts of high standards. It will also mean continually keeping be-fore our workers the dignity of working with their hands, heads, and hearts for it takes all three to produce hand-made articles. The people in this section have more money than ever before in their lives, and as more tourists come into the region, more and more money will find its way into the homes of the mountain people. It might well be that this fact alone will , influence many women in their desire for and against weaving. This reconversion period and the future years will provide an excellent opportunity for the school to give supplementary programs that will keep the women stimulated and fill their need of more educational background. I still am on the Board of Trustees of the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild after completing 2 years as president. I am also on the Board of Directors of the Gatlinburg Public Library. The library continues to increase its service to the town and is building good reading habits in the children who use it with fervor. And so twenty years have passed for me. I am grateful to have had the privilege of working with the mountain women of this section. They have given me their trust and friendship and in turn I have tried to be fair and understanding with their problems. My department never could have succeeded without the encouragement and understanding given to me by the Grand Council and Settlement School Commit-tee members. Through the years they have helped me with their unfailing enthusiasm and sound judgments I am very grateful for that too. To have seen Gatlin-burg progress from an isolated mountain village to a modern incorporated town has been an unusual experience in this day and age when anything can and does happen. The people of this immediate area have acquired in one generation what usually takes two to three generations to accomplish. Then too, there has always been the friendship and loyalty of my co-workers to provide inspiration. It has been a privilege to be a part of it and it has been Fun! Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING THE SEPTEMBER ARROW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL GATLINItUl',.G, TENNESSEE R]EPOR ON AUDIT YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,. 1945 To the Settlement School Committee Pi Beta Phi Fraternity Office of Settlement School Treasurer Denver, Colorado DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined and tested the books of account and records of the Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1945, to the extent deemed necessary by us for an adequate audit for balance sheet and profit and loss statement purposes. The subsidiary records of the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, were not included in our audit. The report concerning those records rendered by Homer K.

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4. Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57

So, when an offer was the Health Center for . a short course at prings, for instruction in their methods of acceptance was made. Our knowledge of A disease is still too limited to spurn any ity that might be beneficial to the corn-The course will come just at the beginning rw fiscal year, and we sincerely hope that it ve to be a good insurance against possibletrouble, rather than needed aid. Classes in Home Nursing for adults did not work out as we had hoped. Scarcity of Mother's helpers, and the press of war time living prevented regular group meetings for such a period. Nevertheless, two sets of classes were taught, one at Pi Beta Phi, and the other at Sevier County High School. Both groups were Home Economics classes, and were taught with the assistance of the Home Economics teachers. Certificates have been issued by the Red Cross, and some of the girls. have already been accepted into the Cadet Nurse Corps. Melinda Ogle Wadley, whose entire life has been spent in Gatlin-burg, will be graduated soon from a hospital in Memphis the first of our girls to complete nurses training. One of the most interesting events of the school year was the running of the Lunch Room. The excitement of remodeling and redecorating aroused interest to a high pitch. The day lunch was served for the first time, every child in the elementary school was weighed and measured. Charts were made for each room, showing each child's standing average, over or under weight. Three months later, when the Lunch Room closed, every child was rechecked and the results tabulated. Present for the entire test were 223 children. Of that number, 163 had gained a total of 428 lbs. from 1/2 to 9 lbs.. apiece. 107 had grown taller, from 1/4 to 13% inches. 26 had lost and 18 showed no change. In January, 51 were underweight. In April, 20 had gained up to or beyond their average, and 18 of the rest were gaining. The period of testing was short, and a child's weight varies quickly with illness, lack of sleep, or overactivity. So the results seem very satisfactory. Two children are now under treatment of an Orthopedic Surgeon for the correction of club feet. Both are wearing special shoes held in rigid position by metal rods. The three months old baby is nearly normal, and the other is improving. Margaret .was corrected when she was tiny, but the braced shoes were not worn long enough. Four years old is Margaret almost too old to make things right without surgery. Yes, life wags on "sortie like common" at the Health Center. The days are very full and very interesting. We are grateful for our friends here and all over the country, in the profession and out of it. There are so many of them, and together, we are making life a little easier, a little safer for each other. Following are the figures for the past year, and for the preceding period: Class of.

It really is something to be able to say that I have served Pi Beta Phi longer than any other person in the history of the Settlement School and I am not a Pi Phi. That fact has not kept me from giving to the school and the community my interest, my service, nor my loyalty through the years. Out of the twenty that have passed all too quickly, I have been employed at the Settlement School for 16 years. This has been in three periods, the last one being the longest 10 years this July. When I first came to Gatlinburg in September 1925 after a very hot and dusty ride over the new road that reached just to the front gate, I can re-member that the first thing I wanted was a bath with lots of water; but Gatlinburg was in the midst oft, a drought and as the electricity was made by a little come and go plant on the river in which there was not enough water to make it and consequently our pump run, I had to be satisfied with as little water as decency and the need required. We didn't have lights much either, nor any way to have refrigeration to keep meat, so not much meat was on our menu, nor any telephone. That did not come for many years after that time. But I did have a cordial welcome from all hands on the staff. Aunt Lizzie Reagan cooked for us then, those of us who lived at Teachers' Cottage, and kept us well in hand. Life was not unpleasant even without much electricity, telephone and radio. Gatlinburg wasn't much in those days. There was Charlie Ogle's store, the Squire's house and Jim Reagan's "Swinkey" where we could get ice cream in our immediate range of vision. The Mountain View. Hotel was just a little green frame building with a few rooms for guests and the Riverside Hotel had even less room. Hardy souls came to Gatlinburg for vacations in those days. I can remember three cars in town, Miss Evelyn's, 0. J. Mattil's and the Huff boys, those constant ,squires to the young teachers in the early days. Both of them later married Pi Phis. Then the cows roamed everywhere, sometimes it seemed as if there were profusions of cows. We were forever chasing our neighbors' mules out of our front yard as well as his chickens. The town could not boast of a lawn mower, baby carriage, church every Sunday, coal or electric stove, and only the Teachers' Cottage had both a bathroom and furnace. Otherwise modern plumbing was practically non-existent. When we wanted fun we made it ourselves, or went on a real binge and spent the week-end in Knoxville. Now and then there were flickering movies given in the top of the then new barn with the audience seated on bales of hay and sound effects provided by the cows, goats, and horses housed below. Power for the movies was made by hooking onto the motor of the venerable old Ford Station Wagon that was the special responsibility of Shot Reagan Shot who was to give his life for his country in this war. Trips to the Teachers' Cottage in the Sugarlands were planned with thoroughness and foresight for a ride up there by horseback or in a car that could hopfrom boulder to boulder was an event not to be taken lightly. In contrast to this picture of a sleepy little mountain village is our bustling tourist town, the Gatlin-burg of today, that adjoins the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I can count only 27 houses in the entire town that were being lived in in 1925 and are still occupied twenty years later. Everything else in the town has been built in the intervening years, most of it since 1932. Now our permanent population is about 1600 and there are hotel and cabin accommodations for three times that many, which are filled to capacity during the summer. We have a telephone exchange, public library, post office, four churches, a four-lane highway with sidewalks; and this year the town incorporated. The county runs the school now, with an attendance of 425 pupils quite a growth from the original 13 of the first Pi Beta Phi school. The first household convenience my weavers "wove out" after electricity was brought in from the outside was an electric iron, with washing ma-chines and bathrooms following. Now to go back to my story. After the effects from my trip down wore off, I asked Miss Evelyn what I was to do. Her reply was a masterpiece of understatement but I have never forgotten it, nor failed to appreciate the wisdom behind it. She said I was to teach weaving. My next question was "how and to whom" and she left me to my own devices when she said I was to find my job and make it. It was either sink or swim from then on. I chose swimming and the results will have to speak for themselves. Miss Phyllis helped me out with another bit of sage advice when in reply to my question "of what to talk about to these strange mountain women, she replied, "Flowers." The subject of flowers was my conversational backlog for many months to come. My first call in the community was to the home of Lulu Mae Ogle to see her mother who wove cover-lets. She was the oldest weaver in these parts and was a rich source for much interesting mountain history. She passed on her art of coverlet weaving to her daughter who now makes all our beautiful coverlets. I also made the acquaintance of my first mountain baby ' and a cute one he was, Van Ogle, who now rides in bombers. Of those first 8 or 10 weavers I found in the next few weeks, 2 of them are still making things for Arrowcraft. Shortly after this Nita Stark came in for her semi-annual Committee visit and there were many discussions about where my weaving apparatus and I were to be located. The looms were then in the old log cabin which did not provide sufficient resistance to the elements, so we decided, and proper space just did not seem to be available. Finally someone had a bright idea! Move the laundry from under the porch of the oTd Stuart Cottage and put me in there. No sooner said than done and I was moved in with 7 old looms; warping bars and a box or two in which to keep some supplies. Heat was supplied by a little old wood stove with the pipe stuck out a' window. We managed pretty well up there for the next three years until we moved again into the new high school building with lots and lots of room (now the 8th grade manages to squeeze into the same space). My greatest problem during those years was whether or not I would acquire a permanent stoop THE SEPTEMBER ARROW am very tall and the porch was very low rs lower than the floor above. My journeys end to the other were a bobbing sort of and between those rafters. There was no a table or desk so I carried all my records arm and my office was everywhere I hap-;it down. weaving had been done before I arrived on Not much, though, but still enough for ve a few women who were interested in ow to make ,new things. Our entire stock on the shelf in back of the door in what [iss Dyer's room. In a few months we hat space and had to put the towels and eon sets (nothing but blue or red borders) shelves in Miss Evelyn's office. I taught o the eighth grade girls and I never had a more interesting class than that first one of 't long before I began to see possibilities. e beginning to talk about a National Park -ea and if that came we could see where ple would come to this region. Lois Rogers, lylor, Miss Evelyn and I had long sessions [rig about it knowing full well that if it we were sitting in the midst of opporwas during the winter of 1926 that Arrow-born and I helped name the baby. Lois and Ln the shop that first summer up in the ttage with a preponderance of baskets in father, who happened to be visiting me le, made the first official sale from the new L wooden salad fork and spoon. After that vcraft Shop moved to whatever space was e at the time from Stuart Cottage to the )m and porch of Teachers cottage and tuart Cottage, then finally into the building the road that was made of the old schoolth a new room added on the back. This k place in the fall of 1927 and the Shop there' until our fine new building was built With the activities of the weaving depart-the Arrowcraft Shop so closely interwoven, [ous moves to gain more room show how :pansion developed. ras rather rugged in those old days, espeyour weaving teacher. What few weavers we lived distances from the school that were by rocky or muddy roads, depending on a, way up beyond the old Baskins school-id gradually as more women learned to )r the school," up into the Sugarlands. That I walked and walked, sometimes as much es a week to reach the women who wanted weaving. It took constant supervision to standards. Not only did I teach them how but how to hem, wash and iron and made lize that people actually used the articles e. The next year I decided to save myself walking so I ,rode a horse to the most )mes. The roads I went on were impassable itomobile, even if there had been an auto-: was not until 1928 that I did start to drive y that time there were more and more nd less and less time to make the rounds. in 1927 that I decided that part of my job to bring something beyond just weaving lives of the women with whom I was work-making friends. My first attempt at social a tea given at the Teachers' Cottage one ternoon. It was the only time we ever served Lountain women, coffee drinkers that they are. They were good sports and drank it though. One old woman said, "Law, if we're goin' to eat, I'll have to spit out my backy" and she did out the front door. From that small beginning grew our weaving meetings of later years, meetings to which the women looked forward from month to month. Through the years a variety of subjects and speakers have been brought to the women, from butter making to picture painting, from chicken raising to piano playing. We had Christmas parties with Christmas trees and presents, tacky parties, dinner at the hotel, picnics, and once a big banquet with all the fixings. There is no doubt in my mind that these varied educational and recreational programs have made our weavers broader in vision and background than those who have not had an opportunity to attend. They have been systematically exposed to University Extension lecturers, preachers, artists, and anyone else who could bring a message on some subject with which they were not familiar. In the fall of 1932 the group organized into the Gatlinburg Weavers Guild. This was always an in-formal set-up but the women felt from that time on that they were a definite unit and they started to sponsor community projects. The first one was the Wayside Market which had some measure of success for two years in selling farm produce at their stand on the main highway. The group next started the Gatlin-burg Garden Club in 1936. Until the war and Red Cross work took up the time of the women of the town, the Garden Club conducted a flourishing pro-gram. They were instrumental in having the State Highway Department plant the dogwood trees along the highway through the town, they planted and still maintain the little park opposite the Arrowcraft Shop and they cleaned off and keep in order the island in the river. They had several flower shows that before their discontinuance gained a wide reputation in East Tennessee. The activities of the Club have been suspended until times are again normal. The next project of the Weavers Guild was "play-acting." A desire for some money in their treasury prompted their play writing and acting. They gave four plays in all over a period of six years. The last one "Store Britches" which was written and acted by the weavers and members of their families, ran for three highly successful summer seasons. Tourists and townspeople alike enjoyed the fun and the old-timey mountain story. The money they made has been used by the weavers for a self-help fund from which they can borrow for medical attention and family emergencies. As much as $250 has been loaned at one time to different women. They have taken trips with expenses paid from the fund, the high-light being a trip to Norris Dam where many of them saw their first motor boat and had their first ride in one. They have made donations to the Red Cross and local charities from it and have helped some of their less fortunate members with gifts in periods of stress. When gas rationing . started our meetings were limited to one every two or three months. Perhaps at this point it would be interesting to go back and include some selections from my old yearly reports. They give an idea of the progress of the weaving department from year to year. In May 1926, I wrote, "The weaving situation in Gatlinburg is gradually but steadily growing into a commercial project of great economic value to the women in their homes. Just how extensive the development is to become depends upon the amount of weaving the school can and will handle. Our greatest problem THE SEPTEMBER ARROW .45 is that of supply and demand. The women can weave more than we are selling at the present time. It would be a great help to know just how extensive the , Committee wishes this department to be. There is room for growth and development." In May 1927 this came along. "As I look back upon this year's work in comparison with that of last year, I find that my problems of conducting the weaving department have changed a great deal. The greatest reason for this has been the amazing growth of sales of the weaving due to a greater interest shown by the Alumnae Clubs and to the Arrowcraft Shop which has been the only solution to the large tourist trade that has come to Gatlinburg for five spring and summer months. We were shipping a truck load of baskets and a dozen or so packages of weaving every day for two months before Christmas. The school handles the entire output of 41 looms. This does not include any of the looms that supply weaving for the three weaving shops that have started in Gatlinburg the past year." Then in May, 1928, "In looking over another year's development of the weaving department, it is interesting to note changes that have come through the increased commercial demands. There has been about a 33% increase in the business which has meant more organization among the women. There have been 40 women weaving for us during the year. The plan of selling materials to the women has kept our weaving of uniform quality. This amount of weaving can be increased many times as there are more women pleading for weaving than we can supply." My report of May 1929 is amusing in the light of subsequent events. I said, "This year I feel as if something definite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal has been reached than it is a condition that can be expiessed in so many words. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instructions. They are becoming experts in the mechanics of weaving. I have tried to . spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school this fall making a total of 50 weavers this year. This work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else." I did leave and Victoria Strand took over for the next 2 years. When she did not return in the fall of 1931, Miss Evelyn asked me to come back again. I was happy to do so. This was in the midst of the depression and in June 1932 I wrote, "In spite of the fact that all the weaving centers of the South have been turning off their weavers for the past year, we have had our usual number of women working for us. It is not easy to make hand-woven articles that will sell at a price that one considers inexpensive but that is the trend of the times. There have been 46 women weaving for the school this year with never less than 38 weaving at one time. Thirty new articles have been designed. This has required an almost complete turn-over of the stock but we hope that by offering a new line of articles to the Clubs this fall our trade will be stimulated." Then in June 1933 I wrote, "This has been a year of ups and downs for the weaving department. In November and December we had more weavers working than at any time since I first came here 8 years ago, then in January to March we had less weaversat work than when I started with the old faithful six or seven women. When the Bank in Sevierville closed in January we had to curtail our weaving pro-gram. In order not to weave beyond our income, it has been necessary to keep down the number of women weaving and yet keep a safe balance between the weaving in stock at the Shop and that being made by the women. We have tried to meet this situation by giving a short warp to two women instead of one long warp to one woman." With the general recovery from the depression, Arrowcraft and the weaving department had another boom. I stayed with it until Christmas of 1934 when again I left, this time for good so I thought. Miss Carr and then Mrs. Mitchell carried on the department until June 1935. Then Mrs. Weaver persuaded me to return once again so I came back to the same old job in a brand new place. This last 10 year period from June 1935 to June 1945 has been one of steady progress upward. It was with our move into the Voorheis Building in 1935 that the weaving department came into its own and no matter where it goes in the future, never will the weavers feel so at home nor as if they had a place all their own as they did during the five years we stayed in that building. It gave us the opportunity to have our meetings and all our many social activities in our own building and the women, as well as myself, loved it. I doubt if they will ever again feel as much a part of the school as they did during those years. We had the facilities for serving refreshments at the meetings and could do many extra things that have not, since been possible. They "wove for the school" as much for the activities we carried on as a group as they did for the money they earned. Each year they earned more and more money as the weaving demand kept increasing and we had to keep raising their pay to comply with the demands of the Wage and Hour Law. Although the average earnings at the present are lower than this, it is not unusual for a weaver to earn from $60 to $75 a month in her spare time at home. That represents a lot of weaving but one must remember that these women are very experienced and very fast. With the move from the Voorheis Building to the new Arrowcraft Shop building in 1940, the department became more streamlined as the business kept increasing from a slow pace when the war started to a skyrocketing period during the war when consumer goods were scarce and money plentiful. As I write this in May 1945, we are not meeting by half the possibilities for business that would be ours if we had the facilities, the weavers and the materials with which to meet it. It was necessary as time went on and the women were more busy at home when their men went to war, to drop all the extra activities that we had enjoyed so much during the preceding years. Figures are always interesting in a report so here are a few. In the ten years from June 1935 to June 1945, we have had a total of 242 women weave for us. Two of these have died. Of this total 138 wove for us last year, the greatest number in our history. We keep between 80 and 90 women weaving all the time. As women drop out we try to' fill their places with other women who already know how to weave. There is no time now to teach weaving to inexperienced women. The weavers have had 104 babies during this period including two sets of twins. This one fact has meant the loss of much time from their weaving as one of our rules requires that no woman can weave two months before or after the birth of a .baby, and only then with the permission of her 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW doctor, and most of the women take off more time than that. At one time four generations of Aunt ,Lizzie Reagan's family were weaving for us including Aunt Lizzie at the age of 85 years. Since the war started 29 weavers have had their husbands and 43 of their children enter the armed forces, one has been killed in action. One weaver had five children in service at the same time. Along in the early thirties we started the practise of supplying all the materials to the weavers and paying them for their labor by the piece. In 1939 we paid them $11,187.79 and for the 11 months just ending we have paid them $24,721.47. Our weaving has increased 105% in the past two years alone. Last year we wove 21,630 luncheon doilies and 17,621 luncheon napkins, 2,108 neck scarfs, 1482 square scarfs, 4202 bibs and 1085 baby blankets. Since 1935 we have women 26,287 underarm bags, 6011 last year alone and I am being conservative in saying we are hundreds behind on our orders. It is impossible to find weavers and materials for more than we are doing, In the last ten years I have designed 246 different woven articles in hundreds of color combinations. In the past seven years we have paid the weavers $109,417.18 for their work. Pi Beta Phi has reason to be proud of this record and I am proud to have had' a part in it with my women. This past year might well be called "Passing Previous Peaks." All of our records have been broken. There have been more weavers, more weaving made .and more money earned by the, weavers than ever before in our history. Our inventory of weaving supplies has had to be our largest in order to take advantage of buying materials when they were avail-able. In spite of planning at least 6 months ahead shortages of necessary materials have occurred. With both cotton and wool frozen for the first six months of 1945, it has been more difficult to operate. Fortunately I had placed large orders before the freeze went into effect and they were delivered in time to keep us going except for a period through the winter when our supply of wool was practically gone. By substituting odd lots of materials that I was able to buy and redesigning a few articles in order to use them, we have kept up as well as possible under the circumstances. It helped a great deal not to take the December inventory of weaving supplies. The weavers were very glad not to stop weaving for a month in the middle of the winter and it meant that we could build up our stock more than usual after the very heavy shipping season before Christmas. It has been possible to do this extra amount of weaving' only by eliminating the extra community activities of the past years for both the women and myself. One contributing factor in large measure has been the fact that the women have had to stay at home more with gas rationing and the absence of so many of their men. They have been weaving to fill up their time and as one of the young mothers told me, "It helps meforget Charlie is at war because I get so tired I just have to sleep." I have had to caution many of them not to overdo with the extra burdens they are carrying. With the coming of winter and muddy roads we discontinued our weekly trips to the Glades and Boogertown to take supplies and pick up weaving. Since then we have been relying on the mails and occasional trips to town by the women. I often wonder what the post-war period will do to Gatlinburg, the tourist travel in this region and the handicrafts of this whole area. With the educational program that will soon be started by the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild, of which we are a member, the summer school in crafts here at the school and all the other handicraft rehabilitation projects that are being started, it will no doubt mean that the Southern Highland area will lead in this country in the production of handicrafts of high standards. It will also mean continually keeping be-fore our workers the dignity of working with their hands, heads, and hearts for it takes all three to produce hand-made articles. The people in this section have more money than ever before in their lives, and as more tourists come into the region, more and more money will find its way into the homes of the mountain people. It might well be that this fact alone will , influence many women in their desire for and against weaving. This reconversion period and the future years will provide an excellent opportunity for the school to give supplementary programs that will keep the women stimulated and fill their need of more educational background. I still am on the Board of Trustees of the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild after completing 2 years as president. I am also on the Board of Directors of the Gatlinburg Public Library. The library continues to increase its service to the town and is building good reading habits in the children who use it with fervor. And so twenty years have passed for me. I am grateful to have had the privilege of working with the mountain women of this section. They have given me their trust and friendship and in turn I have tried to be fair and understanding with their problems. My department never could have succeeded without the encouragement and understanding given to me by the Grand Council and Settlement School Commit-tee members. Through the years they have helped me with their unfailing enthusiasm and sound judgments I am very grateful for that too. To have seen Gatlin-burg progress from an isolated mountain village to a modern incorporated town has been an unusual experience in this day and age when anything can and does happen. The people of this immediate area have acquired in one generation what usually takes two to three generations to accomplish.

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4. Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57

        THE SEPTEMBER ARROW am very tall and the porch was very low rs lower than the floor above. My journeys end to the other were a bobbing sort of and between those rafters. There was no a table or desk so I carried all my records arm and my office was everywhere I hap-;it down. weaving had been done before I arrived on Not much, though, but still enough for ve a few women who were interested in ow to make ,new things. Our entire stock on the shelf in back of the door in what [iss Dyer's room. In a few months we hat space and had to put the towels and eon sets (nothing but blue or red borders) shelves in Miss Evelyn's office. I taught o the eighth grade girls and I never had a more interesting class than that first one of 't long before I began to see possibilities. e beginning to talk about a National Park -ea and if that came we could see where ple would come to this region. Lois Rogers, lylor, Miss Evelyn and I had long sessions [rig about it knowing full well that if it we were sitting in the midst of opporwas during the winter of 1926 that Arrow-born and I helped name the baby. Lois and Ln the shop that first summer up in the ttage with a preponderance of baskets in father, who happened to be visiting me le, made the first official sale from the new L wooden salad fork and spoon. After that vcraft Shop moved to whatever space was e at the time from Stuart Cottage to the )m and porch of Teachers cottage and tuart Cottage, then finally into the building the road that was made of the old schoolth a new room added on the back. This k place in the fall of 1927 and the Shop there' until our fine new building was built With the activities of the weaving depart-the Arrowcraft Shop so closely interwoven, [ous moves to gain more room show how :pansion developed. ras rather rugged in those old days, espeyour weaving teacher. What few weavers we lived distances from the school that were by rocky or muddy roads, depending on a, way up beyond the old Baskins school-id gradually as more women learned to )r the school," up into the Sugarlands. That I walked and walked, sometimes as much es a week to reach the women who wanted weaving. It took constant supervision to standards. Not only did I teach them how but how to hem, wash and iron and made lize that people actually used the articles e. The next year I decided to save myself walking so I ,rode a horse to the most )mes. The roads I went on were impassable itomobile, even if there had been an auto-: was not until 1928 that I did start to drive y that time there were more and more nd less and less time to make the rounds. in 1927 that I decided that part of my job to bring something beyond just weaving lives of the women with whom I was work-making friends. My first attempt at social a tea given at the Teachers' Cottage one ternoon. It was the only time we ever served Lountain women, coffee drinkers that they are. They were good sports and drank it though. One old woman said, "Law, if we're goin' to eat, I'll have to spit out my backy" and she did out the front door. From that small beginning grew our weaving meetings of later years, meetings to which the women looked forward from month to month. Through the years a variety of subjects and speakers have been brought to the women, from butter making to picture painting, from chicken raising to piano playing. We had Christmas parties with Christmas trees and presents, tacky parties, dinner at the hotel, picnics, and once a big banquet with all the fixings. There is no doubt in my mind that these varied educational and recreational programs have made our weavers broader in vision and background than those who have not had an opportunity to attend. They have been systematically exposed to University Extension lecturers, preachers, artists, and anyone else who could bring a message on some subject with which they were not familiar. In the fall of 1932 the group organized into the Gatlinburg Weavers Guild. This was always an in-formal set-up but the women felt from that time on that they were a definite unit and they started to sponsor community projects. The first one was the Wayside Market which had some measure of success for two years in selling farm produce at their stand on the main highway. The group next started the Gatlin-burg Garden Club in 1936. Until the war and Red Cross work took up the time of the women of the town, the Garden Club conducted a flourishing pro-gram. They were instrumental in having the State Highway Department plant the dogwood trees along the highway through the town, they planted and still maintain the little park opposite the Arrowcraft Shop and they cleaned off and keep in order the island in the river. They had several flower shows that before their discontinuance gained a wide reputation in East Tennessee. The activities of the Club have been suspended until times are again normal. The next project of the Weavers Guild was "play-acting." A desire for some money in their treasury prompted their play writing and acting. They gave four plays in all over a period of six years. The last one "Store Britches" which was written and acted by the weavers and members of their families, ran for three highly successful summer seasons. Tourists and townspeople alike enjoyed the fun and the old-timey mountain story. The money they made has been used by the weavers for a self-help fund from which they can borrow for medical attention and family emergencies. As much as $250 has been loaned at one time to different women. They have taken trips with expenses paid from the fund, the high-light being a trip to Norris Dam where many of them saw their first motor boat and had their first ride in one. They have made donations to the Red Cross and local charities from it and have helped some of their less fortunate members with gifts in periods of stress. When gas rationing . started our meetings were limited to one every two or three months. Perhaps at this point it would be interesting to go back and include some selections from my old yearly reports. They give an idea of the progress of the weaving department from year to year. In May 1926, I wrote, "The weaving situation in Gatlinburg is gradually but steadily growing into a commercial project of great economic value to the women in their homes. Just how extensive the development is to become depends upon the amount of weaving the school can and will handle. Our greatest problem THE SEPTEMBER ARROW .45 is that of supply and demand. The women can weave more than we are selling at the present time. It would be a great help to know just how extensive the , Committee wishes this department to be. There is room for growth and development." In May 1927 this came along. "As I look back upon this year's work in comparison with that of last year, I find that my problems of conducting the weaving department have changed a great deal. The greatest reason for this has been the amazing growth of sales of the weaving due to a greater interest shown by the Alumnae Clubs and to the Arrowcraft Shop which has been the only solution to the large tourist trade that has come to Gatlinburg for five spring and summer months. We were shipping a truck load of baskets and a dozen or so packages of weaving every day for two months before Christmas. The school handles the entire output of 41 looms. This does not include any of the looms that supply weaving for the three weaving shops that have started in Gatlinburg the past year." Then in May, 1928, "In looking over another year's development of the weaving department, it is interesting to note changes that have come through the increased commercial demands. There has been about a 33% increase in the business which has meant more organization among the women. There have been 40 women weaving for us during the year. The plan of selling materials to the women has kept our weaving of uniform quality. This amount of weaving can be increased many times as there are more women pleading for weaving than we can supply." My report of May 1929 is amusing in the light of subsequent events. I said, "This year I feel as if something definite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal has been reached than it is a condition that can be expiessed in so many words. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instructions. They are becoming experts in the mechanics of weaving. I have tried to . spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school this fall making a total of 50 weavers this year. This work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else." I did leave and Victoria Strand took over for the next 2 years. When she did not return in the fall of 1931, Miss Evelyn asked me to come back again. I was happy to do so. This was in the midst of the depression and in June 1932 I wrote, "In spite of the fact that all the weaving centers of the South have been turning off their weavers for the past year, we have had our usual number of women working for us. It is not easy to make hand-woven articles that will sell at a price that one considers inexpensive but that is the trend of the times. There have been 46 women weaving for the school this year with never less than 38 weaving at one time. Thirty new articles have been designed. This has required an almost complete turn-over of the stock but we hope that by offering a new line of articles to the Clubs this fall our trade will be stimulated." Then in June 1933 I wrote, "This has been a year of ups and downs for the weaving department. In November and December we had more weavers working than at any time since I first came here 8 years ago, then in January to March we had less weaversat work than when I started with the old faithful six or seven women. When the Bank in Sevierville closed in January we had to curtail our weaving pro-gram. In order not to weave beyond our income, it has been necessary to keep down the number of women weaving and yet keep a safe balance between the weaving in stock at the Shop and that being made by the women. We have tried to meet this situation by giving a short warp to two women instead of one long warp to one woman." With the general recovery from the depression, Arrowcraft and the weaving department had another boom. I stayed with it until Christmas of 1934 when again I left, this time for good so I thought. Miss Carr and then Mrs. Mitchell carried on the department until June 1935. Then Mrs. Weaver persuaded me to return once again so I came back to the same old job in a brand new place. This last 10 year period from June 1935 to June 1945 has been one of steady progress upward. It was with our move into the Voorheis Building in 1935 that the weaving department came into its own and no matter where it goes in the future, never will the weavers feel so at home nor as if they had a place all their own as they did during the five years we stayed in that building. It gave us the opportunity to have our meetings and all our many social activities in our own building and the women, as well as myself, loved it. I doubt if they will ever again feel as much a part of the school as they did during those years. We had the facilities for serving refreshments at the meetings and could do many extra things that have not, since been possible. They "wove for the school" as much for the activities we carried on as a group as they did for the money they earned. Each year they earned more and more money as the weaving demand kept increasing and we had to keep raising their pay to comply with the demands of the Wage and Hour Law. Although the average earnings at the present are lower than this, it is not unusual for a weaver to earn from $60 to $75 a month in her spare time at home. That represents a lot of weaving but one must remember that these women are very experienced and very fast. With the move from the Voorheis Building to the new Arrowcraft Shop building in 1940, the department became more streamlined as the business kept increasing from a slow pace when the war started to a skyrocketing period during the war when consumer goods were scarce and money plentiful. As I write this in May 1945, we are not meeting by half the possibilities for business that would be ours if we had the facilities, the weavers and the materials with which to meet it. It was necessary as time went on and the women were more busy at home when their men went to war, to drop all the extra activities that we had enjoyed so much during the preceding years. Figures are always interesting in a report so here are a few. In the ten years from June 1935 to June 1945, we have had a total of 242 women weave for us. Two of these have died. Of this total 138 wove for us last year, the greatest number in our history. We keep between 80 and 90 women weaving all the time. As women drop out we try to' fill their places with other women who already know how to weave. There is no time now to teach weaving to inexperienced women. The weavers have had 104 babies during this period including two sets of twins. This one fact has meant the loss of much time from their weaving as one of our rules requires that no woman can weave two months before or after the birth of a .baby, and only then with the permission of her 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW doctor, and most of the women take off more time than that. At one time four generations of Aunt ,Lizzie Reagan's family were weaving for us including Aunt Lizzie at the age of 85 years. Since the war started 29 weavers have had their husbands and 43 of their children enter the armed forces, one has been killed in action. One weaver had five children in service at the same time. Along in the early thirties we started the practise of supplying all the materials to the weavers and paying them for their labor by the piece. In 1939 we paid them $11,187.79 and for the 11 months just ending we have paid them $24,721.47. Our weaving has increased 105% in the past two years alone. Last year we wove 21,630 luncheon doilies and 17,621 luncheon napkins, 2,108 neck scarfs, 1482 square scarfs, 4202 bibs and 1085 baby blankets. Since 1935 we have women 26,287 underarm bags, 6011 last year alone and I am being conservative in saying we are hundreds behind on our orders. It is impossible to find weavers and materials for more than we are doing, In the last ten years I have designed 246 different woven articles in hundreds of color combinations. In the past seven years we have paid the weavers $109,417.18 for their work. Pi Beta Phi has reason to be proud of this record and I am proud to have had' a part in it with my women. This past year might well be called "Passing Previous Peaks." All of our records have been broken. There have been more weavers, more weaving made .and more money earned by the, weavers than ever before in our history. Our inventory of weaving supplies has had to be our largest in order to take advantage of buying materials when they were avail-able. In spite of planning at least 6 months ahead shortages of necessary materials have occurred. With both cotton and wool frozen for the first six months of 1945, it has been more difficult to operate. Fortunately I had placed large orders before the freeze went into effect and they were delivered in time to keep us going except for a period through the winter when our supply of wool was practically gone. By substituting odd lots of materials that I was able to buy and redesigning a few articles in order to use them, we have kept up as well as possible under the circumstances. It helped a great deal not to take the December inventory of weaving supplies. The weavers were very glad not to stop weaving for a month in the middle of the winter and it meant that we could build up our stock more than usual after the very heavy shipping season before Christmas. It has been possible to do this extra amount of weaving' only by eliminating the extra community activities of the past years for both the women and myself. One contributing factor in large measure has been the fact that the women have had to stay at home more with gas rationing and the absence of so many of their men. They have been weaving to fill up their time and as one of the young mothers told me, "It helps meforget Charlie is at war because I get so tired I just have to sleep." I have had to caution many of them not to overdo with the extra burdens they are carrying. With the coming of winter and muddy roads we discontinued our weekly trips to the Glades and Boogertown to take supplies and pick up weaving. Since then we have been relying on the mails and occasional trips to town by the women. I often wonder what the post-war period will do to Gatlinburg, the tourist travel in this region and the handicrafts of this whole area. With the educational program that will soon be started by the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild, of which we are a member, the summer school in crafts here at the school and all the other handicraft rehabilitation projects that are being started, it will no doubt mean that the Southern Highland area will lead in this country in the production of handicrafts of high standards. It will also mean continually keeping be-fore our workers the dignity of working with their hands, heads, and hearts for it takes all three to produce hand-made articles. The people in this section have more money than ever before in their lives, and as more tourists come into the region, more and more money will find its way into the homes of the mountain people. It might well be that this fact alone will , influence many women in their desire for and against weaving. This reconversion period and the future years will provide an excellent opportunity for the school to give supplementary programs that will keep the women stimulated and fill their need of more educational background. I still am on the Board of Trustees of the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild after completing 2 years as president. I am also on the Board of Directors of the Gatlinburg Public Library. The library continues to increase its service to the town and is building good reading habits in the children who use it with fervor. And so twenty years have passed for me. I am grateful to have had the privilege of working with the mountain women of this section. They have given me their trust and friendship and in turn I have tried to be fair and understanding with their problems. My department never could have succeeded without the encouragement and understanding given to me by the Grand Council and Settlement School Commit-tee members. Through the years they have helped me with their unfailing enthusiasm and sound judgments I am very grateful for that too. To have seen Gatlin-burg progress from an isolated mountain village to a modern incorporated town has been an unusual experience in this day and age when anything can and does happen. The people of this immediate area have acquired in one generation what usually takes two to three generations to accomplish. Then too, there has always been the friendship and loyalty of my co-workers to provide inspiration. It has been a privilege to be a part of it and it has been Fun! Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B.

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4. Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57

        46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW doctor, and most of the women take off more time than that. At one time four generations of Aunt ,Lizzie Reagan's family were weaving for us including Aunt Lizzie at the age of 85 years. Since the war started 29 weavers have had their husbands and 43 of their children enter the armed forces, one has been killed in action. One weaver had five children in service at the same time. Along in the early thirties we started the practise of supplying all the materials to the weavers and paying them for their labor by the piece. In 1939 we paid them $11,187.79 and for the 11 months just ending we have paid them $24,721.47. Our weaving has increased 105% in the past two years alone. Last year we wove 21,630 luncheon doilies and 17,621 luncheon napkins, 2,108 neck scarfs, 1482 square scarfs, 4202 bibs and 1085 baby blankets. Since 1935 we have women 26,287 underarm bags, 6011 last year alone and I am being conservative in saying we are hundreds behind on our orders. It is impossible to find weavers and materials for more than we are doing, In the last ten years I have designed 246 different woven articles in hundreds of color combinations. In the past seven years we have paid the weavers $109,417.18 for their work. Pi Beta Phi has reason to be proud of this record and I am proud to have had' a part in it with my women. This past year might well be called "Passing Previous Peaks." All of our records have been broken. There have been more weavers, more weaving made .and more money earned by the, weavers than ever before in our history. Our inventory of weaving supplies has had to be our largest in order to take advantage of buying materials when they were avail-able. In spite of planning at least 6 months ahead shortages of necessary materials have occurred. With both cotton and wool frozen for the first six months of 1945, it has been more difficult to operate. Fortunately I had placed large orders before the freeze went into effect and they were delivered in time to keep us going except for a period through the winter when our supply of wool was practically gone. By substituting odd lots of materials that I was able to buy and redesigning a few articles in order to use them, we have kept up as well as possible under the circumstances. It helped a great deal not to take the December inventory of weaving supplies. The weavers were very glad not to stop weaving for a month in the middle of the winter and it meant that we could build up our stock more than usual after the very heavy shipping season before Christmas. It has been possible to do this extra amount of weaving' only by eliminating the extra community activities of the past years for both the women and myself. One contributing factor in large measure has been the fact that the women have had to stay at home more with gas rationing and the absence of so many of their men. They have been weaving to fill up their time and as one of the young mothers told me, "It helps meforget Charlie is at war because I get so tired I just have to sleep." I have had to caution many of them not to overdo with the extra burdens they are carrying. With the coming of winter and muddy roads we discontinued our weekly trips to the Glades and Boogertown to take supplies and pick up weaving. Since then we have been relying on the mails and occasional trips to town by the women. I often wonder what the post-war period will do to Gatlinburg, the tourist travel in this region and the handicrafts of this whole area. With the educational program that will soon be started by the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild, of which we are a member, the summer school in crafts here at the school and all the other handicraft rehabilitation projects that are being started, it will no doubt mean that the Southern Highland area will lead in this country in the production of handicrafts of high standards. It will also mean continually keeping be-fore our workers the dignity of working with their hands, heads, and hearts for it takes all three to produce hand-made articles. The people in this section have more money than ever before in their lives, and as more tourists come into the region, more and more money will find its way into the homes of the mountain people. It might well be that this fact alone will , influence many women in their desire for and against weaving. This reconversion period and the future years will provide an excellent opportunity for the school to give supplementary programs that will keep the women stimulated and fill their need of more educational background. I still am on the Board of Trustees of the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild after completing 2 years as president. I am also on the Board of Directors of the Gatlinburg Public Library. The library continues to increase its service to the town and is building good reading habits in the children who use it with fervor. And so twenty years have passed for me. I am grateful to have had the privilege of working with the mountain women of this section. They have given me their trust and friendship and in turn I have tried to be fair and understanding with their problems. My department never could have succeeded without the encouragement and understanding given to me by the Grand Council and Settlement School Commit-tee members. Through the years they have helped me with their unfailing enthusiasm and sound judgments I am very grateful for that too. To have seen Gatlin-burg progress from an isolated mountain village to a modern incorporated town has been an unusual experience in this day and age when anything can and does happen. The people of this immediate area have acquired in one generation what usually takes two to three generations to accomplish. Then too, there has always been the friendship and loyalty of my co-workers to provide inspiration. It has been a privilege to be a part of it and it has been Fun! Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B.

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4. Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4. Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4. Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4. Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57

Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4.

EPORT OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL CHM It MA T HE ONE and only success which is man's to command is to bring to his work a mighty heart." This one item toward success has surely been the basic quality with which the SettleMent School Committee members have met their various responsibilities this past year, and to "the mighty heart" probably goes a major part of the credit for the partial success of some of the achievements which have been hopes and dreams for years. This has been another year of harmonious working by Settlement School Committee members, with each one attending to her individual duties with enthusiasm and ability, and assisting materially in every phase of general committee functioning. Summer Workshop at Success! Paramount among the fulfilled dreams was the actuality of the Summer Workshop, opening June 11 and dosing July 18 a craft course on university level with outstanding artists in their respective fields to lead it. While not the development of the original concept of the artist colony at Gatlinburg, it proved to be a most successful venture in all aspects for which the committee had hoped. With the cooperation of the University of Tennessee, and specifically the interest, enthusiasm, and vision of their Head of the Home Economics Department, Jessie W. Harris, Pi Beta Phi convention initiate of 1938, university credit was given for four courses: weaving, recreational crafts, woodworking, and community recreation. Classes were conducted on a work-shop basis with each individual attending certain prescribed lectures and then branching into creative work of her own choice. Some fifty students from nineteen states, ranging as far away as California, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and New Mexico, were housed in local homes, tourist cabins, and hotels under the direction of our Settlement School Director, Ruth Dyer, and were so enthusiastic that it was only with difficulty that the staff could close the Workshop doors long enough to get to Pollard Cottage for those delicious Settlement School meals, the specialty of Miss Hodgens, House Manager. The personality of the staff and their manner of teaching were such that each student was able to secure help on the individual problems she was most interested in, whether she be a Craft teacher wanting to know the best way to teach handcraft to children in the lower grades, or a Home Demonstration agent desiring to interest women in a variety of crafts for home decoration, or a person not interested in credit but attending only to make beautiful things for the joy of making and the pleasure of using them, or a recreational leader anxious to show a community how best to enjoy themselves through social recreation all this and much more was taught at the Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop at Gatlinburg this summer, combined with a philosophy which encouraged individuality and the flowering of the student's creative ability to its utmost. Small wonder that our advertising for a second session will be aided by the personal praise of these students from this year's classes. Pi Beta Phi's "jewel" the work it has done in Gatlinburg for so many years to aid the mountain people there and to sponsor beautiful handcrafts now glistens with a newbrilliance, for its influence and scope hav( larged in almost untold measure, each stud( as a newly-cut facet, reflecting in her home ( the enthusiasm felt at Gatlinburg, and thanks to Pi Beta Phi and the University o. for making this opportunity possible. Much of the success for this venture was Director and weaving instructor, Eha Ulbri organizing abilities were responsible for a varied craft school, utilizing the faciliti high school and Craft department, and addii most generous loans from the Milwaul Project, developed by Miss Ulbricht in re, Pi Beta Phi's sincerest thanks go to her co-workers, Josephine Arnquist Bakke, thoroughly understood and carried out tt recreational program envisioned by us, G ford, talented artist and woodworker "Woodshed" in the Arts and Crafts Cente of machinery was always heard, and Hazel teacher of recreational crafts, who had to ten to twelve students on entirely differe at the same time from leather gloves, thr^ prints, to plastics. Plans are already under way for anotl next year. This will follow much the saJ as proved so successful in this first Woi it will be well for all interested Pi Beta 1 reservations in early for 1946 as, in all it will be necessary to limit enrollment. Additions to the School Curriculum Two other goals were achieved this pas lesser degree perhaps, and with similar cc to the original plan, but with good resultsing of physical education by an additiona teacher, Lon Moneyhun, and the second si elusion of music in the curriculum, wit McWilliams Young, Pi Beta Phi of Ohic vising music with regular periods in each teaching a chorus of high school students. that both of these additions to the scho continued in the future, and if possible, el The County-Pi Beta Phi agreement has satisfactory as in the preceding year. We approximately the same support of th budget, and added to our assistance in the teachers, paying all costs of the music tea( semester, the part-time physical education t the Arts and Crafts department, consists former full-time teacher, Elizabeth Petrie, a part-time teacher, Mr. Carl Huskey, in ing. The county continued to use the gr building as well as the high school, takii step towards the erection of their own gi building by asking the state school archit Gatlinburg and see the proposed site in for drafting the first plans. Enrollment was again heavy in the lo-and the County secured an additional gi teacher, to be continued this coming year enrollment in the grades reached 328, teachers provided by county funds. The 1C the high school were taught by five teachers, augmented by those furnished by ] A full-time janitor has been employed by 37 38 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW who, this summer, has been doing the necessary paint and repair work in the high school building and keeping the school lawn and playground mowed. Pi Beta Phi used part of the high school building for the summer workshop, providing the necessary janitorial service during that period. Several resignations among the staff this spring have been filled with the only vacancy at the present time in the first grade room. The position of music supervisor has not yet been filled by Pi Beta Phi. The PTA was revived this past year, joining the state and national associations. They were responsible for carrying out a most successful hot lunch program, assisted by the county who donated paint and materials for redecorating the room, and by Pi Beta Phi, who built a new entrance to the room which fulfilled the state regulations for fire exits of dining-rooms. During the fall visit of the chairman, Pi Beta Phi's gift to the school, the lovely stage curtain and cyclorama, was officially dedicated. At a well-planned evening program including musical numbers by grade and high school students, acceptance thank-yous were given by students and a representative of the community, 'Mr. Medlin. This seemed to serve as a splendid opportunity for stressing the cooperation between Pi Beta Phi and the community in this Settlement School program. Emma Harper Turner Craft Center Dedication Two open houses were given during the Summer Workshop one at the end of each three-week period. Students worked on actual projects, explaining the process to the many interested tourists and towns-people who attended. At the second of these, on July 16, a short outdoor program preceded the tour of the workshop, presided over by Emma Woerner, Committee member, and during which a pantomime was presented by the Community Recreation class and the Arts and Crafts building was dedicated by Miss Amy Onken, Grand President, as the Emma Harper Turner Crafts Center, a beautifully carved wooden sign made by George Barford being placed on the building at that time. Here in the Crafts Center this past year was developed an enlarged program for grade and high school students which, according to Miss Petrie's repOrt, "was successful both in pleasure and in the knowledge gained." High school girls worked at a variety of crafts, but weaving retained first place in their interest and some really splendid articles were made. Boys worked under Carl Huskey making attractive small wooden articles and even completing four table looms for use in the Summer Workshop. They will make more of these this coming year so that each grade room may have one for demonstration and practice. Art work in the grades showed marked improvement over the preceding year, which as you remember was the first year this had been offered in the school. The members of Committee were interested in an exhibit of some of the work done, ranging from the simple designs made by first grade children by arrangjng and pasting cut pieces of colored paper, to the original posters and masks made in the upper' grades. The same goal continued this year that of making things which could be duplicated at home with little expense so that this new ability might be utilized in the home life of the students. Rationing at Arrowcraft' While the joyous news of V-J Day's approach makes us hopeful that there will soon be relief evenfor our much-troubled but ever-capable manager of Arrowcraft, Ethel Snow, it is going to be necessary to "ration" articles sent to the alumnae clubs this coming fall. Even with Arrowcraft producing far more than ever before, though it has often been necessary to discontinue certain items because of lack of materials, impossibility of producing under the OPA ceiling, or a similar wartime cause, production has been unable to keep up with the greatly increased demands. Arrowcraft Shop itself cannot keep a large enough supply on hand to meet the requests of the buying tourist trade there, Every effort will be made on the part of the Pi Beta Phi staff to see that as many clubs are served with as large a percentage of their orders as is possible; cheerful acceptance of this situation is the contribution we of the alumna clubs must make until such time as conditions change. Regular Staff Personnel The regular staff at the Settlement School has remained the same this past year. Miss Ruth Dyer, Director, continues to direct the thousand and one activities that such an establishment includes, and keeps the School as a whole functioning miraculously well during these times when it is so difficult to secure adequate or qualified help. Under her super-vision, and oft-times with the assistance of our maintenance man, Arlie Watson, repairs authorized by the committee have been made, including the addition of a partition between the front and back rooms at the Arts and Crafts Center, a double door at the back to allow easy moving of looms, roof repairs of the barn and sheds, repair of gates and some rebuilding of fences, necessary minor repairs and painting. No major building was done this past year, although plans are now being started for a new Health Center building. Lean Hodgins, House Manager, has added to her regular duties the chaperoning of the girl's dormitory. Carl Ogle and Elvin Trentham have continued their care of the demonstration farm during this period without an Agriculture teacher. Arrowcraft Shop added two salesgirls, Arbutus Ogle and Lois Watson, to the former staff consisting of Ethel Snow, Winogene Redding, Lura Owenby, and Bess Chance; and Georgia Duffield continues in charge of the Mountain View Hotel shop. Health Center is the busy domain of the nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, whose full report is included in this issue, in spite of the fact that the building itself demands almost immediate replacement. This, we hope, will be possible in the near future. "The Mighty Hearts" The Settlement School Committee personnel, also, has remained the same this year as last. Secretary Ann Munn, also Contact Member for Arts and Crafts, visited the school in the spring to see the craft classes in operation and to assist with the detailed planning for the summer session. Conferences were held with staff members of the University of Tennessee, and with Miss Ulbricht, then in Milwaukee. Mrs. Munn also attended meetings of the Mountain Workers and the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild in Montreat, at the latter of which plans were made for the incorporation of the Guild as a non-profit organization. Arrowcraft has been an integral part of the Guild since its founding and it was fitting that it was during the presidency of our Weaving Supervisor, Winogene Redding, that this step was taken, and by virtue thereof became the recipients of a three year grant from the General Education Board THE SEPTEMBER ARROW which will aid in furthering the development of handcrafts in the entire Southern Highland area. Beth LeRoy, publicity member on Committee, continued her interesting monthly letters to province vice-presidents and sent a most enlightening and entertaining letter to all active chapter and alumnae clubs, describing a visit to the School, arranged so that it could be used as a basis for talks given in conjunction with the place mat maps. We shall miss Beth on the Committee, for her term expired at this last meeting time; we shall miss her enthusiasm, her love of Settlement School work, and her building spirits. We welcomed Eugenia Smith (Mrs. G. Herbert), as new Committee member, member of Indiana r, who brings a rich heritage of Pi Beta Phi experiences, most recent of which was the installation of the new chapter on the campus of Willamette University, where her husband is president. Lolita Prouty, treasurer, has continued to meet difficult days with the bother of withholding taxes, Social Security, and other regulations and reports now imposed on anyone taking charge of accounts; but her fine attention to all details have given us accurate and complete reports regularly. Emma Woerner has been busy keeping engagements Community FOGRESS is the law of life." Pi Beta Phi is living up to its past achievements in bringing to Gatlin-burg, in conjunction with the University of Tennessee, a Summer Workshop in Crafts. We look forward to almost endless possibilities to be derived from this new program in wonderful development for the school and the whole region. Changes in village life are taking place. Perhaps the one most far reaching in its scope is the incorporation of the village, voted in the spring. Better sanitation and law enforcement will certainly result from this step. Pi Beta Phi will have some say in town affairs since we now have two representatives, Miss Evelyn Bishop and Mrs. Ethel Snow, on the Chamber of Commerce Board. During the winter a Lion's Club was organized and the American Legion members living in town withdrew from the Sevierville Post to start one of their own. The Methodist congregation have been given a site for a church building which will be built as soon as conditions permit. One Sunday this congregation and the one from Pigeon Forge used our Auditorium for morning service when Bishop Kern spoke. School Sevier County has cooperated well with us this past year. They have provided a janitor, now on a twelve months' basis. While certain repairs have not been made to the buildings .the fault lies not with the wish of the county board but with war time shortages of materials and labor. Greater interest in school activities has been evidenced all year in the crowds attending any and all functions connected with the school program. Basket-ball crowds made us long for a larger gym. The plays given by the senior and junior classes, the big Halloween Carnival, the Open House evening, the program given by the elementary school children and the graduation exercises for both the eighth grade and the high school were all well attended by parents and friends of the school. These various entertainments were of the same high quality as those given for her films, and some twenty chapters and c: had their inspiration this past year. Charact comments received from alumnae clubs is ing: "The films (of the Settlement Schoc greatly enjoyed, in fact, I think I am safe they made the hit of the year at our alue meeting.

Respectfully submitted, MILDREI REPORT OF DIRECTOR in the past. One big contributing factor to the has been the new stage curtains and cycle stalled last fall. These make it possible to proper background, add dignity and have t. influence on the deportment of the children.

This was repeated at church night of the Methodists. Twenty six children finished the eighth j 40 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW twelve graduated from the high school. Through aid given by us in transportation, eleven children from Elkmont were enrolled in our lower grades. PTA cooperation with the school program has been especially fine all year. Their main project was serving a hot meal at noon to the children in the elementary school. Government aid made it possible to serve one hot dish, with milk, for ten cents a day per child. It was necessary to clean up the old basement room and to buy a new stove. Pi Phi helped with the repair and a big rummage sale plus individual contributions provided the needed equipment. Different mothers helped to make the project a success. At the Commencement Exercises Mrs. J. Donahoe, president of PTA, presented four awards of five dollars each to the student in each class who had shown the most improvement in their studies during the year. For the first time this organization affiliated with the national organization. Farm With food shortages in so many places we are fortunate to be able to produce so much of the necessary food for our school family and to have a surplus to sell. The milk, cream, eggs, chickens, honey, vegetables, blackberries that grow on our own hill-sides, strawberries from our own bed, apples from the orchard help to supply our table with the finest of food. Weekly sales of eggs and all the fryers we could spare to the Mountain View Hotel, the sale of sixteen young pigs and surplus vegetables have added cash, much needed to offset the high feed costs. All departments of the farm will show a small profit this year. We were able to grow enough hay for the live-stock. The mules have done their bit in helping many a person with garden plowing or extra farm work. They have earned over $150.00 for us by this service. We sold one of our old Jersey cows and replaced her with a good grade cow, half Jersey and half Holstein. This cow will be sold after our three fine pure bred jersey heifers begin to produce. The gates on the place were old and in need of replacement. This was done in the bad weather in the winter. As much fence was built as could be done with the help that we had. The barn roof was reshingled. Dormitory For the most of the year we had seven girls and three boys in the school family. It is worth while to note the changes that take place in the individual students during nine months of living in our dormitories. They gain poise and confidence in themselves, their personal appearance changes for the better and they usually gain in weight. One boy gained twenty five pounds this past nine months. Much credit is due Miss Hodgen for the very fine way in which she trains the girls in their housekeeping duties. They are in demand as waitresses. Probably due to the fact that there is more money in the community than ever before, more of the students are meeting their financial obligations to the school. One former Dormitory boy, looking very smart in his uniform with overseas ribbons, came and settled an old bill that had been running for two years. A girl who graduated last year and has since been working in a defense plant, sent a check for $86.25 to cover her entire bill. Her appreciation to Pi Beta Phi was expressed thus "If it were possible money could not buy the many helpful things I learned at the School. Many thanks to the Dormitory, School and congenial instructors." Several times during the semester the girls haveplanned parties to which other high school students and boys home on leave were invited. All the young people seem to love to come to Stewart Cottage. The girls plan the decorations, games and refreshments, often bringing sugar from home to make the cakes and cookies that they serve. Health Center The Pi Phi nurse has such varied duties that words seem inadequate to report them. She visits the homes where there is illness; gives advice and help in maternity and infant welfare; inspects regularly the children of our school and other surrounding ones; gives the necessary inoculations; treats injuries not serious enough for a doctor's care; conducts classes in Home Nursing and First Aid; takes patients in town to the different hospitals, has a regular clinic day and even helps the tourists in such emergencies as heart attacks and acute sunburn. In the elementary school the children were weighed and talks on nutrition given at the beginning of the school lunch program. Charts were made for each room. Both children and parents were interested in progress made and recorded as the program developed. Mrs. Chalmers had a nice honor come to her in that she was chosen as the representative from Sevier County to attend a short course in the treatment of the after effects of. Infantile Paralysis at Warm Springs, Georgia. This course was sponsored by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. Several generous gifts have been made to further the health program. The Dallas Evening group sent boxes of needed surgical dressings. Through Beth LeRoy a Chase doll was secured for demonstration purposes. Sigma Phi Gamma again sent $50.00 which was used for eye correction work and to purchase glasses for needy children. The largest gift of all, $200.00 from the Chicago North Alumnae Club, is awaiting the time when certain equipment may be purchased. Arrowcraft We still have what economists call a Seller's Market. This makes the yearly report of our shop quite a different story from the ones in the years in which we were trying to establish a market and urging all the clubs to help sell our products. Now, production cannot keep up with the demand, Ethel Snow has had to refuse to sell anything to the many small dealers who helped out by selling Arrowcraft products in the lean years. Both of the Southern Highlands Inc: Shops, one in Radio City and the other at Norris Dam, Tennessee or the Shop of the Southern High-land Handicraft Guild in Asheville could have taken our full output. Instead they have been rationed in order to keep goods to sell to the people who come direct to the shop and to send to our alumnie clubs. The gross sales for eleven months of the year came to an all time high of $85,093.67, This is $16,387.93 more than the total for last year. This clearly proves that in spite of war" time restrictions, shortages in materials and labor that our humble beginnings have blossomed into a real business. The many club chair-men have helped to swell these totals. Eight clubs have sold over one thousand dollars worth of Arrow-craft goods. These are, Kansas City, Missouri, Port-land, Oregon, Champaign, Illinois, San Francisco, Berkeley, Denver, Franklin, Indiana, and Milwaukee. Ten other clubs have sales above $700.00. These are Dallas, Tulsa, Boston plus LeRoy, Albany, St. Louis, Cleveland, Marin County, California, Lafayette, Indiana, Madison and Manhattan, Kansas. It should be remembered that these figures do not paint a true THE SEPTEMBER ARROW picture for some clubs would have sold much more if they could have obtained the goods. Will we have to follow Government practices and work out a ration system so that all may share alike? The shop is still the most attractive one in the village, one that every Pi Phi can be proud of, knowing that it represents the fraternity to the tourists and stands for the things we have done to improve the economic life of our coiner of the Southern Highland Area. Conclusion Every day we are reminded of the intere loyal Pi Phis all over the country are taking project. Their gifts, so carefully packed, bring p and profit to many of the individuals we are to help. I wish to express my gratitude to the especially to Council and Committee for their hl consideration at all times. Respectfully submitted, RUTH I OWC AFT W EBSTER says a report is "to give an account of" but I am sure that would be repetition as that is given each month in Ruth Dyer's letter and other sources. Instead I am writing down some of the problems that come up during the year knowing there should be a solution that I have not found so far. The War Years have been hard for us too but it has done one good thing for Arrowcraft, proven that it is not necessary for the Clubs to send back quantities of goods. By keeping the quality good we should never have to go back to that. To encourage sales we have given the Clubs many privileges that no business firm would countenance. We can not begin to send them all they are going to want this year so I think it is the time to get on a still firmer foundation. Why should it not be a requirement that in order for a province to be 100% all bills to Arrowcraft must have been paid. Each year brings at least one headache over an account that has run on for a number of years, this year there have been two such. If there was that yearly accounting it would automatically bring anything wrong to the attention of the Province Officer and the Club itself. We used to preach early orders but by that was meant September and early October and not all in November and December. More people are expected to visit Gatlinburg in the years to come than ever before. There is not much point in having the lovely shop if we do not sell to these people. But that simply can not be done if we start saving for the Clubs in May. I have already had many inquiries. My manual reads "a letter to the Clubs in September telling about prospective things and including a new price list with thanks for what they have done." I have written it much earlier the past years to save myself so many personal letters. As you know it is not possible to be sure of all the things lasting through shipping that go on the price list in July. This year I am not sure of any thing so how can I tell them I will send large quantities of goods at a certain time. It is not fair to the small Clubs who also want small sales, big in their eyes, to send thirty six to fifty baby blankets to one Club. That might be the last thirty six the way things look right now. Rationing may come late to Arrowcraft but it looks as if it may be the fair thing to do. I have tried to be fair but it is the ones whoare most demanding that are the least underst It helps however to get bits like this from a chairman "I continue to be amazed at the gra you've been able to do with all the Iimitati, know exists." Most clubs do not get started again befog tember so as far as big sales are concernec should be an understanding that none can b until after that and that it is not possible tl in May and expect us to put the things away disappointment of summer trade and many sin orders. Allanstand and Southern Highlanders In been rationed this year. These days they could entire output and are glad to take it any time the year. Also I have had to tell all the small have been selling to that we can not send an until times are back to normal. I have tried them down easy as they are all old friends may need them again later on. Along w, headaches I am glad to report that more chi] settled their accounts in full than ever beft there is still another month before the audi Cole was able to draw the first red line for them in all the years I have been here and it h running for years before that. It has become a habit to list the ten highe in relation to sales but it is not a true picture respects as many of them could not get as muc: as they would have liked to have had. There were eight clubs who sold over a tl dollars worth: Kansas City, Missouri 1,686.4 land, Oregon 1,630.93, Champaign 1,496. Francisco 1,484.76, Berkeley 1,395.82, 1,177.56, Franklin, Indiana 1,065.57, and Mi: 1,025.34.

REPORT OF THE JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HEALTF CENTER MAX 1944 MAY 1945 WENTY-FIVE years ago, during the season of T 1919-20, a "visiting nurses for the community" was engaged by the Settlement School Committee. By patience and understanding, confidence was established. The district of service was .purposely keptsmall, for travel by horseback was slow, as trips cut down sharply on the amount of w person could do. The eight years that Miss stayed at the Health Center, set the pattern years that followed.

And reading the reports cars, one sees growth, slowly, but steadily. ons are giving way to knowledge, and the ways are modified and integrated with the nit Charity says, "Life wags on, sortie like '' at the Health Center.

"Books take up" in the autumn, .ush of little feet is again heard on the path o the hospital.

Classes in Home Nursing for adults did not work out as we had hoped. Scarcity of Mother's helpers, and the press of war time living prevented regular group meetings for such a period. Nevertheless, two sets of classes were taught, one at Pi Beta Phi, and the other at Sevier County High School. Both groups were Home Economics classes, and were taught with the assistance of the Home Economics teachers. Certificates have been issued by the Red Cross, and some of the girls. have already been accepted into the Cadet Nurse Corps. Melinda Ogle Wadley, whose entire life has been spent in Gatlin-burg, will be graduated soon from a hospital in Memphis the first of our girls to complete nurses training. One of the most interesting events of the school year was the running of the Lunch Room. The excitement of remodeling and redecorating aroused interest to a high pitch. The day lunch was served for the first time, every child in the elementary school was weighed and measured. Charts were made for each room, showing each child's standing average, over or under weight. Three months later, when the Lunch Room closed, every child was rechecked and the results tabulated. Present for the entire test were 223 children. Of that number, 163 had gained a total of 428 lbs. from 1/2 to 9 lbs.. apiece. 107 had grown taller, from 1/4 to 13% inches. 26 had lost and 18 showed no change. In January, 51 were underweight. In April, 20 had gained up to or beyond their average, and 18 of the rest were gaining. The period of testing was short, and a child's weight varies quickly with illness, lack of sleep, or overactivity. So the results seem very satisfactory. Two children are now under treatment of an Orthopedic Surgeon for the correction of club feet. Both are wearing special shoes held in rigid position by metal rods. The three months old baby is nearly normal, and the other is improving. Margaret .was corrected when she was tiny, but the braced shoes were not worn long enough. Four years old is Margaret almost too old to make things right without surgery. Yes, life wags on "sortie like common" at the Health Center. The days are very full and very interesting. We are grateful for our friends here and all over the country, in the profession and out of it. There are so many of them, and together, we are making life a little easier, a little safer for each other. Following are the figures for the past year, and for the preceding period: Class of.

It really is something to be able to say that I have served Pi Beta Phi longer than any other person in the history of the Settlement School and I am not a Pi Phi. That fact has not kept me from giving to the school and the community my interest, my service, nor my loyalty through the years. Out of the twenty that have passed all too quickly, I have been employed at the Settlement School for 16 years. This has been in three periods, the last one being the longest 10 years this July. When I first came to Gatlinburg in September 1925 after a very hot and dusty ride over the new road that reached just to the front gate, I can re-member that the first thing I wanted was a bath with lots of water; but Gatlinburg was in the midst oft, a drought and as the electricity was made by a little come and go plant on the river in which there was not enough water to make it and consequently our pump run, I had to be satisfied with as little water as decency and the need required. We didn't have lights much either, nor any way to have refrigeration to keep meat, so not much meat was on our menu, nor any telephone. That did not come for many years after that time. But I did have a cordial welcome from all hands on the staff. Aunt Lizzie Reagan cooked for us then, those of us who lived at Teachers' Cottage, and kept us well in hand. Life was not unpleasant even without much electricity, telephone and radio. Gatlinburg wasn't much in those days. There was Charlie Ogle's store, the Squire's house and Jim Reagan's "Swinkey" where we could get ice cream in our immediate range of vision. The Mountain View. Hotel was just a little green frame building with a few rooms for guests and the Riverside Hotel had even less room. Hardy souls came to Gatlinburg for vacations in those days. I can remember three cars in town, Miss Evelyn's, 0. J. Mattil's and the Huff boys, those constant ,squires to the young teachers in the early days. Both of them later married Pi Phis. Then the cows roamed everywhere, sometimes it seemed as if there were profusions of cows. We were forever chasing our neighbors' mules out of our front yard as well as his chickens. The town could not boast of a lawn mower, baby carriage, church every Sunday, coal or electric stove, and only the Teachers' Cottage had both a bathroom and furnace. Otherwise modern plumbing was practically non-existent. When we wanted fun we made it ourselves, or went on a real binge and spent the week-end in Knoxville. Now and then there were flickering movies given in the top of the then new barn with the audience seated on bales of hay and sound effects provided by the cows, goats, and horses housed below. Power for the movies was made by hooking onto the motor of the venerable old Ford Station Wagon that was the special responsibility of Shot Reagan Shot who was to give his life for his country in this war. Trips to the Teachers' Cottage in the Sugarlands were planned with thoroughness and foresight for a ride up there by horseback or in a car that could hopfrom boulder to boulder was an event not to be taken lightly. In contrast to this picture of a sleepy little mountain village is our bustling tourist town, the Gatlin-burg of today, that adjoins the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I can count only 27 houses in the entire town that were being lived in in 1925 and are still occupied twenty years later. Everything else in the town has been built in the intervening years, most of it since 1932. Now our permanent population is about 1600 and there are hotel and cabin accommodations for three times that many, which are filled to capacity during the summer. We have a telephone exchange, public library, post office, four churches, a four-lane highway with sidewalks; and this year the town incorporated. The county runs the school now, with an attendance of 425 pupils quite a growth from the original 13 of the first Pi Beta Phi school. The first household convenience my weavers "wove out" after electricity was brought in from the outside was an electric iron, with washing ma-chines and bathrooms following. Now to go back to my story. After the effects from my trip down wore off, I asked Miss Evelyn what I was to do. Her reply was a masterpiece of understatement but I have never forgotten it, nor failed to appreciate the wisdom behind it. She said I was to teach weaving. My next question was "how and to whom" and she left me to my own devices when she said I was to find my job and make it. It was either sink or swim from then on. I chose swimming and the results will have to speak for themselves. Miss Phyllis helped me out with another bit of sage advice when in reply to my question "of what to talk about to these strange mountain women, she replied, "Flowers." The subject of flowers was my conversational backlog for many months to come. My first call in the community was to the home of Lulu Mae Ogle to see her mother who wove cover-lets. She was the oldest weaver in these parts and was a rich source for much interesting mountain history. She passed on her art of coverlet weaving to her daughter who now makes all our beautiful coverlets. I also made the acquaintance of my first mountain baby ' and a cute one he was, Van Ogle, who now rides in bombers. Of those first 8 or 10 weavers I found in the next few weeks, 2 of them are still making things for Arrowcraft. Shortly after this Nita Stark came in for her semi-annual Committee visit and there were many discussions about where my weaving apparatus and I were to be located. The looms were then in the old log cabin which did not provide sufficient resistance to the elements, so we decided, and proper space just did not seem to be available. Finally someone had a bright idea! Move the laundry from under the porch of the oTd Stuart Cottage and put me in there. No sooner said than done and I was moved in with 7 old looms; warping bars and a box or two in which to keep some supplies. Heat was supplied by a little old wood stove with the pipe stuck out a' window. We managed pretty well up there for the next three years until we moved again into the new high school building with lots and lots of room (now the 8th grade manages to squeeze into the same space). My greatest problem during those years was whether or not I would acquire a permanent stoop THE SEPTEMBER ARROW am very tall and the porch was very low rs lower than the floor above. My journeys end to the other were a bobbing sort of and between those rafters. There was no a table or desk so I carried all my records arm and my office was everywhere I hap-;it down. weaving had been done before I arrived on Not much, though, but still enough for ve a few women who were interested in ow to make ,new things. Our entire stock on the shelf in back of the door in what [iss Dyer's room. In a few months we hat space and had to put the towels and eon sets (nothing but blue or red borders) shelves in Miss Evelyn's office. I taught o the eighth grade girls and I never had a more interesting class than that first one of 't long before I began to see possibilities. e beginning to talk about a National Park -ea and if that came we could see where ple would come to this region.

That I walked and walked, sometimes as much es a week to reach the women who wanted weaving. It took constant supervision to standards. Not only did I teach them how but how to hem, wash and iron and made lize that people actually used the articles e. The next year I decided to save myself walking so I ,rode a horse to the most )mes. The roads I went on were impassable itomobile, even if there had been an auto-: was not until 1928 that I did start to drive y that time there were more and more nd less and less time to make the rounds. in 1927 that I decided that part of my job to bring something beyond just weaving lives of the women with whom I was work-making friends. My first attempt at social a tea given at the Teachers' Cottage one ternoon. It was the only time we ever served Lountain women, coffee drinkers that they are. They were good sports and drank it though. One old woman said, "Law, if we're goin' to eat, I'll have to spit out my backy" and she did out the front door. From that small beginning grew our weaving meetings of later years, meetings to which the women looked forward from month to month. Through the years a variety of subjects and speakers have been brought to the women, from butter making to picture painting, from chicken raising to piano playing. We had Christmas parties with Christmas trees and presents, tacky parties, dinner at the hotel, picnics, and once a big banquet with all the fixings. There is no doubt in my mind that these varied educational and recreational programs have made our weavers broader in vision and background than those who have not had an opportunity to attend. They have been systematically exposed to University Extension lecturers, preachers, artists, and anyone else who could bring a message on some subject with which they were not familiar. In the fall of 1932 the group organized into the Gatlinburg Weavers Guild. This was always an in-formal set-up but the women felt from that time on that they were a definite unit and they started to sponsor community projects. The first one was the Wayside Market which had some measure of success for two years in selling farm produce at their stand on the main highway. The group next started the Gatlin-burg Garden Club in 1936. Until the war and Red Cross work took up the time of the women of the town, the Garden Club conducted a flourishing pro-gram. They were instrumental in having the State Highway Department plant the dogwood trees along the highway through the town, they planted and still maintain the little park opposite the Arrowcraft Shop and they cleaned off and keep in order the island in the river. They had several flower shows that before their discontinuance gained a wide reputation in East Tennessee. The activities of the Club have been suspended until times are again normal. The next project of the Weavers Guild was "play-acting." A desire for some money in their treasury prompted their play writing and acting. They gave four plays in all over a period of six years. The last one "Store Britches" which was written and acted by the weavers and members of their families, ran for three highly successful summer seasons. Tourists and townspeople alike enjoyed the fun and the old-timey mountain story. The money they made has been used by the weavers for a self-help fund from which they can borrow for medical attention and family emergencies. As much as $250 has been loaned at one time to different women. They have taken trips with expenses paid from the fund, the high-light being a trip to Norris Dam where many of them saw their first motor boat and had their first ride in one. They have made donations to the Red Cross and local charities from it and have helped some of their less fortunate members with gifts in periods of stress. When gas rationing . started our meetings were limited to one every two or three months. Perhaps at this point it would be interesting to go back and include some selections from my old yearly reports. They give an idea of the progress of the weaving department from year to year. In May 1926, I wrote, "The weaving situation in Gatlinburg is gradually but steadily growing into a commercial project of great economic value to the women in their homes. Just how extensive the development is to become depends upon the amount of weaving the school can and will handle. Our greatest problem THE SEPTEMBER ARROW .45 is that of supply and demand. The women can weave more than we are selling at the present time. It would be a great help to know just how extensive the , Committee wishes this department to be. There is room for growth and development." In May 1927 this came along. "As I look back upon this year's work in comparison with that of last year, I find that my problems of conducting the weaving department have changed a great deal. The greatest reason for this has been the amazing growth of sales of the weaving due to a greater interest shown by the Alumnae Clubs and to the Arrowcraft Shop which has been the only solution to the large tourist trade that has come to Gatlinburg for five spring and summer months. We were shipping a truck load of baskets and a dozen or so packages of weaving every day for two months before Christmas. The school handles the entire output of 41 looms. This does not include any of the looms that supply weaving for the three weaving shops that have started in Gatlinburg the past year." Then in May, 1928, "In looking over another year's development of the weaving department, it is interesting to note changes that have come through the increased commercial demands. There has been about a 33% increase in the business which has meant more organization among the women. There have been 40 women weaving for us during the year. The plan of selling materials to the women has kept our weaving of uniform quality. This amount of weaving can be increased many times as there are more women pleading for weaving than we can supply." My report of May 1929 is amusing in the light of subsequent events. I said, "This year I feel as if something definite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal has been reached than it is a condition that can be expiessed in so many words. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instructions. They are becoming experts in the mechanics of weaving. I have tried to . spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school this fall making a total of 50 weavers this year. This work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else." I did leave and Victoria Strand took over for the next 2 years. When she did not return in the fall of 1931, Miss Evelyn asked me to come back again. I was happy to do so. This was in the midst of the depression and in June 1932 I wrote, "In spite of the fact that all the weaving centers of the South have been turning off their weavers for the past year, we have had our usual number of women working for us. It is not easy to make hand-woven articles that will sell at a price that one considers inexpensive but that is the trend of the times. There have been 46 women weaving for the school this year with never less than 38 weaving at one time. Thirty new articles have been designed. This has required an almost complete turn-over of the stock but we hope that by offering a new line of articles to the Clubs this fall our trade will be stimulated." Then in June 1933 I wrote, "This has been a year of ups and downs for the weaving department. In November and December we had more weavers working than at any time since I first came here 8 years ago, then in January to March we had less weaversat work than when I started with the old faithful six or seven women. When the Bank in Sevierville closed in January we had to curtail our weaving pro-gram. In order not to weave beyond our income, it has been necessary to keep down the number of women weaving and yet keep a safe balance between the weaving in stock at the Shop and that being made by the women. We have tried to meet this situation by giving a short warp to two women instead of one long warp to one woman." With the general recovery from the depression, Arrowcraft and the weaving department had another boom. I stayed with it until Christmas of 1934 when again I left, this time for good so I thought. Miss Carr and then Mrs. Mitchell carried on the department until June 1935. Then Mrs. Weaver persuaded me to return once again so I came back to the same old job in a brand new place. This last 10 year period from June 1935 to June 1945 has been one of steady progress upward. It was with our move into the Voorheis Building in 1935 that the weaving department came into its own and no matter where it goes in the future, never will the weavers feel so at home nor as if they had a place all their own as they did during the five years we stayed in that building. It gave us the opportunity to have our meetings and all our many social activities in our own building and the women, as well as myself, loved it. I doubt if they will ever again feel as much a part of the school as they did during those years. We had the facilities for serving refreshments at the meetings and could do many extra things that have not, since been possible. They "wove for the school" as much for the activities we carried on as a group as they did for the money they earned. Each year they earned more and more money as the weaving demand kept increasing and we had to keep raising their pay to comply with the demands of the Wage and Hour Law. Although the average earnings at the present are lower than this, it is not unusual for a weaver to earn from $60 to $75 a month in her spare time at home. That represents a lot of weaving but one must remember that these women are very experienced and very fast. With the move from the Voorheis Building to the new Arrowcraft Shop building in 1940, the department became more streamlined as the business kept increasing from a slow pace when the war started to a skyrocketing period during the war when consumer goods were scarce and money plentiful. As I write this in May 1945, we are not meeting by half the possibilities for business that would be ours if we had the facilities, the weavers and the materials with which to meet it. It was necessary as time went on and the women were more busy at home when their men went to war, to drop all the extra activities that we had enjoyed so much during the preceding years. Figures are always interesting in a report so here are a few. In the ten years from June 1935 to June 1945, we have had a total of 242 women weave for us. Two of these have died. Of this total 138 wove for us last year, the greatest number in our history. We keep between 80 and 90 women weaving all the time. As women drop out we try to' fill their places with other women who already know how to weave. There is no time now to teach weaving to inexperienced women. The weavers have had 104 babies during this period including two sets of twins. This one fact has meant the loss of much time from their weaving as one of our rules requires that no woman can weave two months before or after the birth of a .baby, and only then with the permission of her 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW doctor, and most of the women take off more time than that. At one time four generations of Aunt ,Lizzie Reagan's family were weaving for us including Aunt Lizzie at the age of 85 years. Since the war started 29 weavers have had their husbands and 43 of their children enter the armed forces, one has been killed in action. One weaver had five children in service at the same time. Along in the early thirties we started the practise of supplying all the materials to the weavers and paying them for their labor by the piece. In 1939 we paid them $11,187.79 and for the 11 months just ending we have paid them $24,721.47. Our weaving has increased 105% in the past two years alone. Last year we wove 21,630 luncheon doilies and 17,621 luncheon napkins, 2,108 neck scarfs, 1482 square scarfs, 4202 bibs and 1085 baby blankets. Since 1935 we have women 26,287 underarm bags, 6011 last year alone and I am being conservative in saying we are hundreds behind on our orders. It is impossible to find weavers and materials for more than we are doing, In the last ten years I have designed 246 different woven articles in hundreds of color combinations. In the past seven years we have paid the weavers $109,417.18 for their work. Pi Beta Phi has reason to be proud of this record and I am proud to have had' a part in it with my women. This past year might well be called "Passing Previous Peaks." All of our records have been broken. There have been more weavers, more weaving made .and more money earned by the, weavers than ever before in our history. Our inventory of weaving supplies has had to be our largest in order to take advantage of buying materials when they were avail-able. In spite of planning at least 6 months ahead shortages of necessary materials have occurred. With both cotton and wool frozen for the first six months of 1945, it has been more difficult to operate. Fortunately I had placed large orders before the freeze went into effect and they were delivered in time to keep us going except for a period through the winter when our supply of wool was practically gone. By substituting odd lots of materials that I was able to buy and redesigning a few articles in order to use them, we have kept up as well as possible under the circumstances. It helped a great deal not to take the December inventory of weaving supplies. The weavers were very glad not to stop weaving for a month in the middle of the winter and it meant that we could build up our stock more than usual after the very heavy shipping season before Christmas. It has been possible to do this extra amount of weaving' only by eliminating the extra community activities of the past years for both the women and myself. One contributing factor in large measure has been the fact that the women have had to stay at home more with gas rationing and the absence of so many of their men. They have been weaving to fill up their time and as one of the young mothers told me, "It helps meforget Charlie is at war because I get so tired I just have to sleep." I have had to caution many of them not to overdo with the extra burdens they are carrying. With the coming of winter and muddy roads we discontinued our weekly trips to the Glades and Boogertown to take supplies and pick up weaving. Since then we have been relying on the mails and occasional trips to town by the women. I often wonder what the post-war period will do to Gatlinburg, the tourist travel in this region and the handicrafts of this whole area. With the educational program that will soon be started by the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild, of which we are a member, the summer school in crafts here at the school and all the other handicraft rehabilitation projects that are being started, it will no doubt mean that the Southern Highland area will lead in this country in the production of handicrafts of high standards. It will also mean continually keeping be-fore our workers the dignity of working with their hands, heads, and hearts for it takes all three to produce hand-made articles. The people in this section have more money than ever before in their lives, and as more tourists come into the region, more and more money will find its way into the homes of the mountain people. It might well be that this fact alone will , influence many women in their desire for and against weaving. This reconversion period and the future years will provide an excellent opportunity for the school to give supplementary programs that will keep the women stimulated and fill their need of more educational background. I still am on the Board of Trustees of the South-ern Highland Handicraft Guild after completing 2 years as president. I am also on the Board of Directors of the Gatlinburg Public Library. The library continues to increase its service to the town and is building good reading habits in the children who use it with fervor. And so twenty years have passed for me. I am grateful to have had the privilege of working with the mountain women of this section. They have given me their trust and friendship and in turn I have tried to be fair and understanding with their problems. My department never could have succeeded without the encouragement and understanding given to me by the Grand Council and Settlement School Commit-tee members. Through the years they have helped me with their unfailing enthusiasm and sound judgments I am very grateful for that too. To have seen Gatlin-burg progress from an isolated mountain village to a modern incorporated town has been an unusual experience in this day and age when anything can and does happen. The people of this immediate area have acquired in one generation what usually takes two to three generations to accomplish. Then too, there has always been the friendship and loyalty of my co-workers to provide inspiration. It has been a privilege to be a part of it and it has been Fun! Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B.

In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.00 to the Red Cross: $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnx clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumna clubs have contributed more than fifteen thousand dollars and as of August 1, 1945, 38 scholarships have been awarded this year., More applications are still on file. So far, PI BETA PHI HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP SEVENTY GIRLS SECURE THEIR TRAINING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY in institutions approved by the American Medical Association. Attached is a complete list of contributions from July 1, 1944 to August 1, 1945. Following the list of contributors, appears the list of all the young women who have received Physiotherapy Scholarships for this same period. Here is listed the amount each received, and the institution where each has studied. The report of this Committee could well close with these two tabulated lists of facts and figures. Nearly twice as many scholarships have been awarded this year as compared with those of last year, and contributions have been far larger. But several things have happened throughout the year that gave infinite satisfaction to the Committee for War Work, as ornaments on a Christmas tree give sparkle and charm. Beginning in chronological order: 1. Early in November came one check from Mary McCullom Top, President of Kappa Province, in which were included sub'stantial contributions from every active chapter in Kappa Province. 2. Early in December the Navy announced that it would confer the commission of Ensign upon every scholarship girl, upon her completion of the Emergency Course offered by an institution approved by the American Medical Association, upon her enlistment in the WAVES. 3. Before Christmas, Wisconsin A sent through its check for $800.00 to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, duplicating its gift of last year. 4. Early in January, the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C. furnished the Committee with a complete list of scholarship girls serving in Army Hospitals. Four of them were then over-seas. Photographs of many were promised, pictures appeared in the May 1945 ARRoW. 5. Early in the year, the Denver Alumnae Club contributed a complete $400.00 scholarship. 6. From early September until the day the report of this committee for Grand Council was compiled, the Washington, D.C. Alumnae Club has sent gifts, arriving almost weekly, which now total $606.64. eports WA WO K 7. From the Baltimore Alumnx Club and Maryland A has come the perfect tribute to a living member two complete scholarships totaling $800.00 "The Helen Doll Tottle Physiotherapy Scholarship Awards." The two girls fortunate enough to be so honored are designated in the list of scholarships awarded; they will train at Mayo Clinic. 8. The Chairman of the Committee for War Work purrs with pride at the record of Chicago and its environs: contributions of $415.00 from Illinois Epsilon, $500.00 from North Shore Alumna Club, and more than another $500.00 from the other alumnae clubs in or near Chicago. 9. Many clubs and chapters have doubled their contributions clubs and chapters too numerous to mention. We know this greater generosity is due to the province presidents and vice-presidents who have been infinitely persuasive! 10. Feature articles appearing in the May, 1945 AR.-Row by Dr. Frank Krusen of the Mayo Clinic and Miss Jessie Stevenson, President of the American Physiotherapy Association, give to Pi Beta Phi full recognition for pioneering in offering scholarships in the field of Physical Therapy. 11. A letter from Ross T. McIntire, Vice Admiral (MC) Surgeon General, U. S. Navy, dated June 18, 1945 states: "Our estimates of our needs for physical therapists to care for the anticipated patient load in our hospitals indicate that we will require seventy-five additional graduates of recognized schools of Physical Therapy between now and 30 June 1946." Surely, Pi Beta Phi will continue to do its share toward helping young women prepare themselves to meet this vital, national need. 12. But the following letter from Lt. Dorothy Bradley to the Grand Treasurer which accompanied a personal contribution to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund is highly significant. Lt. Bradley is a Pi Phi from Wisconsin Alpha, serving over-seas. We reproduce the letter here in its entirety hoping it will give the entire Fraternity the sense of achievement for work accomplished during the war emergency it has given the Commit-tee for War Work. Respectfully and always appreciatively submitted, LOIS DONALDSON KOEHLER, Chairman April 25, 1945 Germany My dear Mrs. Stoolman: Encloced is a check for $25.00 to be added to the Pi Beta Phi Physical Therapy Scholarship Fund. The Fraternity is to be commended for its initiative in sponsoring a scholarship fund for this very worthwhile work. The demand for Physical Therapists is exceedingly great, and long after the war is over we shall continue to play an important part in the rehabilitation of our wounded men. I have served as a Physical Therapist in the Army for nearly two years fourteen months overseas. We are always busy. Sometimes, as when we moved into Germany. we act as a holding hospital which means that patients are held in the hospital from twenty minutes to six hours. There is little time for clinic work so we go around the wards giving exercises to patients in casts, spending time with the men who have amputations, for most all of them. are anxious about the artificial arm or leg that they will get, and are anxious to know if they will be able to go back to work with such a handicap. 57
