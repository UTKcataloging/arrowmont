        The Man o Made the Survey Dr. Taylor was suggested as the person best fitted to make the survey by Dr. Edwin A. Lee, Professor of Education and Dean of the School of Education, University of California at Los Angeles (1940) ; Professor of Education, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York (1938-1940). William S. Taylor, dean of the College of education at the University of Kentucky since 1923, received his early education in William S. Taylor the public schools of Ohio County. He completed the work for his B.S.A. degree at the University of Kentucky, received his M.S. degree from the University of Wisconsin, and was granted the Ph.D. degree by Columbia University. Dr. Taylor has gained recognition not only in his ownstate but throughout the United .States. He was asked to make a survey of secondary education in Arkansas in 1928-29 and this same year he served as vocational guidance counsellor for the Assembly of High School Youth in Oregon. The following year he acted in the same capacity in Washington and in 1930 the state of Montana asked that he come there as the Vocational counsellor for the Assembly of High School Youth in that state. In 1936-37 he was asked to serve as chairman of the Committee on Reorganization of the National Education Association, and in 1939 Miss Amy Hinrichs, then president of the National Education Association, appointed him chairman of the Committee on Academic Freedom and each succeeding president has reappointed him to this chairmanship. From 1933 to 1941 he served as state director for Kentucky for the N.E.A. Dr. Taylor holds membership in the following professional organizations: Phi Delta Kappa, Kappa Delta Pi, Alpha Zeta, Kentucky Education Association (president 1928-29) , American Vocational Association, National Society for the Study of Education, National Association of Colleges and Departments of Education (president 1926-27, secretary-treasurer 1941), American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Association of University Professors. The Development of Professional Education of Teachers in Pennsylvania was written by Dr. Taylor and he was co-author with J. G. Fowlkes, Thomas E. Goff, and W. W. Wright of Practical Arithmetic Work Books and with Jesse E. Adams of Introduction to Education and the Teaching Process, In 1937-38 he was on leave from the University of Kentucky and spent his time traveling and studying in England and on the continent. His most recent publication, Education in England, gives a summary of his findings while abroad. The Man Who Assisted Dr. Taylor Maurice F. Seay, Director of the Bureau of School Service and Head of the Department of Educational Administration at the University of Kentucky, received his A.B. and M.A. degrees from Transylvania College at Lexington, Kentucky. Mr. Seay has served since 1938 as a member of the Planning Board of the Kentucky Education Association; and is .a member of the Education Commission of Southern Mountain Workers Conference. 160 Evaluation of the Program of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at Gatlin.burg, Tennessee, with Recommendations for the Future By WILLIAM S. TAYLOR GENERAL STATEMENT An adequate appraisal of the work of the II B (T) Settlement School could not be made without a knowledge both of the purpose of its founders and of its accomplishments through the years. It is the purpose of this report to evaluate the present program of the school and to make suggestions concerning its future. No attempt will be made to recount the contributions of the school to Gatlinburg and the surrounding vicinity. This has been done effectively by many persons who visited this interesting educational project. To fail to acknowledge, however, the excellence of the work of the school and the service of the membership of the II B '4) fraternity to a community so desperately in need of help would be to fail to recognize the splendid service of a great unselfish organization of women throughout the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada. To Pi Beta Phis it may seem that their responsibility for this school and to the community has been greatly lessened since Gatlin-burg has grown from an isolated, rural area to a thriving community just outside a great national park. No longer is access to Gatlin-burg difficult. Beautiful highways approach this thriving little mountain town filled with good hotels and good tourist cabins. The season ending October 1 this year saw more than 1,250,000 guests in Gatlinburg and the Smokies. Measured by the usual yardstick of prosperity, the town of Gatlin-burg is a prosperous community. Those who go to Gatlinburg, however, and see only the new Gatlinburg Inn, the Riverside Hotel, the Greystone, the Mountain View Inn, the new tourist cabins, and the new business establishments, gain a one-sided picture of this mountain community. The other side of the picture can be seen by driving up Baskin's Run, visiting the Glades, or following the winding road to Cartertown. It is not Gatlinburg alone that has interested II B through the years ; it is the less fortunate area that lies within a radius of six to ten miles of this picturesque town. Any honest appraisal of the work of II B will show definitely that the Fraternity has been instrumental in raising the intellectual level of the community, in building character in its people, and in establishing good habits of life among the citizens of a remote area greatly in need of educational service. When II B (T. became interested in Gatlinburg, no one dreamed that the Great Smokies would some day become one of America's most beautiful national parks. Pi Phi did its work in this community in such a way as to gain the respect and good will of the families of the community whose children attended the school organized and operated by the Fraternity. The children were encouraged to go through high school, to attend college, and to make of themselves useful citizens of the community and the state in which they live. So well has the Fraternity done its work that the people who were property owners in the community have continued to grow with the community, and today, thirty years after II B 013 went into the area, the original families of the community are still the property owners with the business of Gatlin-burg in their hands. I do not know another community in the United States that has grown as rapidly as has Gatlinburg, nor one in which the original families have been able to profit as greatly from new business and increased values of property. It is 'a pleasant sight to see the Huffs, the Whaleys, the Ogles, and the other pioneer families of this mountain community enjoying the comforts of a new type of civiliaztion. Pi Phi can rightly claim a great portion of the credit for providing these people with the kind of education which enabled them to grow with their community. The greatly changed conditions, as a result of the development of the Great Smoky National Park and the rapid growth of Gatlinburg, necessarily compels a rethinking of II B 's program in this area. I have studied carefully the area that has been served by the school in the past and the area now being served. If there is any 161 162 THE DECEMBER ARROW Pi Beta Phi anywhere who feels that the Fraternity should leave Gatlinburg because of the rapid growth of the community, all she would have to do to convince herself that this would be unwise would be to make a critical study of the needs of the people in the area and of the county's ability to sup-port the schools. When the fraternity started the project, it hoped to provide a satisfactory education on the elementary level for the families served. A secondary education is just as essential to successful living in a democracy today as was elementary education three decades ago. The vision of the members of Pi Phi has been most unusual. Not only have they made available secondary education as soon as possible, but during the entire history of the school, they have attempted to provide the type of practical education which enabled the families of the area to improve their economic status and to live more comfortably and more happily in the shadow of the mountains. They realized from the beginning that to raise the social level of a people, they must also raise the economic level. A survey of the area served by the school will show clearly that, while many mountain communities have become increasingly poorer, the people in the mountain community served by II B (I) have been enabled to live on a higher economic and social level than ever before. FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION The budgets for 1940-41 and 1941-42 and the reports of the auditors for 1940-41 were carefully examined and discussed with the Director and the Bookkeeper. Since both of these officials are beginning their first year at the school, these discussions seemed to be helpful in clarifying the financial situation and in revealing the relationship of the budget to the current problems. The officials of the school are to be commended for the adoption of accepted practices for good financial administration. Complete audits of all accounts are made regularly; a satisfactory accounting procedure is followed and conscientious efforts are made to live within the budget. THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM The school is at the present time housed in two buildings, both of which are located on II B (I) land in Gatlinburg. The elementary school building is old and is hardly suitable for educational purposes. The high school building is newer, reasonably modern, fairly well lighted, and, on the whole, well adapted to present needs. The teachers in both the elementary and the secondary schools have been carefully chosen and are far above the average to be found in similar communities. The elementary school is now under county control, but II B (1. has used excellent judgment in retaining the right to nominate a portion of the teachers. The program of studies of the high school includes not only the fundamental subjects taught on the secondary level, but also a strong curriculum in home making and an excellent offering in vocational agriculture. There has recently been inaugurated an educational program in the crafts which should prove unusually interesting and helpful to the community. Still lacking is an adequate program in music which should be incorporated at the earliest possible date. The high school is working under crowded conditions. Classes are being conducted in the library and this is, of course, undesirable procedure. The crowded conditions of the high school will be relieved, however, when the new boys' dormitory has been completed and the boys residing in a wing of the building have been transferred to their new home, and when a new elementary school has been built and the seventh and eighth grades, now housed in the high school, have been transferred to the new elementary building. Pi Beta Phi has been wise in turning over to the county the administration and support of the elementary school. The State of Tennessee is gradually increasing its appropriation for educational purposes. Education in a democracy demands that the state and the local community, working cooperatively, with assistance in some areas from the Federal government, provide an adequate education for every child. Sevier County with the aid of state appropriations can at the present time finance the program of elementary education on a satisfactory basis and should do so. Within a few years, possibly two, certainly not to exceed six at the most, II B should relinquish its responsibility for the administration of the secondary education program. This does not mean that the fraternity will cease to be interested in the secondary school, but that it will not be responsible for the support of the part of the program which corresponds to the secondary education maintained by the county for other schools of its system. Relieved of this re THE DECEMBER ARROW 163 sponsibility, II B 1 can continue to supplement both the elementary and the secondary school programs with services which could not be supplied by the state or the county. Sevier County is paying approximately $5,500 as its share of the program of secondary education which is now administered by the II B .13 school. The Fraternity has followed a very wise policy in insisting from time to time that the county assume a larger share of the financial burden of the education program as the resources of the board of education become greater. The county has agreed to pay the salary of an additional teacher in the high school beginning with the present year. It is encouraging to note this willingness on the part of the county board to share in the cost of the program of secondary education in Gatlinburg and the surrounding area. Some of the funds used by Sevier County in paying its share of the B program come from the State and Federal grants for vocational education. If it were not for the willingness of the school to supplement these funds, these added services to the secondary school could not be obtained. As the present program of the H B (I) School is evaluated, the fact that the county is now making a large contribution to the cost of the high school should be kept in mind. Pi Beta Phi should not feel that it has been relieved of its responsibility for either the elementary or the secondary school when these are turned over to the county. The program that could be provided by the county would be far more meager than that which has been provided by the Settlement School. The Fraternity should continue to provide the additional features that give to the children of the area the knowledge, habits, and skills desirable in good citizens ; it should supply for a time the supplementary sums necessary to procure teachers of agriculture, home economics, industrial arts, weaving, and music. It should also continue to make avail-able to the elementary and secondary schools such services as those now rendered by the Health Center and the dormitories. There will be a considerable number of details to be worked out between the county board of education and II B 4), all of which I think can be handled with reasonable ease. For instance, when the administration of the secondary school is turned over to the county, the question of a building will, of course, be raised. It seems useless to build another secondary school building in Gatlin-burg. It would be my recommendation that the present secondary school building and the land on which it is located be leased to the county at a nominal sum and that II B 1 be relieved of any responsibility for the care and upkeep of the building. The present elementary school is unsuited for educational purposes. The elementary school should, however, be located near enough to the secondary school so that one principal can supervise both schools, and so that the two programs will continue to be integrated. H B 4 will not be able to supplement the elementary program as effectively if the building is located in some other part of the town. Such services as those rendered by the Health Center and the Craft Shop to the elementary program are of great value. There is a plot of land across Baskin's Run immediately opposite the high school, which, if it could be procured, would be a desirable site for the new elementary school building. This land, I understand, belongs to Mr. Huff, who owns the Mountain View Hotel. He is a public spirited person and probably would make it available to the community at a reasonable cost. The county will probably be able to build a satisfactory building if the site can be procured without cost to the county. Here again it might be wise for Pi Beta Phi to supplement the sum sufficiently to insure a building that will be entirely satisfactory to the organization which has sponsored this pro-gram so effectively. That detail would of necessity have to be worked out by the Fraternity and the county board. THE FARM The Settlement School has built up an interesting agricultural program and has, I think, made the most of its opportunities in this direction. The farm is operated on an economical basis and is producing just about as much as it can be made to produce. The teacher of agriculture, Mr. Coe, is responsible for the management of the farm, the excellent dairy herd, the poultry, the hogs, and the gardening. I do not see how he could have done any better than he has done. Without finding fault with the decisions that have been made in the past, I should like to raise the question as to whether or not the school can afford to use for agricultural purposes some of the land that proba164 THE DECEMBER ARROW bly has a minimum value of $2,000 an acre. The best of the more level land is now being used for gardening purposes, as it should be, if it is to be used for farm purposes at all. The hilly land is useful only for pasture. There is no possibility of raising feed for the dairy herd, the three horses, or the hogs and poultry. The management of the Mountain View Hotel objects to having the dairy herd grazing on the plot of land immediately in front of the hotel and has requested that cattle be kept off this small field. If the re-quest is granted, a small amount of hay may be produced on this plot; but again the question arises as to whether land so valuable should be used for hay production. There is a possibility that Mr. Huff may be willing to lease this plot on a long time basis at a good rental annually with a clause inserted in the lease that no buildings may be constructed on this property. His primary interest is to maintain a pleasant outlook from the hotel and, to some of the guests, cows in the immediate vicinity are objection-able. No hasty decision should be made about the farm. If it was started as a part of an educational program and was intended to be used as a demonstration of good farming, it has probably outlived its usefulness. The work in vocational agriculture demands that each boy enrolled in the class shall use scientific farm practices on his own home farm. The teacher visits each boy at his home and tries to help the boy and his parents to work out a better farm program. If agricultural progress in the community is to be made, it must come largely as a result of the influence of the agricultural teacher's program and the county agent's work. THE ARROWCRAFT PROGRAM Pi Beta Phi was a pioneer in providing for the area around Gatlinburg a type of adult education which enabled the people to revive an art all but lost in the early part of the century, an art that has given to the homes of the community an income badly needed. To be convinced of the worth of the pro-gram, one has but to glance at the sums paid monthly to each of the ninety-seven families now producing materials for the fraternity. If, however, this were not enough evidence, a visit to the homes where the materials are being produced would convince even the most skeptical that the revival of this art not only has been of economic value but that it has had great cultural value to the community. Almost every family in the en-tire area, whether it has produced materials for the II B (12 Settlement School or for some other agency, has profited because of the fraternity's early work in this field. The new Arrowcraft Shop, which has just been completed, is a beautiful building; it attracts thousands of tourists every year. The production program under the direction of Miss Redding and the sales division under Mrs. Snow seem to be managed in an unusually effective manner. The building is one of the show places of Gatlinburg; it was particularly interesting to watch tourists of evident culture and refinement come into the building to study the products of the mountain homes in the area. In addition to the Arrowcraft Shop a small, attractive sales shop is operated in the Mountain View Hotel. This shop is interesting not only because of its display of beautiful products, but also because of the demonstrations of weaving of afghans by Mrs. Georgia Duffield. Pi Beta Phi has set a high standard in its crafts program and this standard has never been lowered. One thing more, I think, should be said in passing the people who produce the materials for the Arrowcraft Shop thoroughly enjoy their work. It was a happy experience to watch Aunt Lizzie Reagan in her eighty-fourth year weaving for the friends of II B (I all over the world. THE HEALTH CENTER Even a casual appraisal of the work of the Health Center makes one enthusiastic about the contribution of this agency to the welfare of the community. Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, the present director of the Center, has given an unusual service to the entire area served by the school. Her instructional program in health education in the elementary and secondary schools of Gatlinburg and in the one and two-teacher schools in the surrounding county, her first aid program in the schools and in the community, and her work as a visiting nurse in the poorer homes of the area have made her loved and admired by children and adults in the entire area. It was a privilege to travel with Mrs. Chalmers, to visit the homes and the schools that she visits, and to see the excellent work which is being done. It would be impossible for the one doctor located in Gatlinburg to give the health THE DECEMBER ARROW 165 service that Mrs. Chalmers now gives. Mrs. Chalmers understands that the coming of a doctor to the community has relieved her of certain responsibilities which she formerly assumed; but to remove the work of the Health Center from the community would deprive the needy people of the area of a health service they could not possibly get in any other way. This service should be continued on its present high level. ADULT EDUCATION Gatlinburg, located at a considerable distance from a city of any kind, should have a program of adult education interesting to large numbers of people beyond school age. There are many unusual personalities in this town of 1,500 people and there is a definite need for a type of adult education that will be stimulating and satisfying. Such a pro-gram should be sponsored by the present advisory committee or by another local committee of perhaps nine people, at least one of whom should be a member of the Settlement School organization. It should certainly have persons on it like Miss Dorothy MacLean, Mr. King, the former principal of the school, and other people representing different interests and different levels of education. Few small communities have at their command so many resources in fine arts and in industrial arts as has Gatlinburg. Photography, for instance, a hobby with millions of Americans, is a highly developed art with Miss Dorothy MacLean, a citizen of the community. It should not be difficult to interest a considerable number of people in a study of this subject and in an enlarged appreciation of the beautiful in nature, in architecture, in gardens, in interior decoration, and in many other areas. Still another field which offers unusual opportunity in adult education is that of painting. Attention to this field has been called by both Mr. Lutcher Stark and Dean Edwin Holton. There are few spots in the world more gorgeous in the autumn or more beautiful in. the springtime than the Great Smoky Mountains in the vicinity of Gatlinburg. It should offer opportunities equal to those of Brown County in Indiana, or of Carmel-bythe-Sea, California. From the time the autumn colors fade until the redbud and the dogwood blossom in the springtime, Gatlinburg is a quiet community in which many people have a ()Teat deal of free time. Some of these people might spend many happy hours and increase their musical appreciation if a library of good records could be brought together and one evening a week for a short period of time could be set aside for a music hour. Such a weekly music hour has proved popular in many communities. Perhaps as good a way as any to start a program of adult education would be to pro-vide a forum series, using the high school auditorium as the place of meeting. It seems desirable that such a program should be a joint responsibility of Pi Phi and the community rather than an effort on the part of the fraternity alone. A program so sponsored would increase community interest and would enhance the opportunity to extend the program. Gatlinburg needs a library service, which can be provided only by an organization such as II B The library in the school should be made available to the community and some of the books should be sent out in pack-age libraries to the surrounding schools. Such a service will require much thought and planning; it is possible, however, to procure good reading materials for adults on all educational levels and to make this service avail-able twelve months a year. The industrial arts shop in connection with the high school offers spendid opportunities to both in-school and out-of-school groups in metal work and in work with wood. Mr. Poore is genuinely interested in building a helpful program in adult education; the work has already been well begun in this area with a large class enrolled in an evening school program. These adults are thoroughly interested and they are profiting from the experience. The school is engaged in a splendid pro-gram of adult education in agriculture, a program which will become increasingly effective. The opportunities for out-of-school groups in home economics, health, and industry are still largely unexplored and unrealized in spite of the excellence of the work of those in charge of these fields. The area served by the school is large and the educational process is slow, but genuine progress is being made. Pi Beta Phi can attract national attention-with its program of adult education if it will attack this problem with the enthusiasm, the intelligence, and the determination that have characterized its program for thirty years. 166 THE DECEMBER ARROW EMPHASIS FOR THE FUTURE PROGRAM In the preceding sections of this report no abrupt changes have been recommended for the policy or for the program of the school which II B (1) has sponsored for almost a third of a century. Years ago it was decided to have the county board of education assume, as it was able, greater financial and administrative responsibility for the education of the children in Gatlinburg and the adjacent communities. Already the elementary school has been turned over to the county, and the school authorities have agreed to assume full responsibility for the housing of this unit after a two year period. The county board of education is assuming a large share of the cost of the high school, paying the salary of an additional teacher this year. Within a period of a few years the county can be expected to under-take the administration of the secondary school at Gatlinburg; arrangements should be completed at an early date for the transfer of this responsibility to the county. As the fraternity has, from time to time, been relieved of certain financial obligations for educational services in which it has pioneered, it has been able to expand other phases of its work and to inaugurate new services. This has been a wise procedure; it has enabled II B 4T. to offer to the community an increasingly effective educational program. The result has been an enriched community life and a healthier, happier, and more intelligent citizenry whose high standards reflect credit upon the school and upon its sponsors. Now that the county can be expected to assume greater responsibilities for both the elementary and the secondary schools, the fraternity can look forward to an oppor tunity for providing the necessary funds to make possible a larger and a richer curricular offering. Several of the services now being rendered by the fraternity need to be expanded; and a great majority of the services discussed are supplementary, but they constitute the difference between an inadequate educational program and the opportunity for the richness of life to which every person in a democracy is entitled. These services should remain for many years the unique contribution of the II B t fraternity to this mountain community. With complete understanding and sympathetic cooperation between the county board of education and the fraternity, an experiment involving a total educational pro-gram for all of the people in an area can be expected to make an even greater contribution to education in America, and to bring even larger credit to the unselfish efforts of a group of women of high ideals and noble aspirations bound together in a great fraternity. AN APPRECIATION To all of those who have assisted in presenting the program of the II B cl) Settlement School and who have aided in a better understanding of its problems, the writer desires to express his appreciation. Particularly does he wish to acknowledge the assistance given by the following persons: Mrs. Joseph N. Copp of Los Angeles for her searching questions; Mrs. Elizabeth C. Peck and her associates at the school for their friendly help in providing information re-quested; and Professor Maurice F. Seay, his colleague at the University of Kentucky, for aid in evaluating the work of the school and for constructive criticism of this report. Two Founders: An Appreci ~ll~lC71 By FRANCES ROSSER BROWN, Oklahoma Alpha, National Historian "Let us read of them with reverence, let us remember them, feeling that in their dear and simple lives these women touched heights of truth and sincerity such as few ever attain." THE LAST PIONEER FANNIE WHITENACK LIBBEY 1848-1941 Great victors on whose brows the laurel wreath Is placed, symbolic of outstanding worth, Win lasting fame among the sons of earth By love, not by a sword drawn from its sheath. You saw a nation warring underneath Two banners, reunited with the birth Of tolerance. Your girlhood faced no dearth Of problems which such wars alike bequeath. New portals then were swinging wide for all. A broader, fuller life for womankind Became your dream. This in the passing years Was realized. Devotion to life's call Received love's crown but your triumphant mind Still wings its flight in search of larger spheres. ESTHER FRIEDLANDER, Minnesota Alpha FANNIE WHITENACK LIBBEY One evening in late April of 1867 five Monmouth College girls were visiting together in the home " of one of these five, Fannie Whitenack, when one of them suggested that they organize a college fraternity for women. This suggestion met with instant approval and within a short time final organization was made in the Holt home in Monmouth for the establishment of the first national secret college society for women, II B (D. There were twelve founders of this national fraternity who charted this way of service for thousands of college women who were to follow them. On May 21, 1941, the last surviving one of the twelve, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, passed away. It was she who saw the Fraternity through a longer cycle of time than any other member, having been present when the organizing was first mentioned, and having lived into the beginning of the Frater nity's seventy-fifth Anniversary Year. Members of II B (I) feel that the qualities of en-durance, strength, and loyalty which were Mrs. Libbey's were symbolic of these same qualities embodied within the Fraternity. Fannie Whitenack Libbey A service was held in memory of Fannie Whitenack Libbey on the afternoon of May 23 in the home of her daughter, Mrs. Charles Sawyer, with whom she made her home during the latter years of her life. This service was beautiful in its simplicity, the gathering of friends who loved her deeply. Reverend John Hall, pastor of the Methodist Church, of which Mrs. Libbey was an active member, officiated at the service and began by reading the comforting words of the twenty-eighth verse of the fourteenth chap-ter from the Gospel of St. John. Then a friend sang Harriet Beecher Stowe's poem, "Still, Still With Thee," and Reverend Hall spoke in praise of Mrs. Libbey's life, which had been so filled with doing good for 167

The Fraternity should continue to provide the additional features that give to the children of the area the knowledge, habits, and skills desirable in good citizens ; it should supply for a time the supplementary sums necessary to procure teachers of agriculture, home economics, industrial arts, weaving, and music. It should also continue to make avail-able to the elementary and secondary schools such services as those now rendered by the Health Center and the dormitories. There will be a considerable number of details to be worked out between the county board of education and II B 4), all of which I think can be handled with reasonable ease. For instance, when the administration of the secondary school is turned over to the county, the question of a building will, of course, be raised. It seems useless to build another secondary school building in Gatlin-burg. It would be my recommendation that the present secondary school building and the land on which it is located be leased to the county at a nominal sum and that II B 1 be relieved of any responsibility for the care and upkeep of the building. The present elementary school is unsuited for educational purposes. The elementary school should, however, be located near enough to the secondary school so that one principal can supervise both schools, and so that the two programs will continue to be integrated. H B 4 will not be able to supplement the elementary program as effectively if the building is located in some other part of the town. Such services as those rendered by the Health Center and the Craft Shop to the elementary program are of great value. There is a plot of land across Baskin's Run immediately opposite the high school, which, if it could be procured, would be a desirable site for the new elementary school building. This land, I understand, belongs to Mr. Huff, who owns the Mountain View Hotel. He is a public spirited person and probably would make it available to the community at a reasonable cost. The county will probably be able to build a satisfactory building if the site can be procured without cost to the county. Here again it might be wise for Pi Beta Phi to supplement the sum sufficiently to insure a building that will be entirely satisfactory to the organization which has sponsored this pro-gram so effectively. That detail would of necessity have to be worked out by the Fraternity and the county board. THE FARM The Settlement School has built up an interesting agricultural program and has, I think, made the most of its opportunities in this direction. The farm is operated on an economical basis and is producing just about as much as it can be made to produce. The teacher of agriculture, Mr. Coe, is responsible for the management of the farm, the excellent dairy herd, the poultry, the hogs, and the gardening. I do not see how he could have done any better than he has done. Without finding fault with the decisions that have been made in the past, I should like to raise the question as to whether or not the school can afford to use for agricultural purposes some of the land that proba164 THE DECEMBER ARROW bly has a minimum value of $2,000 an acre. The best of the more level land is now being used for gardening purposes, as it should be, if it is to be used for farm purposes at all. The hilly land is useful only for pasture. There is no possibility of raising feed for the dairy herd, the three horses, or the hogs and poultry. The management of the Mountain View Hotel objects to having the dairy herd grazing on the plot of land immediately in front of the hotel and has requested that cattle be kept off this small field. If the re-quest is granted, a small amount of hay may be produced on this plot; but again the question arises as to whether land so valuable should be used for hay production. There is a possibility that Mr. Huff may be willing to lease this plot on a long time basis at a good rental annually with a clause inserted in the lease that no buildings may be constructed on this property. His primary interest is to maintain a pleasant outlook from the hotel and, to some of the guests, cows in the immediate vicinity are objection-able. No hasty decision should be made about the farm. If it was started as a part of an educational program and was intended to be used as a demonstration of good farming, it has probably outlived its usefulness. The work in vocational agriculture demands that each boy enrolled in the class shall use scientific farm practices on his own home farm. The teacher visits each boy at his home and tries to help the boy and his parents to work out a better farm program. If agricultural progress in the community is to be made, it must come largely as a result of the influence of the agricultural teacher's program and the county agent's work. THE ARROWCRAFT PROGRAM Pi Beta Phi was a pioneer in providing for the area around Gatlinburg a type of adult education which enabled the people to revive an art all but lost in the early part of the century, an art that has given to the homes of the community an income badly needed. To be convinced of the worth of the pro-gram, one has but to glance at the sums paid monthly to each of the ninety-seven families now producing materials for the fraternity. If, however, this were not enough evidence, a visit to the homes where the materials are being produced would convince even the most skeptical that the revival of this art not only has been of economic value but that it has had great cultural value to the community. Almost every family in the en-tire area, whether it has produced materials for the II B (12 Settlement School or for some other agency, has profited because of the fraternity's early work in this field. The new Arrowcraft Shop, which has just been completed, is a beautiful building; it attracts thousands of tourists every year. The production program under the direction of Miss Redding and the sales division under Mrs. Snow seem to be managed in an unusually effective manner. The building is one of the show places of Gatlinburg; it was particularly interesting to watch tourists of evident culture and refinement come into the building to study the products of the mountain homes in the area. In addition to the Arrowcraft Shop a small, attractive sales shop is operated in the Mountain View Hotel. This shop is interesting not only because of its display of beautiful products, but also because of the demonstrations of weaving of afghans by Mrs. Georgia Duffield. Pi Beta Phi has set a high standard in its crafts program and this standard has never been lowered. One thing more, I think, should be said in passing the people who produce the materials for the Arrowcraft Shop thoroughly enjoy their work. It was a happy experience to watch Aunt Lizzie Reagan in her eighty-fourth year weaving for the friends of II B (I all over the world. THE HEALTH CENTER Even a casual appraisal of the work of the Health Center makes one enthusiastic about the contribution of this agency to the welfare of the community. Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, the present director of the Center, has given an unusual service to the entire area served by the school. Her instructional program in health education in the elementary and secondary schools of Gatlinburg and in the one and two-teacher schools in the surrounding county, her first aid program in the schools and in the community, and her work as a visiting nurse in the poorer homes of the area have made her loved and admired by children and adults in the entire area. It was a privilege to travel with Mrs. Chalmers, to visit the homes and the schools that she visits, and to see the excellent work which is being done. It would be impossible for the one doctor located in Gatlinburg to give the health THE DECEMBER ARROW 165 service that Mrs. Chalmers now gives. Mrs. Chalmers understands that the coming of a doctor to the community has relieved her of certain responsibilities which she formerly assumed; but to remove the work of the Health Center from the community would deprive the needy people of the area of a health service they could not possibly get in any other way. This service should be continued on its present high level. ADULT EDUCATION Gatlinburg, located at a considerable distance from a city of any kind, should have a program of adult education interesting to large numbers of people beyond school age. There are many unusual personalities in this town of 1,500 people and there is a definite need for a type of adult education that will be stimulating and satisfying. Such a pro-gram should be sponsored by the present advisory committee or by another local committee of perhaps nine people, at least one of whom should be a member of the Settlement School organization. It should certainly have persons on it like Miss Dorothy MacLean, Mr. King, the former principal of the school, and other people representing different interests and different levels of education. Few small communities have at their command so many resources in fine arts and in industrial arts as has Gatlinburg. Photography, for instance, a hobby with millions of Americans, is a highly developed art with Miss Dorothy MacLean, a citizen of the community. It should not be difficult to interest a considerable number of people in a study of this subject and in an enlarged appreciation of the beautiful in nature, in architecture, in gardens, in interior decoration, and in many other areas. Still another field which offers unusual opportunity in adult education is that of painting. Attention to this field has been called by both Mr. Lutcher Stark and Dean Edwin Holton. There are few spots in the world more gorgeous in the autumn or more beautiful in. the springtime than the Great Smoky Mountains in the vicinity of Gatlinburg. It should offer opportunities equal to those of Brown County in Indiana, or of Carmel-bythe-Sea, California. From the time the autumn colors fade until the redbud and the dogwood blossom in the springtime, Gatlinburg is a quiet community in which many people have a ()Teat deal of free time. Some of these people might spend many happy hours and increase their musical appreciation if a library of good records could be brought together and one evening a week for a short period of time could be set aside for a music hour. Such a weekly music hour has proved popular in many communities. Perhaps as good a way as any to start a program of adult education would be to pro-vide a forum series, using the high school auditorium as the place of meeting. It seems desirable that such a program should be a joint responsibility of Pi Phi and the community rather than an effort on the part of the fraternity alone. A program so sponsored would increase community interest and would enhance the opportunity to extend the program. Gatlinburg needs a library service, which can be provided only by an organization such as II B The library in the school should be made available to the community and some of the books should be sent out in pack-age libraries to the surrounding schools. Such a service will require much thought and planning; it is possible, however, to procure good reading materials for adults on all educational levels and to make this service avail-able twelve months a year. The industrial arts shop in connection with the high school offers spendid opportunities to both in-school and out-of-school groups in metal work and in work with wood. Mr. Poore is genuinely interested in building a helpful program in adult education; the work has already been well begun in this area with a large class enrolled in an evening school program. These adults are thoroughly interested and they are profiting from the experience. The school is engaged in a splendid pro-gram of adult education in agriculture, a program which will become increasingly effective. The opportunities for out-of-school groups in home economics, health, and industry are still largely unexplored and unrealized in spite of the excellence of the work of those in charge of these fields. The area served by the school is large and the educational process is slow, but genuine progress is being made. Pi Beta Phi can attract national attention-with its program of adult education if it will attack this problem with the enthusiasm, the intelligence, and the determination that have characterized its program for thirty years. 166 THE DECEMBER ARROW EMPHASIS FOR THE FUTURE PROGRAM In the preceding sections of this report no abrupt changes have been recommended for the policy or for the program of the school which II B (1) has sponsored for almost a third of a century. Years ago it was decided to have the county board of education assume, as it was able, greater financial and administrative responsibility for the education of the children in Gatlinburg and the adjacent communities. Already the elementary school has been turned over to the county, and the school authorities have agreed to assume full responsibility for the housing of this unit after a two year period. The county board of education is assuming a large share of the cost of the high school, paying the salary of an additional teacher this year. Within a period of a few years the county can be expected to under-take the administration of the secondary school at Gatlinburg; arrangements should be completed at an early date for the transfer of this responsibility to the county. As the fraternity has, from time to time, been relieved of certain financial obligations for educational services in which it has pioneered, it has been able to expand other phases of its work and to inaugurate new services. This has been a wise procedure; it has enabled II B 4T. to offer to the community an increasingly effective educational program. The result has been an enriched community life and a healthier, happier, and more intelligent citizenry whose high standards reflect credit upon the school and upon its sponsors. Now that the county can be expected to assume greater responsibilities for both the elementary and the secondary schools, the fraternity can look forward to an oppor tunity for providing the necessary funds to make possible a larger and a richer curricular offering. Several of the services now being rendered by the fraternity need to be expanded; and a great majority of the services discussed are supplementary, but they constitute the difference between an inadequate educational program and the opportunity for the richness of life to which every person in a democracy is entitled. These services should remain for many years the unique contribution of the II B t fraternity to this mountain community. With complete understanding and sympathetic cooperation between the county board of education and the fraternity, an experiment involving a total educational pro-gram for all of the people in an area can be expected to make an even greater contribution to education in America, and to bring even larger credit to the unselfish efforts of a group of women of high ideals and noble aspirations bound together in a great fraternity. AN APPRECIATION To all of those who have assisted in presenting the program of the II B cl) Settlement School and who have aided in a better understanding of its problems, the writer desires to express his appreciation. Particularly does he wish to acknowledge the assistance given by the following persons: Mrs. Joseph N. Copp of Los Angeles for her searching questions; Mrs. Elizabeth C. Peck and her associates at the school for their friendly help in providing information re-quested; and Professor Maurice F. Seay, his colleague at the University of Kentucky, for aid in evaluating the work of the school and for constructive criticism of this report. Two Founders: An Appreci ~ll~lC71 By FRANCES ROSSER BROWN, Oklahoma Alpha, National Historian "Let us read of them with reverence, let us remember them, feeling that in their dear and simple lives these women touched heights of truth and sincerity such as few ever attain." THE LAST PIONEER FANNIE WHITENACK LIBBEY 1848-1941 Great victors on whose brows the laurel wreath Is placed, symbolic of outstanding worth, Win lasting fame among the sons of earth By love, not by a sword drawn from its sheath. You saw a nation warring underneath Two banners, reunited with the birth Of tolerance. Your girlhood faced no dearth Of problems which such wars alike bequeath. New portals then were swinging wide for all. A broader, fuller life for womankind Became your dream. This in the passing years Was realized. Devotion to life's call Received love's crown but your triumphant mind Still wings its flight in search of larger spheres. ESTHER FRIEDLANDER, Minnesota Alpha FANNIE WHITENACK LIBBEY One evening in late April of 1867 five Monmouth College girls were visiting together in the home " of one of these five, Fannie Whitenack, when one of them suggested that they organize a college fraternity for women. This suggestion met with instant approval and within a short time final organization was made in the Holt home in Monmouth for the establishment of the first national secret college society for women, II B (D. There were twelve founders of this national fraternity who charted this way of service for thousands of college women who were to follow them. On May 21, 1941, the last surviving one of the twelve, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, passed away. It was she who saw the Fraternity through a longer cycle of time than any other member, having been present when the organizing was first mentioned, and having lived into the beginning of the Frater nity's seventy-fifth Anniversary Year. Members of II B (I) feel that the qualities of en-durance, strength, and loyalty which were Mrs. Libbey's were symbolic of these same qualities embodied within the Fraternity. Fannie Whitenack Libbey A service was held in memory of Fannie Whitenack Libbey on the afternoon of May 23 in the home of her daughter, Mrs. Charles Sawyer, with whom she made her home during the latter years of her life. This service was beautiful in its simplicity, the gathering of friends who loved her deeply. Reverend John Hall, pastor of the Methodist Church, of which Mrs. Libbey was an active member, officiated at the service and began by reading the comforting words of the twenty-eighth verse of the fourteenth chap-ter from the Gospel of St. John. Then a friend sang Harriet Beecher Stowe's poem, "Still, Still With Thee," and Reverend Hall spoke in praise of Mrs. Libbey's life, which had been so filled with doing good for 167

Devotion to life's call Received love's crown but your triumphant mind Still wings its flight in search of larger spheres. ESTHER FRIEDLANDER, Minnesota Alpha FANNIE WHITENACK LIBBEY One evening in late April of 1867 five Monmouth College girls were visiting together in the home " of one of these five, Fannie Whitenack, when one of them suggested that they organize a college fraternity for women. This suggestion met with instant approval and within a short time final organization was made in the Holt home in Monmouth for the establishment of the first national secret college society for women, II B (D. There were twelve founders of this national fraternity who charted this way of service for thousands of college women who were to follow them. On May 21, 1941, the last surviving one of the twelve, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, passed away. It was she who saw the Fraternity through a longer cycle of time than any other member, having been present when the organizing was first mentioned, and having lived into the beginning of the Frater nity's seventy-fifth Anniversary Year. Members of II B (I) feel that the qualities of en-durance, strength, and loyalty which were Mrs. Libbey's were symbolic of these same qualities embodied within the Fraternity. Fannie Whitenack Libbey A service was held in memory of Fannie Whitenack Libbey on the afternoon of May 23 in the home of her daughter, Mrs. Charles Sawyer, with whom she made her home during the latter years of her life. This service was beautiful in its simplicity, the gathering of friends who loved her deeply. Reverend John Hall, pastor of the Methodist Church, of which Mrs. Libbey was an active member, officiated at the service and began by reading the comforting words of the twenty-eighth verse of the fourteenth chap-ter from the Gospel of St. John. Then a friend sang Harriet Beecher Stowe's poem, "Still, Still With Thee," and Reverend Hall spoke in praise of Mrs. Libbey's life, which had been so filled with doing good for 167 The Man o Made the Survey Dr. Taylor was suggested as the person best fitted to make the survey by Dr. Edwin A. Lee, Professor of Education and Dean of the School of Education, University of California at Los Angeles (1940) ; Professor of Education, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York (1938-1940). William S. Taylor, dean of the College of education at the University of Kentucky since 1923, received his early education in William S. Taylor the public schools of Ohio County. He completed the work for his B.S.A. degree at the University of Kentucky, received his M.S. degree from the University of Wisconsin, and was granted the Ph.D. degree by Columbia University. Dr. Taylor has gained recognition not only in his ownstate but throughout the United .States. He was asked to make a survey of secondary education in Arkansas in 1928-29 and this same year he served as vocational guidance counsellor for the Assembly of High School Youth in Oregon. The following year he acted in the same capacity in Washington and in 1930 the state of Montana asked that he come there as the Vocational counsellor for the Assembly of High School Youth in that state. In 1936-37 he was asked to serve as chairman of the Committee on Reorganization of the National Education Association, and in 1939 Miss Amy Hinrichs, then president of the National Education Association, appointed him chairman of the Committee on Academic Freedom and each succeeding president has reappointed him to this chairmanship. From 1933 to 1941 he served as state director for Kentucky for the N.E.A. Dr. Taylor holds membership in the following professional organizations: Phi Delta Kappa, Kappa Delta Pi, Alpha Zeta, Kentucky Education Association (president 1928-29) , American Vocational Association, National Society for the Study of Education, National Association of Colleges and Departments of Education (president 1926-27, secretary-treasurer 1941), American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Association of University Professors. The Development of Professional Education of Teachers in Pennsylvania was written by Dr. Taylor and he was co-author with J. G. Fowlkes, Thomas E. Goff, and W. W. Wright of Practical Arithmetic Work Books and with Jesse E. Adams of Introduction to Education and the Teaching Process, In 1937-38 he was on leave from the University of Kentucky and spent his time traveling and studying in England and on the continent. His most recent publication, Education in England, gives a summary of his findings while abroad. The Man Who Assisted Dr. Taylor Maurice F. Seay, Director of the Bureau of School Service and Head of the Department of Educational Administration at the University of Kentucky, received his A.B. and M.A. degrees from Transylvania College at Lexington, Kentucky. Mr. Seay has served since 1938 as a member of the Planning Board of the Kentucky Education Association; and is .a member of the Education Commission of Southern Mountain Workers Conference. 160 Evaluation of the Program of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at Gatlin.burg, Tennessee, with Recommendations for the Future By WILLIAM S. TAYLOR GENERAL STATEMENT An adequate appraisal of the work of the II B (T) Settlement School could not be made without a knowledge both of the purpose of its founders and of its accomplishments through the years. It is the purpose of this report to evaluate the present program of the school and to make suggestions concerning its future. No attempt will be made to recount the contributions of the school to Gatlinburg and the surrounding vicinity. This has been done effectively by many persons who visited this interesting educational project. To fail to acknowledge, however, the excellence of the work of the school and the service of the membership of the II B '4) fraternity to a community so desperately in need of help would be to fail to recognize the splendid service of a great unselfish organization of women throughout the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada. To Pi Beta Phis it may seem that their responsibility for this school and to the community has been greatly lessened since Gatlin-burg has grown from an isolated, rural area to a thriving community just outside a great national park. No longer is access to Gatlin-burg difficult. Beautiful highways approach this thriving little mountain town filled with good hotels and good tourist cabins. The season ending October 1 this year saw more than 1,250,000 guests in Gatlinburg and the Smokies. Measured by the usual yardstick of prosperity, the town of Gatlin-burg is a prosperous community. Those who go to Gatlinburg, however, and see only the new Gatlinburg Inn, the Riverside Hotel, the Greystone, the Mountain View Inn, the new tourist cabins, and the new business establishments, gain a one-sided picture of this mountain community. The other side of the picture can be seen by driving up Baskin's Run, visiting the Glades, or following the winding road to Cartertown. It is not Gatlinburg alone that has interested II B through the years ; it is the less fortunate area that lies within a radius of six to ten miles of this picturesque town. Any honest appraisal of the work of II B will show definitely that the Fraternity has been instrumental in raising the intellectual level of the community, in building character in its people, and in establishing good habits of life among the citizens of a remote area greatly in need of educational service. When II B (T. became interested in Gatlinburg, no one dreamed that the Great Smokies would some day become one of America's most beautiful national parks. Pi Phi did its work in this community in such a way as to gain the respect and good will of the families of the community whose children attended the school organized and operated by the Fraternity. The children were encouraged to go through high school, to attend college, and to make of themselves useful citizens of the community and the state in which they live. So well has the Fraternity done its work that the people who were property owners in the community have continued to grow with the community, and today, thirty years after II B 013 went into the area, the original families of the community are still the property owners with the business of Gatlin-burg in their hands. I do not know another community in the United States that has grown as rapidly as has Gatlinburg, nor one in which the original families have been able to profit as greatly from new business and increased values of property. It is 'a pleasant sight to see the Huffs, the Whaleys, the Ogles, and the other pioneer families of this mountain community enjoying the comforts of a new type of civiliaztion. Pi Phi can rightly claim a great portion of the credit for providing these people with the kind of education which enabled them to grow with their community. The greatly changed conditions, as a result of the development of the Great Smoky National Park and the rapid growth of Gatlinburg, necessarily compels a rethinking of II B 's program in this area. I have studied carefully the area that has been served by the school in the past and the area now being served. If there is any 161 162 THE DECEMBER ARROW Pi Beta Phi anywhere who feels that the Fraternity should leave Gatlinburg because of the rapid growth of the community, all she would have to do to convince herself that this would be unwise would be to make a critical study of the needs of the people in the area and of the county's ability to sup-port the schools. When the fraternity started the project, it hoped to provide a satisfactory education on the elementary level for the families served. A secondary education is just as essential to successful living in a democracy today as was elementary education three decades ago. The vision of the members of Pi Phi has been most unusual. Not only have they made available secondary education as soon as possible, but during the entire history of the school, they have attempted to provide the type of practical education which enabled the families of the area to improve their economic status and to live more comfortably and more happily in the shadow of the mountains. They realized from the beginning that to raise the social level of a people, they must also raise the economic level. A survey of the area served by the school will show clearly that, while many mountain communities have become increasingly poorer, the people in the mountain community served by II B (I) have been enabled to live on a higher economic and social level than ever before. FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION The budgets for 1940-41 and 1941-42 and the reports of the auditors for 1940-41 were carefully examined and discussed with the Director and the Bookkeeper. Since both of these officials are beginning their first year at the school, these discussions seemed to be helpful in clarifying the financial situation and in revealing the relationship of the budget to the current problems. The officials of the school are to be commended for the adoption of accepted practices for good financial administration. Complete audits of all accounts are made regularly; a satisfactory accounting procedure is followed and conscientious efforts are made to live within the budget. THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM The school is at the present time housed in two buildings, both of which are located on II B (I) land in Gatlinburg. The elementary school building is old and is hardly suitable for educational purposes. The high school building is newer, reasonably modern, fairly well lighted, and, on the whole, well adapted to present needs. The teachers in both the elementary and the secondary schools have been carefully chosen and are far above the average to be found in similar communities. The elementary school is now under county control, but II B (1. has used excellent judgment in retaining the right to nominate a portion of the teachers. The program of studies of the high school includes not only the fundamental subjects taught on the secondary level, but also a strong curriculum in home making and an excellent offering in vocational agriculture. There has recently been inaugurated an educational program in the crafts which should prove unusually interesting and helpful to the community. Still lacking is an adequate program in music which should be incorporated at the earliest possible date. The high school is working under crowded conditions. Classes are being conducted in the library and this is, of course, undesirable procedure. The crowded conditions of the high school will be relieved, however, when the new boys' dormitory has been completed and the boys residing in a wing of the building have been transferred to their new home, and when a new elementary school has been built and the seventh and eighth grades, now housed in the high school, have been transferred to the new elementary building. Pi Beta Phi has been wise in turning over to the county the administration and support of the elementary school. The State of Tennessee is gradually increasing its appropriation for educational purposes. Education in a democracy demands that the state and the local community, working cooperatively, with assistance in some areas from the Federal government, provide an adequate education for every child. Sevier County with the aid of state appropriations can at the present time finance the program of elementary education on a satisfactory basis and should do so. Within a few years, possibly two, certainly not to exceed six at the most, II B should relinquish its responsibility for the administration of the secondary education program. This does not mean that the fraternity will cease to be interested in the secondary school, but that it will not be responsible for the support of the part of the program which corresponds to the secondary education maintained by the county for other schools of its system. Relieved of this re THE DECEMBER ARROW 163 sponsibility, II B 1 can continue to supplement both the elementary and the secondary school programs with services which could not be supplied by the state or the county. Sevier County is paying approximately $5,500 as its share of the program of secondary education which is now administered by the II B .13 school. The Fraternity has followed a very wise policy in insisting from time to time that the county assume a larger share of the financial burden of the education program as the resources of the board of education become greater. The county has agreed to pay the salary of an additional teacher in the high school beginning with the present year. It is encouraging to note this willingness on the part of the county board to share in the cost of the program of secondary education in Gatlinburg and the surrounding area. Some of the funds used by Sevier County in paying its share of the B program come from the State and Federal grants for vocational education. If it were not for the willingness of the school to supplement these funds, these added services to the secondary school could not be obtained. As the present program of the H B (I) School is evaluated, the fact that the county is now making a large contribution to the cost of the high school should be kept in mind. Pi Beta Phi should not feel that it has been relieved of its responsibility for either the elementary or the secondary school when these are turned over to the county. The program that could be provided by the county would be far more meager than that which has been provided by the Settlement School. The Fraternity should continue to provide the additional features that give to the children of the area the knowledge, habits, and skills desirable in good citizens ; it should supply for a time the supplementary sums necessary to procure teachers of agriculture, home economics, industrial arts, weaving, and music. It should also continue to make avail-able to the elementary and secondary schools such services as those now rendered by the Health Center and the dormitories. There will be a considerable number of details to be worked out between the county board of education and II B 4), all of which I think can be handled with reasonable ease. For instance, when the administration of the secondary school is turned over to the county, the question of a building will, of course, be raised. It seems useless to build another secondary school building in Gatlin-burg. It would be my recommendation that the present secondary school building and the land on which it is located be leased to the county at a nominal sum and that II B 1 be relieved of any responsibility for the care and upkeep of the building. The present elementary school is unsuited for educational purposes. The elementary school should, however, be located near enough to the secondary school so that one principal can supervise both schools, and so that the two programs will continue to be integrated. H B 4 will not be able to supplement the elementary program as effectively if the building is located in some other part of the town. Such services as those rendered by the Health Center and the Craft Shop to the elementary program are of great value. There is a plot of land across Baskin's Run immediately opposite the high school, which, if it could be procured, would be a desirable site for the new elementary school building. This land, I understand, belongs to Mr. Huff, who owns the Mountain View Hotel. He is a public spirited person and probably would make it available to the community at a reasonable cost. The county will probably be able to build a satisfactory building if the site can be procured without cost to the county. Here again it might be wise for Pi Beta Phi to supplement the sum sufficiently to insure a building that will be entirely satisfactory to the organization which has sponsored this pro-gram so effectively. That detail would of necessity have to be worked out by the Fraternity and the county board. THE FARM The Settlement School has built up an interesting agricultural program and has, I think, made the most of its opportunities in this direction. The farm is operated on an economical basis and is producing just about as much as it can be made to produce. The teacher of agriculture, Mr. Coe, is responsible for the management of the farm, the excellent dairy herd, the poultry, the hogs, and the gardening. I do not see how he could have done any better than he has done. Without finding fault with the decisions that have been made in the past, I should like to raise the question as to whether or not the school can afford to use for agricultural purposes some of the land that proba164 THE DECEMBER ARROW bly has a minimum value of $2,000 an acre. The best of the more level land is now being used for gardening purposes, as it should be, if it is to be used for farm purposes at all. The hilly land is useful only for pasture. There is no possibility of raising feed for the dairy herd, the three horses, or the hogs and poultry. The management of the Mountain View Hotel objects to having the dairy herd grazing on the plot of land immediately in front of the hotel and has requested that cattle be kept off this small field. If the re-quest is granted, a small amount of hay may be produced on this plot; but again the question arises as to whether land so valuable should be used for hay production. There is a possibility that Mr. Huff may be willing to lease this plot on a long time basis at a good rental annually with a clause inserted in the lease that no buildings may be constructed on this property. His primary interest is to maintain a pleasant outlook from the hotel and, to some of the guests, cows in the immediate vicinity are objection-able. No hasty decision should be made about the farm. If it was started as a part of an educational program and was intended to be used as a demonstration of good farming, it has probably outlived its usefulness. The work in vocational agriculture demands that each boy enrolled in the class shall use scientific farm practices on his own home farm. The teacher visits each boy at his home and tries to help the boy and his parents to work out a better farm program. If agricultural progress in the community is to be made, it must come largely as a result of the influence of the agricultural teacher's program and the county agent's work. THE ARROWCRAFT PROGRAM Pi Beta Phi was a pioneer in providing for the area around Gatlinburg a type of adult education which enabled the people to revive an art all but lost in the early part of the century, an art that has given to the homes of the community an income badly needed. To be convinced of the worth of the pro-gram, one has but to glance at the sums paid monthly to each of the ninety-seven families now producing materials for the fraternity. If, however, this were not enough evidence, a visit to the homes where the materials are being produced would convince even the most skeptical that the revival of this art not only has been of economic value but that it has had great cultural value to the community. Almost every family in the en-tire area, whether it has produced materials for the II B (12 Settlement School or for some other agency, has profited because of the fraternity's early work in this field. The new Arrowcraft Shop, which has just been completed, is a beautiful building; it attracts thousands of tourists every year. The production program under the direction of Miss Redding and the sales division under Mrs. Snow seem to be managed in an unusually effective manner. The building is one of the show places of Gatlinburg; it was particularly interesting to watch tourists of evident culture and refinement come into the building to study the products of the mountain homes in the area. In addition to the Arrowcraft Shop a small, attractive sales shop is operated in the Mountain View Hotel. This shop is interesting not only because of its display of beautiful products, but also because of the demonstrations of weaving of afghans by Mrs. Georgia Duffield. Pi Beta Phi has set a high standard in its crafts program and this standard has never been lowered. One thing more, I think, should be said in passing the people who produce the materials for the Arrowcraft Shop thoroughly enjoy their work. It was a happy experience to watch Aunt Lizzie Reagan in her eighty-fourth year weaving for the friends of II B (I all over the world. THE HEALTH CENTER Even a casual appraisal of the work of the Health Center makes one enthusiastic about the contribution of this agency to the welfare of the community. Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, the present director of the Center, has given an unusual service to the entire area served by the school. Her instructional program in health education in the elementary and secondary schools of Gatlinburg and in the one and two-teacher schools in the surrounding county, her first aid program in the schools and in the community, and her work as a visiting nurse in the poorer homes of the area have made her loved and admired by children and adults in the entire area. It was a privilege to travel with Mrs. Chalmers, to visit the homes and the schools that she visits, and to see the excellent work which is being done. It would be impossible for the one doctor located in Gatlinburg to give the health THE DECEMBER ARROW 165 service that Mrs. Chalmers now gives. Mrs. Chalmers understands that the coming of a doctor to the community has relieved her of certain responsibilities which she formerly assumed; but to remove the work of the Health Center from the community would deprive the needy people of the area of a health service they could not possibly get in any other way. This service should be continued on its present high level. ADULT EDUCATION Gatlinburg, located at a considerable distance from a city of any kind, should have a program of adult education interesting to large numbers of people beyond school age. There are many unusual personalities in this town of 1,500 people and there is a definite need for a type of adult education that will be stimulating and satisfying. Such a pro-gram should be sponsored by the present advisory committee or by another local committee of perhaps nine people, at least one of whom should be a member of the Settlement School organization. It should certainly have persons on it like Miss Dorothy MacLean, Mr. King, the former principal of the school, and other people representing different interests and different levels of education. Few small communities have at their command so many resources in fine arts and in industrial arts as has Gatlinburg. Photography, for instance, a hobby with millions of Americans, is a highly developed art with Miss Dorothy MacLean, a citizen of the community. It should not be difficult to interest a considerable number of people in a study of this subject and in an enlarged appreciation of the beautiful in nature, in architecture, in gardens, in interior decoration, and in many other areas. Still another field which offers unusual opportunity in adult education is that of painting. Attention to this field has been called by both Mr. Lutcher Stark and Dean Edwin Holton. There are few spots in the world more gorgeous in the autumn or more beautiful in. the springtime than the Great Smoky Mountains in the vicinity of Gatlinburg. It should offer opportunities equal to those of Brown County in Indiana, or of Carmel-bythe-Sea, California. From the time the autumn colors fade until the redbud and the dogwood blossom in the springtime, Gatlinburg is a quiet community in which many people have a ()Teat deal of free time. Some of these people might spend many happy hours and increase their musical appreciation if a library of good records could be brought together and one evening a week for a short period of time could be set aside for a music hour. Such a weekly music hour has proved popular in many communities. Perhaps as good a way as any to start a program of adult education would be to pro-vide a forum series, using the high school auditorium as the place of meeting. It seems desirable that such a program should be a joint responsibility of Pi Phi and the community rather than an effort on the part of the fraternity alone. A program so sponsored would increase community interest and would enhance the opportunity to extend the program. Gatlinburg needs a library service, which can be provided only by an organization such as II B The library in the school should be made available to the community and some of the books should be sent out in pack-age libraries to the surrounding schools. Such a service will require much thought and planning; it is possible, however, to procure good reading materials for adults on all educational levels and to make this service avail-able twelve months a year. The industrial arts shop in connection with the high school offers spendid opportunities to both in-school and out-of-school groups in metal work and in work with wood. Mr. Poore is genuinely interested in building a helpful program in adult education; the work has already been well begun in this area with a large class enrolled in an evening school program. These adults are thoroughly interested and they are profiting from the experience. The school is engaged in a splendid pro-gram of adult education in agriculture, a program which will become increasingly effective. The opportunities for out-of-school groups in home economics, health, and industry are still largely unexplored and unrealized in spite of the excellence of the work of those in charge of these fields. The area served by the school is large and the educational process is slow, but genuine progress is being made. Pi Beta Phi can attract national attention-with its program of adult education if it will attack this problem with the enthusiasm, the intelligence, and the determination that have characterized its program for thirty years. 166 THE DECEMBER ARROW EMPHASIS FOR THE FUTURE PROGRAM In the preceding sections of this report no abrupt changes have been recommended for the policy or for the program of the school which II B (1) has sponsored for almost a third of a century. Years ago it was decided to have the county board of education assume, as it was able, greater financial and administrative responsibility for the education of the children in Gatlinburg and the adjacent communities. Already the elementary school has been turned over to the county, and the school authorities have agreed to assume full responsibility for the housing of this unit after a two year period. The county board of education is assuming a large share of the cost of the high school, paying the salary of an additional teacher this year. Within a period of a few years the county can be expected to under-take the administration of the secondary school at Gatlinburg; arrangements should be completed at an early date for the transfer of this responsibility to the county. As the fraternity has, from time to time, been relieved of certain financial obligations for educational services in which it has pioneered, it has been able to expand other phases of its work and to inaugurate new services. This has been a wise procedure; it has enabled II B 4T. to offer to the community an increasingly effective educational program. The result has been an enriched community life and a healthier, happier, and more intelligent citizenry whose high standards reflect credit upon the school and upon its sponsors. Now that the county can be expected to assume greater responsibilities for both the elementary and the secondary schools, the fraternity can look forward to an oppor tunity for providing the necessary funds to make possible a larger and a richer curricular offering. Several of the services now being rendered by the fraternity need to be expanded; and a great majority of the services discussed are supplementary, but they constitute the difference between an inadequate educational program and the opportunity for the richness of life to which every person in a democracy is entitled. These services should remain for many years the unique contribution of the II B t fraternity to this mountain community. With complete understanding and sympathetic cooperation between the county board of education and the fraternity, an experiment involving a total educational pro-gram for all of the people in an area can be expected to make an even greater contribution to education in America, and to bring even larger credit to the unselfish efforts of a group of women of high ideals and noble aspirations bound together in a great fraternity. AN APPRECIATION To all of those who have assisted in presenting the program of the II B cl) Settlement School and who have aided in a better understanding of its problems, the writer desires to express his appreciation. Particularly does he wish to acknowledge the assistance given by the following persons: Mrs. Joseph N. Copp of Los Angeles for her searching questions; Mrs. Elizabeth C. Peck and her associates at the school for their friendly help in providing information re-quested; and Professor Maurice F. Seay, his colleague at the University of Kentucky, for aid in evaluating the work of the school and for constructive criticism of this report. Two Founders: An Appreci ~ll~lC71 By FRANCES ROSSER BROWN, Oklahoma Alpha, National Historian "Let us read of them with reverence, let us remember them, feeling that in their dear and simple lives these women touched heights of truth and sincerity such as few ever attain."

ESTHER FRIEDLANDER, Minnesota Alpha FANNIE WHITENACK LIBBEY One evening in late April of 1867 five Monmouth College girls were visiting together in the home " of one of these five, Fannie Whitenack, when one of them suggested that they organize a college fraternity for women. This suggestion met with instant approval and within a short time final organization was made in the Holt home in Monmouth for the establishment of the first national secret college society for women, II B (D. There were twelve founders of this national fraternity who charted this way of service for thousands of college women who were to follow them. On May 21, 1941, the last surviving one of the twelve, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, passed away. It was she who saw the Fraternity through a longer cycle of time than any other member, having been present when the organizing was first mentioned, and having lived into the beginning of the Frater nity's seventy-fifth Anniversary Year. Members of II B (I) feel that the qualities of en-durance, strength, and loyalty which were Mrs. Libbey's were symbolic of these same qualities embodied within the Fraternity. Fannie Whitenack Libbey A service was held in memory of Fannie Whitenack Libbey on the afternoon of May 23 in the home of her daughter, Mrs. Charles Sawyer, with whom she made her home during the latter years of her life. This service was beautiful in its simplicity, the gathering of friends who loved her deeply. Reverend John Hall, pastor of the Methodist Church, of which Mrs. Libbey was an active member, officiated at the service and began by reading the comforting words of the twenty-eighth verse of the fourteenth chap-ter from the Gospel of St. John. Then a friend sang Harriet Beecher Stowe's poem, "Still, Still With Thee," and Reverend Hall spoke in praise of Mrs. Libbey's life, which had been so filled with doing good for 167
