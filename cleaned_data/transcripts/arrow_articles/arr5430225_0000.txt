She takes the , and if she is learning a new s instruction of any kind, I go give it. It is fortunate that we Ise, for the weavers live any quirement for a woman to come in once every two weeks, unless she has a reasonable excuse. Husbands and children come in at other times, and are a great help when there is a young baby to bring along or the weather is bad. No children are allowed to stay out of school to come, so we often play the role of truant officer. The women enjoy their weaving. The mountain people are especially clever with the use of their hands and with training do lovely work. They love the colors they use, and the greater variety they can have, the better they like it. All the designs are supplied to them. Most of them are original adaptations of old Colonial patterns-some of them are entirely new. A few standard coverlet drafts, like the Whig Rose and the Tennessee Blazing Star, find their place among our articles. Three years ago when .we moved into the building that was formerly the woodcraft shop, the weaving department came into its own. We were able then to expand our activities. I especially wanted the women to feel THE FEBRUARY ARROW that it is their building and that they are free to come there for advice, help, and recreation. From the calls they make upon us and the many problems which we solve unrelated to weaving, we are sure that the building and the opportunities for service fulfill a crying need. The monthly weaving meetings are held there the meetings when they receive their checks for weaving done in the previous four weeks, and come for a good time as well. We celebrate any and all occasions, decorations go up and come down, refreshments are pre-pared and served, weaving problems are discussed, ideas exchanged, songs are sung, poetry is read, anything that would give a good time is undertaken. Nothing is ever too much trouble for a weaving meeting. Sur-prises are carefully guarded and then sprung on the unsuspecting audience. Old friends visit for this is one time when they gather from all sections away from Gatlinburg. We get an opportunity to see the new babies as they come along, too. Our garden club which had its debut last spring meets in the weaving building once each month. The membership includes not only interested weavers but any woman from the community who cares to attend. The pro-grams have been varied and instructive. This spring we will be busy with some community beautification project. We have a lending library of light novels that are thoroughly enjoyed. The readers in the group soon read all the books and clamor for more. Old magazines are distributed whenever we have them. Tragic things happen, funny things hap-pen, and annoying things happen. This fall two of my young weavers lost their babies. Both cases caused us uneasiness until we learned the particulars and were assured that the weaving was not a contributing factor. We JENNIE NICHOL MEMORIAL HOSPITAL WINTER COMES TO ARROWCRAFT have a stringent rule that any weaver becomes pregnant must have permission the nurse or her doctor before she can tinue weaving.

Through the Weavers' Guild of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School a Garden Club was organized May 4, 1937. We call ourselves "The Gatlinburg Garden Club" meeting the first Tuesday of each month, to discuss different types of flowers, and their proper care, and planting. At the June meeting, we had a very interesting display of several different kinds of roses. The miniature bouquet was very interesting, as it was new to many of the weavers. October 5 we had a Flower Show, of which, we all were more than delighted, having been organized for such a short time. Flowers were displayed in abundance, and prizes were awarded. At the November meeting, we discussed bulbs, and their planting. Several of the members have planted bulbs of different kinds that bloom early in spring. We are sure this will improve our Flower Gardens, as heretofore we have not had many flowers to bloom in early spring. Everyone enjoyed the meeting in December as it was devoted entirely to the making of Christmas wreaths, from our beautiful holly, with its many red berries this year, and the evergreen cedar.

Our play must be something we were familiar with, and as most everyone is interested in our quaint mountain brogue and odd ways of living, we decided to make our play centralize around our mountain cabin homes.
