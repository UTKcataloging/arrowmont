NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON THE NEW TEACHERS' RESIDENCE Coming to Gatlinburg last June and remaining for nearly five months has given me time for a closer and more intimate study of the actual needs of our work here. Every day of these months has been a busy one. The greatest work has been building the new teachers' residence which will be completed and in use when you read this. This building was designed by Elmina and Ada Wilson, Iowa r, and members of the New York. Alumnie Club. It is situated about *Further information in regard to the Loan Fund may be found on page 83 of THE ARROW for October. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 171 twenty feet west of the old cottage and about three hundred feet east of the school building on the top and side of the hill, facing the north, directly in front of the driveway from the highWay, with a good view of mountains from every window. Upon entering the piazza (28x12) and up a step we come to the front door alcove, with its seats on either side inviting you to rest and gaze upon the wonderful mountain view, which just now is brilliant in coloring from the touch of Jack Frost. The front door opens into a hall IxIO) with a living-room (16x20) on the east, finished in beautiful, almost perfect chestnut. A great chimney of warm red brick nearly fills the south end, with inviting chimney seats or cosy corners on either side. Four windows give abundailt light to this most attractive room with its beaded and matched walls and ceilings and open joists. On the right of the hall in the northwest corner is the teachers' "den" or library, a snug room (16xI0) with three windows. Directly across the hall from the front door is the dining-room (16x11), with walls finished with 11-inch red oak boards, laid vertically with 2-inch battens, and a freeze of narrow boards laid horizontally above the moulding strips. A built-in sideboard is on the west wall while three large windows introduce a flood of warm sunlight. This is a wonder-fully handsome room, every board being about perfect. On its left and back of the living-room are the pantry and kitchen, light and airy and fitted with built-in closets and conveniences. A bedroom planned for the head resident, is in the southwest corner ,of the house. (13x11), and off the stair hall is the lavatory and toilet. The hall and stairway are entirely cut off from the front of the house and are in the west center of the building between the den and head resident's bedroom. From this hall, stairs lead down to the basement and up to the second floor. On the second floor are five beautiful bedrooms, all finished in velvety, narrow beaded and matched native wood, selected for its fine, clear grain and perfect quality. The sizes of these rooms are as follows: northeast room (12%x16), center or guestroom (I1 xl5), northwest room (9x16), south-east room (9x16) , the bathroom (734x11) , with generous closets in each room, a linen closet, broom closet, and clothes closet. The attic or third floor is over, the whole building and will be spacious for storage of trunks, etc. The outside of the house is covered with clear poplar, or whitewood siding and shingled roof. The foundation walls are made of concrete and also the basement 172 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI floor. A new 76 ft. well, with 60 ft. of water in dry season with a 2 H. P. Kewanee pump will furnish the water supply and an American Radiator Company steam furnace, the heat. The whole makes a building complete in every detail, and the careful work done by our men (all but one of whom come from Gatlinburg and our mountains nearby), has resulted in a substantial, handsome building, "the best built house in the county" with which our Pi Phis may well be satisfied and enjoy genuine pleasure in owning and occupying. It has taken seventy-seven days to build this house and it will cost approximately $5,500. ELIZABETH A. HELMICK. OUR PROPOSED HOSPITAL' Now that our long-talked-of teachers' residence, with its furnace heat and abundance of running water, is a reality, we must turn our thoughts and strength to the next greatest need the hospital. This year greater than ever we have needed this institution. School has been closed by order of the County School Board for two weeks because of an epidemic of diphtheria, and a large number of deaths among the children, especially at the Sugar Lands, have been entirely due to lack of proper care. As I write this I am interrupted by a caller who reports the second death in Pink Cole's family of five (the oldest nine years old) this month. They live on the Two Mile Creek and he has been one of the best workmen on the new residence. No doctor nor nurse visited this family! You who can call a physician by phone and have him at your bedside within a hour cannot realize the conditions here when we may travel over rough roads eight or ten miles to the only phone, find it ott of order, travel eight or ten miles farther on, and by begging and pleading and offering or knowing you will have to pay a year's savings for the visit get the doctor to your sick child inside of twenty-four hours at the quickest and possibly not until forty-eight hours have passed. I cannot think of a single family which has not had sickness of one kind or another this fall. It has been a terribly hard fall upon" everybody, the people tell me. While we have had no physician to diagnose these cases, we believe our people have had diphtheria, scarlet fever,pneumonia, tonsilitis, and numerous lesser ailments. For these, every woman has a differ= ent remedy, handed down for generations. I have been told by a NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 173 visiting mountain physician that these remedies kill as many as they cure. Dear sisters in Pi Beta Phi, for the sake of the small, helpless children let us share with our mountain mothers the means at our command to promptly equip this little building with the simple necessities for relieving the anguish and suffering among our people. The county has given us a permanent lease of this school property which is wonderfully situated on top of a hill overlooking the valley and the surrounding mountain ranges and includes a 50x30 two-year-old building. This should be put in use immediately. I have just the nurse we need ready to come. The plan is to have her in charge of the hospital, with a native girl or two native girls always in training as assistants, and when not needed at the hospital, to have her go out daily as a visiting nurse, examining into the health of our people and the conditions they live under, giving lessons and advice upon caring for the sick. The need is so great here that words fail me in putting it as forcefully as I feel it should be. It is proposed that this work shall be entirely memorial. Dear sisters, for the sake of one of your precious ones who have gone before you, will you not send a gift to this splendid undertaking for preventing suffering and prolonging life? We have been given an almost new ambulance. We shall need two mules. Will some one offer to buy a mule for the hospital? The nurse will ride one of these mules up' the ravines and river bottoms, over the divides and through narrow, rocky trails: will some one offer to' buy a saddle for her? I am going ahead with this work with the conviction in my heart that God will answer my prayer that generous gifts will come to'' pay the cost. Address, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. ELIZABETH A. HELmIcK. THE IMPRESSIONS OF A VISITING ALUMNA, GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE Dear Pi Phi Sisters : I felt quite like the old woman in the nursery rhyme who, when she awakened, enquired of the world "Be this I or be this not I" when I opened my eyes upon these beautiful hills! For three years I have wanted to visit the Pi Phi School and see it before the life of the community was greatly changed: and here I am! Girls, it's 174 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI quite interesting leaving Knoxville at six A. M. on a most informal train for Sevierville and then riding fifteen miles in a springless "hack," eight of those miles being over the rockiest road I ever encountered but through beautiful scenery. Jack Frost had done his work well on the hill sides: the little Pigeon, spanned by numerous little swinging bridges, rushing and tumbling along; the women washing clothes by the water's' edge and boiling them in huge iron pots, all made the time pass away quickly and pleasantly and before we realized it we were at our journey's end and rounding a turn in the road there was Andy Ogle's new house (I recognized it by its picture in THE ARROW), the schoolhouse and nestled in the trees near by, the teachers' cottage, the nearly completed new residence and Mrs. Helmick's new bungalow, and such a warm welcome from' Mrs. Helmick, Miss Plank and the teachers. We (my daughter and I) felt that we belonged to the place at once. I wish you might see the residence; it is lovely, roomy, and of pleasing architecture. You know they do not lathe and plaster down here. These walls, instead of being of pine boards, are down stairs quartered sawed red oak, left in its natural state and you have no idea how beautiful it is. Mrs. Helmick has watched every board that has gone into the house, indeed, there is much of Mrs. Helmick in that house. She was telling me she had reduced twenty poimds this summer and attributed it to her simple life and lack of soups and desserts; but her young son George exclaimed "It's that house, trotting 'round all day for it. She's the whole works." And he is about right. Who of us would be willing to come down here and stay four months as 'she has done to superintend this building? She is up and out every morning at 6 :30 to start the men, going down :to Mr. Huff's to telephone about bricks, plumbing, paint, etc., and being subject to call all day long. She is greatly distressed that her correspondence has been neglected but it is physically impossible, for one person to do more .than she has down here. Everybody is busy down here.* Miss Plank and the three teachers are constantly on the jump. Just at the present time the school attendance is small owing to a recent quarantine and prevalence of diphtheria and scarlet fever, but even so every night after school finds the four cottage workers headed out on a mission up Roaring Creek to Mrs. McCarters to see about "kivers" she is weaving or up Sugar Lands way to Aunt Lydia's to buy baskets, or Mill Creek to Steve Whaley's or, over to the Glades to Montgomery's and' then NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 175 every night to Mrs. Ephriam Ogle's, a good mile there and back, for their quart of milk. A very busy life is that of our Pi Phi sisters working at our school. I am, going home filled with enthusiasm for our work here. I have been in the homes and the girls have told me of the changes which have been wrought since we started our school, but there is still much .to do. A hospital is a crying need! The use of the county school on the hill has been given us for this purpose, but we must equip it and put a nurse in charge and that will take money. We have started a big thing down here; we have the confidence of the people and we must not weaken or turn back.. We must feel that this is just as important a missionary work as any done by the churches. Some of us feel that we have given all that we can when we give to church missions. That is all right ; give all you can there and then bustle around and give more for the Pi Phi School, and don't think that when that five-year pledge is out that you are through, we have only just started ! I have been visiting several of these mountain schools while down here and I , can see what great things we can do with time and MONEY. MARY B. WALLACE, Des Moines Alumna Club. OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL STAFF Elva Plank, now head resident of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, was a charter member of the Bloom-field chapter, installed in October, 1881, at the South Iowa Normal School. She was a student at the Iowa Wesleyan University during the year 1882. In November, 1884, she was sent as a delegate to the Seventh Grand Alpha Convention, held at Iowa City, and was elected secretary of that session. At the Lawrence Convention, in 1885, in the 'absence of the Grand President, Nell Custer-Swisher, and there being no vice-president, Miss Plank was chosen to preside. This was the ELVA PLANK Head Resident 176 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI convention which voted that "no chapter shall exist unless situated in a university or a college." She served as Grand Vice-president from 1885 to 1888 and as Grand TreaSurer from 1888 to 1890. It will be remembered that at the Ottumwa Convention in 1888 it was voted, after years of agitation on the subject, to change the name of our organization from I. C. Sorosis to Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, and the Greek letters Pi Beta Phi exchanged places on our Arrow with the I. C., which thereafter stood for our motto. Miss Plank was one of the advocates of this change, and when the convention authorized the incorporation of the Fraternity under the laws of Illinois, she was one of the four directors for the first year. In January, 1916, -Miss Plank visited the school at Gatlinburg and gave her services until the close of the school year in March, becoming so deeply interested in the work that she applied for the position of head resident upon the retirement of Miss Caroline.

In the fall of the same year she entered the U niversity of Michigan, and on No.: vember 9 was initiated into Pi Beta Phi Fraternity.

By Ethel Hueston, Iowa A. The Bobbs Merrill Co., Indianapolis, Ind. Price, $I.25. All readers of Prudence of the Parsonage which was reviewed at length in THE ARROW for last March will be eager to read the sequel, Prudence Says So. In the new volume, Prudence, the charming heroine of the earlier book, does not figure prominently after the first few chapters for she leaves the parsonage to found her own home. Her influence, however, yet remains in the manse and the words "Prudence Says So" are constantly used in family arguments by those left behind. The book deals with the development of the other four "parsonage girls" who grow into exceptionally attractive womanhood. Mrs. Hueston is gaining in pictorial power and her new book contains more passages of real strength than are found in the earlier volume while the appealing qualities of Prudence of the Parsonage are, if anything, intensified in its sequel. IN MEMORIAM , 179 IN MEMORIAM LOUISE ROWE-DESHLER Iowa r mourns the death of Louise Rowe-Deshler who died at Billings, Montana, in August, 1916. The early years of her splendid life were spent at Boone, Iowa. She was graduated from the Iowa State College at Ames in 1904, where she had been active in all student organizations and was easily one of the leaders of her class. While in college she was an active worker for the reestablishment of Iowa P of II B (D. In 1907-8 Louise again entered Iowa State College to take a postgraduate course giving special attention to dietetics. She was a dietitian at Fuiley Hospital in Dubuque, Iowa, for two years, leaving only to accept a better position in the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Later she established a strong course in domestic science in her home town, Boone, Iowa. Her strength of character was evident during the trying period before her marriage when death claimed both her -father and her mother within the year. She never wavered when the trials seemed hardest, but met her troubles bravely. In July, 1915, Louise was married to W. E. Deshler, also a graduate of Iowa State College. To her new home she gave a rare devotion and love which made her home life radiant with happiness. Among her new friends in the West, she displayed the same womanly qualities that had always dominated her life as student, teacher, friend. In August, 1916, death claimed .her soon after the birth and death of her little daughter. One of the sweetest memories her II friends cherish is a note written to them just before her passing when her heart was so filled with love and anticipation of her approaching motherhood. Mrs. Deshler was a member of O. E. S. and D. A. R. She possessed a splendid personality and was devoted to the service of those about her; Iowa r is richer and better for her membership.

In the new volume, Prudence, the charming heroine of the earlier book, does not figure prominently after the first few chapters for she leaves the parsonage to found her own home. Her influence, however, yet remains in the manse and the words "Prudence Says So" are constantly used in family arguments by those left behind. The book deals with the development of the other four "parsonage girls" who grow into exceptionally attractive womanhood. Mrs. Hueston is gaining in pictorial power and her new book contains more passages of real strength than are found in the earlier volume while the appealing qualities of Prudence of the Parsonage are, if anything, intensified in its sequel.

The early years of her splendid life were spent at Boone, Iowa.

In 1907-8 Louise again entered Iowa State College to take a postgraduate course giving special attention to dietetics. She was a dietitian at Fuiley Hospital in Dubuque, Iowa, for two years, leaving only to accept a better position in the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Later she established a strong course in domestic science in her home town, Boone, Iowa. Her strength of character was evident during the trying period before her marriage when death claimed both her -father and her mother within the year. She never wavered when the trials seemed hardest, but met her troubles bravely. In July, 1915, Louise was married to W. E. Deshler, also a graduate of Iowa State College. To her new home she gave a rare devotion and love which made her home life radiant with happiness.

        174 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI quite interesting leaving Knoxville at six A. M. on a most informal train for Sevierville and then riding fifteen miles in a springless "hack," eight of those miles being over the rockiest road I ever encountered but through beautiful scenery. Jack Frost had done his work well on the hill sides: the little Pigeon, spanned by numerous little swinging bridges, rushing and tumbling along; the women washing clothes by the water's' edge and boiling them in huge iron pots, all made the time pass away quickly and pleasantly and before we realized it we were at our journey's end and rounding a turn in the road there was Andy Ogle's new house (I recognized it by its picture in THE ARROW), the schoolhouse and nestled in the trees near by, the teachers' cottage, the nearly completed new residence and Mrs. Helmick's new bungalow, and such a warm welcome from' Mrs. Helmick, Miss Plank and the teachers. We (my daughter and I) felt that we belonged to the place at once. I wish you might see the residence; it is lovely, roomy, and of pleasing architecture. You know they do not lathe and plaster down here. These walls, instead of being of pine boards, are down stairs quartered sawed red oak, left in its natural state and you have no idea how beautiful it is. Mrs. Helmick has watched every board that has gone into the house, indeed, there is much of Mrs. Helmick in that house. She was telling me she had reduced twenty poimds this summer and attributed it to her simple life and lack of soups and desserts; but her young son George exclaimed "It's that house, trotting 'round all day for it. She's the whole works." And he is about right. Who of us would be willing to come down here and stay four months as 'she has done to superintend this building? She is up and out every morning at 6 :30 to start the men, going down :to Mr. Huff's to telephone about bricks, plumbing, paint, etc., and being subject to call all day long. She is greatly distressed that her correspondence has been neglected but it is physically impossible, for one person to do more .than she has down here. Everybody is busy down here.* Miss Plank and the three teachers are constantly on the jump. Just at the present time the school attendance is small owing to a recent quarantine and prevalence of diphtheria and scarlet fever, but even so every night after school finds the four cottage workers headed out on a mission up Roaring Creek to Mrs. McCarters to see about "kivers" she is weaving or up Sugar Lands way to Aunt Lydia's to buy baskets, or Mill Creek to Steve Whaley's or, over to the Glades to Montgomery's and' then NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 175 every night to Mrs. Ephriam Ogle's, a good mile there and back, for their quart of milk. A very busy life is that of our Pi Phi sisters working at our school. I am, going home filled with enthusiasm for our work here. I have been in the homes and the girls have told me of the changes which have been wrought since we started our school, but there is still much .to do. A hospital is a crying need! The use of the county school on the hill has been given us for this purpose, but we must equip it and put a nurse in charge and that will take money. We have started a big thing down here; we have the confidence of the people and we must not weaken or turn back.. We must feel that this is just as important a missionary work as any done by the churches. Some of us feel that we have given all that we can when we give to church missions. That is all right ; give all you can there and then bustle around and give more for the Pi Phi School, and don't think that when that five-year pledge is out that you are through, we have only just started ! I have been visiting several of these mountain schools while down here and I , can see what great things we can do with time and MONEY. MARY B. WALLACE, Des Moines Alumna Club. OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL STAFF Elva Plank, now head resident of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, was a charter member of the Bloom-field chapter, installed in October, 1881, at the South Iowa Normal School. She was a student at the Iowa Wesleyan University during the year 1882. In November, 1884, she was sent as a delegate to the Seventh Grand Alpha Convention, held at Iowa City, and was elected secretary of that session. At the Lawrence Convention, in 1885, in the 'absence of the Grand President, Nell Custer-Swisher, and there being no vice-president, Miss Plank was chosen to preside.

She served as Grand Vice-president from 1885 to 1888 and as Grand TreaSurer from 1888 to 1890. It will be remembered that at the Ottumwa Convention in 1888 it was voted, after years of agitation on the subject, to change the name of our organization from I. C.

Upon entering the piazza (28x12) and up a step we come to the front door alcove, with its seats on either side inviting you to rest and gaze upon the wonderful mountain view, which just now is brilliant in coloring from the touch of Jack Frost. The front door opens into a hall IxIO) with a living-room (16x20) on the east, finished in beautiful, almost perfect chestnut. A great chimney of warm red brick nearly fills the south end, with inviting chimney seats or cosy corners on either side. Four windows give abundailt light to this most attractive room with its beaded and matched walls and ceilings and open joists. On the right of the hall in the northwest corner is the teachers' "den" or library, a snug room (16xI0) with three windows. Directly across the hall from the front door is the dining-room (16x11), with walls finished with 11-inch red oak boards, laid vertically with 2-inch battens, and a freeze of narrow boards laid horizontally above the moulding strips. A built-in sideboard is on the west wall while three large windows introduce a flood of warm sunlight. This is a wonder-fully handsome room, every board being about perfect. On its left and back of the living-room are the pantry and kitchen, light and airy and fitted with built-in closets and conveniences. A bedroom planned for the head resident, is in the southwest corner ,of the house. (13x11), and off the stair hall is the lavatory and toilet. The hall and stairway are entirely cut off from the front of the house and are in the west center of the building between the den and head resident's bedroom. From this hall, stairs lead down to the basement and up to the second floor. On the second floor are five beautiful bedrooms, all finished in velvety, narrow beaded and matched native wood, selected for its fine, clear grain and perfect quality. The sizes of these rooms are as follows: northeast room (12%x16), center or guestroom (I1 xl5), northwest room (9x16), south-east room (9x16) , the bathroom (734x11) , with generous closets in each room, a linen closet, broom closet, and clothes closet.

The whole makes a building complete in every detail, and the careful work done by our men (all but one of whom come from Gatlinburg and our mountains nearby), has resulted in a substantial, handsome building, "the best built house in the county" with which our Pi Phis may well be satisfied and enjoy genuine pleasure in owning and occupying. It has taken seventy-seven days to build this house and it will cost approximately $5,500. ELIZABETH A. HELMICK. OUR PROPOSED HOSPITAL' Now that our long-talked-of teachers' residence, with its furnace heat and abundance of running water, is a reality, we must turn our thoughts and strength to the next greatest need the hospital. This year greater than ever we have needed this institution. School has been closed by order of the County School Board for two weeks because of an epidemic of diphtheria, and a large number of deaths among the children, especially at the Sugar Lands, have been entirely due to lack of proper care. As I write this I am interrupted by a caller who reports the second death in Pink Cole's family of five (the oldest nine years old) this month. They live on the Two Mile Creek and he has been one of the best workmen on the new residence. No doctor nor nurse visited this family! You who can call a physician by phone and have him at your bedside within a hour cannot realize the conditions here when we may travel over rough roads eight or ten miles to the only phone, find it ott of order, travel eight or ten miles farther on, and by begging and pleading and offering or knowing you will have to pay a year's savings for the visit get the doctor to your sick child inside of twenty-four hours at the quickest and possibly not until forty-eight hours have passed. I cannot think of a single family which has not had sickness of one kind or another this fall. It has been a terribly hard fall upon" everybody, the people tell me. While we have had no physician to diagnose these cases, we believe our people have had diphtheria, scarlet fever,pneumonia, tonsilitis, and numerous lesser ailments. For these, every woman has a differ= ent remedy, handed down for generations. I have been told by a NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 173 visiting mountain physician that these remedies kill as many as they cure. Dear sisters in Pi Beta Phi, for the sake of the small, helpless children let us share with our mountain mothers the means at our command to promptly equip this little building with the simple necessities for relieving the anguish and suffering among our people. The county has given us a permanent lease of this school property which is wonderfully situated on top of a hill overlooking the valley and the surrounding mountain ranges and includes a 50x30 two-year-old building. This should be put in use immediately. I have just the nurse we need ready to come. The plan is to have her in charge of the hospital, with a native girl or two native girls always in training as assistants, and when not needed at the hospital, to have her go out daily as a visiting nurse, examining into the health of our people and the conditions they live under, giving lessons and advice upon caring for the sick. The need is so great here that words fail me in putting it as forcefully as I feel it should be. It is proposed that this work shall be entirely memorial. Dear sisters, for the sake of one of your precious ones who have gone before you, will you not send a gift to this splendid undertaking for preventing suffering and prolonging life? We have been given an almost new ambulance. We shall need two mules. Will some one offer to buy a mule for the hospital? The nurse will ride one of these mules up' the ravines and river bottoms, over the divides and through narrow, rocky trails: will some one offer to' buy a saddle for her? I am going ahead with this work with the conviction in my heart that God will answer my prayer that generous gifts will come to'' pay the cost. Address, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. ELIZABETH A. HELmIcK. THE IMPRESSIONS OF A VISITING ALUMNA, GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE Dear Pi Phi Sisters : I felt quite like the old woman in the nursery rhyme who, when she awakened, enquired of the world "Be this I or be this not I" when I opened my eyes upon these beautiful hills! For three years I have wanted to visit the Pi Phi School and see it before the life of the community was greatly changed: and here I am! Girls, it's 174 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI quite interesting leaving Knoxville at six A. M. on a most informal train for Sevierville and then riding fifteen miles in a springless "hack," eight of those miles being over the rockiest road I ever encountered but through beautiful scenery. Jack Frost had done his work well on the hill sides: the little Pigeon, spanned by numerous little swinging bridges, rushing and tumbling along; the women washing clothes by the water's' edge and boiling them in huge iron pots, all made the time pass away quickly and pleasantly and before we realized it we were at our journey's end and rounding a turn in the road there was Andy Ogle's new house (I recognized it by its picture in THE ARROW), the schoolhouse and nestled in the trees near by, the teachers' cottage, the nearly completed new residence and Mrs. Helmick's new bungalow, and such a warm welcome from' Mrs. Helmick, Miss Plank and the teachers. We (my daughter and I) felt that we belonged to the place at once. I wish you might see the residence; it is lovely, roomy, and of pleasing architecture. You know they do not lathe and plaster down here. These walls, instead of being of pine boards, are down stairs quartered sawed red oak, left in its natural state and you have no idea how beautiful it is. Mrs. Helmick has watched every board that has gone into the house, indeed, there is much of Mrs. Helmick in that house. She was telling me she had reduced twenty poimds this summer and attributed it to her simple life and lack of soups and desserts; but her young son George exclaimed "It's that house, trotting 'round all day for it. She's the whole works." And he is about right. Who of us would be willing to come down here and stay four months as 'she has done to superintend this building? She is up and out every morning at 6 :30 to start the men, going down :to Mr. Huff's to telephone about bricks, plumbing, paint, etc., and being subject to call all day long. She is greatly distressed that her correspondence has been neglected but it is physically impossible, for one person to do more .than she has down here. Everybody is busy down here.* Miss Plank and the three teachers are constantly on the jump. Just at the present time the school attendance is small owing to a recent quarantine and prevalence of diphtheria and scarlet fever, but even so every night after school finds the four cottage workers headed out on a mission up Roaring Creek to Mrs. McCarters to see about "kivers" she is weaving or up Sugar Lands way to Aunt Lydia's to buy baskets, or Mill Creek to Steve Whaley's or, over to the Glades to Montgomery's and' then NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 175 every night to Mrs. Ephriam Ogle's, a good mile there and back, for their quart of milk. A very busy life is that of our Pi Phi sisters working at our school. I am, going home filled with enthusiasm for our work here. I have been in the homes and the girls have told me of the changes which have been wrought since we started our school, but there is still much .to do. A hospital is a crying need! The use of the county school on the hill has been given us for this purpose, but we must equip it and put a nurse in charge and that will take money. We have started a big thing down here; we have the confidence of the people and we must not weaken or turn back.. We must feel that this is just as important a missionary work as any done by the churches. Some of us feel that we have given all that we can when we give to church missions. That is all right ; give all you can there and then bustle around and give more for the Pi Phi School, and don't think that when that five-year pledge is out that you are through, we have only just started ! I have been visiting several of these mountain schools while down here and I , can see what great things we can do with time and MONEY. MARY B. WALLACE, Des Moines Alumna Club. OUR SETTLEMENT SCHOOL STAFF Elva Plank, now head resident of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, was a charter member of the Bloom-field chapter, installed in October, 1881, at the South Iowa Normal School. She was a student at the Iowa Wesleyan University during the year 1882. In November, 1884, she was sent as a delegate to the Seventh Grand Alpha Convention, held at Iowa City, and was elected secretary of that session. At the Lawrence Convention, in 1885, in the 'absence of the Grand President, Nell Custer-Swisher, and there being no vice-president, Miss Plank was chosen to preside. This was the ELVA PLANK Head Resident 176 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI convention which voted that "no chapter shall exist unless situated in a university or a college." She served as Grand Vice-president from 1885 to 1888 and as Grand TreaSurer from 1888 to 1890. It will be remembered that at the Ottumwa Convention in 1888 it was voted, after years of agitation on the subject, to change the name of our organization from I. C. Sorosis to Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, and the Greek letters Pi Beta Phi exchanged places on our Arrow with the I. C., which thereafter stood for our motto. Miss Plank was one of the advocates of this change, and when the convention authorized the incorporation of the Fraternity under the laws of Illinois, she was one of the four directors for the first year. In January, 1916, -Miss Plank visited the school at Gatlinburg and gave her services until the close of the school year in March, becoming so deeply interested in the work that she applied for the position of head resident upon the retirement of Miss Caroline.

By Ethel Hueston, Iowa A. The Bobbs Merrill Co., Indianapolis, Ind. Price, $I.25. All readers of Prudence of the Parsonage which was reviewed at length in THE ARROW for last March will be eager to read the sequel, Prudence Says So. In the new volume, Prudence, the charming heroine of the earlier book, does not figure prominently after the first few chapters for she leaves the parsonage to found her own home. Her influence, however, yet remains in the manse and the words "Prudence Says So" are constantly used in family arguments by those left behind. The book deals with the development of the other four "parsonage girls" who grow into exceptionally attractive womanhood. Mrs. Hueston is gaining in pictorial power and her new book contains more passages of real strength than are found in the earlier volume while the appealing qualities of Prudence of the Parsonage are, if anything, intensified in its sequel. IN MEMORIAM , 179 IN MEMORIAM LOUISE ROWE-DESHLER Iowa r mourns the death of Louise Rowe-Deshler who died at Billings, Montana, in August, 1916. The early years of her splendid life were spent at Boone, Iowa. She was graduated from the Iowa State College at Ames in 1904, where she had been active in all student organizations and was easily one of the leaders of her class. While in college she was an active worker for the reestablishment of Iowa P of II B (D. In 1907-8 Louise again entered Iowa State College to take a postgraduate course giving special attention to dietetics. She was a dietitian at Fuiley Hospital in Dubuque, Iowa, for two years, leaving only to accept a better position in the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Later she established a strong course in domestic science in her home town, Boone, Iowa. Her strength of character was evident during the trying period before her marriage when death claimed both her -father and her mother within the year. She never wavered when the trials seemed hardest, but met her troubles bravely. In July, 1915, Louise was married to W. E. Deshler, also a graduate of Iowa State College. To her new home she gave a rare devotion and love which made her home life radiant with happiness. Among her new friends in the West, she displayed the same womanly qualities that had always dominated her life as student, teacher, friend. In August, 1916, death claimed .her soon after the birth and death of her little daughter. One of the sweetest memories her II friends cherish is a note written to them just before her passing when her heart was so filled with love and anticipation of her approaching motherhood. Mrs. Deshler was a member of O. E. S. and D. A. R. She possessed a splendid personality and was devoted to the service of those about her; Iowa r is richer and better for her membership.
