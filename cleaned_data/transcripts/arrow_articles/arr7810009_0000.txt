There is no question that the days in Gatlinburg were filled with highly productive accomplishments and that all attending the meeting found revelations related to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School program and the growth of Gatlinburg that will undergird a strong and everlasting association between fraternity and community. From the arrival of the national officers at the Mountain-View Hotel through the coming of active chapter presidents and pledge supervisors to the welcoming of the AAC chairmen, the conclave was one artfully balanced between work and workshops and things social and special. Work and Workshops s The primary purpose of this meeting was to work and that purpose was filled in every sense of the word. Grand Council had arrived in Gatlinburg a week earlier for its annual interim meeting and had spent all of its days and hours of its nights during that period around a paper laden table in discussion and action that covered everything from selecting recipients of annual awards to drafting policy decisions for consideration by officers. Province Presidents and Vice Presidents and several other national officers arrived on Friday morning June 16, had lunch and were in their first joint meeting by 1:30 p.m. The pace, thus established, continued briskly through a weekend of separate work-shops or joint meetings morning, afternoon and night. Joint Meetings covered every phase of the Fraternity program with reports from all members of Grand Council in the areas their offices serve and reports and recommendations from the Settlement School chairman, Chapter House Corporation Counselor, Scholarship Chairman, Director of Central Office, National Convention Guide and ARROW Editor. In four separate workshop sessions Province Presidents met with Mrs. Mansfield presiding, and Province Vice Presidents were in session with Mrs. Morgan as chairman. These meetings were filled with discussions relating to virtually every phase of the officers' duties and activities aimed at educating, strengthening and improving as each phase might require. Other members of Grand Council and national officers met with these workshop groups for more detailed consideration of interests mutual to their offices and those of the province officers. In addition to giving enthusiastic support to major decisions regarding a firm statement of membership policy and the adoption of the IBM system for fraternity records and accounting, the province officers heard discussions on the improvements slated in the area of rushing, reference and sponsorship of new members, of the decison to try a five-issue ARROW schedule for three years with the ARROW Information Bulletin to be on a limited printing basis and of the improved codification of house corporation procedures. Province Vice Presidents checked out of the hotel Monday as the active chapter presidents and pledge supervisors began to arrive by the bus load, shepherded from Knoxville by the Workshop's efficient transportation chairman, Joan Black Wallace.

Their discussions covered a broad range of fraternity activity, organization and policy as it relates both to the chapter life and to the overall program of Pi Beta Phi. Ideas were shared on topics ranging from scholarship, rushing and officer training to standards, fraternity projects, activities and Panhellenic relations . . . and many other subjects. Alumnae Advisory Chairmen arrived Wednesday afternoon and were housed at the Riverside Motel. They joined with their active chapter representatives in joint workshop sessions Wednesday night and then met in three sessions of their own on Friday. The final attention to work was given on Friday night in a joint meeting of the AAC chairmen and Grand Council.

Thursday was a special day from start to finish with morning and afternoon tours of the Settlement School alternating with scenic bus trips into the Smoky Mountain National Park to Clingman's Dome and an angel-eye view of some of the majestically beautiful scenery that surrounds Gatlinburg. The Settlement School Committee and staff rolled out a many-aisled red carpet for the tours of the institution facilities. The tour began at the remodeled Red Barn and the story of its original use for agriculture students and its present service for Workshop students and meetings. It went on through the comfortably appointed Ruth Barret Smith Staff House, paused for fascinating, lingering glances at the interesting mementoes in the Log Cabin museum, continued through Stuart Cottage, the Girls' Dorm and Helmick House, the Boys' Dorm, the Pi Beta Phi THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI High School where the Craft Workshop is held, the Emma Harper Turner Craft Center, the Jennie Nichol Memorial Health Center and the Arrowcraft Shop. Along the way the growing enthusiasm and interest of Pi Phis, seeing the tremendous service available and the potential for expanded benefits, provided ample recompense to the individuals and groups who had worked out the tour and were on hand to give information and answer questions. These included Helen Russell, Settlement School Chairman, and all of the committee, Elouise Hensley, Helen Dix, Lois Summers, Zoe James, and staff members, Mrs. Mueller, Mrs. Christian, and Gene Redding at Arrowcraft Shop, Mrs. Chalmers at the Health Center, former Arrowcraft Shop manager, Mrs. Elizabeth Rue, members of the Gatlinburg Little Pigeon Alumnx Club and representatives from Tennessee Gamma. The finale to this special day was one of pleasure, excitement and inspiration an Awards Banquet. Gathered in Huff House the large assemblage was likened by Mrs. Mansfield to a "beautiful bouquet." The happy people there thrilled to the story of Marjorie Chalmer's twenty-five years of dedicated service as the Health Center Nurse; rose with full hearts and high admiration to greet the banquet speaker, beloved Honorary Grand President, Amy Burnham Onken; listened with intense interest and respect to her words of challenge on keeping the fraternity system strong; gave way to laughter and happy applause with the revelation of the winners of 1961's top Pi Phi Awards; and finally joined in a lovely, upward surge of devotion as the Candle-lighting Ceremony closed this chapter in the story of their Pi Phi experience.

WORKSHOP HIGHLIGHTS MiJ~ Orthen'.3 L?an,ei AItJrCM Marjorie C1a/mer~' 23' year Report The Gatlinburg meeting of Pi Phi officers, chap-ter presidents and pledge supervisors, and AAC chairmen had many memorable moments for its participants, but all seemed to agree that the meeting's highlights came at the banquet in the words from two beloved Pi Phis. Those words came in the entertaining and inspiring banquet address of Honorary Grand President Amy Burnham Onken and in the report of Marjorie Chalmers of 25-years work at the Jennie Nichol Health Center. M t''m Orthert Sat 0C/ "On April 29, when I celebrated Founders Day with the three Wisconsin chapters, I said that I should not be willing to speak to any groups of Pi Phis, active or alumnae, without stressing the dangers which threaten all fraternities today that of pressure from non-members which would mean the complete destruction of the college fraternity as we have known and loved it. I was interested to read in the spring Alpha Phi Quarterly that the first attempt to make fraternities yield to outside pressure came when N.P.C. established the quota system on many campuses. As I have thought of this statement, I have realized how true it is. I remember that at one N.P.C. Convention, a delegate from another N.P.C. member group said to me on the floor of convention: `Miss Onken, your chapter on such and such a campus would be better if the quota system were in effect there.' My reply was that might be but that Pi Phi did not expect other fraternities to build up its chapters and that Pi Phi itself would either strengthen the chapter or withdraw it from the campus. "Now we are facing outside pressure from college administrations, student governments, and people distinctly outside of college precincts who are at-tempting to dictate whom a chapter may pledge. Already, years ago in fact, these groups said that if a fraternity says that it has no clause limiting its members to any race or religion it must prove that it really does not practice such limitations by pledging a person not usually associated with it. The Right of Assembly is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights for all groups whose purposes are known and are known to be good. "Unless we, as Pi Beta Phis, stand fast for the right of a fraternity to choose its members on the basis of congeniality and its own national desires, the fraternity system will die. "I wonder if I may close this talk to you as I did that at Madison by telling one of the most inspiring experiences of my Pi Phi life? At the installation of California Zeta each of us found at her place at the cookie-shine a tiny doll which had attached to it a hand painted folder whose cover showed a baby trying to learn to spell Pi Beta Phi with the blocks from which she had spelled Theta Sigma Nu for almost twenty-five years. Inside there was this statement written from the heart of one of the Santa Barbara alumnae : `An initiation cannot make a Pi Phi. It only opens the door to effort. Nothing but the careful application of our "What-so-evers" through the days, weeks and months of a lifetime can result in the positive attitude which marks us. Pi Beta Phi, so attained, will not wash off in the turbulent waters of petty emotions.' May each of us be this kind of Pi Phi." Leading up to the climax of her speech, Miss Onken had delighted her listeners with facts regarding the establishment of Settlement School and familiar figures in its history. . . "I am not sure that when I went to the Evanston Convention in 1912 I knew Pi Phi had held its first school in Gatlinburg late in March. Miss Hill, an experienced teacher and mountain worker, living in Nashville had said that she would teach the school for three months at forty dollars a month. When she got to Gatlinburg, however, she found that the school house needed a lot of work done on it before it could be used, so she worked two months to get it ready and asked only twenty dollars a month for this. The first school began with fourteen pupils but there would have been only an unlucky thirteen if Andy Huff, one of the best friends that Pi Phi ever had, had not carried four-year old little Mattie to school and back home daily. The summer before Mattie was to enter Iowa State College, she said to me: `Pi Phi has done so much for all of us that we think that it is time that one of us did something for Pi Phi.' With such a feeling towards the Fraternity, it is no 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 15 wonder that Mattie was a fine Iowa Gamma and is an always loyal alumni of the Gatlinburg group. "One of the things I was most eager to see was the Red barn. I had bought postcards which showed the interior and exterior but I just couldn't believe that it could be as lovely as it is. I knew it first, of course, as just the red barn when Aunt Lizzie Reagen, a lifelong friend of the school, was keeping house for the staff and insisted upon milking the cows outdoors in any kind of weather . . . as she emphatically declared, she `wasn't going to have those cows mess up the new barn'. "I couldn't fail to include among the many loyal friends of the Settlement School Arlie Watson, who for many years has been the custodian of the Pi Phi grounds. Many people visiting the school see and talk only with Arlie, but they come away realizing how much good the Settlement School has done. "In July 1912 things reached a crisis in Gatlin-burg. Mrs. Helmick, representing Pi Phi, had said to the men that when an organization gave a special service to a community it was usual for the in-habitants themselves to help make this possible, but there was no leadership and no response. She had talked with E. E. Ogle, who owned 35 acres of land just in front of the present Mountain View Hotel and he had said that he'd sell the property for $1800, but still nothing happened. "Then Mrs. Huff had a dream. The account which I have always known differs from that in the Pi Phi History. As I have heard it in the dream Mrs. Huff was standing on the roadside looking at her children and the neighbors' children playing in the dry and rocky bed of the Little Pigeon River. Suddenly she looked up and saw a wall of water, the result of a flash flood in the mountains, coming down and she knew that the wall of water was really a wall of ignorance which would as truly engulf and destroy the children. The first thing next morning she sent a messenger to Mr. Huff who was cutting timber in the mountains. When Mr. Huff got back to Gatlinburg he and Steve Whaley came to talk with Mrs. Helmick and to ask her what they could do to get the people to give. Mrs. Helmick signed the name of Pi Beta Phi as being willing to give $600 towards the price of the land and Mr. Huff and Mr. Whaley agreed that each would give $250. "Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller sat on the porch with Mrs. Huff and wondered whether the entire amount would be pledged before the bus came to carry them back to Chicago, which meant that the school would be moved to another location. In the afternoon, Mr. Ogle, himself came to say that he would give $250. When the pledges were almost equal to the $1800, Mr. Huff and Junior Maples said they would make up any deficit if there should be one. Whereupon, Charlie Ogle, son of E. E. Ogle, gathered together all the firecrackers left over from the 4th of July and shot them off so that the entire community would know that Pi Phi and the school PI PHI SISTERS Marjorie Chalmers and Amy Burnham Onken. would stay in Gatlinburg. "Basket making was given first real consideration when in the fall of 1914 Margaret Burrows, Texas Alpha, stopped on her way home from New York and gathered together a class of girls who were interested in basketweaving. . . I think I am right in believing that weaving got its first big boost when Izora brought her son to school and waited all day to take him home. The staff, seeing her sitting all day with nothing to do, got her a loom. Izora be-came the Arrowcraft's best weaver and was the only one to whom a bunch of yarns of all colors could be given knowing that her true sense of color would not allow her ever to put two colors together if they would clash. Izora's whole life changed when she found that she could weave things which people liked well enough to pay for. . . . "The first nurse at Gatlinburg was Phyllis Higgenbotham, Ontario Alpha, who came in 1920. With her saddle bags stocked with medicines and supplies she rode over the valleys and high up in the mountains bringing health and comfort wherever she went. . . It is hard not to speak of all the fine Settlement School Directors who have given so much, Mary Pollard, Vermont Alpha, Evelyn Bishop, New York Alpha, Eunice Weather, Illinois Zeta, Ruth Dyer, Iowa Gamma, and our present fine director, Marion Meuller, Indiana Gamma. "But the Settlement School is not Pi Beta Phi: it is the memorial which honors the beloved Founders who gave to Pi Beta Phi the ideals and high stand16 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ards upon which they had moulded their own lives and from which Pi Beta Phi has not deviated. "Pi Beta. Phis' Grand Council has been alert to the need for having chapters on campuses worthy of having Pi Phi chapters. In the earliest ARROW of which I have a copy, that of November 1908, there were only thirty-eight chapters listed. Now there are 105 chapters, with ribboned groups on at least two other campuses. The first fraternity for women is still first in prestige and is at the forefront of American fraternities as it must always be." 7///arjor;e Cha/meri kpOPt The ideal of Pi Phi service could ask for no fuller realization than is revealed in the twenty-five years of dedicated endeavor of Marjorie Chalmers as the Jennie Nichol Health Center Nurse. While no recognition might seem truly adequate for her gifts, there was a high moment of happiness at the Workshop Banquet when Settlement School Committee Chairman Helen Russell presented a framed resolution of appreciation and a "lettuce" corsage of crisp green bills. Mrs. Russell also read the following excerpts from Mrs. Chalmers' report on her twenty-five years as the Health Center Nurse: "To review twenty-five years of living in one re-port is not an easy thing to do. Time flows together like a movie and one must stop the flying film and examine it frame by frame in order to evaluate events. In the beginning was the small village, quiet and peaceful, just commencing to stir with the coming of the National Park. There was a black-topped road through the town, almost too narrow for passing. Other roads were dirt roads dusty sometimes; some places, there was no road at all, and one drove through a bean or a corn patch or in a stony creek with bushes scraping the sides of the car and boulders denting the running-boards. Where there were no bridges, there were fords shallow most of the time, but treacherously full after a flash flood. Amusements were homemade a hike, a horse-back ride, an occasional movie in the school auditorium, and for a special treat, a trip into Knoxville for dinner and a show. One memorable journey took a group in the back of the truck, seated on a pile of mattresses headed to the factory for renovation. The embarrassment of climbing out over the tail gate in front of the Farragut Hotel and smoothing down wrinkled clothes has faded little through the years. Our isolation drew us all close together, inter-dependent and self-sufficient. That some isolation made nursing a very personal thing, and I learnedearly the intimacy that comes with the shared experiences of living. Those who together face life and death feel very close thereafter. In the many months without a doctor in the area, we were dependent, too, on our own resources. We improvised splints and group tents, applied pressure bandages, and used suction for snake bites. We learned the safest way to hold a gaping wound in alignment until it could be sutured by a doctor in the city. We encountered axe cuts and gunshot wounds, convulsions and bear scratches, and one attempted suicide. We learned to be swift in emergencies, for home remedies were not always good, and needless pain and danger were incurred from covering a burn with molasses and soda or packing a deep cut with spider webs in an attempt to stop the bleeding. But there is nothing like the feeling that comes when a three year old with a big hurt and tear-smudged face climbs manfully onto the chair announcing to anxious parents, "Marnie fix." Some of the experiences were tragic; the unnecessary death of a baby, the purchase of a tiny coffin, the carrying it and the family to the country burying ground, and our attempt to conduct a proper service. There was never a dull moment, and the responsibility at times seemed overwhelming. It is no wonder that when the doctors did come, first one and then another, they were warmly welcomed and mourned when they left for more specialized fields. Dr. Shilling came after World War II, and has been a blessing to the community and a comfort to our soul. No longer do we arrange clothing at night for quick dressing, or check the bags and battery lantern for night calls. There is more than enough to do within our particular sphere. Life now is perhaps less spectacular than in the old days. Eight Chevrolets have succeeded the high wheeled Pontiac. The narrow roads are widened and paved. The leather jacket and the knapsack are but a memory. The well stocked obstetrical bag has gone the way of all leather in this climate. Many more stu The Size of It A briefed version of Marjorie Chalmers' summary of the work done by the Health Center in her twenty-five years gives an idea of the size and scope of that service: Field Visits 26,115 Office Calls 71,673 Shots (Whooping cough, smallpox, ty phoid, diphtheria, tetanus, and Salk vaccine) 36,216 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 17 dents roam the campus and. the "New" Health Center has seen more than a dozen busy years. Still the service continues, changing with the needs, an important and integral part of the community. Educating to prevent and to combat illness is vital and our responsibility is never-ending. We teach as we serve, whether it be a minor surgical dressing or planning for Civil Defense. As well as the problems of war and catastrophe, we have the every-day, every-person, problems of grief and worry, the joy of new life, and the planning and training for growth. What matter if a job takes ten hours or ten minutes. If it is needed, it must be well done. Our clinics, shared with the State Public Health Department, cover X-Rays, Crippled Children's Serv-ice, testing of eyes and hearing, and tuberculin tests. Our own Well Baby Clinics are as popular as ever, and our school children are examined and inoculated and first-aided constantly. They tell us our area is better protected against polio than any other in the state, for which we are very grateful. The days are very full. Our people come for help as they have come for many years. Our doctors, as did the doctors in the beginning, still "back us all the way." We are thankful for the confidence and friendliness that have supported our efforts, and we trust that for many years, the Jennie Nichol Memorial Health Center will continue to be of service to any one in need." THE ARROWCRAFT SHOP WILL NEED A NEW MANAGER SOON The Settlement School Committee regretfully announces the resignation of Nevada Christian as Arrowcraft Manager to be effective in mid-November. Her desire to serve through the fall shipping season and until a re-placement can be found is appreciated. While confident that many Pi Phis could qualify, those who have had business leadership experience, are in good health, have no family responsibilities, appreciate handmade articles, and enjoy public contacts are urged to consider this opportunity to further serve Pi Beta Phi at the Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. If interested please contact Mrs. Robert R. Russell, chairman Settlement School Committee, 6823 Crest Avenue, University City 30, Missouri.

The tour began at the remodeled Red Barn and the story of its original use for agriculture students and its present service for Workshop students and meetings. It went on through the comfortably appointed Ruth Barret Smith Staff House, paused for fascinating, lingering glances at the interesting mementoes in the Log Cabin museum, continued through Stuart Cottage, the Girls' Dorm and Helmick House, the Boys' Dorm, the Pi Beta Phi THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI High School where the Craft Workshop is held, the Emma Harper Turner Craft Center, the Jennie Nichol Memorial Health Center and the Arrowcraft Shop. Along the way the growing enthusiasm and interest of Pi Phis, seeing the tremendous service available and the potential for expanded benefits, provided ample recompense to the individuals and groups who had worked out the tour and were on hand to give information and answer questions. These included Helen Russell, Settlement School Chairman, and all of the committee, Elouise Hensley, Helen Dix, Lois Summers, Zoe James, and staff members, Mrs. Mueller, Mrs. Christian, and Gene Redding at Arrowcraft Shop, Mrs. Chalmers at the Health Center, former Arrowcraft Shop manager, Mrs. Elizabeth Rue, members of the Gatlinburg Little Pigeon Alumnx Club and representatives from Tennessee Gamma. The finale to this special day was one of pleasure, excitement and inspiration an Awards Banquet. Gathered in Huff House the large assemblage was likened by Mrs. Mansfield to a "beautiful bouquet." The happy people there thrilled to the story of Marjorie Chalmer's twenty-five years of dedicated service as the Health Center Nurse; rose with full hearts and high admiration to greet the banquet speaker, beloved Honorary Grand President, Amy Burnham Onken; listened with intense interest and respect to her words of challenge on keeping the fraternity system strong; gave way to laughter and happy applause with the revelation of the winners of 1961's top Pi Phi Awards; and finally joined in a lovely, upward surge of devotion as the Candle-lighting Ceremony closed this chapter in the story of their Pi Phi experience.

WORKSHOP HIGHLIGHTS MiJ~ Orthen'.3 L?an,ei AItJrCM Marjorie C1a/mer~' 23' year Report The Gatlinburg meeting of Pi Phi officers, chap-ter presidents and pledge supervisors, and AAC chairmen had many memorable moments for its participants, but all seemed to agree that the meeting's highlights came at the banquet in the words from two beloved Pi Phis. Those words came in the entertaining and inspiring banquet address of Honorary Grand President Amy Burnham Onken and in the report of Marjorie Chalmers of 25-years work at the Jennie Nichol Health Center. M t''m Orthert Sat 0C/ "On April 29, when I celebrated Founders Day with the three Wisconsin chapters, I said that I should not be willing to speak to any groups of Pi Phis, active or alumnae, without stressing the dangers which threaten all fraternities today that of pressure from non-members which would mean the complete destruction of the college fraternity as we have known and loved it. I was interested to read in the spring Alpha Phi Quarterly that the first attempt to make fraternities yield to outside pressure came when N.P.C. established the quota system on many campuses. As I have thought of this statement, I have realized how true it is. I remember that at one N.P.C. Convention, a delegate from another N.P.C. member group said to me on the floor of convention: `Miss Onken, your chapter on such and such a campus would be better if the quota system were in effect there.' My reply was that might be but that Pi Phi did not expect other fraternities to build up its chapters and that Pi Phi itself would either strengthen the chapter or withdraw it from the campus. "Now we are facing outside pressure from college administrations, student governments, and people distinctly outside of college precincts who are at-tempting to dictate whom a chapter may pledge. Already, years ago in fact, these groups said that if a fraternity says that it has no clause limiting its members to any race or religion it must prove that it really does not practice such limitations by pledging a person not usually associated with it. The Right of Assembly is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights for all groups whose purposes are known and are known to be good. "Unless we, as Pi Beta Phis, stand fast for the right of a fraternity to choose its members on the basis of congeniality and its own national desires, the fraternity system will die. "I wonder if I may close this talk to you as I did that at Madison by telling one of the most inspiring experiences of my Pi Phi life? At the installation of California Zeta each of us found at her place at the cookie-shine a tiny doll which had attached to it a hand painted folder whose cover showed a baby trying to learn to spell Pi Beta Phi with the blocks from which she had spelled Theta Sigma Nu for almost twenty-five years. Inside there was this statement written from the heart of one of the Santa Barbara alumnae : `An initiation cannot make a Pi Phi. It only opens the door to effort. Nothing but the careful application of our "What-so-evers" through the days, weeks and months of a lifetime can result in the positive attitude which marks us. Pi Beta Phi, so attained, will not wash off in the turbulent waters of petty emotions.' May each of us be this kind of Pi Phi." Leading up to the climax of her speech, Miss Onken had delighted her listeners with facts regarding the establishment of Settlement School and familiar figures in its history. . . "I am not sure that when I went to the Evanston Convention in 1912 I knew Pi Phi had held its first school in Gatlinburg late in March. Miss Hill, an experienced teacher and mountain worker, living in Nashville had said that she would teach the school for three months at forty dollars a month. When she got to Gatlinburg, however, she found that the school house needed a lot of work done on it before it could be used, so she worked two months to get it ready and asked only twenty dollars a month for this. The first school began with fourteen pupils but there would have been only an unlucky thirteen if Andy Huff, one of the best friends that Pi Phi ever had, had not carried four-year old little Mattie to school and back home daily. The summer before Mattie was to enter Iowa State College, she said to me: `Pi Phi has done so much for all of us that we think that it is time that one of us did something for Pi Phi.' With such a feeling towards the Fraternity, it is no 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 15 wonder that Mattie was a fine Iowa Gamma and is an always loyal alumni of the Gatlinburg group. "One of the things I was most eager to see was the Red barn. I had bought postcards which showed the interior and exterior but I just couldn't believe that it could be as lovely as it is. I knew it first, of course, as just the red barn when Aunt Lizzie Reagen, a lifelong friend of the school, was keeping house for the staff and insisted upon milking the cows outdoors in any kind of weather . . . as she emphatically declared, she `wasn't going to have those cows mess up the new barn'. "I couldn't fail to include among the many loyal friends of the Settlement School Arlie Watson, who for many years has been the custodian of the Pi Phi grounds. Many people visiting the school see and talk only with Arlie, but they come away realizing how much good the Settlement School has done. "In July 1912 things reached a crisis in Gatlin-burg. Mrs. Helmick, representing Pi Phi, had said to the men that when an organization gave a special service to a community it was usual for the in-habitants themselves to help make this possible, but there was no leadership and no response. She had talked with E. E. Ogle, who owned 35 acres of land just in front of the present Mountain View Hotel and he had said that he'd sell the property for $1800, but still nothing happened. "Then Mrs. Huff had a dream. The account which I have always known differs from that in the Pi Phi History. As I have heard it in the dream Mrs. Huff was standing on the roadside looking at her children and the neighbors' children playing in the dry and rocky bed of the Little Pigeon River. Suddenly she looked up and saw a wall of water, the result of a flash flood in the mountains, coming down and she knew that the wall of water was really a wall of ignorance which would as truly engulf and destroy the children. The first thing next morning she sent a messenger to Mr. Huff who was cutting timber in the mountains. When Mr. Huff got back to Gatlinburg he and Steve Whaley came to talk with Mrs. Helmick and to ask her what they could do to get the people to give. Mrs. Helmick signed the name of Pi Beta Phi as being willing to give $600 towards the price of the land and Mr. Huff and Mr. Whaley agreed that each would give $250. "Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller sat on the porch with Mrs. Huff and wondered whether the entire amount would be pledged before the bus came to carry them back to Chicago, which meant that the school would be moved to another location. In the afternoon, Mr. Ogle, himself came to say that he would give $250. When the pledges were almost equal to the $1800, Mr. Huff and Junior Maples said they would make up any deficit if there should be one. Whereupon, Charlie Ogle, son of E. E. Ogle, gathered together all the firecrackers left over from the 4th of July and shot them off so that the entire community would know that Pi Phi and the school PI PHI SISTERS Marjorie Chalmers and Amy Burnham Onken. would stay in Gatlinburg. "Basket making was given first real consideration when in the fall of 1914 Margaret Burrows, Texas Alpha, stopped on her way home from New York and gathered together a class of girls who were interested in basketweaving. . . I think I am right in believing that weaving got its first big boost when Izora brought her son to school and waited all day to take him home. The staff, seeing her sitting all day with nothing to do, got her a loom. Izora be-came the Arrowcraft's best weaver and was the only one to whom a bunch of yarns of all colors could be given knowing that her true sense of color would not allow her ever to put two colors together if they would clash. Izora's whole life changed when she found that she could weave things which people liked well enough to pay for. . . . "The first nurse at Gatlinburg was Phyllis Higgenbotham, Ontario Alpha, who came in 1920. With her saddle bags stocked with medicines and supplies she rode over the valleys and high up in the mountains bringing health and comfort wherever she went. . . It is hard not to speak of all the fine Settlement School Directors who have given so much, Mary Pollard, Vermont Alpha, Evelyn Bishop, New York Alpha, Eunice Weather, Illinois Zeta, Ruth Dyer, Iowa Gamma, and our present fine director, Marion Meuller, Indiana Gamma. "But the Settlement School is not Pi Beta Phi: it is the memorial which honors the beloved Founders who gave to Pi Beta Phi the ideals and high stand16 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ards upon which they had moulded their own lives and from which Pi Beta Phi has not deviated. "Pi Beta. Phis' Grand Council has been alert to the need for having chapters on campuses worthy of having Pi Phi chapters. In the earliest ARROW of which I have a copy, that of November 1908, there were only thirty-eight chapters listed. Now there are 105 chapters, with ribboned groups on at least two other campuses. The first fraternity for women is still first in prestige and is at the forefront of American fraternities as it must always be." 7///arjor;e Cha/meri kpOPt The ideal of Pi Phi service could ask for no fuller realization than is revealed in the twenty-five years of dedicated endeavor of Marjorie Chalmers as the Jennie Nichol Health Center Nurse. While no recognition might seem truly adequate for her gifts, there was a high moment of happiness at the Workshop Banquet when Settlement School Committee Chairman Helen Russell presented a framed resolution of appreciation and a "lettuce" corsage of crisp green bills. Mrs. Russell also read the following excerpts from Mrs. Chalmers' report on her twenty-five years as the Health Center Nurse: "To review twenty-five years of living in one re-port is not an easy thing to do. Time flows together like a movie and one must stop the flying film and examine it frame by frame in order to evaluate events. In the beginning was the small village, quiet and peaceful, just commencing to stir with the coming of the National Park. There was a black-topped road through the town, almost too narrow for passing. Other roads were dirt roads dusty sometimes; some places, there was no road at all, and one drove through a bean or a corn patch or in a stony creek with bushes scraping the sides of the car and boulders denting the running-boards. Where there were no bridges, there were fords shallow most of the time, but treacherously full after a flash flood. Amusements were homemade a hike, a horse-back ride, an occasional movie in the school auditorium, and for a special treat, a trip into Knoxville for dinner and a show. One memorable journey took a group in the back of the truck, seated on a pile of mattresses headed to the factory for renovation. The embarrassment of climbing out over the tail gate in front of the Farragut Hotel and smoothing down wrinkled clothes has faded little through the years. Our isolation drew us all close together, inter-dependent and self-sufficient. That some isolation made nursing a very personal thing, and I learnedearly the intimacy that comes with the shared experiences of living. Those who together face life and death feel very close thereafter. In the many months without a doctor in the area, we were dependent, too, on our own resources. We improvised splints and group tents, applied pressure bandages, and used suction for snake bites. We learned the safest way to hold a gaping wound in alignment until it could be sutured by a doctor in the city. We encountered axe cuts and gunshot wounds, convulsions and bear scratches, and one attempted suicide. We learned to be swift in emergencies, for home remedies were not always good, and needless pain and danger were incurred from covering a burn with molasses and soda or packing a deep cut with spider webs in an attempt to stop the bleeding. But there is nothing like the feeling that comes when a three year old with a big hurt and tear-smudged face climbs manfully onto the chair announcing to anxious parents, "Marnie fix." Some of the experiences were tragic; the unnecessary death of a baby, the purchase of a tiny coffin, the carrying it and the family to the country burying ground, and our attempt to conduct a proper service. There was never a dull moment, and the responsibility at times seemed overwhelming. It is no wonder that when the doctors did come, first one and then another, they were warmly welcomed and mourned when they left for more specialized fields. Dr. Shilling came after World War II, and has been a blessing to the community and a comfort to our soul. No longer do we arrange clothing at night for quick dressing, or check the bags and battery lantern for night calls. There is more than enough to do within our particular sphere. Life now is perhaps less spectacular than in the old days. Eight Chevrolets have succeeded the high wheeled Pontiac. The narrow roads are widened and paved. The leather jacket and the knapsack are but a memory. The well stocked obstetrical bag has gone the way of all leather in this climate. Many more stu The Size of It A briefed version of Marjorie Chalmers' summary of the work done by the Health Center in her twenty-five years gives an idea of the size and scope of that service: Field Visits 26,115 Office Calls 71,673 Shots (Whooping cough, smallpox, ty phoid, diphtheria, tetanus, and Salk vaccine) 36,216 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 17 dents roam the campus and. the "New" Health Center has seen more than a dozen busy years. Still the service continues, changing with the needs, an important and integral part of the community. Educating to prevent and to combat illness is vital and our responsibility is never-ending. We teach as we serve, whether it be a minor surgical dressing or planning for Civil Defense. As well as the problems of war and catastrophe, we have the every-day, every-person, problems of grief and worry, the joy of new life, and the planning and training for growth. What matter if a job takes ten hours or ten minutes. If it is needed, it must be well done. Our clinics, shared with the State Public Health Department, cover X-Rays, Crippled Children's Serv-ice, testing of eyes and hearing, and tuberculin tests. Our own Well Baby Clinics are as popular as ever, and our school children are examined and inoculated and first-aided constantly. They tell us our area is better protected against polio than any other in the state, for which we are very grateful. The days are very full. Our people come for help as they have come for many years. Our doctors, as did the doctors in the beginning, still "back us all the way." We are thankful for the confidence and friendliness that have supported our efforts, and we trust that for many years, the Jennie Nichol Memorial Health Center will continue to be of service to any one in need." THE ARROWCRAFT SHOP WILL NEED A NEW MANAGER SOON The Settlement School Committee regretfully announces the resignation of Nevada Christian as Arrowcraft Manager to be effective in mid-November. Her desire to serve through the fall shipping season and until a re-placement can be found is appreciated. While confident that many Pi Phis could qualify, those who have had business leadership experience, are in good health, have no family responsibilities, appreciate handmade articles, and enjoy public contacts are urged to consider this opportunity to further serve Pi Beta Phi at the Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. If interested please contact Mrs. Robert R. Russell, chairman Settlement School Committee, 6823 Crest Avenue, University City 30, Missouri.

Lovely folders filled with informational material and favors were provided for each officer and talks were made by each member of the Settlement School Committee, the school's Director Marion Mueller and Arrowcraft Shop Manager Nevada Christian. Rain turned Tuesday night's poolside party into a fireside frolic for the hardworking actives, who let off steam in songs and laughter before the big Mountain View fireplace after their evening workshop. A hilarious exchange of songs and rush skits got under-way after the presentation of a clever parody by the Mu Province chapter presidents and pledge supervisors their musical offering put new words about Gatlinburg and workshop experiences to familiar tunes and the result was a highly entertaining and well received presentation. Thursday was a special day from start to finish with morning and afternoon tours of the Settlement School alternating with scenic bus trips into the Smoky Mountain National Park to Clingman's Dome and an angel-eye view of some of the majestically beautiful scenery that surrounds Gatlinburg.

Along the way the growing enthusiasm and interest of Pi Phis, seeing the tremendous service available and the potential for expanded benefits, provided ample recompense to the individuals and groups who had worked out the tour and were on hand to give information and answer questions.

There was a black-topped road through the town, almost too narrow for passing. Other roads were dirt roads dusty sometimes; some places, there was no road at all, and one drove through a bean or a corn patch or in a stony creek with bushes scraping the sides of the car and boulders denting the running-boards. Where there were no bridges, there were fords shallow most of the time, but treacherously full after a flash flood. Amusements were homemade a hike, a horse-back ride, an occasional movie in the school auditorium, and for a special treat, a trip into Knoxville for dinner and a show.

        WORKSHOP HIGHLIGHTS MiJ~ Orthen'.3 L?an,ei AItJrCM Marjorie C1a/mer~' 23' year Report The Gatlinburg meeting of Pi Phi officers, chap-ter presidents and pledge supervisors, and AAC chairmen had many memorable moments for its participants, but all seemed to agree that the meeting's highlights came at the banquet in the words from two beloved Pi Phis. Those words came in the entertaining and inspiring banquet address of Honorary Grand President Amy Burnham Onken and in the report of Marjorie Chalmers of 25-years work at the Jennie Nichol Health Center. M t''m Orthert Sat 0C/ "On April 29, when I celebrated Founders Day with the three Wisconsin chapters, I said that I should not be willing to speak to any groups of Pi Phis, active or alumnae, without stressing the dangers which threaten all fraternities today that of pressure from non-members which would mean the complete destruction of the college fraternity as we have known and loved it. I was interested to read in the spring Alpha Phi Quarterly that the first attempt to make fraternities yield to outside pressure came when N.P.C. established the quota system on many campuses. As I have thought of this statement, I have realized how true it is. I remember that at one N.P.C. Convention, a delegate from another N.P.C. member group said to me on the floor of convention: `Miss Onken, your chapter on such and such a campus would be better if the quota system were in effect there.' My reply was that might be but that Pi Phi did not expect other fraternities to build up its chapters and that Pi Phi itself would either strengthen the chapter or withdraw it from the campus. "Now we are facing outside pressure from college administrations, student governments, and people distinctly outside of college precincts who are at-tempting to dictate whom a chapter may pledge. Already, years ago in fact, these groups said that if a fraternity says that it has no clause limiting its members to any race or religion it must prove that it really does not practice such limitations by pledging a person not usually associated with it. The Right of Assembly is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights for all groups whose purposes are known and are known to be good. "Unless we, as Pi Beta Phis, stand fast for the right of a fraternity to choose its members on the basis of congeniality and its own national desires, the fraternity system will die. "I wonder if I may close this talk to you as I did that at Madison by telling one of the most inspiring experiences of my Pi Phi life? At the installation of California Zeta each of us found at her place at the cookie-shine a tiny doll which had attached to it a hand painted folder whose cover showed a baby trying to learn to spell Pi Beta Phi with the blocks from which she had spelled Theta Sigma Nu for almost twenty-five years. Inside there was this statement written from the heart of one of the Santa Barbara alumnae : `An initiation cannot make a Pi Phi. It only opens the door to effort. Nothing but the careful application of our "What-so-evers" through the days, weeks and months of a lifetime can result in the positive attitude which marks us. Pi Beta Phi, so attained, will not wash off in the turbulent waters of petty emotions.' May each of us be this kind of Pi Phi." Leading up to the climax of her speech, Miss Onken had delighted her listeners with facts regarding the establishment of Settlement School and familiar figures in its history. . . "I am not sure that when I went to the Evanston Convention in 1912 I knew Pi Phi had held its first school in Gatlinburg late in March. Miss Hill, an experienced teacher and mountain worker, living in Nashville had said that she would teach the school for three months at forty dollars a month. When she got to Gatlinburg, however, she found that the school house needed a lot of work done on it before it could be used, so she worked two months to get it ready and asked only twenty dollars a month for this. The first school began with fourteen pupils but there would have been only an unlucky thirteen if Andy Huff, one of the best friends that Pi Phi ever had, had not carried four-year old little Mattie to school and back home daily. The summer before Mattie was to enter Iowa State College, she said to me: `Pi Phi has done so much for all of us that we think that it is time that one of us did something for Pi Phi.' With such a feeling towards the Fraternity, it is no 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 15 wonder that Mattie was a fine Iowa Gamma and is an always loyal alumni of the Gatlinburg group. "One of the things I was most eager to see was the Red barn. I had bought postcards which showed the interior and exterior but I just couldn't believe that it could be as lovely as it is. I knew it first, of course, as just the red barn when Aunt Lizzie Reagen, a lifelong friend of the school, was keeping house for the staff and insisted upon milking the cows outdoors in any kind of weather . . . as she emphatically declared, she `wasn't going to have those cows mess up the new barn'. "I couldn't fail to include among the many loyal friends of the Settlement School Arlie Watson, who for many years has been the custodian of the Pi Phi grounds. Many people visiting the school see and talk only with Arlie, but they come away realizing how much good the Settlement School has done. "In July 1912 things reached a crisis in Gatlin-burg. Mrs. Helmick, representing Pi Phi, had said to the men that when an organization gave a special service to a community it was usual for the in-habitants themselves to help make this possible, but there was no leadership and no response. She had talked with E. E. Ogle, who owned 35 acres of land just in front of the present Mountain View Hotel and he had said that he'd sell the property for $1800, but still nothing happened. "Then Mrs. Huff had a dream. The account which I have always known differs from that in the Pi Phi History. As I have heard it in the dream Mrs. Huff was standing on the roadside looking at her children and the neighbors' children playing in the dry and rocky bed of the Little Pigeon River. Suddenly she looked up and saw a wall of water, the result of a flash flood in the mountains, coming down and she knew that the wall of water was really a wall of ignorance which would as truly engulf and destroy the children. The first thing next morning she sent a messenger to Mr. Huff who was cutting timber in the mountains. When Mr. Huff got back to Gatlinburg he and Steve Whaley came to talk with Mrs. Helmick and to ask her what they could do to get the people to give. Mrs. Helmick signed the name of Pi Beta Phi as being willing to give $600 towards the price of the land and Mr. Huff and Mr. Whaley agreed that each would give $250. "Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller sat on the porch with Mrs. Huff and wondered whether the entire amount would be pledged before the bus came to carry them back to Chicago, which meant that the school would be moved to another location. In the afternoon, Mr. Ogle, himself came to say that he would give $250. When the pledges were almost equal to the $1800, Mr. Huff and Junior Maples said they would make up any deficit if there should be one. Whereupon, Charlie Ogle, son of E. E. Ogle, gathered together all the firecrackers left over from the 4th of July and shot them off so that the entire community would know that Pi Phi and the school PI PHI SISTERS Marjorie Chalmers and Amy Burnham Onken. would stay in Gatlinburg. "Basket making was given first real consideration when in the fall of 1914 Margaret Burrows, Texas Alpha, stopped on her way home from New York and gathered together a class of girls who were interested in basketweaving. . . I think I am right in believing that weaving got its first big boost when Izora brought her son to school and waited all day to take him home. The staff, seeing her sitting all day with nothing to do, got her a loom. Izora be-came the Arrowcraft's best weaver and was the only one to whom a bunch of yarns of all colors could be given knowing that her true sense of color would not allow her ever to put two colors together if they would clash. Izora's whole life changed when she found that she could weave things which people liked well enough to pay for. . . . "The first nurse at Gatlinburg was Phyllis Higgenbotham, Ontario Alpha, who came in 1920. With her saddle bags stocked with medicines and supplies she rode over the valleys and high up in the mountains bringing health and comfort wherever she went. . . It is hard not to speak of all the fine Settlement School Directors who have given so much, Mary Pollard, Vermont Alpha, Evelyn Bishop, New York Alpha, Eunice Weather, Illinois Zeta, Ruth Dyer, Iowa Gamma, and our present fine director, Marion Meuller, Indiana Gamma.

There is no question that the days in Gatlinburg were filled with highly productive accomplishments and that all attending the meeting found revelations related to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School program and the growth of Gatlinburg that will undergird a strong and everlasting association between fraternity and community. From the arrival of the national officers at the Mountain-View Hotel through the coming of active chapter presidents and pledge supervisors to the welcoming of the AAC chairmen, the conclave was one artfully balanced between work and workshops and things social and special. Work and Workshops s The primary purpose of this meeting was to work and that purpose was filled in every sense of the word. Grand Council had arrived in Gatlinburg a week earlier for its annual interim meeting and had spent all of its days and hours of its nights during that period around a paper laden table in discussion and action that covered everything from selecting recipients of annual awards to drafting policy decisions for consideration by officers. Province Presidents and Vice Presidents and several other national officers arrived on Friday morning June 16, had lunch and were in their first joint meeting by 1:30 p.m. The pace, thus established, continued briskly through a weekend of separate work-shops or joint meetings morning, afternoon and night. Joint Meetings covered every phase of the Fraternity program with reports from all members of Grand Council in the areas their offices serve and reports and recommendations from the Settlement School chairman, Chapter House Corporation Counselor, Scholarship Chairman, Director of Central Office, National Convention Guide and ARROW Editor. In four separate workshop sessions Province Presidents met with Mrs. Mansfield presiding, and Province Vice Presidents were in session with Mrs. Morgan as chairman. These meetings were filled with discussions relating to virtually every phase of the officers' duties and activities aimed at educating, strengthening and improving as each phase might require. Other members of Grand Council and national officers met with these workshop groups for more detailed consideration of interests mutual to their offices and those of the province officers. In addition to giving enthusiastic support to major decisions regarding a firm statement of membership policy and the adoption of the IBM system for fraternity records and accounting, the province officers heard discussions on the improvements slated in the area of rushing, reference and sponsorship of new members, of the decison to try a five-issue ARROW schedule for three years with the ARROW Information Bulletin to be on a limited printing basis and of the improved codification of house corporation procedures. Province Vice Presidents checked out of the hotel Monday as the active chapter presidents and pledge supervisors began to arrive by the bus load, shepherded from Knoxville by the Workshop's efficient transportation chairman, Joan Black Wallace.

THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 11 Guide, Helen Lewis, and her able assistant Henrietta Huff, they were soon settled either at the Mountain View or jack Huff Motel nearby. Monday night Mrs. Mansfield greeted the active chapter representatives at dinner and then their work began with the first province workshop sessions. There followed three such sessions Tuesday and three on Wednesday for the active officers and their province president. Their discussions covered a broad range of fraternity activity, organization and policy as it relates both to the chapter life and to the overall program of Pi Beta Phi. Ideas were shared on topics ranging from scholarship, rushing and officer training to standards, fraternity projects, activities and Panhellenic relations . . . and many other subjects. Alumnae Advisory Chairmen arrived Wednesday afternoon and were housed at the Riverside Motel. They joined with their active chapter representatives in joint workshop sessions Wednesday night and then met in three sessions of their own on Friday. The final attention to work was given on Friday night in a joint meeting of the AAC chairmen and Grand Council. At that time members of the Council reported to the group on matters affecting AAC activity as well as giving brief outlines of Fraternity progress in the fields covered by their duties. Social and Special The balance wheel of any Pi Phi gathering is al-ways that part of it given to moments of pleasant relaxation in convivial meals, inspiring programs, the sight of something special, and recreation. The work-shop program had all of these. OFFICERS' ACTION In joint session at the 1961 Workshop at Gatlinburg, Pi Beta Phi national officers gave unanimous approval to two matters concerning Fraternity policy and business. Membership They reaffirmed the member-ship policy of the Fraternity to wit: From the time of its founding, selection has been the basis for membership in Pi Beta Phi. As an international organization with chapters in the United States and Canada, the fraternity has a system of sponsorship to assure its continued strength. From the available prospective members the chapters select those who measure up to Pi Beta Phi standards and are congenial in taste and aspiration. IBM After careful consideration of the advantages offered by conversion to IBM equipment in Central Office and its system for certain other fraternity business, the officers voted unanimously in favor of the conversion. Province vice presidents were the first to be honored during the week. These hard working liaison officers between the Settlement School program and the vast network of over 300 alumnae clubs were honored on Saturday at luncheon by the Settlement School Committee in the Pine Room at the Mountain View.

Lovely folders filled with informational material and favors were provided for each officer and talks were made by each member of the Settlement School Committee, the school's Director Marion Mueller and Arrowcraft Shop Manager Nevada Christian. Rain turned Tuesday night's poolside party into a fireside frolic for the hardworking actives, who let off steam in songs and laughter before the big Mountain View fireplace after their evening workshop. A hilarious exchange of songs and rush skits got under-way after the presentation of a clever parody by the Mu Province chapter presidents and pledge supervisors their musical offering put new words about Gatlinburg and workshop experiences to familiar tunes and the result was a highly entertaining and well received presentation. Thursday was a special day from start to finish with morning and afternoon tours of the Settlement School alternating with scenic bus trips into the Smoky Mountain National Park to Clingman's Dome and an angel-eye view of some of the majestically beautiful scenery that surrounds Gatlinburg. The Settlement School Committee and staff rolled out a many-aisled red carpet for the tours of the institution facilities. The tour began at the remodeled Red Barn and the story of its original use for agriculture students and its present service for Workshop students and meetings. It went on through the comfortably appointed Ruth Barret Smith Staff House, paused for fascinating, lingering glances at the interesting mementoes in the Log Cabin museum, continued through Stuart Cottage, the Girls' Dorm and Helmick House, the Boys' Dorm, the Pi Beta Phi THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI High School where the Craft Workshop is held, the Emma Harper Turner Craft Center, the Jennie Nichol Memorial Health Center and the Arrowcraft Shop. Along the way the growing enthusiasm and interest of Pi Phis, seeing the tremendous service available and the potential for expanded benefits, provided ample recompense to the individuals and groups who had worked out the tour and were on hand to give information and answer questions. These included Helen Russell, Settlement School Chairman, and all of the committee, Elouise Hensley, Helen Dix, Lois Summers, Zoe James, and staff members, Mrs. Mueller, Mrs. Christian, and Gene Redding at Arrowcraft Shop, Mrs. Chalmers at the Health Center, former Arrowcraft Shop manager, Mrs. Elizabeth Rue, members of the Gatlinburg Little Pigeon Alumnx Club and representatives from Tennessee Gamma. The finale to this special day was one of pleasure, excitement and inspiration an Awards Banquet. Gathered in Huff House the large assemblage was likened by Mrs. Mansfield to a "beautiful bouquet." The happy people there thrilled to the story of Marjorie Chalmer's twenty-five years of dedicated service as the Health Center Nurse; rose with full hearts and high admiration to greet the banquet speaker, beloved Honorary Grand President, Amy Burnham Onken; listened with intense interest and respect to her words of challenge on keeping the fraternity system strong; gave way to laughter and happy applause with the revelation of the winners of 1961's top Pi Phi Awards; and finally joined in a lovely, upward surge of devotion as the Candle-lighting Ceremony closed this chapter in the story of their Pi Phi experience.

WORKSHOP HIGHLIGHTS MiJ~ Orthen'.3 L?an,ei AItJrCM Marjorie C1a/mer~' 23' year Report The Gatlinburg meeting of Pi Phi officers, chap-ter presidents and pledge supervisors, and AAC chairmen had many memorable moments for its participants, but all seemed to agree that the meeting's highlights came at the banquet in the words from two beloved Pi Phis. Those words came in the entertaining and inspiring banquet address of Honorary Grand President Amy Burnham Onken and in the report of Marjorie Chalmers of 25-years work at the Jennie Nichol Health Center. M t''m Orthert Sat 0C/ "On April 29, when I celebrated Founders Day with the three Wisconsin chapters, I said that I should not be willing to speak to any groups of Pi Phis, active or alumnae, without stressing the dangers which threaten all fraternities today that of pressure from non-members which would mean the complete destruction of the college fraternity as we have known and loved it. I was interested to read in the spring Alpha Phi Quarterly that the first attempt to make fraternities yield to outside pressure came when N.P.C. established the quota system on many campuses. As I have thought of this statement, I have realized how true it is. I remember that at one N.P.C. Convention, a delegate from another N.P.C. member group said to me on the floor of convention: `Miss Onken, your chapter on such and such a campus would be better if the quota system were in effect there.' My reply was that might be but that Pi Phi did not expect other fraternities to build up its chapters and that Pi Phi itself would either strengthen the chapter or withdraw it from the campus. "Now we are facing outside pressure from college administrations, student governments, and people distinctly outside of college precincts who are at-tempting to dictate whom a chapter may pledge. Already, years ago in fact, these groups said that if a fraternity says that it has no clause limiting its members to any race or religion it must prove that it really does not practice such limitations by pledging a person not usually associated with it. The Right of Assembly is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights for all groups whose purposes are known and are known to be good. "Unless we, as Pi Beta Phis, stand fast for the right of a fraternity to choose its members on the basis of congeniality and its own national desires, the fraternity system will die. "I wonder if I may close this talk to you as I did that at Madison by telling one of the most inspiring experiences of my Pi Phi life? At the installation of California Zeta each of us found at her place at the cookie-shine a tiny doll which had attached to it a hand painted folder whose cover showed a baby trying to learn to spell Pi Beta Phi with the blocks from which she had spelled Theta Sigma Nu for almost twenty-five years. Inside there was this statement written from the heart of one of the Santa Barbara alumnae : `An initiation cannot make a Pi Phi. It only opens the door to effort. Nothing but the careful application of our "What-so-evers" through the days, weeks and months of a lifetime can result in the positive attitude which marks us. Pi Beta Phi, so attained, will not wash off in the turbulent waters of petty emotions.' May each of us be this kind of Pi Phi." Leading up to the climax of her speech, Miss Onken had delighted her listeners with facts regarding the establishment of Settlement School and familiar figures in its history. . . "I am not sure that when I went to the Evanston Convention in 1912 I knew Pi Phi had held its first school in Gatlinburg late in March. Miss Hill, an experienced teacher and mountain worker, living in Nashville had said that she would teach the school for three months at forty dollars a month. When she got to Gatlinburg, however, she found that the school house needed a lot of work done on it before it could be used, so she worked two months to get it ready and asked only twenty dollars a month for this. The first school began with fourteen pupils but there would have been only an unlucky thirteen if Andy Huff, one of the best friends that Pi Phi ever had, had not carried four-year old little Mattie to school and back home daily. The summer before Mattie was to enter Iowa State College, she said to me: `Pi Phi has done so much for all of us that we think that it is time that one of us did something for Pi Phi.' With such a feeling towards the Fraternity, it is no 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 15 wonder that Mattie was a fine Iowa Gamma and is an always loyal alumni of the Gatlinburg group. "One of the things I was most eager to see was the Red barn. I had bought postcards which showed the interior and exterior but I just couldn't believe that it could be as lovely as it is. I knew it first, of course, as just the red barn when Aunt Lizzie Reagen, a lifelong friend of the school, was keeping house for the staff and insisted upon milking the cows outdoors in any kind of weather . . . as she emphatically declared, she `wasn't going to have those cows mess up the new barn'. "I couldn't fail to include among the many loyal friends of the Settlement School Arlie Watson, who for many years has been the custodian of the Pi Phi grounds. Many people visiting the school see and talk only with Arlie, but they come away realizing how much good the Settlement School has done. "In July 1912 things reached a crisis in Gatlin-burg. Mrs. Helmick, representing Pi Phi, had said to the men that when an organization gave a special service to a community it was usual for the in-habitants themselves to help make this possible, but there was no leadership and no response. She had talked with E. E. Ogle, who owned 35 acres of land just in front of the present Mountain View Hotel and he had said that he'd sell the property for $1800, but still nothing happened. "Then Mrs. Huff had a dream. The account which I have always known differs from that in the Pi Phi History. As I have heard it in the dream Mrs. Huff was standing on the roadside looking at her children and the neighbors' children playing in the dry and rocky bed of the Little Pigeon River. Suddenly she looked up and saw a wall of water, the result of a flash flood in the mountains, coming down and she knew that the wall of water was really a wall of ignorance which would as truly engulf and destroy the children. The first thing next morning she sent a messenger to Mr. Huff who was cutting timber in the mountains. When Mr. Huff got back to Gatlinburg he and Steve Whaley came to talk with Mrs. Helmick and to ask her what they could do to get the people to give. Mrs. Helmick signed the name of Pi Beta Phi as being willing to give $600 towards the price of the land and Mr. Huff and Mr. Whaley agreed that each would give $250. "Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller sat on the porch with Mrs. Huff and wondered whether the entire amount would be pledged before the bus came to carry them back to Chicago, which meant that the school would be moved to another location. In the afternoon, Mr. Ogle, himself came to say that he would give $250. When the pledges were almost equal to the $1800, Mr. Huff and Junior Maples said they would make up any deficit if there should be one. Whereupon, Charlie Ogle, son of E. E. Ogle, gathered together all the firecrackers left over from the 4th of July and shot them off so that the entire community would know that Pi Phi and the school PI PHI SISTERS Marjorie Chalmers and Amy Burnham Onken. would stay in Gatlinburg. "Basket making was given first real consideration when in the fall of 1914 Margaret Burrows, Texas Alpha, stopped on her way home from New York and gathered together a class of girls who were interested in basketweaving. . . I think I am right in believing that weaving got its first big boost when Izora brought her son to school and waited all day to take him home. The staff, seeing her sitting all day with nothing to do, got her a loom. Izora be-came the Arrowcraft's best weaver and was the only one to whom a bunch of yarns of all colors could be given knowing that her true sense of color would not allow her ever to put two colors together if they would clash. Izora's whole life changed when she found that she could weave things which people liked well enough to pay for. . . . "The first nurse at Gatlinburg was Phyllis Higgenbotham, Ontario Alpha, who came in 1920. With her saddle bags stocked with medicines and supplies she rode over the valleys and high up in the mountains bringing health and comfort wherever she went. . . It is hard not to speak of all the fine Settlement School Directors who have given so much, Mary Pollard, Vermont Alpha, Evelyn Bishop, New York Alpha, Eunice Weather, Illinois Zeta, Ruth Dyer, Iowa Gamma, and our present fine director, Marion Meuller, Indiana Gamma. "But the Settlement School is not Pi Beta Phi: it is the memorial which honors the beloved Founders who gave to Pi Beta Phi the ideals and high stand16 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ards upon which they had moulded their own lives and from which Pi Beta Phi has not deviated. "Pi Beta. Phis' Grand Council has been alert to the need for having chapters on campuses worthy of having Pi Phi chapters. In the earliest ARROW of which I have a copy, that of November 1908, there were only thirty-eight chapters listed. Now there are 105 chapters, with ribboned groups on at least two other campuses. The first fraternity for women is still first in prestige and is at the forefront of American fraternities as it must always be." 7///arjor;e Cha/meri kpOPt The ideal of Pi Phi service could ask for no fuller realization than is revealed in the twenty-five years of dedicated endeavor of Marjorie Chalmers as the Jennie Nichol Health Center Nurse. While no recognition might seem truly adequate for her gifts, there was a high moment of happiness at the Workshop Banquet when Settlement School Committee Chairman Helen Russell presented a framed resolution of appreciation and a "lettuce" corsage of crisp green bills. Mrs. Russell also read the following excerpts from Mrs. Chalmers' report on her twenty-five years as the Health Center Nurse: "To review twenty-five years of living in one re-port is not an easy thing to do. Time flows together like a movie and one must stop the flying film and examine it frame by frame in order to evaluate events. In the beginning was the small village, quiet and peaceful, just commencing to stir with the coming of the National Park. There was a black-topped road through the town, almost too narrow for passing. Other roads were dirt roads dusty sometimes; some places, there was no road at all, and one drove through a bean or a corn patch or in a stony creek with bushes scraping the sides of the car and boulders denting the running-boards. Where there were no bridges, there were fords shallow most of the time, but treacherously full after a flash flood. Amusements were homemade a hike, a horse-back ride, an occasional movie in the school auditorium, and for a special treat, a trip into Knoxville for dinner and a show. One memorable journey took a group in the back of the truck, seated on a pile of mattresses headed to the factory for renovation. The embarrassment of climbing out over the tail gate in front of the Farragut Hotel and smoothing down wrinkled clothes has faded little through the years. Our isolation drew us all close together, inter-dependent and self-sufficient. That some isolation made nursing a very personal thing, and I learnedearly the intimacy that comes with the shared experiences of living. Those who together face life and death feel very close thereafter. In the many months without a doctor in the area, we were dependent, too, on our own resources. We improvised splints and group tents, applied pressure bandages, and used suction for snake bites. We learned the safest way to hold a gaping wound in alignment until it could be sutured by a doctor in the city. We encountered axe cuts and gunshot wounds, convulsions and bear scratches, and one attempted suicide. We learned to be swift in emergencies, for home remedies were not always good, and needless pain and danger were incurred from covering a burn with molasses and soda or packing a deep cut with spider webs in an attempt to stop the bleeding. But there is nothing like the feeling that comes when a three year old with a big hurt and tear-smudged face climbs manfully onto the chair announcing to anxious parents, "Marnie fix." Some of the experiences were tragic; the unnecessary death of a baby, the purchase of a tiny coffin, the carrying it and the family to the country burying ground, and our attempt to conduct a proper service. There was never a dull moment, and the responsibility at times seemed overwhelming. It is no wonder that when the doctors did come, first one and then another, they were warmly welcomed and mourned when they left for more specialized fields. Dr. Shilling came after World War II, and has been a blessing to the community and a comfort to our soul. No longer do we arrange clothing at night for quick dressing, or check the bags and battery lantern for night calls. There is more than enough to do within our particular sphere. Life now is perhaps less spectacular than in the old days. Eight Chevrolets have succeeded the high wheeled Pontiac. The narrow roads are widened and paved. The leather jacket and the knapsack are but a memory. The well stocked obstetrical bag has gone the way of all leather in this climate. Many more stu The Size of It A briefed version of Marjorie Chalmers' summary of the work done by the Health Center in her twenty-five years gives an idea of the size and scope of that service: Field Visits 26,115 Office Calls 71,673 Shots (Whooping cough, smallpox, ty phoid, diphtheria, tetanus, and Salk vaccine) 36,216 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 17 dents roam the campus and. the "New" Health Center has seen more than a dozen busy years. Still the service continues, changing with the needs, an important and integral part of the community. Educating to prevent and to combat illness is vital and our responsibility is never-ending. We teach as we serve, whether it be a minor surgical dressing or planning for Civil Defense. As well as the problems of war and catastrophe, we have the every-day, every-person, problems of grief and worry, the joy of new life, and the planning and training for growth. What matter if a job takes ten hours or ten minutes. If it is needed, it must be well done. Our clinics, shared with the State Public Health Department, cover X-Rays, Crippled Children's Serv-ice, testing of eyes and hearing, and tuberculin tests. Our own Well Baby Clinics are as popular as ever, and our school children are examined and inoculated and first-aided constantly. They tell us our area is better protected against polio than any other in the state, for which we are very grateful. The days are very full. Our people come for help as they have come for many years. Our doctors, as did the doctors in the beginning, still "back us all the way." We are thankful for the confidence and friendliness that have supported our efforts, and we trust that for many years, the Jennie Nichol Memorial Health Center will continue to be of service to any one in need." THE ARROWCRAFT SHOP WILL NEED A NEW MANAGER SOON The Settlement School Committee regretfully announces the resignation of Nevada Christian as Arrowcraft Manager to be effective in mid-November. Her desire to serve through the fall shipping season and until a re-placement can be found is appreciated. While confident that many Pi Phis could qualify, those who have had business leadership experience, are in good health, have no family responsibilities, appreciate handmade articles, and enjoy public contacts are urged to consider this opportunity to further serve Pi Beta Phi at the Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. If interested please contact Mrs. Robert R. Russell, chairman Settlement School Committee, 6823 Crest Avenue, University City 30, Missouri.
