        News of Edited by HENRIETTA MCCUTCHAN HUFF Missouri Beta Students Sing Praises of Summer Craft Workshop school of arts and crafts The Great Smoky Mountains Gatlinburg, Tennessee 37738 Arrowmont is a hubbub of activity with the hustle and bustle of bull dozers, rock masons, and carpenters all busy at completing the plans for Arrowmont's enlargement program. In the next issue of the ARROW, you will find the architect's drawings of the new Classroom Building, which should be completed by the fall of 1969. Even though this building will not be ready for use in this 1969 Summer Session of our School of Arts and Crafts, all classes will be provided for in the present Craft Center with its weaving wing, the Lolita Snell Prouty Ceramic Wing, and other facilities being used to tide us over until its completion. Every Pi Phi has a right to be proud of Arrowmont, our philanthropy in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We are no longer working for and supporting a school to help one small community, but rather a school of arts and crafts to help many people from all parts of our country and even the world. Each one can be proud of the excellent reputation our school has attained under the able leadership of Marian Heard, Professor of Related Arts and Crafts at the University of Tennessee. Last summer one gentle-man came all the way from England after hearing of the excellence of our school, and said he learned more in one week here than in a month at the other schools he had attended. Studentsfrom 17 different countries have attended since the Craft Workshop was started in 1945. There were 97 students, 12 of these being scholarship recipients of Pi Phi Alumnae Clubs, at the 1968 Summer Workshop. They came from 31 states, 3 from Canada and 1 from En-gland. ,At the end of the session, all these students were given a chance to write comments about the school. Everyone complimented the outstanding instructors, and a great majority ex-pressed in some way how much they enjoyed living with such a variety of people, representing so many different ages, occupations and backgrounds, but all with the same interest in creating objects of beauty. The articles that follow will tell about three of these students. Open House If any Pi Phi is wondering about the School and its value, why not enroll in a class of crafts, or plan to be in Gatlinburg on Friday, July 18. From 7:00 to 9:00 o'clock that evening, at the Pi Phi Craft Center, an Open House will be held, and this will be a good time to find out just what our school is really accomplishing. Each Pi Phi who has attended a session has gone away filled with enthusiasm for our Pi Beta Phi philanthropy, Arrowmont. 16 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 17 Retired Dentist Likes Working With Hands DR. WILLIAM TOLAR, feeling that crafts are a vital segment of recreation and leisure time, traveled to Gatlinburg last summer to enroll in the Summer Craft Workshop, sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee. Dr. Tolar was forced to give up his dentistry practice due to illness, and since his retirement has revived his interest in making jewelry. He assisted in occupational therapy in the Army, and then later enjoyed crafts as a hobby. He makes jewelry for his own enjoyment, liking to work with his hands and mind, and feeling that it is a challenge to his technical ability. He came from Berwyn, Illinois, at his own expense, and says that he had a most enjoyable time. Having lived in the men's Stuart Dormitory during Workshop, he commented on the wide ranges of ages from teens to seventies and on the "tremendous personality of the people." He was very complimentary of the students and their working together to prepare for the Craft Open House exhibit, held the last day of the school. He went on to add that the won derful part of the school was that there was not Dr. Bill works on jewelry. a teacher who wasn't working as hard as his students. Dr. Tolar heard about the Craft Program several years ago when he was vacationing in Gatlinburg and came to the school's Open House. A retired school teacher, who is now a recreational director, encouraged him to attend the Craft School, and he emphasized how he hoped the trend toward crafts would become an even greater part of recreational programs in cities.

Having won an alumnae club scholarship, Judy spent two weeks at the Summer Craft Workshop studying enameling and textile design. Judy is a home economics major at the University of Minnesota and feels the experience gained in enameling and textile design through these courses will assist her in her curriculum. After graduation she plans to teach home economics, with hopes for future enrollment in graduate school and an ultimate goal of a Master in Crafts. The courses taught at the Summer Workshop have university creditation through the University of Tennessee, co-sponsor of Arrowmont. In addition to the technical knowledge gained, Judy commented on the wonderful opportunity she had had to know, work, and live with people of so many different ages, back-grounds, and occupations. This experience, she said, had been an education in itself. Judy applied for and won the scholarship offered by the Minneapolis Pi Phi Alumnae Club, and was thereby able to make her first trip to Gatlinburg. Upon her return to the University, she is looking forward to telling her chapter, Minnesota Alpha, all about Craft Workshop. Due to the distance, few of them have ever seen the school, and she wants them to feel more a Jean Venable, member of Board of Governors for Arrowmont, learns weaving at Summer Workshop. Judy Sauter works on a piece of enamelware, with two other examples of her work beside her. part of the philanthropy they support. She hopes to do this through displaying the many materials she has made and designed, as well as through slides of the school and surrounding area. Californian Has Fond Memories by JEAN BOBST VENABLE I HAD such an interesting and rewarding experience in attending the second session of the Summer Craft Workshop at Arrowmont. I had wanted to attend ever since the summer of 1966 when I was fortunate to be a delegate to that Pi Phi convention. Thus, when the Southern California Area Council of Pi Beta Phi awarded me their scholarship, I was eagerly anticipating my trip. However, I had no idea what was really in store for me. The first class I attended was the beginning jewelry class. Sandra Blaine, the instructor and assistant director of the school, impressed me with her knowledge and ability, but when she said, "Tomorrow I want all of you to bring twenty-five sketches from nature (in one continuous line) of something you could make in wire." I thought, "Good Grief (Charlie Brown) I'll never make it." My artistic ability is pretty nil and one continuous line sounded even more impossible. (Continued on page 29) Kim Finds Excitement On Trip to Rhodesia KIM SKOLD, Arizona Alpha, returned to her chapter this fall, brimming with excitement and tales of her unusual and rewarding summer spent in Rhodesia, south central Africa. Al-though she spent most of her time in Salisbury, where she had a parlor session with the town's mayor, she managed to make many interesting side trips during her stay. She visited the game reserve in the middle of Mozambique Gorongosa and touched upon the upper part of South Africa. Kim also saw Victoria Falls and went on a trip up the Zambezi River. Kim Skold, Arizona Alpha While in Rhodesia, Kim met Mrs. Townley, the wife of one of Europe's top art dealers. Be-cause of Mrs. Townley, Kim was able to visit Harare, a township and orphanage. Play Tom Sawyer by JUDITH LYON This fall the largest sorority class on the University of Michigan campus from the 1967 fall rush moved into our beautiful house here in Ann Arbor. To commemorate the event, they all gathered, after the major settling problems were solved, and painted the white picket fence which surrounds the front of the house, "Welcome new initiates!". Thanks to our wonderful alumnae, as of this fall, we no longer have any holes in our roof. As a replacement, we have leak-proof ceilings, which go well with the new carpeting that fills many of our rooms. by CARYL CHAMBERLIN Arizona Alpha African children smile apprehensively for Kim Skold's camera. She also visited the villages of Matabele and Mashona. The former is noted for its soapstone carvings and the latter for its wood carving. One of the highlights of Kim's trip was her meeting with a witch doctor who was seventy-nine years old and had three wives and nineteen children. New Room Added Members of Colorado Gamma came back to Colorado State University last fall for a very active quarter. A new room was added to our house last summer, which greatly enhanced our rush, held a week before classes began. After pledging, we all enjoyed several functions with the fraternities on campus. With fall quarter came Homecoming, and the Colorado Gamma Pi Phis worked hard to make it successful. Four of our members were Homecoming committee heads, with Karen Asp as chairman. Our annual house tour was held in October. The money this year is being used to support a home for delinquent teenagers. 19
