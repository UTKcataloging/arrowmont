        Instigates New Department At Bethany An outstanding example that Pi Beta Phi is far more than an organization with merely social aims is West Virginia Gamma's Barbara Schneider. For the past three years Barbara has been busily involved in just about every facet of college and fraternity life. Probably her most significant achievement, to date, is that she was the chairman of a student committee and the main influence in the establishment of a new department at Bethany College. Last spring, when most students were involved only in maintaining grades and preparing for fraternity and sorority weekends, Barbara was rushing back and forth between various faculty commit Barbara Schneider, West Virginia Gamma tees trying to gain support for the new department. Her efforts met with great success and Bethany students now may choose to major in political science. However this is certainly not the only thing Barbara has done at Bethany. Her freshman year, she was active in the Spanish Club, the college band, and Koinonia, a religious oriented campus organization. She was also a member of the International Relations Club of which she is now the president. This organization, consisting of both foreign and American students, has as its purpose promotion of interest in national by BETH PARKIN West Virginia Gamma and international affairs and the opportunity for cultural exchange. Barbara spent the first semester of her sophomore year, with the recommendation of the Beth-any faculty, at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey. She was one of a number of specially selected students from the United States and abroad to participate in a concentrated pro-gram in political science on "International Relations and Organization." Previously, the pro-gram had been restricted to juniors and seniors, but Barbara had the distinction of being one of the first two sophomores ever admitted to this program. Since it was the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, she was able to hear some of the world's most important political figures speak before the U.N. While at Drew, Barbara was on the "Hot Line." This was a selected group of students that performed volunteer services to the college community by aiding students with such problems as drugs, pre-marital sex, and suicidal tendencies. All of these activities have not deterred Barbara from being quite active in the sorority or from maintaining a good scholarship index. Barbara has served as corresponding secretary, representative to the Student Board of Governors, and as a member of Arrowboard. She is presently secretary under the I.C. '71 program. Barbara has maintained a scholastic average above 3.3 and last fall was initiated into Phi Alpha Theta, a national history honorary. She is, of course, majoring in political science and history. After graduation next year, she hopes to at-tend law school. Name Four To Offices One of the goals of this Fraternity is to build leadership qualities for use in outside activities. Wyoming Alpha is indeed accomplishing this goal. Angel Flight elected four Pi Phi officers in January. Those elected were Debbie Seeley, drill team commander, Adrianne Christopulos, secretary; Liz Pack, historian; and Kathy Gregson, public relations. 14 Edited by ELEANOR BUSHNELL LEHNER Board of Governors Arrowmont architect, Hubert Bebb, designed this outdoor Conversation Circle, Bench, and Garden, which he and other Gatlinburg businessmen will donate to Arrowmont in honor of retiring Executive Coordinator Lucile McCutchan Woodworth. Grand Council has accepted the offer of this gift with gratitude. It will be a popular gathering place for groups of students relaxing between laboratory sessions.

She represented the Fraternity in working with architects and contractors while the Mall and the classroom building were being constructed. She also directed the layout and construction of a nature trail through Pi Phi mountain property which has been a source of both design study and pleasure for Arrowmont students, as well as for visitors.

For the past three years Barbara has been busily involved in just about every facet of college and fraternity life. Probably her most significant achievement, to date, is that she was the chairman of a student committee and the main influence in the establishment of a new department at Bethany College. Last spring, when most students were involved only in maintaining grades and preparing for fraternity and sorority weekends, Barbara was rushing back and forth between various faculty commit Barbara Schneider, West Virginia Gamma tees trying to gain support for the new department. Her efforts met with great success and Bethany students now may choose to major in political science. However this is certainly not the only thing Barbara has done at Bethany. Her freshman year, she was active in the Spanish Club, the college band, and Koinonia, a religious oriented campus organization. She was also a member of the International Relations Club of which she is now the president. This organization, consisting of both foreign and American students, has as its purpose promotion of interest in national by BETH PARKIN West Virginia Gamma and international affairs and the opportunity for cultural exchange. Barbara spent the first semester of her sophomore year, with the recommendation of the Beth-any faculty, at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey. She was one of a number of specially selected students from the United States and abroad to participate in a concentrated pro-gram in political science on "International Relations and Organization." Previously, the pro-gram had been restricted to juniors and seniors, but Barbara had the distinction of being one of the first two sophomores ever admitted to this program. Since it was the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, she was able to hear some of the world's most important political figures speak before the U.N. While at Drew, Barbara was on the "Hot Line." This was a selected group of students that performed volunteer services to the college community by aiding students with such problems as drugs, pre-marital sex, and suicidal tendencies. All of these activities have not deterred Barbara from being quite active in the sorority or from maintaining a good scholarship index. Barbara has served as corresponding secretary, representative to the Student Board of Governors, and as a member of Arrowboard. She is presently secretary under the I.C. '71 program. Barbara has maintained a scholastic average above 3.3 and last fall was initiated into Phi Alpha Theta, a national history honorary. She is, of course, majoring in political science and history. After graduation next year, she hopes to at-tend law school. Name Four To Offices One of the goals of this Fraternity is to build leadership qualities for use in outside activities. Wyoming Alpha is indeed accomplishing this goal. Angel Flight elected four Pi Phi officers in January. Those elected were Debbie Seeley, drill team commander, Adrianne Christopulos, secretary; Liz Pack, historian; and Kathy Gregson, public relations. 14 Edited by ELEANOR BUSHNELL LEHNER Board of Governors Arrowmont architect, Hubert Bebb, designed this outdoor Conversation Circle, Bench, and Garden, which he and other Gatlinburg businessmen will donate to Arrowmont in honor of retiring Executive Coordinator Lucile McCutchan Woodworth. Grand Council has accepted the offer of this gift with gratitude. It will be a popular gathering place for groups of students relaxing between laboratory sessions. News of school of arts and crafts The Great Smoky Mountains Gatlinburg, Tennessee 37738 15 Lucile Woodworth Resigns Position Lucile McCutchan Woodworth, Missouri Beta, recently announced her retirement as Executive Coordinator of Arrowmont after having served in that capacity since June, 1968. During her sojourn at Arrowmont, she has seen the Emma Harper Turner memorial progess from the groundbreaking for the Pi Phi Mall, in July, 1968, through the dedication of the Centennial Project, the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts, in June, 1970. She represented the Fraternity in working with architects and contractors while the Mall and the classroom building were being constructed. She also directed the layout and construction of a nature trail through Pi Phi mountain property which has been a source of both design study and pleasure for Arrowmont students, as well as for visitors. While acting as hostess to staff members, students and visitors, Mrs. Woodworth engaged in many civic activities. The Conversation Circle, shown on the preceding page, is being prepared by a group of Gatlinburg businessmen in Lucile's honor. Pi Beta Phi is now looking for an administrator to fill the vacancy left by Mrs. Woodworth's retirement. Any communications to Arrowmont should be directed to Mrs. Benjamin Lewis who is acting as temporary administrator. Attention! A full-time Administrator for Arrowmont is needed. Applicants should have broad business experience since the Administrator will serve as personnel and public relations director. It is preferable that applicants be members of Pi Beta Phi, but other applicants, both men and women, will be considered. For further information, please write to: Mrs. Adin H. Hall 4039 Piping Rock Lane Houston, Texas 77027 Is Anyone Looking For A Convention Site? Consider Arrowmont Pi Phis, if you or your husbands belong to groups that are looking for interesting locales for conventions or workshops, think about Arrowmont. The auditorium will hold up to 200 delegates. The library can also accommodate a size-able group. The laboratory rooms offer facilities for smaller meetings. Small groups can be accommodated in the dormitories. Larger groups can utilize the many motels nearby. Meals for 100 can be served in the Staff House dining room. If the convention is for businessmen, their wives can have a delightful time browsing through the Arrowcraft Shop and the many other variety stores in Gatlinburg. If the convention is for women they'll want to allow some free time for this. The mountain scenery is beautiful, and the local entertainment is colorful. Address your inquiries to Administrator, Arrowmont, Box 567, Gatlinburg, Tennessee 37738. The two smiling young ladies exploring the Arrowmont truck are staff members Ann S. Van Aken and Sandra Blain. Ann, a designer-craftsman from Palo Alto, California, has taught ceramics in Pi Phi summer workshops for many years. Sandy, an instructor in the Department of Crafts and Interior Design at the University of Tennessee, has served as Assistant Director of Arrowmont for two years. G4TLIMBURG_TFY~ Drawing by Diane Pirie, Past President California Delta COME ON, ANGELS! THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL! If you could see her now! With her new name, ARROWMONT. . And her new face. . . . She could become the Juilliard of Arts and Crafts. Of course, she does need ANGELS. But Pi Phi is full of those. So Come on, Angels. . . . Let's put wings on ARROWMONT. Picture a beautiful campus in the mountains. Spacious laboratories. Enviable equipment. Congeniality. Peace and quiet. Plenty of time to spend creating whatever a person feels like creating. Switch to another image. . . . A nation full of budding craftsmen. Everyone wants to "be creative." But some want to create better. That's where ARROWMONT comes in. In the field of music, the most gifted steer for Eastman or Juilliard. In arts and crafts, the most talented and/orenthusiastic belong at ARROWMONT. Can. ARROWMONT absorb them ? That depends, Angels. Angels can help pay salaries that even dedicated teachers must earn. Angels can build dormitories where work-happy students can rest their weary imaginations. Angels can speed the arrival of the day when all the bills will be paid. Only Angels can turn ARROWMONT into the National Cultural Center it is capable of becoming. This is your chance to participate in a "really big show" the biggest ever to hit the fraternity system. This is your chance to prove to the world what Pi Beta Phi can do. This is your chance to silence the voices heralding the decline and fall of the fraternity system. Look to ARROWMONT, Angels. It can put wings on YOU. 17 the hundreds of colorful batiks created last summer by of Sister Mary Remy, Chairman of the Art Department at nary College in Milwaukee, whose work is featured in the U.S.A. exhibition currently touring the country before be-a permanent part of the Smithsonian collection in Washing-.

And Gatlinburg will be famous as the home of a national cultural center. A comprehensive Master Plan, prepared for the Gatlinburg City Council by a nationally known firm, suggests this possibility. What Needs Does Arrowmont Fill? EDUCATION Preserving and fostering craft skills takes on added importance as automation and mass production increase. For some, crafts provide a livelihood. For others they afford a creative out-let. Education improves both quality and enjoyment. REHABILITATION Crafts can benefit the mentally and physically handicapped of all ages. Both children and adults with permanent handicaps or injuries due to accidents (even loss of sight) or to military service disabilities can train muscles to be useful again through the constructive use of crafts. Even the mentally disabled can be brought a step closer to reality through creative activities involving crafts. RECREATION Day camps, summer camps, youth organizations, senior citizen centers are a few of the many areas where crafts are utilized for recreational purposes. More and more people are seeking meaningful ways to spend their leisure time. ART "A thing of beauty is a joy forever." The pleasure of creating an appealing wall hanging or bowl or silver bracelet or enamel pendant, or batik or silkscreen design will, if it is well done, put joy into our lives, beauty into our surroundings, and a lift to our spirits. Whatever the craft, the joy and satisfaction are the same.
