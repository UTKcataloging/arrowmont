II Il THE BARTELS Masters of Their Craft Arrowmont is fortunate to have on permanent display several creations in wood which are easily distinguishable as examples of the workmanship of a unique couple. The Bartels, Doris and Roland (Bart), have achieved an enviable reputation as creators of contemporary religious decor. Their works can be seen in at least six universities and colleges; in several churches in Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee, and in private homes as well. Working basically in wood, they have constructed various sizes of creches, wall panels, candle stands, crosses, plaques, and many individual figures. The articles generally have religious significance and are contemporary in design. Doris Bartels, a commercial artist before her marriage, indulged her longtime interest in contemporary religious art after her children were grown by studying with Sister M. Thomasita, OSF, of Milwaukee, a leading artist in the field. She worked with Sister Thomasita for fourteen years in the art department of Cardinal Stritch College, before moving to Roland (Bart) and Doris Bartels enjoy increased creativity in "retirement." Here they fashion a plaque depicting St. Francis of Assisi. New York with her husband. There she assisted in establishing the Gallery of Contemporary Christian Art, Inc. When Bart Bartels retired, they moved to Gatlinburg to join the working craftsmen of that area. Bart's part of the work is to select and pre-pare the various woods, and to provide the patience and precision required in some of the intricate construction of his wife's designs. They are members of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild, and associate members of the 12 Designer Craftsmen of Gatlinburg. Jean Wirths Scott admires the wooden clock, created by the Bartels, which was donated to Arrowmont by Mary Frances Davidson, who teaches courses in vegetable dyeing each summer. Jean, the new Vice President of Philanthropies, was attending her first Board of Governors meeting. The Bartels designed and created the Evelyn Peters Kyle "Angel" award which is displayed in recognition of outstanding Pi Beta Phi alumnae.

Chairman, HELEN DEPPE VOTTMAR (Ed. note: Mrs. Vollmar attended Arrowmont as a student prior to her scheduled retirement as Chairman of the Board of Governors in the fall of 1975.) Last summer my husband and I, along with about 120 others, attended a one week session at Arrowmont School of Crafts. Thus we be-came a part of the one thousand-plus students in attendance for the 1975 session. Forty-two states were represented during the ten week period. Ours is Missouri, the old "Show Me" state . . . and we were shown . . . The "Arrowmont Experience" is instructive, stimulating, absorbing, fun, rewarding . . . pleasantly exhausting. Arrowmont is a school for the serious crafts-man. Ages, background and skill range from teenagers to senior citizens. From professional craftsmen to rank beginners, such as myself. As it is accredited through the University of Tennessee for both graduate and undergraduate credit, many were taking the courses for credit while some were merely auditing . . . either is acceptable. Students work in a warm and friendly atmosphere inspired by Marian Heard, Director. Her highly respected position in the craft world enables her to assemble an out-standing faculty for Arrowmont year after year. Caroline Riddle, the Administrator, is found almost everywhere on the campus. Her position is all embracing, involving the school, housing, dining and maintenance along with her responsibilities connected with Arrowcraft, both in its production and sales. She is in charge of the business and personnel areas and must keep it all running smoothly, which she does in a pleasant and efficient manner. We are blessed to have both Miss Heard and Mrs. Riddle at the helm, along with our dedicated employees of many years who back them up. My husband's interest lies in silversmithing, and he made a handsome salad-serving set of silver. I explored the field of batiks, It opened my eyes to a whole new world. Design! I learned the technique of making batiks along with the fact that I have a long way to go beforebecoming a producing craftsman. I enjoyed every minute of it! Because of limited housing on our campus, my husband and I stayed in a nearby hotel. So did about thirty others. It was only on the way to and from the school that we realized we were in the busy resort town of Gatlinburg. Once through the Arrowmont gates and onto our lovely campus with the high Pi Phi Hill as a backdrop, peace and quiet prevails so necessary for creativity. We all had our meals together in the pleasant dining room at the Staff House. As the work is so concentrated, there is little time for relaxation and visiting. Mealtime provides this opportunity. It is also a time for married couples taking separate courses to get together. Coming to Arrowmont under those conditions is definitely a "his-and-hers" experience. The library and studios are light and spacious. Outside the windows the beautiful Smokey Mountains shape the horizon. The shelves in the library are beginning to be filled with a number of excellent books on crafts and design. They are used constantly by the students for reference and inspiration. If your Club should like to donate a book as a memorial gift or a "just because," contact Miss Heard. The climax of the week was the display of the students' work on the last afternoon of the session when each studio held open house. Colorful batiks covered the walls of the batik studio; stunning jewelry was displayed on natural forms brought in from the hillside, along with beautiful enamels with their look of precious stones; weaving and ceramics, unbelievable in scope of imagination, beauty and skill. But, as will all things, the end did come, and by five o'clock on that last afternoon the students dismantled the exhibits, packed their precious productions, said good-bys and headed in all directions of the country toward home. Aside from the delight of my new adventure into the world of crafts, there were other (Continued on page 40) 16 Ohio Zetas gathered in front of the Red Barn during their retreat at Arrowmont last November.

Many of our actives and pledges had heard the words "Arrowcraft", "Arrowmont", "Settlement School", and "Gatlinburg" , but wanted to see Pi Phi in action for themselves, so a retreat to Arrowmont was organized. We arrived in Gatlinburg on Saturday to find a quaint little mountain village bustling with activity. The day was crisp, skies were blue, and sun was shining. We spent the morning shopping in the cute and varied shops of Gatlinburg. Of course, the Arrowcraft Shop was visited by all of us. In the afternoon Caroline Riddle, Administrator of Arrowmont, showed us a slide show of Arrowmont and the crafts it produces. She also told us the history and the future hopes of Arrowmont. Then we were given a tour of the beautiful school and each of us enjoyed a personal view of the outstanding facilities of Arrowmont. That night Ohio Zetas ate dinner together at a local Gatlinburg restaurant. We were all pleased with the kindness that the townspeople bestowed upon us when they found that we were Pi Phis.

Chairman, HELEN DEPPE VOTTMAR (Ed. note: Mrs. Vollmar attended Arrowmont as a student prior to her scheduled retirement as Chairman of the Board of Governors in the fall of 1975.) Last summer my husband and I, along with about 120 others, attended a one week session at Arrowmont School of Crafts. Thus we be-came a part of the one thousand-plus students in attendance for the 1975 session. Forty-two states were represented during the ten week period. Ours is Missouri, the old "Show Me" state . . . and we were shown . . . The "Arrowmont Experience" is instructive, stimulating, absorbing, fun, rewarding . . . pleasantly exhausting. Arrowmont is a school for the serious crafts-man. Ages, background and skill range from teenagers to senior citizens. From professional craftsmen to rank beginners, such as myself. As it is accredited through the University of Tennessee for both graduate and undergraduate credit, many were taking the courses for credit while some were merely auditing . . . either is acceptable. Students work in a warm and friendly atmosphere inspired by Marian Heard, Director. Her highly respected position in the craft world enables her to assemble an out-standing faculty for Arrowmont year after year. Caroline Riddle, the Administrator, is found almost everywhere on the campus. Her position is all embracing, involving the school, housing, dining and maintenance along with her responsibilities connected with Arrowcraft, both in its production and sales. She is in charge of the business and personnel areas and must keep it all running smoothly, which she does in a pleasant and efficient manner. We are blessed to have both Miss Heard and Mrs. Riddle at the helm, along with our dedicated employees of many years who back them up. My husband's interest lies in silversmithing, and he made a handsome salad-serving set of silver. I explored the field of batiks, It opened my eyes to a whole new world. Design! I learned the technique of making batiks along with the fact that I have a long way to go beforebecoming a producing craftsman. I enjoyed every minute of it! Because of limited housing on our campus, my husband and I stayed in a nearby hotel. So did about thirty others. It was only on the way to and from the school that we realized we were in the busy resort town of Gatlinburg. Once through the Arrowmont gates and onto our lovely campus with the high Pi Phi Hill as a backdrop, peace and quiet prevails so necessary for creativity. We all had our meals together in the pleasant dining room at the Staff House. As the work is so concentrated, there is little time for relaxation and visiting. Mealtime provides this opportunity. It is also a time for married couples taking separate courses to get together. Coming to Arrowmont under those conditions is definitely a "his-and-hers" experience. The library and studios are light and spacious. Outside the windows the beautiful Smokey Mountains shape the horizon. The shelves in the library are beginning to be filled with a number of excellent books on crafts and design. They are used constantly by the students for reference and inspiration. If your Club should like to donate a book as a memorial gift or a "just because," contact Miss Heard. The climax of the week was the display of the students' work on the last afternoon of the session when each studio held open house. Colorful batiks covered the walls of the batik studio; stunning jewelry was displayed on natural forms brought in from the hillside, along with beautiful enamels with their look of precious stones; weaving and ceramics, unbelievable in scope of imagination, beauty and skill. But, as will all things, the end did come, and by five o'clock on that last afternoon the students dismantled the exhibits, packed their precious productions, said good-bys and headed in all directions of the country toward home. Aside from the delight of my new adventure into the world of crafts, there were other (Continued on page 40) 16 Ohio Zetas gathered in front of the Red Barn during their retreat at Arrowmont last November. Gatlinburg Retreat Impresses Chapter Very early in the morning last November 15, Ohio Zeta Pi Phis boarded a bus headed for Gatlinburg, Tenn. Many of our actives and pledges had heard the words "Arrowcraft", "Arrowmont", "Settlement School", and "Gatlinburg" , but wanted to see Pi Phi in action for themselves, so a retreat to Arrowmont was organized. We arrived in Gatlinburg on Saturday to find a quaint little mountain village bustling with activity. The day was crisp, skies were blue, and sun was shining. We spent the morning shopping in the cute and varied shops of Gatlinburg. Of course, the Arrowcraft Shop was visited by all of us. In the afternoon Caroline Riddle, Administrator of Arrowmont, showed us a slide show of Arrowmont and the crafts it produces. She also told us the history and the future hopes of Arrowmont. Then we were given a tour of the beautiful school and each of us enjoyed a personal view of the outstanding facilities of Arrowmont. That night Ohio Zetas ate dinner together at a local Gatlinburg restaurant. We were all pleased with the kindness that the townspeople bestowed upon us when they found that we were Pi Phis. It is fantastic to be a part of a sorority that makes such a wonderful contribution to our society.
