        Mrs. Spring The limitless spaces, colorful life and fascinating history of the West have their match in an indefatigable Pi Phi who has found much of her life set against its rough and beautiful tapestry. Agnes Wright Spring, a charter member of Wyoming Alpha and currently the Colorado State Historian, is apparently never too busy to collaborate on a book, write a pamphlet or edit a magazine for she can lay claim to a play, some 600 feature articles, a number of children's stories and some western fiction, and sixteen books. She assumed her duties as state historian in 1954. Some of her literary accomplishments in just the past four years have included editing, The Horse Wrangler by Floyd Bard, which was a runner-up for the Silver Spur Award of Western Writers of America for the best non-fiction Western Book of 1960, collaborating on Hoof beats of Destiny, a story of the Pony Express, also published in 1960, writing a history of the First National Bank of Denver, editing A Pioneer of the Black Hills by Hughes, collaborating under a Rockefeller grant on When Grass Was King and writing in 1961 a special pamphlet, "Colorado In the Civil War." Around the edges of her busy days she also finds the time and talent to edit The Colorado Magazine, which is the official publication of the State Historical Society of Colorado and performs the same tasks for the Gold Nugget, which is a junior Historical Magazine. Good copy herself, Mrs. Spring has been the frequent subject of feature stories in Denver papers. Agnes Wright Spring HISTORY IS HER BUSINESS Former Arrow Editor has carved colorful career as writer, editor and historian as vast as her West. Howard Siddon said of her in the Rocky Mountain News, "Colorado's relatively short and lusty history owes much of its documentation to Mrs. Spring's tireless efforts . . . her knowledge, national reputation and innumerable friends enable her to uncover historical strikes comparable to a miner's mother lode." This remarkable chronicler has shared her talent generously with Pi Beta Phi. She was president of her chapter and was an ARROW Chapter Letter Editor before assuming the post of Editor in 1921, which she held until 1928. She then served the Fraternity as National Historian and wrote the History of Pi Beta Phi. Later she was Public Relations Chair-man. She is a former member of the Settlement School Committee and during World War II was Director of Settlement School for three months. She is the author of the pamphlet on Settlement School which pledges receive. Agnes Spring was born in Colorado but grew up on a ranch on the Little Laramie River in Wyoming and carried from there her love of the life and people of the West. She prepared for her writing career at the University of Wyoming and after graduation there studied journalism at the Pulitzer School of journalism at Columbia University as the holder of the Pi Beta Phi Fellowship. She came back to Wyoming and was its State Librarian and State Historian, ex-officio until her marriage to Archer T. Spring of Boston in 1921. Wyoming let her marry and return to her native Colorado but it still claimed her a fact borne out 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 15 by her work as Woman's Editor of the Wyoming Stockman-Farmer for 27 years, though twenty of those years she was living in Colorado. Last year Wyoming called her home for a unique honor befitting her career she became the first woman to receive the University of Wyoming Distinguished Alumni Award. It was the first time in the eight-year history of the award that two individuals were selected in the same year for the honor. Mrs. Spring shared the spotlight with Wyoming United States Senator J. J. Hickey, who is also a former governor of that state. The role of being a "first woman" is not a new one for our biographer of pioneers, as one might expect. She got her first set of spurs in that department in 1960 when the Colorado Cowboy Hall of Fame tapped her for its roster and its first woman nominee. The "twain" of East and West have met in the marriage of Agnes and Archer Spring for she says "He's as Old Boston as I am Old West" ; buthe too is a literary artist of success, though his profession before retirement was that of petroleum engineering. He writes verses and epigrams for the Saturday Evening Post, and has also published articles in Sports Illustrated, The Rotarian, American Legion Magazine and similar publications. The Springs live in an apartment close by the State Historical Museum and Mrs. Spring walks to her office daily. When she can she pursues more rigorous exercise as a fisherman. She and her husband take frequent trips throughout the West and the nation, concentrating their travel in the continental United States rather than abroad. She frequently attends meetings or conventions of one of the many professional or historical groups of which she is a member. Some of these are the Colorado Women's Press Association, the Mississippi Valley Historical Society and the Pioneer Men and Women of Colorado, an organization made up of descend-ants of people who came to the state prior to 1864. FROM YOUR EDITOR EMERITUS (Continued from page 2) wish you could have known them all; they were all such pretty girls." ; and her sister, Mrs. Hutchinson spoke up and said, "And Em was the prettiest of us all!" Or the night of the banquet at Asheville when Mrs. Libby stood up with the sextet of girls and sang a Pi Phi song she had written coming out on the train. Precious memories, indeed, to add to our store of gracious things to be cherished by all who had the privilege of knowing alive fine women; when they founded the Fraternity, they were lovely girls like yourselves. We have such a wonderful heritage one worthy of our best efforts and hardest work so that it may be preserved for many years to come. Here's to our best Convention ever! Let us live up to the ideals those twelve women left for us. Pi Phi love from Pi Phi Is Only Woman Delegate to Conference Mary Elizabeth Lomen (Mrs. Alfred J.), Washington Alpha Pi Phi, now of Fairbanks, Alaska, had the honor to be selected the only woman delegate to the fall conference of the Western Interstate Commission of Higher Education. This conference was held in Denver, Colorado, November 30-December 1, 1961. Its purpose was to discuss the problem of the out-of-state student in the public colleges and universities of thirteen western states. Mrs. Lomen represented Alaska at the meeting. The findings of the conference will be widely circulated on publication. Mrs. Lomen was president of the Seattle Alum= Club in 1953 and is a former chairman of the Alumnae Advisory Board of Washington Alpha. She is the mother of three children: Gilbert, 16, Julie, 12, and James, 1. ot. Wiesbaden continues to be a residential town and international health resort, but many buildings have gone up in recent years adding a note of modernity to the city. Last summer a Missouri Beta Pi Phi accompanied her husband to a new assignment in Europe. She was Wilda Van Gieson Landon and her husband is General Truman H. Landon, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Air Forces in Europe. In the fall she responded to the request of Grand President Alice Weber Mansfield that she write some of her impressions for the ARROW. She wrote "Among the most pleasant assignments in our Air Force career was the one that brought General Lan-don and me back to Wiesbaden, Germany, in July of this year. "Of course, each new assignment brings new friendships, but in Wiesbaden there was the added delight of meeting old friends. Although nearly eight years have passed since we left Germany for Washington, D.C., in August 1953, there were many especially among our German friends who re-membered us and who helped to make our return a homecoming. "Wiesbaden itself has changed. The remnants of bombed and broken buildings which one still saw here and there in Wiesbaden in 1953 have disappeared and many new and very modern buildings have been built. The charm of the city has remained. There is still an easy gracefulness about the city in the many lovely parks and on broad promenades of the fashionable Wilhelmstrasse. "The USAFE command covers a broad area: England, France, Germany, and Spain, then east along both shores of the Mediterranean as far as Saudi Arabia. General Landon's duties have taken him to many parts of the area. I have been able to join him on trips in Germany and to England, France, and Spain. Soon I hope to visit Italy, Turkey, and Greece. "My husband's responsibilities also include those of a NATO organization, the Fourth Allied Tactical A Return to Wiesbaden Air Force, consisting of Canadian, French, German, and US air force units. His duties take us very often to Ramstein, Germany, where this command has its headquarters, located near the world-famous "Wein Strasse." "The visit to Ramstein provide me with wonderful opportunities to meet with the families of German, French, and Canadian personnel who, along with the American Air Force personnel, form a truly international community there. There, too, each national group takes pride in displaying its customs and manner of doing. "I find the wives of our US Air Force personnel keenly aware of the importance of the role which they play in creating a favorable image of our country in their contacts overseas. "Outside of London, at South Ruislip, the head-quarters of the Third Air Force in Paris at NATO headquarters ; at Torrejon Air Base, near Madrid, the headquarters of the 65th Air Division ; every-where I travelled, I met American wives and families who are ably representing America in their frequent contacts with the communities in which they live. "These women will return home with a greater understanding of international affairs and will certainly help to give their children the background for leadership which comes from an understanding of the world outside our own country. "Being abroad is a stimulating experience for all of us, and if the responsibilities are great, so are the satisfactions. The world is growing constantly smaller. The need to know 'and understand our neighbors was never greater." General and Mrs. Landon welcome the secretary of the Air Force, Eugene M. Zuckert, on his arrival at Wiesbaden. flewo rom J)j11/e /0ieon Edited by Helen Boucher Dix, Ohio B Long History of Mountain Weaving Represented at Craftsman's Fair by Sutton From "kiverlids" to ponchos, the history of mountain weaving was represented in the Arrowcraft Shop exhibit at the Craftsman's Fair in Gatlinburg, October 24-28, 1961. Mountain woman's skill and adaptability was on display in the handsome sweaters and ponchos she has created for the skiers who will come to Gatlin-burg for the first time this year. Most of the weavers who made the ponchos, modelled by Betty Sipe, Gatlinburg a Ski Club hostess, have never seen a skier in costume, but they can follow any pattern whether for a placement, or a stole to wear after skiing. Miss Winogene Redding, Arrowcraft Shop weaving designer, says the adaptation to winter sports Christian attire is but one phase of a long history in Gatlin-burg weaving. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, established in 1912, has sustained the tradition of weaving in this area and that has been the core of revival of all handicrafts. In its awakening of interest in the crafts the school had the help of Aunt Lizzie Reagan, who worked at an ancient loom until she died in 1926 at the age of eighty-seven, and the versatile craftsman, Aunt Lydia Whaley. The two women taught their neighbors, many of whom required only refresher courses in spinning and weaving, and the school found a ready market for the products through the widely scattered Pi Beta Phi chapters and alumnae clubs. IT'S TRADITIONAL Craftsmanship is traditional for those dedicated artisans who weave for Arrowcraft. Here Izora Keener, tenter, whose weaving covers 40 years, Jean Carter, left, who comes from a family of 16 weavers, and Winogene Red-ding, Arrowcraft Shop weaving designer for 20 years give their approval to finished products. 23 24 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Miss Redding, a native of Wollaston, Massachusetts, arrived at the Settlement School in 1925 to direct the weaving operations and to design patterns to meet modern demands. At about the same time Arrowcraft Shop was established to provide the market, both locally and nationally. Today Arrowcraft employs seventy-five weavers on a year-around basis. They own their looms and do their weaving in their leisure time at home. Arrow-craft supplies the threads and yarns and supervises and directs the work. The oldest weaver is Mrs. Mollie Moore, eighty years old. She has several daughters who weave for the shop. Mrs. Izora Keener, who started working for Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in 1921, has the longest record of employment. Mrs. Laura Watson heads the largest family of weavers. Joining her in the craft are four daughters, six daughters-in-law, and four granddaughters. Among the hundreds of patterns in Arrowcraft weaving the most popular continues to be the traditional Whig Rose, which was adapted to a lunch-eon mat that has been sold in great quantity. Under Miss Redding's direction the Arrowcraft weavers make not only traditional but contemporary weavings in tweeds, bags, luncheon mats, stoles, blankets, aprons, and yardage. The roster of weavers includes hundreds of local women, many of whom have started their own business and prospered with the growth of the tourist industry. In the early years of the program weaving was taught in the high school and is now a part of the Arts and Crafts classes. There are approximately 1,000 looms in the Gatlinburg area. Thus, weaving is the most important of local handicrafts, and probably no other area in America has greater claim to importance as a hand weaving center. About twenty-five years ago the Arrowcraft Weavers organized a Guild, and under Miss Redding's direction sponsored the Gatlinburg Garden Club in 1937. The club, open to both Guild members as well as interested women in the community, held annual flower shows in the school. Although she came to Gatlinburg thirty-six years ago, Miss Redding has not worked continuously for Arrowcraft. In her first period of employment she rode horseback to homes of weavers living in re-mote sections. She taught weaving in Norris, Ten Miss Betty Sipe, Gatlinburg Ski Club hostess and professional model, poses in Arrowcraft's handwoven "poncho" to demonstrate its happy blend with ski pants. This picture was used in connection with publicity for the Craftsman's Fair in October, 1961. nessee, under the TVA program in 1934-35. In 1948 she opened her own studio in Wollaston, Massachusetts, where, in addition to teaching weaving, she authored and published REDDIGRAPHS for WEAVERS, a series of designs that had international circulation. She taught weaving in summer schools in Mason, New Hampshire, Natchitoches, Louisiana, and at Pi Beta Phi (school) before returning to Arrowcraft as weaving designer in 1958. She became a member of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild during its pioneer days, and she has served the organization in many capacities. She is presently chairman of the jury on standards and is president of the Tennessee unit of the Guild. (From The Gatlinburg Press, Oct. 12, 1961). The Albuquerque Alumnae Club is providing a scholarship to the Summer Craft Workshop this year. SETTLEMENT SCHOOL ANNOUNCEMENTS,. A Special Invitation The 1962 Convention in Washington, D.C. will recognize the 50th Anniversary of the founding of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Many Pi Phis have served as resident staff members, teachers, or committee members during the half-century the Settlement School has been developing as a living Memorial to our Founders. If you are one of these who helped to "build the Settlement School," we extend a special invitation to attend the 1962 Convention, especially the commemorative dinner and program on Tuesday evening, June 26. Please make your former position and service years known on your official Registration Blank. Mrs. Carl W. Hens-ley, Secretary Settlement School Committee, 1126 Fay Avenue Baybreeze, Kemah, Texas, will also like to know if you plan to attend. Fire at Settlement School At 2:00 A.M. on January 11 the coldest night in sixty-seven years, fire broke out in the boys' dormitory (Teachers Cottage) at our Settlement School. Fortunately and thankfully, all in the building were safely evacuated. The prompt response of the Gatlinburg Volunteer Fire Department undoubtedly prevented further extensive damage, even though there is heavy loss. Much of the first floor and contents were destroyed, including office equipment and all personal possessions of Mrs. Adams, our treasured house-mother and cook. There was considerable loss in the belongings of a teacher, Mr. Carnes, and the boys. The Boys Dorm has been moved to the first floor of the Red Barn, Mrs. Adams is now at the Staff House where the Director's office is also temporarily located. It is hoped that restoration will be completed in time for the necessary housing of summer Craft Workshop Students. While insurance is expected to take care of re-placement of structure and contents, it will notcover any improvements (such as better wiring, the traceable cause of the fire) thought desirable to undertake at this time. In addition those who work closely with the Settlement School believe the Fraternity should attempt restitution of personal losses to the greatest possible extent. It is believed that Pi Phis as chapters, clubs and individuals will welcome the opportunity to help in this emergency, the first of this kind in 50 years. Gatlinburg offered its help as a community and as individual friends of the Settlement School immediately and wholeheartedly. Can we as Pi Phis, do less? If you wish to help, please designate your check to "Emergency Fund" and send to Mrs. Richard E. James, Jr., Treasurer Settlement School Committee, 3903 Gladney Drive, Doraville, Georgia. i Phi Seniors The 1962 Craft Workshop offers, three Graduate Assistant positions to graduating seniors who are art majors or minors. How would you like to live and work at the Settlement School for six weeks early next sumMer? There is financial reimbursement, one free credit course, and free room and board. If interested, write soon to Mrs. Robert R. Russell, Chairman, Settlement School Committee, 6823 Crest Avenue, University City 30, Missouri. Arrowcraft Manager Needed The Arrowcraft Manager's position is still open to a qualified member of the Fraternity. Surely there is a Pi Phi, somewhere who is available and truly interested in this challenging position which calls for experience in business management, good health, congenial relationships, handcraft appreciations, and freedom from family responsibilities. If interested, please contact immediately Mrs. Robert R. Russell, Chairman Settlement School Committee, 6823 Crest Avenue, University City 30, Missouri. Members of Tennessee Alpha visited the Red Barn and toured Settlement School in October. Louisiana Beta, Tennessee Gamma and South Carolina Alpha have made inquiries about possible visits. The Red Barn has been used also by church groups, craftsmen, and recreation groups. 25

Hens-ley, Secretary Settlement School Committee, 1126 Fay Avenue Baybreeze, Kemah, Texas, will also like to know if you plan to attend. Fire at Settlement School At 2:00 A.M. on January 11 the coldest night in sixty-seven years, fire broke out in the boys' dormitory (Teachers Cottage) at our Settlement School. Fortunately and thankfully, all in the building were safely evacuated. The prompt response of the Gatlinburg Volunteer Fire Department undoubtedly prevented further extensive damage, even though there is heavy loss. Much of the first floor and contents were destroyed, including office equipment and all personal possessions of Mrs. Adams, our treasured house-mother and cook. There was considerable loss in the belongings of a teacher, Mr. Carnes, and the boys. The Boys Dorm has been moved to the first floor of the Red Barn, Mrs. Adams is now at the Staff House where the Director's office is also temporarily located. It is hoped that restoration will be completed in time for the necessary housing of summer Craft Workshop Students. While insurance is expected to take care of re-placement of structure and contents, it will notcover any improvements (such as better wiring, the traceable cause of the fire) thought desirable to undertake at this time. In addition those who work closely with the Settlement School believe the Fraternity should attempt restitution of personal losses to the greatest possible extent. It is believed that Pi Phis as chapters, clubs and individuals will welcome the opportunity to help in this emergency, the first of this kind in 50 years. Gatlinburg offered its help as a community and as individual friends of the Settlement School immediately and wholeheartedly. Can we as Pi Phis, do less? If you wish to help, please designate your check to "Emergency Fund" and send to Mrs. Richard E. James, Jr., Treasurer Settlement School Committee, 3903 Gladney Drive, Doraville, Georgia. i Phi Seniors The 1962 Craft Workshop offers, three Graduate Assistant positions to graduating seniors who are art majors or minors. How would you like to live and work at the Settlement School for six weeks early next sumMer? There is financial reimbursement, one free credit course, and free room and board. If interested, write soon to Mrs. Robert R. Russell, Chairman, Settlement School Committee, 6823 Crest Avenue, University City 30, Missouri. Arrowcraft Manager Needed The Arrowcraft Manager's position is still open to a qualified member of the Fraternity. Surely there is a Pi Phi, somewhere who is available and truly interested in this challenging position which calls for experience in business management, good health, congenial relationships, handcraft appreciations, and freedom from family responsibilities. If interested, please contact immediately Mrs. Robert R. Russell, Chairman Settlement School Committee, 6823 Crest Avenue, University City 30, Missouri. Members of Tennessee Alpha visited the Red Barn and toured Settlement School in October. Louisiana Beta, Tennessee Gamma and South Carolina Alpha have made inquiries about possible visits. The Red Barn has been used also by church groups, craftsmen, and recreation groups. 25 Mrs. Spring The limitless spaces, colorful life and fascinating history of the West have their match in an indefatigable Pi Phi who has found much of her life set against its rough and beautiful tapestry. Agnes Wright Spring, a charter member of Wyoming Alpha and currently the Colorado State Historian, is apparently never too busy to collaborate on a book, write a pamphlet or edit a magazine for she can lay claim to a play, some 600 feature articles, a number of children's stories and some western fiction, and sixteen books. She assumed her duties as state historian in 1954. Some of her literary accomplishments in just the past four years have included editing, The Horse Wrangler by Floyd Bard, which was a runner-up for the Silver Spur Award of Western Writers of America for the best non-fiction Western Book of 1960, collaborating on Hoof beats of Destiny, a story of the Pony Express, also published in 1960, writing a history of the First National Bank of Denver, editing A Pioneer of the Black Hills by Hughes, collaborating under a Rockefeller grant on When Grass Was King and writing in 1961 a special pamphlet, "Colorado In the Civil War." Around the edges of her busy days she also finds the time and talent to edit The Colorado Magazine, which is the official publication of the State Historical Society of Colorado and performs the same tasks for the Gold Nugget, which is a junior Historical Magazine. Good copy herself, Mrs. Spring has been the frequent subject of feature stories in Denver papers. Agnes Wright Spring HISTORY IS HER BUSINESS Former Arrow Editor has carved colorful career as writer, editor and historian as vast as her West. Howard Siddon said of her in the Rocky Mountain News, "Colorado's relatively short and lusty history owes much of its documentation to Mrs. Spring's tireless efforts . . . her knowledge, national reputation and innumerable friends enable her to uncover historical strikes comparable to a miner's mother lode." This remarkable chronicler has shared her talent generously with Pi Beta Phi. She was president of her chapter and was an ARROW Chapter Letter Editor before assuming the post of Editor in 1921, which she held until 1928. She then served the Fraternity as National Historian and wrote the History of Pi Beta Phi. Later she was Public Relations Chair-man. She is a former member of the Settlement School Committee and during World War II was Director of Settlement School for three months. She is the author of the pamphlet on Settlement School which pledges receive. Agnes Spring was born in Colorado but grew up on a ranch on the Little Laramie River in Wyoming and carried from there her love of the life and people of the West. She prepared for her writing career at the University of Wyoming and after graduation there studied journalism at the Pulitzer School of journalism at Columbia University as the holder of the Pi Beta Phi Fellowship. She came back to Wyoming and was its State Librarian and State Historian, ex-officio until her marriage to Archer T. Spring of Boston in 1921. Wyoming let her marry and return to her native Colorado but it still claimed her a fact borne out 14 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 15 by her work as Woman's Editor of the Wyoming Stockman-Farmer for 27 years, though twenty of those years she was living in Colorado. Last year Wyoming called her home for a unique honor befitting her career she became the first woman to receive the University of Wyoming Distinguished Alumni Award. It was the first time in the eight-year history of the award that two individuals were selected in the same year for the honor. Mrs. Spring shared the spotlight with Wyoming United States Senator J. J. Hickey, who is also a former governor of that state. The role of being a "first woman" is not a new one for our biographer of pioneers, as one might expect. She got her first set of spurs in that department in 1960 when the Colorado Cowboy Hall of Fame tapped her for its roster and its first woman nominee. The "twain" of East and West have met in the marriage of Agnes and Archer Spring for she says "He's as Old Boston as I am Old West" ; buthe too is a literary artist of success, though his profession before retirement was that of petroleum engineering. He writes verses and epigrams for the Saturday Evening Post, and has also published articles in Sports Illustrated, The Rotarian, American Legion Magazine and similar publications. The Springs live in an apartment close by the State Historical Museum and Mrs. Spring walks to her office daily. When she can she pursues more rigorous exercise as a fisherman. She and her husband take frequent trips throughout the West and the nation, concentrating their travel in the continental United States rather than abroad. She frequently attends meetings or conventions of one of the many professional or historical groups of which she is a member. Some of these are the Colorado Women's Press Association, the Mississippi Valley Historical Society and the Pioneer Men and Women of Colorado, an organization made up of descend-ants of people who came to the state prior to 1864. FROM YOUR EDITOR EMERITUS (Continued from page 2) wish you could have known them all; they were all such pretty girls." ; and her sister, Mrs. Hutchinson spoke up and said, "And Em was the prettiest of us all!" Or the night of the banquet at Asheville when Mrs. Libby stood up with the sextet of girls and sang a Pi Phi song she had written coming out on the train. Precious memories, indeed, to add to our store of gracious things to be cherished by all who had the privilege of knowing alive fine women; when they founded the Fraternity, they were lovely girls like yourselves. We have such a wonderful heritage one worthy of our best efforts and hardest work so that it may be preserved for many years to come. Here's to our best Convention ever! Let us live up to the ideals those twelve women left for us. Pi Phi love from Pi Phi Is Only Woman Delegate to Conference Mary Elizabeth Lomen (Mrs. Alfred J.), Washington Alpha Pi Phi, now of Fairbanks, Alaska, had the honor to be selected the only woman delegate to the fall conference of the Western Interstate Commission of Higher Education. This conference was held in Denver, Colorado, November 30-December 1, 1961. Its purpose was to discuss the problem of the out-of-state student in the public colleges and universities of thirteen western states. Mrs. Lomen represented Alaska at the meeting. The findings of the conference will be widely circulated on publication. Mrs. Lomen was president of the Seattle Alum= Club in 1953 and is a former chairman of the Alumnae Advisory Board of Washington Alpha. She is the mother of three children: Gilbert, 16, Julie, 12, and James, 1. ot. Wiesbaden continues to be a residential town and international health resort, but many buildings have gone up in recent years adding a note of modernity to the city. Last summer a Missouri Beta Pi Phi accompanied her husband to a new assignment in Europe. She was Wilda Van Gieson Landon and her husband is General Truman H. Landon, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Air Forces in Europe. In the fall she responded to the request of Grand President Alice Weber Mansfield that she write some of her impressions for the ARROW. She wrote "Among the most pleasant assignments in our Air Force career was the one that brought General Lan-don and me back to Wiesbaden, Germany, in July of this year. "Of course, each new assignment brings new friendships, but in Wiesbaden there was the added delight of meeting old friends. Although nearly eight years have passed since we left Germany for Washington, D.C., in August 1953, there were many especially among our German friends who re-membered us and who helped to make our return a homecoming. "Wiesbaden itself has changed. The remnants of bombed and broken buildings which one still saw here and there in Wiesbaden in 1953 have disappeared and many new and very modern buildings have been built. The charm of the city has remained. There is still an easy gracefulness about the city in the many lovely parks and on broad promenades of the fashionable Wilhelmstrasse. "The USAFE command covers a broad area: England, France, Germany, and Spain, then east along both shores of the Mediterranean as far as Saudi Arabia. General Landon's duties have taken him to many parts of the area. I have been able to join him on trips in Germany and to England, France, and Spain. Soon I hope to visit Italy, Turkey, and Greece. "My husband's responsibilities also include those of a NATO organization, the Fourth Allied Tactical A Return to Wiesbaden Air Force, consisting of Canadian, French, German, and US air force units. His duties take us very often to Ramstein, Germany, where this command has its headquarters, located near the world-famous "Wein Strasse." "The visit to Ramstein provide me with wonderful opportunities to meet with the families of German, French, and Canadian personnel who, along with the American Air Force personnel, form a truly international community there. There, too, each national group takes pride in displaying its customs and manner of doing. "I find the wives of our US Air Force personnel keenly aware of the importance of the role which they play in creating a favorable image of our country in their contacts overseas. "Outside of London, at South Ruislip, the head-quarters of the Third Air Force in Paris at NATO headquarters ; at Torrejon Air Base, near Madrid, the headquarters of the 65th Air Division ; every-where I travelled, I met American wives and families who are ably representing America in their frequent contacts with the communities in which they live. "These women will return home with a greater understanding of international affairs and will certainly help to give their children the background for leadership which comes from an understanding of the world outside our own country. "Being abroad is a stimulating experience for all of us, and if the responsibilities are great, so are the satisfactions. The world is growing constantly smaller. The need to know 'and understand our neighbors was never greater." General and Mrs. Landon welcome the secretary of the Air Force, Eugene M. Zuckert, on his arrival at Wiesbaden. flewo rom J)j11/e /0ieon Edited by Helen Boucher Dix, Ohio B Long History of Mountain Weaving Represented at Craftsman's Fair by Sutton From "kiverlids" to ponchos, the history of mountain weaving was represented in the Arrowcraft Shop exhibit at the Craftsman's Fair in Gatlinburg, October 24-28, 1961. Mountain woman's skill and adaptability was on display in the handsome sweaters and ponchos she has created for the skiers who will come to Gatlin-burg for the first time this year. Most of the weavers who made the ponchos, modelled by Betty Sipe, Gatlinburg a Ski Club hostess, have never seen a skier in costume, but they can follow any pattern whether for a placement, or a stole to wear after skiing. Miss Winogene Redding, Arrowcraft Shop weaving designer, says the adaptation to winter sports Christian attire is but one phase of a long history in Gatlin-burg weaving. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, established in 1912, has sustained the tradition of weaving in this area and that has been the core of revival of all handicrafts. In its awakening of interest in the crafts the school had the help of Aunt Lizzie Reagan, who worked at an ancient loom until she died in 1926 at the age of eighty-seven, and the versatile craftsman, Aunt Lydia Whaley. The two women taught their neighbors, many of whom required only refresher courses in spinning and weaving, and the school found a ready market for the products through the widely scattered Pi Beta Phi chapters and alumnae clubs. IT'S TRADITIONAL Craftsmanship is traditional for those dedicated artisans who weave for Arrowcraft. Here Izora Keener, tenter, whose weaving covers 40 years, Jean Carter, left, who comes from a family of 16 weavers, and Winogene Red-ding, Arrowcraft Shop weaving designer for 20 years give their approval to finished products. 23 24 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Miss Redding, a native of Wollaston, Massachusetts, arrived at the Settlement School in 1925 to direct the weaving operations and to design patterns to meet modern demands. At about the same time Arrowcraft Shop was established to provide the market, both locally and nationally. Today Arrowcraft employs seventy-five weavers on a year-around basis. They own their looms and do their weaving in their leisure time at home. Arrow-craft supplies the threads and yarns and supervises and directs the work. The oldest weaver is Mrs. Mollie Moore, eighty years old. She has several daughters who weave for the shop. Mrs. Izora Keener, who started working for Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in 1921, has the longest record of employment. Mrs. Laura Watson heads the largest family of weavers. Joining her in the craft are four daughters, six daughters-in-law, and four granddaughters. Among the hundreds of patterns in Arrowcraft weaving the most popular continues to be the traditional Whig Rose, which was adapted to a lunch-eon mat that has been sold in great quantity. Under Miss Redding's direction the Arrowcraft weavers make not only traditional but contemporary weavings in tweeds, bags, luncheon mats, stoles, blankets, aprons, and yardage. The roster of weavers includes hundreds of local women, many of whom have started their own business and prospered with the growth of the tourist industry. In the early years of the program weaving was taught in the high school and is now a part of the Arts and Crafts classes. There are approximately 1,000 looms in the Gatlinburg area. Thus, weaving is the most important of local handicrafts, and probably no other area in America has greater claim to importance as a hand weaving center. About twenty-five years ago the Arrowcraft Weavers organized a Guild, and under Miss Redding's direction sponsored the Gatlinburg Garden Club in 1937. The club, open to both Guild members as well as interested women in the community, held annual flower shows in the school. Although she came to Gatlinburg thirty-six years ago, Miss Redding has not worked continuously for Arrowcraft. In her first period of employment she rode horseback to homes of weavers living in re-mote sections. She taught weaving in Norris, Ten Miss Betty Sipe, Gatlinburg Ski Club hostess and professional model, poses in Arrowcraft's handwoven "poncho" to demonstrate its happy blend with ski pants. This picture was used in connection with publicity for the Craftsman's Fair in October, 1961. nessee, under the TVA program in 1934-35. In 1948 she opened her own studio in Wollaston, Massachusetts, where, in addition to teaching weaving, she authored and published REDDIGRAPHS for WEAVERS, a series of designs that had international circulation. She taught weaving in summer schools in Mason, New Hampshire, Natchitoches, Louisiana, and at Pi Beta Phi (school) before returning to Arrowcraft as weaving designer in 1958. She became a member of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild during its pioneer days, and she has served the organization in many capacities. She is presently chairman of the jury on standards and is president of the Tennessee unit of the Guild. (From The Gatlinburg Press, Oct. 12, 1961). The Albuquerque Alumnae Club is providing a scholarship to the Summer Craft Workshop this year. SETTLEMENT SCHOOL ANNOUNCEMENTS,.
