In many ways the responsibility for its permanence and success rests with today's active chapter members. These young Pi Phis are members of a generation that has been too often misjudged because of the excesses of its vocal malcontents. There is solid and heartening evidence that today's children of affluence are not children of indifference in relation to the needs of their fellows. Indeed, there is much dedication on their part as individuals and accomplishment as a result of their group efforts to demonstrate their deep feeling of commitment to the ideal in the area of human relationships. In the hope that it might help them coalesce their thinking about this new project to set down their views on it and their work for it, they were asked to discuss those thoughts for Fraternity Forum. Once again the young women of Pi Beta Phi have given their sisters cause for pride and confidence with their grasp of the realities and their vision of the ideal as they view the challenge of the new national philanthropy of their Fraternity, which a Cornell Pi Phi has described as a "catalyst for creativity in society." 63 [cat etmtt JOtcutivi 64 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Fulfilling Our Ambitions VERMONT ALPHA The Pi Beta Phi philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, is one which we, of the Vermont Alpha Chapter, feel personifies the backbone of the fraternity as a whole and is one which, in today's world, is part of the universal struggle for peace through assistance in helping ourselves fulfill our ambitions. If each one of us were to feel as if he or she were contributing to the world as a whole, even in the most minute detail, we would at least be satisfying one of our basic inner needs: to feel useful. Arrow in the Smokies fulfills this aspect in many people who not only are contributing factors to the establishment but who are also helping others to be so involved. Through this philanthropy we are providing an outlet for the enjoyment and skill of the surrounding people, as well as maintaining an important part of the American culture. But this "creative institution" has by no means achieved its highest potential. There is much more than can be done .and should be done, not only in our national philanthropy at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, but also in each chapter's individual philanthropy project. By developing and improving the Arrow settlement in Gatlinburg we will maintain a little of our heritage as well as supporting a living memorial. Similarly, in each individual chap-ter philanthropy, the members can find fulfillment outside of their campus or college life and assist the community at the same time. Although these philanthropies will vary, it is hoped that they will uphold the idea that not only are we helping ourselves, but also others. ANN MILLER Fine Way to Start MAINE ALPHA We at Maine Alpha are very pleased with the new extension that is to be added to the Summer Craft Workshop. We feel that this new project, located on the property of our Settlement School is a fine way to start off Pi Phi's second hundred years. We intend to make this dream of a new Arrow in the Smokies come true by giving as much support as we can. For many years Maine Alphas have been raising money for our national philanthropy in various ways. This fall we had our muu-muu and candied apple. sales, and very shortly we will be having our annual arrowcraft sale sale. The arrowcraft sale is held in our Student Union Building and is very well received by the Maine students. As well as making money by this sale we are also publicizing our Settlement School and Arrowcraft Shop. We are very fortunate in having a number of alumni in the area and these sales help to keep them informed of what is happening in our national philanthropy. Philanthropies are very important to Maine Alphas. Our present local philanthropy is an Opportunity Center for mentally retarded children. The children at the Opportunity Center greatly appreciate the parties and dances which we have for them on special occasions. On the local level we also assist the fraternities with their Christmas parties for orphan children and many of us are involved in the Companion Programwhere we spend a few hours a week with a little girl or boy from one of the surrounding towns. The Maine Alphas hope and will try their best to make Arrow in the Smokies a success. BECKY HALL "Arrow in the Arctic" ONTARIO ALPHA Since the success of the "Arrow in the Smokies" has been, recognized in full measure, the Ontario Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi felt that an article on the "Arrow in the Arctic" might be of added interest to the other chapters of Pi Beta Phi; particularly the chapters in the United States, who perhaps do not know what its specific aims and purposes are. So, perhaps we can acquaint them, with a few facts relating to what we believe to be, a progressive project in the realm of philanthropy here in Canada. The idea for the new Canadian Project was put forth by the Vancouver Alumnae Club. Their suggestion was that all the Canadian Alumni Clubs and Active Chapters annual contributions towards the buying of books for the library at Whitehorse in the Yukon, and the library at Hay River in the Northwest Territories. These libraries are being developed by the Canadian government, but needless to say, contributions are not only greatly needed but most appreciated. The librarians in charge of these two libraries have been authorized to purchase the books which will be most beneficial for educational purposes, with our contributions. We would hope that the American Chapters of Pi Beta Phi would recognize the value of our Canadian Project. We feel that the possibilities for enlarging our plans for philanthropy in this area are unlimited. Therefore, we would suggest that you might like to extend your assistance to us so that we may unite in our efforts to bring our project the success that we have made together at Gatlinburg. New Avenues for Growth CONNECTICUT ALPHA It is a truism that the educated man leads the richest life. He understands and appreciates the world around him. He is economically and intellectually independent. Thirteen years ago, it seems these beliefs were uppermost in Phi Phi's minds as they envisioned the Centennial Project, "Arrow in the Smokies." Since the new institution is fully accredited by the University of Tennessee and will run on a year round basis, individuals who be-fore could not attend the University for economic or other reasons may be able to enjoy the privilege of these courses in craft design. The establishment of such an institution opens up countless avenues for the growth and development of craft education. In the years to come, Gatlinburg may be a spot for conventions, seminar courses, and workshops in teacher-education for arts and crafts as well as professional training. Beside supporting Pi Phi's philanthropic endeavors through Magazine Agency orders, Arrowcraft sales, and Arrowcraft displays, Connecticut Alpha has other plans for supporting "Arrow in the Smokies," per THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI 65 haps the most promising of all Pi Phi projects. Each year, at the traditional Settlement School Dinner, all the sisters dress in "mountain duds" and enjoy fried chicken and corn on the cob Gatlinburg style. This year, the tips given the waitresses will be donated to "Arrow in the Smokies." After dinner, thanks to a joint effort on the part of the Program ,and Philanthropies Chairmen, the "hilly billy" sisters will be invited to an Arrowcraft Sale and a showing of slides about "Arrow in the Smokies." In addition to supporting the fraternity's national projects, Connecticut Alpha Chapter's philanthropic ideals are manifested in two local, projects: trips to the Mansfield Connecticut State School where sisters visit patients, and a foster child in Greece who is sup-ported through the chapter's friendship and contributions. GERALDINE ZORN Yankee Hernando's Hideaway VERMONT BETA Our national philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, needs no explanation for any Pi Phi. Each and every one of us realizes the importance of this national altruistic project and the opportunities it offers to others to help themselves through the Craft Workshop. Pi Beta Phi should be proud that it was the originator of a philanthropy which is not only a Craft Workshop, but also a market for the wares of weavers and craftsmen in the area. Vermont Beta donates each year to the Settlement School Fund, raising the money in numerous ways. Our main fund raising project is held each year on a Sunday in November and is entitled "Hernando's Hideaway." It is a spaghetti supper, served in "Hide-away" atmosphere, with live entertainment provided. This Pi Phi project has become a tradition on campus, and the number of people attending has increased so much each year that we are now holding three complete sittings! Our local philanthropy is the Vermont Heart Association for which we also raise funds, in what we feel is an enjoyable way. At the University of Vermont Homecoming Game, the Pi Phi's sponsor a candy apple sale with homemade apples. This has proved to be an extremely popular project, with the profits in-creasing each year. Whether working on Hernando's Hideaway, making or selling candied apples or giving volunteer time to the American Red Cross or the Tuberculosis Association, the sisters of Vermont Beta manage to stay busy giving of themselves but also realizing the satisfaction that comes from this giving. JANET STEFF Arrowcraft Kits for Sale! MASSACHUSETTS BETA The "Arrow in the Smokies" is a very real part of the lives of the girls of Massachusetts Beta. From our earliest days of pledging we are made aware of our purpose as Pi Phis. We are not merely a group of girls banded together for social aims, nor are we united solely to share in the sisterhood experience. This of course is a part of it. However, there is a very tangible reason for our belonging to a fraternity that of philanthropy. The Settlement School in Gatlinburg is a project dear to our hearts, for in maintaining this center, we have a genuine opportunity to help others. We can take pride in the fact that because of the aid of so many hundreds of Pi Phis, this school was established and has been maintained for more than half a century. Its handicrafts are known to be some of the best in the world. Our reward is the gratitude of those who are benefited by this center. This year, to do our share in promoting the "Arrow in the Smokies," we have sent for a sample kit from Arrowcraft which will contain various items of their handiwork. Committees are being set up for the general organization of the sale which will be held in November. The publicity committee will set to work on informing other members of the Greek system as well as non-Greeks all over campus of the sale. These crafts will make ideal Christmas gifts. The future of the Settlement School looks indeed bright. Pi Phi membership is forever increasing, and with new members come new ideas, new initiative. Those illustrious Pi Phis who established the Settlement School so many years ago aimed their arrows high, thus setting the pace for those who were to follow. Helping Others NEW YORK GAMMA Our centennial philanthropic project, "Arrow in the Smokies" shows Pi Beta Phi to be a mature organization capable of sup-porting itself and helping others. Our second hundred years will be typified by service in the education of the arts. We can be proud that we are mature enough to meet the challenge of educating others through our own desire to give. The accrediting of the Craft Center by the University of Tennesseee is perhaps the best indicator of outside trust in Pi Beta Phi. We are to be held responsible for the educating of many in the arts and crafts beyond the manipulation of materials. Those studying the arts and crafts will be able to express themselves in their media as well as accumulate credits. Only in a mature, responsible and respected organization would this be entrusted. We can be sure that Arrow in the Smokies will be a high water mark in the area of philanthropy. Since it is structured in such a way that no area of administration is left untouched, we can be assured that the inner workings of the project are well cared for. Our experience in the handling of the Arrowcraft work-shop will prove to be the starting point for this new project. We will be able to enlarge previous projects into a new one which will encorporate solid administration coordinated with the workings of the Craft Center. Helping others to help themselves is perhaps one of the most challenging of all problems today and is being faced by orders higher than our own fraternity. If we are to find our place in this endeavor, we must give. This is the keyword of "Arrow in the Smokies." The Settlement School in now matured. From here we 66 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI must work toward a new goal that of .a concentrated interest in the arts and craft education, in order to actualize the experience gained from previous projects. ROZANNE FARKAS Catalyst for Creativity in Society NEW YORK DELTA With the popularity today of such service projects as the Peace Corps and Vista, Pi Phis throughout the world can reflect with pride on the foresight of their older sisters. For the appearance of those indomitable wearers of the Arrow in Gatlinburg over five decades ago shows that Pi Beta Phi had al-ready penetrated a new frontier to fight for the betterment of their fellow man. Present day Gatlinburg clearly testifies to the tremendous success of our mission, but poses a new challenge as well: to project Gatlinburg beyond complacent prosperity toward being a catalyst for further creativity within the society. The gradual development of the Arts and Crafts Center illustrates Pi Beta Phi's belief that creativity springs from the individual; personal expression and satisfaction constitute the highest and ultimate good of crafts. In that way our Centennial Project, by expanding the opportunities for people of all ages and conditions to partake of the program, will exert an even greater regenerating influence on every individual. However, our project in the Smokies has also come to enjoy world-wide prestige and our new, ambitious program should inspire other craft centers to follow our pioneering step. Finally, our new institution will allow even more people the joy of viewing and possessing these crafts from the Smokies, intimately linking those distant consumers with the creative inspiration that forged the Arrow in the Smokies. As a chapter and as individuals the members of New York Delta are concerned about and interested in helping others when they most need it. The pledge training program is concerned with developing in each individual an interest not only specifically in Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic projects but also in developing an attitude of caring about the community in general which will be maintained throughout her life. A Settlement School Tea and Sale was planned in October to raise money for the Settlement School for the Arrow in the Smokies project. Christmas Orphan Party OHIO ALPHA Ohio Alpha has thought it would be a grand experience for an Ohio Alpha art major to be awarded a scholarship to the summer workshop each year. This would be sponsored in some way by Ohio Alpha. These girls would not only get training in their major, but they would be able to provide us with invaluable information concerning Settlement School as a whole. She could receive college credit at the same time. Another idea, although perhaps not as feasible, is that Pi Phi Art majors from various chapters be hired as Summer School instructors. They would be paid enough to cover their expenses, but not so much that it would be a profitable summer money-wise. Theywould get so much practical experience that the intangible rewards would be irreplaceable. Our chapter has two local philanthropic projects each year. One is an annual Christmas Orphan Party co-sponsored with the Sigma Chis. The other changes each year. This year it will be participation in the local UNICEF drive. We also sell within our own chapter some original Pi Phi Angel stationery de-signed by one of our girls. The profits from this go into our building fund for the new house. If some-thing like this were to be instituted throughout all the chapters, the proceeds could pay for a new National Arrow of the Smokies Scholarship. NANCY KINNISON Recognition of a Need OHIO BETA From the very beginning one hundred years ago, when our twelve founders bought coal and paid the rent for a Monmouth family who was unable to support itself, Pi Beta Phi has been actively involved in serving others. In 1912 we rose to a great educational need in an isolated community on the fringe of the Smoky Mountains. The original purpose was to reach the 3R's and to give special emphasis to industrial and agricultural training. This philanthropic effort has expanded over the years and has been a boom to Gatlinburg. But time moves on and needs change. As Pi Beta Phi stands on the threshold of its second century, it glances back only for encouragement from those who have gone before, then steps forward to meet a new, challenging, contemporary problem. A year-round Craft Workshop will offer professional instruction to those people who will then teach the skills to handicapped people the blind, the deaf, the elderly, the mentally retarded, and so forth. These are individuals of all age groups who have been untrained, unable to work, and financially dependent. This endeavor holds a maximum potential for service in our nation. With new skills of sewing, knitting, metal work, pottery, rug weaving, craft design, enameling, jewelry making, etc., these previously handicapped people can feel useful and contributive. It would be so easy in our rapidly changing, technologically-oriented society for these people to be for-gotten. But Pi Beta Phi has recognized the need and has devoted its time and money to this cause. (Two Ohio Beta girls will benefit from the Harriet Rutherford Johnstone Scholarship: Barbara Morrison and Kay Pattison. Opportunity for Service OHIO ZETA Our days at Ohio Zeta are busy, active ones. As sisters we participate together in all phases of fraternity life. We enjoy the pleasant seclusion of our own chapter, and its close bonds create a place apart for us. And yet, our hearts and hopes reach far beyond this secluded realm; we direct our thoughts not only inward, to one another, but also consistently upward and outward to identify with the vastness and pervasiveness of Pi Beta Phi and with the always new aspirings of our fraternity. It is with great pride and high hopes that we now THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 67 view these aspirings embodied so finely in the establishment of our sisterhood's newest philanthropy, "Arrow in the Smokies." We see "Arrow in the Smokies" as an opportunity for service unequalled even in our meritorious past. It holds a great potential for even bigger and better results than those achieved so effectively thus far. Because "Arrow in the Smokies" has been designed as a step beyond, though one highly coordinated with, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, we see its possibilities for effectiveness as greatly enhanced. Hopefully, it will be nurtured into an institution much like its forerunner but one which offers even more of the possibilities for creativity and craftsmanship and for aiding and yielding of ourselves for others. Arrowcraft Sales Lend Support D.C. ALPHA This year being our Centennial Year, the Pi Phis of the District of Columbia Alpha chapter want to lend total support to our national philanthropy, Settlement School. Through magazine sales and Arrowcraft sales we hope to make a contribution that will help Settlement School accomplish as much as it has since 1912 in Pi Beta Phi's next one hundred years. Helping others help themselves leaves a warm feeling in the hearts of the members of D.C. Alpha chapter and of Pi Phis around the world. MADELEINE WALKER Soundless Opportunity for Expansion VIRGINIA GAMMA The Pi Beta Phi philanthropy in Gatlinburg, Tennessee has snow-balled from its modest beginnings in 1910 as a memorial to the Pi Phi founders to a major source of education for people from this mountain area. Gatlinburg was chosen as the site for the sorority project because of the enormous education and health needs of the people. The school, opened in 1912 with 13 pupils, now has become an integral part of the Tennessee education system, and the number of students has increased many times. Also a part of the Pi Phi philanthropy is the Arrow Craft Shop. In 1945 the Summer Craft Workshop in conjunction with the University of Tennessee was given birth and is currently serving people from all over the world. If one looks at the value of our philanthropy, he is bound to recognize its infinite worth and nearly boundless possibilities for even further expansion. Supporting the latter part of this statement is the fact that the Tennessee education system has taken over a great deal of responsibility for the school, and consequently has given the Pi Phis more time for its Arrow Craft Shop, and for expanding into other services. It appears to the Virginia Gammas that the Arrow in the Smokies will continue to offer expanding realities as long as interest is shown; and as long as there is a need for something, the Pi Phis will strive to make it available. DONNA GORMAN Working with Special Groups VIRGINIA DELTA For over fifty years, the words Pi Beta Phi have meant to countless people the Settle ment School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. These words have meant friendship and assistance. Now with the celebration of Pi Beta Phi's Centennial, the character of the Pi Beta Phi philanthropy is changing its goals after long years, and is directing its energy toward an expanding Craft Shop. With the discontinuation of the Settlement School, the future of the "new" Arrowcraft Shop is one of unlimited opportunity. The Arrowcraft Shop is being expanded with the long-range idea that it will become a center of study and from which people can build outward. The programs planned for this year are quite ambitious, but it is the thought of future years that really excites the imagination! The study programs for this year include courses for amateurs, undergraduate and graduate students, teachers, designer craftsmen, volunteer leaders, and many more. However, it is in working with special groups, such as the handicapped, the aged, the under-privileged, the chronically ill, and the mentally retarded, that Pi Beta Phi as a philanthropy can do the greatest good. The thought of those children who are handicapped, or an old man who no longer feels useful to himself or society, being able to express themselves and to produce an item that they have created and that is recognized as being worthwhile, is thrilling. It is the idea of this kind of help and assistance that the ideals of Pi Beta Phi have always encouraged and advocated. CHRIS DAVIS Spaghetti Supper Support WEST VIRGINIA ALPHA Our chapter was in-formed of "Arrow in the Smokies" in full scope when our convention delegates gave their reports this fall. Every member thinks it is a fantastic idea. One hundred years is a long time to celebrate and we feel that starting a project like "Arrow in the Smokies" is the biggest way that all Pi Phis could celebrate. On the house tours during Rush the chapter always has one room reserved for explanation of our philanthropies. None of our members are using a fraternity scholarship at the present moment. The chapter has decided to start its own loan fund, however. Once a month it is going to have a spaghetti dinner to raise money. Anyone may come to it and all the chapter members help with this dinner in some way. $100.00 was cleared on the first dinner and I feel this will increase with publicity. Hopefully, we will be able to use some of this money to help with the "Arrow in the Smokies" project. MARCIA PUFFENBERGER Avenue for Concern NORTH CAROLINA BETA The expansion of Pi Beta Phi's national philanthropy, the Settlement School, through the Arrow in the Smokies, has heightened the interest of North Carolina Beta chap-ter. One of the distinct advantages of any organization is its potential service; and one of the bonds that holds the members of Pi Beta Phi together is concern 68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI for others. Arrow in the Smokies provides an excel-lent opportunity to take advantage of this concern. North Carolina Beta is planning an activity which will both promote good public relations and provide financial support for the new addition. An auction will be held for a fraternity wherein members of the chapter will be auctioned off. The highest bidder of each Pi Phi will have access to her services for a Saturday afternoon. She promises to wash his car, iron his shirts, or other tasks assigned to her. A bake sale will be held during the auction, and all proceeds will go to the Arrow in the Smokies. Local philanthropic projects have received increasing interest also. In past years the chapter has provided Thanksgiving baskets for needy families; given a Christmas party with a fraternity for orphans in the area; and the pledge class gave a party for some men-tally retarded children. This year two new projects have been added. Growing concern for the impoverished areas of the community surrounding the campus, with particular regard to the children, has resulted in a new program to help them. Each week a group of about fifteen children is brought to the campus. They meet with several Pi Phi's to learn about a variety of subjects. One week flowers were discussed, followed by a tour of the Duke gardens. Another week drama was explained, and the children produced their own play. As the year progresses it is hoped that the two groups will grow close together and personal relationships can be fostered. An additional Christmas project is also being planned. The Salvation Army provides dolls if volunteers will "dress" them. Each member can make an outfit during a regular meeting time, since the materials will be organized beforehand by the Philanthropies Chairmen. It is hoped that the project will both bring increased unity to the group, and be beneficial to the community. There has been an increasing amount of controversy on our campus concerning the worth of women's fraternities. A great deal of the value of Pi Beta Phi to its members is very personal and intangible. Philanthropies, both on the national and local level, are a vital factor in promoting good relations, as well as providing a meaningful involvement on the part of the participants. The expansion of Pi Beta Phi's existing philanthropy speaks for its success in the preceding years. North 'Carolina Beta is striving to make the next one hundred years even more meaningful. Monument to All Pi Phis SOUTH CAROLINA ALPHA Probably the first thing a Pi Phi learns is to be proud of her sorority, for Pi Phi has so many firsts to be proud of. One of these is being the first national sorority to create a philanthropic project. And almost as important as its being a first is the fact that as Pi Phis we all share the same goal in keeping our philanthropy going. In the Smokies one can see this project in real life. As close as our chapter is to Tennessee, the Smokies project is more than just a passing thought. Here we are provided an opportunity to see the project first hand. The Settlement School itself stands apart fromthe ever growing resort town and stands as a welcome and monument to all Pi Phis. There is a great future in our Settlement School now that its groundwork has been laid. The position of the school is ideal to reach out and grasp the en-tire area where people still need greater education facilities and training in skills. The school also can renew hope for reviving interest in the hand crafts. This chapter hopes that the Settlement School will continue to grow and tie the bonds of friendship not only to other Pi Phi sisters but to those who need help and faith. LINDA COULL Cultural and Economic Growth MICHIGAN DELTA Michigan Delta sees a great future for the Ri Beta Phi philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, both as a potentiality for service and as a creative institution. As a potential for service it will greatly benefit the people of the area by creating more jobs and by giving them the opportunity to improve their lives, both economically and culturally. By expanding the Arts and Crafts Center, there will be a greater opportunity for the people to express and develop their talents and skills in the arts and crafts. In addition to benefiting the local people, the expanded Center will be a great experience for art students, prospective teachers and any persons who are interested in art. The Arts and Crafts Center will greatly aid the economic condition of Gatlinburg and will bring in more business for the local craftsmen. To help bring about the dream of Arrow in the Smokies, Michigan Delta has had two Settlement School Sales, both of which were quite successful. One was held by the chapter in late Spring and the other was held by the Alumni Club in early November. In past years Michigan Delta has worked with needy children of the community. Last year the chap-ter adopted a family and also did work with a Catholic school. In addition to this, the chapter made tray favors for the local hospital. The chapter is still working with all three of these local philanthropies. JANE GRONBACK Christmas Village TENNESSEE BETA Tennessee Beta Pi Phis have been eagerly anticipating, and busily preparing for, Christmas Village. Sponsored by the Nashville Alumnae Club, Christmas village is held annually in mid-November at the Hippodrome in Nashville. Many local merchants set up booths at which their merchandise ranging from toys to plum puddings to sportswear is displayed and sold. The Arrowcraft Shop, too, has a booth at which its craftwork can be either bought or ordered. The proceeds from Christmas Village are donated to the Bill Wilkerson Speech and Hearing Center in Nashville. This year, Tennessee Beta Pi Phis decided to make and sell our own handiwork. The chapter was divided into four teams, to add an element of competition, and during the summer each Pi Phi made approximately ten "somethings" of her own choice. Thus the opportunity for originality and creativity was un THE ARROW OF Pt BETA PHI 69 bounded. This fall the response was amazing as we viewed the items which had been made during the summer, and discovered all sorts of "hidden" talent within the chapter. The items included such things as hand-painted waste baskets, felt Christmas stockings, covered match boxes, needlepoint calendars, crocheted coat hanger covers, hand-painted lap boards for studying, hairbows, antiqued card boxes and letter boxes, aprons, Christmas decorations, roller bags, hand-decorated stationery, pine cone flowers, and many, many more. JULIE MCGEHEE New Enthusiasm from Convention NORTH CAROLINA ALPHA Our convention delegate, in her report of the convention activities, enthusiastically spoke of the exhibit from the craft shop. She was able to give our chapter a better idea of the type and quality of work resulting from the Settlement School training. She was extremely impressed with the handicrafts and the obviously superior training that made them a possibility. Her enthusiasm stimulated the desire in all of us to perhaps make a trip as a group to see this craft work in Gatlinburg. The chapter plans to continue its magazine sale and hopefully do our share to help this beneficial and successful project expand even more rapidly in the future than it has in the past. We feel very proud to have been small contributors to a project so worthwhile. On our campus we will bear the meal and activity expense of a foreign exchange student this year. We also plan to sponsor a picnic for all undergraduate foreign students. KAREN DAVIS Development of Individual Skills INDIANA ALPHA In the early history of the quite serene Smoky Mountains, the tall proud evergreens stretch to reach the sun, the source of their life. The early mountain folk also had to look to the sun for their lives. They were farmers whose existence depended on the sun giving life to their crops. In 1912, Pi Beta Phi introduced a new light in their lives. The Settlement School was established in a valley high in the Smoky Mountains of Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The Settlement School acted like a sun in the development of the individual skills which the people of the mountains have. The Settlement School will be celebrating it's 56th. Anniversary this year, March 1968. Members of Indiana Alpha are proud of Emma Harper Turner, one of our founders, the Washington, D.C. Alpha Chapter and the Alumnae Club delegates from Washington, D.C. for initiating the idea of the Settlement School at the 1910 Convention. Just as the 111 colleges and universities, which house Pi Beta Phi Chapters, have given her members the opportunity to express their talents and skills, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School has given hundreds of people the opportunity to express their talents for making crafts. BETTE RICHARDSONFrom Abstraction to Reality INDIANA ZETA When the Indiana Zeta Pi Phi Chapter held its fifteenth anniversary luncheon this fall, the members were surprised and very pleased to find an-owcraft workshop samples on display. Until that day, the Arrow in the Smokies had been merely a vague abstraction in the minds of most of us. We had not realized that the skill and craftsmanship of those at the Arrow in the Smokies could result in such a variety of beautiful creations. Among the other activities ,at our anniversary luncheon, the Arrowcraft display renewed inspiration and pride in our national fraternity. Perhaps the awareness of and pride in our Pi Beta Phi philanthropy is part of that special quality Pi Phis all over the country seem to possess. As college women, it seems so very appropriate that we sponsor a project which does so very much to promote industry and creativity. All over the country Pi Phis can wear the golden arrow with special pride, not only as a symbol of our sisterhood, but also as a reminder of our philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. JANIS TRUSTY Gatlinburg Houseparty TENNESSEE GAMMA The members of the Tennessee Gamma chapter of Pi Beta Phi, feel most definitely that Arrow in the Smokies will become a reality. The success of our 'altruistic project of our first 100 years, the Settlement School, exemplifies the interest and effort of Pi Beta Phi's around the world. Our centennial project, the Art and Craft Center, will continue the Settlement School purpose of helping others to help themselves. Since our chapter at the University of Tennessee is the closest chapter to Gatlinburg, being only 40 miles away, we feel closely connected with the philanthropic projects of Pi Phi. Our chapter's "house party" is annually held in Gatlinburg and the pledges are given a tour of the Settlement School and Craft facilities. The Arrowcraft Shop is visited and utilized regularly by members of our chapter. The chapter has purchased an entire display of crafts from the Arrowcraft Shop to use during Fall Open House and at other times when our chapter suite is opened to visitors. Each year crafts from the shop are sold at a Christmas Bazaar in which all seventeen sororities on the University of Tennessee campus participate. We hope that in the future our chapter may help the Arrowcraft Shop in the distribution of crafts to active chapters and Alumnae Clubs across the nation and in Canada. The co-sponsorship of the Summer Craft Workshop by the University of Tennessee shows the interest of those outside the sorority in making the Pi Phi dream come true. We feel that through the utilization of facilities now in. Gatlinburg and through gifts and contributions, the Pi Phi Dream, Arrow in the Smokies, will become a center of craft development unequalled by any other. MARGARET S. YOUNG 70 THE ARROW OF N BETA PHI Pride from Proximity TENNESSEE DELTA Tennessee Delta takes special pride in our new Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, since it is located in our own state. By expanding the present accredited summer craft work-shop, adding new buildings and staff members, and maintaining the school on a year round basis, we feel that we will be giving others an opportunity for education and a fuller development of their talents in our second century of achievement. It is our hope that students will come to perfect their arts and crafts for use in rehabilitation, in teaching home economics and the mentally retarded. We give our support to this new project by asking both our members and pledges to purchase two magazines from the Pi Beta Phi magazine agency. Because we are near Gatlinburg, many of our members have had the privilege of visiting the Arrowcraft Shop. They have brought back to our chapter unique objects designed there, thus stimulating a genuine interest for some of our more talented members to attend the sessions. Our main philanthropic project last year was the adoption of a group of officers in Viet Nam. During the year we corresponded with them and sent them goodies and care packages. Projects for this fall include providing Thanksgiving baskets for needy families and Christmas gifts for underprivileged children and visiting an old folks home twice a week. We also support the Maternal Welfare League of Memphis, which is devoted to research in birth defects. We are indeed proud to make Pi Beta Phi a pioneer in its second century in a great philanthropy Arrow in the Smokies. SUSAN FEATHERSTON A Major Responsibility ALABAMA BETA "Airow in the Smokies" is our major responsibility now and in the future. We hope that our contribution will help bring this dream to a reality for Pi Phis and those who will benefit from the Arrow in the Smokies. The future of this project depends on the backing of the individual chapters. We plan to inform every member of the importance of this project and how each person can help. Our philanthropies chairman and program chairman have been working together to present several programs on the Arrow in the Smokies. Our chapter is very limited in ways of making money on campus, because of University rules against fund-raising events. Candy selling by the pledges in the spring is our only big fund-raising event. Of course the actives contribute a great deal to this project, too. Our main way of collecting funds is through individual contributions and these go to the Centennial Fund and the Settlement School. Even though we are limited in our ways of making money, we still take a great deal of pride in our philanthropies pro-gram. For our local philanthropy, we have several different projects for the year. Through the we sponsor a child of a needy family who receives guid-ance and care through a well-organized program. During Christmas, we help a fraternity give a Santa Claus party for children from the welfare department. This can be one of the most rewarding experiences to see the smiling faces of these children. Also the pledges give a party and presents to the mentally retarded children at Partlow's. Through these projects, Alabama Beta plans to con-tribute their time and efforts to our local philanthropies as well as to the "Arrow in the Smokies". JUDY LORD Contribution to Happiness and Independence ALABAMA GAMMA Of education, Abraham Lincoln said, . . . "I can only say that 'I view it as the most important subject that we as a people can be en-gaged in. . . ." With our new project, Arrow in the Smokies, Pi Beta Phi is engaging in the "important subject" of education. Our approach, however, is not the traditional readin', writin' and 'rithmetic one. By educating our senior citizens and the handicapped in the use of their talents, Arrow in the Smokies will open the door to a more useful and satisfying life for them. Alabama Gamma looks on Arrow in the Smokies as a way for each of us to contribute to the happiness and independence of others less fortunate than we. We are very enthusiastic about this new project and plan to support it wholeheartedly with our contributions. We are proud that Pi Beta Phi is pioneering yet another worthy and needed philanthropy. The Arrow in the Smokies will gleam brightly as it points upward the goal of a more full and rich life not only for those benefiting by the project, but also for those of us who will help to make it a success. MARGARET-ANNE HESTER All Out Support FLORIDA GAMMA In this the 100th year of Pi Beta Phi, Florida Gamma hopes to do everything it can to support the fraternity's Centennial project. The project, which is a Craft Workshop to be built in co-operation with the University of Tennessee, will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. The workshop will be located in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. We understand that the goal of this project is that it will become the outstanding center of education in the field of arts and crafts, drawing students from the United States, Canada and foreign nations instead of being limited to the local area. We realize that this project is quite an undertaking and that it cannot go on until the required funds are raised and made avail-able. One very successful fund raising project has already been accomplished by the girls of Florida Gamma. We put on a "Mister Legs Contest" one night in the school cafeteria. After a short speech by one of the girls about the Settlement School and the Centennial project and about just where the money would be THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 71 going, one boy from each fraternity marched around the tables in the costume which he thought would best show off his legs. Each boy was escorted by a pretty Pi Phi carrying a money box for the collection of "votes." It was all so much fun and such a success that we plan to make it a yearly thing. More fund raising projects are planned for the rest of the year as we of Florida Gamma feel that it is up to each of us to support this, the first philanthropic project supported by a fraternity and giving financial support through active chapters and alumni clubs to expand an educational program. KATHRYN ANN BROWN The Time Is Ripe! GEORGIA ALPHA--Arrow in the Smokies is living proof that the originators of the first national altruistic project of any woman's fraternity demonstrated remarkable foresight when they presented plans for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. What began as a rehabilitation center to insure the education of underprivileged residents has become a haven for art students, teachers, therapists, crafts-men and hobbyists. Because of its close proximity to the University of Georgia, which boasts one of the finest art schools in the nation, Arrow in the Smokies should continue to offer additional training to Georgia Alpha's and the nation's art students. There has been a strong in-crease in interest shown by Georgia citizens for art and cultural improvement in that field. Atlanta's new center for the performing arts, its museums and galleries have been revitalized and replenished by civic leaders aware of their importance in the community. The proposed changes and improvements at the Centennial Convention could not have come at a more opportune time in this area. The time is ripe for citizens throughout Georgia to be made aware of the expanded opportunities now available to them through Arrow in the Smokies. Georgia Alpha has conducted a minor public relations campaign for the fraternity philanthropy in the past during major rush seasons on campus. The products of the school, its mechanics, and its rewards are explained to hundreds of girls each year. Whether they are pledged to our chapter or not, these girls are made aware of the opportunities existing just a few hours from Athens. SUZANNE WEBB Project Yields International Benefits ILLINOIS EPSILON Illinois Epsilon was proud to be one of the top ten contributors to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Now, at the beginning of the fraternity's second one-hundred years, the chapter is enthusiastic about supporting our new project, Arrow in the Smokies. We are especially pleased that our organization, which has given so much to girls throughout the world, now has a project in which each of us can make contributions that will yield international benefits. As in the past, our chapter will continue to take advantage of all opportunities to advertize our philanthropic project. During rush we displayed a variety of Settlement School handicrafts. We also have plans for similar displays before Christmas and during Parents' Week-End. Our chapter feels that the success of Arrow in the Smokies will not be based solely upon monetary contributions. Only through national publicity outside of Pi Beta Phi circles will such a project become a reality, for as stated before, the benefits of Arrow in the Smokies can not help but be international, BETTY CARTER Tutoring Center WISCONSIN BETA The women of Wisconsin Beta are deeply interested in the work of our national philanthropies, especially Arrow in the Smokies. The employment which it offers to the needy people of the area undoubtedly raises their living standard and allows them the chance to enjoy a better life. However, our chapter is especially interested in the continual development of our native crafts which is fostered through the Arroweraft workshop and the new Arts and Crafts Center. It gives us all a genuine feeling of satisfaction to know that we are helping to keep a part of our American heritage alive, not only in Tennessee, but throughout the country. We realize that in our times of unrest and turbulence, our national philanthropy is working toward establishing good will throughout the world when the many foreign students who come to study return home with their new skills. Our chapter is now able to devote most of its time to our national philanthropy because we have already raised the necessary funds and achieved our goal for our local philanthropy, the Beloit Tutoring Center in Mississippi. This tutoring center has been greatly successful in the past few years in its work with the student classified as a "low achiever." And so our work goes on as we prepare for our Christmas bazaar to be held early in December to raise funds for our own Settlement School. We will be selling various types of handywork which we are now in the process of making. We happily continue this work in the true spirit of Pi Beta Phi. BETSY BLANEY What Does the Future Hold? MANITOBA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi became, with the initiation of the Settlement School at Gatlinburg, the first fraternity to have a national philanthropy; the first fraternity to show the world that they were a service instititution, not just a social club. In those early days, all that the Pi Phi's envisioned was a country school, bringing education where there had been none before, in honor of those twelve aspiring young women, so keenly interested in education them-selves, who had formed our Pi Phi. Our reality, in 1967 has grown far beyond their wildest dreams. Where there was no school, Pi Phi built a school; and staffed it, and, over the years, developed it into the university accredited institution it is today. Where there was no doctor, or even nurse, to care for the sick, aged and young children, Pi Phi brought in their own nurses, and doctors, and taught basic hygiene in 72 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the school; now there is a clinic and doctor in the town. When Pi Phi came to Gatlinburg, the hill people were poor, barely ekeing out an existence on their land. Pi Phi has taught these hill people crafts, and bought them the needed equipment; now there is thriving home industry, which Pi Phi supports in its Arrowcraft shops. Much indeed has been accomplished in the past fifty years at Gatlinburg. So who can say what the future holds for the Arrow in the Smokies? There is much that can still become, and more that we cannot envision today, but that will be accomplished. There is always a need for education, and always an opportunity for service. The future of Pi Phi holds far more than its past, at Gatlinburg in the Smokies. BARBARA EDMONDS Key to Pi Phi Future SOUTH DAKOTA ALPHA A century ago when the twelve founders of Pi Beta Phi met to organize a women's fraternity for the purpose of enhancing the nobility of womanhood, they faced the problem of proving what positive goal such an organization could accomplish. Today the same problem still exists for twentieth-century fraternity women. In comparison to the immensity of world conflicts, the acquiring of social graces and the finding of strength in the bonds of personal friendships cannot alone justify the existence of women's fraternal, groups. At a recent officers' retreat members of South Dakota Alpha heard their university's Coordinator of Student Affairs challenge them to ACT instead of REACT. Too often sororities and fraternities concentrate their efforts in rebelling against and attempting to reject the college regulations placed upon them. Truly this shows that they care and are alive, but why must every action be only a response? Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic project, Arrow in the Smokies, holds the key to the future of our college fraternity. Expanding the summer craft workshop is a definite step Pi Beta Phi can take forward showing to the public that we are not organized for the sole purpose of our personal advancement in the social aspects of life. It is pertinent for South Dakota A and all other chapters to recognize the new centennial plans for Arrow in the Smokies and show to the public that this too is the purpose of our fraternity. And thus, while doing this, we will be acting and advancing the welfare of others as well as ourselves. CINDY CIMPL Enthusiasm Spreads Rapidly MINNESOTA ALPHA At Minnesota Alpha, we had a change in feeling recently toward the Settlement School. That change is due mainly to three things. First, one of our members visited Gatlinburg last summer while on vacation and her stories about it have made it come alive for us. Secondly, our two delegates to Convention brought back an enthusiasm for Settlement School which is rapidly spreading to the whole chapter. Third, and, we feel, most important, is the new name which has been given to the project, Arrow in the Smokies. This name means more to us than the words "philanthropy" or "Settlement School." The word "Arrow" alone brings to mind the chain of friendship which exists coast to coast and generation to generation in Pi Beta Phi. It brings to mind the love and devotion we feel toward one another .and toward all that is good and true. It reminds us that we in Pi Beta Phi are striving for the highest ideals. Then, the joining of the word "Arrow" with the site of our philanthropy, the "Smokies," joins all these feelings to the Settlement School. It sets the tone for the spirit of Settlement School. Now that this spirit has become more apparent to us, it has become apparent also that it is our job to maintain and spread the spirit. To do this, we, first of all, made Settlement School a much larger part of Fall Rush Information Day. We told its story in more de-tail and displayed many of the craft. Throughout, we tried to convey the spirit of giving which started Settlement School and which keeps it growing year after year. Secondly, we have made it a point to leave the Arrowcraft catalog in the living room where waiting guests will pick it up. And we have coached all our members so that they can answer any questions the guests might ask about Gatlinburg and the School, or about the Arrowcraft Worshop and the ordering of the articles made there. Finally, we plan to add, to our annual Settlement School information program, the personal reactions of our active who visited Gatlinburg last summer and of a former active who spent a whole summer there. With these new ideas and spurred on by our new feelings about Arrow in the Smokies, we hope at Minnesota Alpha to make Settlement School known and loved, and therefore supported, by an ever-increasing number of people. J. MARCHE L Emphasis During Rush MISSOURI GAMMA Missouri Gamma puts emphasis on our national philanthropy project during rush. Because we think it is a unique idea and binds us in further sisterhood, we want to help bring success to Arrow in the Smokies. Rather than taking a chance in having some rushees miss our story by leaving discussion up to the individual rushers, we have our philanthropies chairman give a small talk on this subject to the entire group. She has a display of articles made at the Arrowcraft Shop set up and is ready to answer questions. We feel that the best way to show our interest to the public is through enthusiasm in our attitudes. We support the Settlement School as our chapter philanthropy and throughout the year we sponsor money-making projects to provide funds. Our annual mum sale at Homecoming is a major activity. We have great success with this project and are able to expand it as each year passes. Another project is the Rummage Sale we have for the public. A location in the city is sought that will provide us with the maximum expo-sure to the public. Each girl is responsible for a prearranged number of articles and rarely do we have much left after a two day sale. We also have some type of candy sale on campus, and we hope to have an apple sale later in the year. Each year we try to THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 73 have some other type of fund raising project in addition to our annual activities. Also, members are encouraged to order articles from the Settlement School through our chairman. Last year a senior, Sahanny Johnson, received the California Alpha Scholarship. We are proud to be taking active participation in support of Arrow in the Smokies. Each year we hope to build this participation and in this way push Arrow in the Smokies to great success. DEBBIE NELSON Inevitable Growth Seen ARKANSAS ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies definitely has a future, and as more than a dream in the minds of Pi Phis everywhere. With 111 active chapters and 339 alum clubs working in every state and in Canada, the entire settlement school project is bound to grow. At Arkansas Alpha, we work to promote the larger philanthropic project of Arrow in the Smokies and at the same time we are active on local projects. We have the Arrowcraft sale every year. Before the sale, we contact the alums and neighbors and faculty members, to let them know when we will have the display. By having the sale, we bring the entire Arrow in the Smokies project to the citizens of Fayetteville. The profits from the sale go back to the project. Recently our chapter joined the Chamber of Commerce and by this we hope to acquaint the Fayetteville community more with Pi Phi as a locally and nationally active fraternity. On a local level we carry on several philanthropic projects. This year we have adopted a young American Indian girl. We send money for her schooling and some of her needs and write to her often. Last year we were awarded a trophy from the Community Chest for giving the greatest contribution to their drive of all organizations on campus. We also have a Christmas party each year for underprivileged children in the community. JO ANN PRYOR Hope for the Future MISSISSIPPI ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies means hope, love, responsibility, opportunity, pride, and yield to Mississippi Alpha Pi Phis as well as Pi Phis throughout the nation. In 1912 with the organization of the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, the dream of almost half a century was realized, and each bounding step brought hope for the future to Pi Beta Phi and to those who come there to learn and work. Love, ever-present in Pi Beta Phi, found a special outlet in this national philanthropy as Pi Phis help others help themselves. Responsibility and opportunity were basic building blocks for the Settlement School. But of these pride and yield are the most important for they are interchangeable each producing the other, creating a never-ending, every-increasing cycle. At the turn of a century of happiness and growth, Pi Beta Phi adopts a centennial project which will follow in the footsteps of the Settlement School and the Arrowcraft Shop. Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the Summer Craft Workshop and will act in a more wide-ranged capacity to better meet the demands of a growing country and fraternity. Arrow in the Smokies has been made possible through planning and hard work, and with the continued support of every Pi Phi it cannot fail. EDDIE WELFORD Meeting Leisure's Challenge IOWA GAMMA Pi Beta Phi's Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is an expansion of the Craft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tenn., which is co-sponsored by the Fraternity and the University of Tennessee. The Craft Workshop offers a broad curriculum in the Arts and Crafts, and the courses offer college credit for graduate and undergraduate work. Today there is an increased amount of leisure time offered to our citizens due to automation and the specialized times. When this leisure time is added to the need in our society for individual creativity, the logical solution is a greater emphasis on arts and crafts. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, the opportunity for creative self-expression will be given. To further the growth of our philanthropy and help Arrow in the Smokies to become a reality, each chapter member must take an active interest in the project and help to raise money for its support. One way to do this is to hold Arrowcraft sales, which would acquaint our members with the quality and variety of articles made. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, it will enable individuals to develop their talents, the handicapped to become a little more independent, and older citizens to feel more worthwhile. An old Hindu Maxim sums up the responsibilities of each one of us. "He does not live in vain, who employs his wealth, his thought, his speech to advance the good of others." VICKI VOELKER Action Key to Success! IOWA ZETA Pi Beta Phi has always been concerned with helping others to help themselves, this is evident in the organization of Chapters and Clubs. This concern has been extended to people outside the membership of Pi Beta Phi through the program of the first philanthropy supported by a fraternity the Settlement School. In keeping with this idea Pi Beta Phi's Centennial project is a Craft Workshop in co-operation with the University of Tennessee to be built in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. It will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. As members of Iowa Zeta, we are proud to give our support in such an outstanding project. We know that creative arts have been found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also our Alumnae Clubs can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Se74 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. Creative crafts develop skill, provide an outlet for self-expression, increase sensitiveness as to surrounding giving dignity to common things, bring the handicapped into better adjustment, and are .a delight to the adventuresome. Iowa Zeta realizes that we must look at the coming of the new. All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. This is only possible with the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. As members of Iowa Zeta, we pledge our loyal support and are proud that we can contribute to such an excellent project. To know that we are helping other people as well as our members, sparks a feeling of pride and it is a pleasure to say that we belong to such a wonderful organization as Pi Beta Phi. ANN MONTGOMERY Improved Publicity Planned NEBRASKA BETA Nebraska Beta has started an interesting new local philanthropic project this year by offering its services to the Nebraska State Hospital. Five members a week, consisting of three actives and two pledges, work as volunteers in the hospital lounge or canteen. In this manner they are able to serve as cashiers, waitresses, and fountain girls and at the same time build positive relationships with the patients. In addition to our new local philanthropic project Nebraska Beta is planning to hold its annual Settlement School sale. Posters, announcements, and news-paper coverage will aid in publicizing the sale, which will be open to the entire campus. It is hoped that profits from this sale and magazine sales will help establish support for another Nebraska Beta project one aimed at making the benefit of Arrow in the Smokies known to more than just Pi Phis. With help from local newspapers and campus newspapers a brief description of the aims of Arrow in the Smokies will be presented. Members of the Lincoln Weaving Club and other local craft clubs will be encouraged to con-tact our chapter for information about sponsorship to Tennessee in the form of a loan or scholarship. Public relations will be improved and Pi Phi's achievements and opportunities will be made available to many out-side of our chapter. Nebraska Beta feels that the greatest way it can make Arrow in the Smokies meaningful is by sponsoring a member who can benefit from the experience . . . a member outside of our own chapter. KITTY MCMANUS Success Through Support KANSAS BETA Pi Beta Phi was founded by twelve girls at Monmouth College in 1867. Since that time its membership has grown enormously and has spread to college campuses throughout the United States and Canada. Similarly Arrow in the Smokies should grow and grow. It will do so 'because the same enthusiastic spirit and love for Pi Phi will be behind it. There are already signs of this "success through support." The idea of a centennial project was first realized at the 1954 Convention. Since that time interest has been great. Last year over one hundred thou-sand dollars was contributed to "Arrow in the Smokies !" As time goes on and Pi Phi's continue to be generous with this, their outstanding philanthropic project, Gatlinburg, Tennessee should be a huge center of activity. Numerous buildings will be gradually constructed for art and craft classes until it will be a complete center. Then this Craft Center will be of tremendous benefit to its teachers and students, as well as artists everywhere. Preserving the native arts and crafts of our country, it should become a well-known and respected cultural project. Even more important, as "Arrow in the Smokies" grows, so will the reputation of Pi Beta Phi. Through its outstanding achievements and its numerous philanthropic projects from the time of its founding, Pi Phi has already demonstrated to others its high standards and principles. Now, because of this wonderful Centennial Project, the name "Pi Beta Phi" could become synonomous with "service." And as this spirit of Pi Phi, which began in 1867, continues to grow, so will the 1967 Centennial Project "Arrow in the Smokies." MARSHA GARRETT Serving Mankind OKLAHOMA ALPHA What are the purposes of a Pi Beta Phi philanthropic project in the Smokies? This is a question that we at Oklahoma Alpha are asking and have attempted to answer. The necessity of vocational training is one answer to the need for the Pi Phi service project. Vocational training can bring industries to the area, provide jobs and give the skilled worker a sense of accomplishment. The type of craftmanship learned from the project is another answer to our question. Not only can skilled industrial techniques be taught, but skills in the crafting of handmade articles. If the handcrafting skills of the people of the Smokies can be preserved, Pi Phi can preserve the past for the future. Not only will the lives of the people of the Smokies be enriched but the lives of everyone who views their craftmanship. If we, as part of the Greek system can reach beyond our realm of membership and aid others, we have served not only ourselves but mankind. By providing service outside our membership, this project can not only answer our goal of service but can be-come our theme for the next hundred years of fraternity growth. NANCY BREEDEN Fund-raising Projects Unlimited! OKLAHOMA BETA Members of Pi Beta Phi, have always tried to be of service to the people around us and to people in need. A momentous step was taken THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 75 when in 1910, we began laying the plans for our Arrowcraft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. From this time, much progress has been made and we here at Oklahoma Beta are proud of our fraternities lead in the area of philanthropy. The Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is another significant step for our fraternity. It is one of the best ways in which the art of hand made crafts and skills can be perpetuated. Our chapter feels that there are many possibilities for the Arrow in the Smokies. With the increased amount of leisure time of our society and the growing number of people over sixty-five, there is a need to find a creative and constructive outlet for our human energies. The Arrow in the Smokies 'can provide this outlet by giving many a place to come and learn while perpetuating the art of crafts. There is also the possibility of the Arrow in the Smokies as a training ground for instructors who could help with the rehabilitation of those people in our nation who need the therapy of learning an enjoy-able, constructive, and physically beneficial skill. It is with these possibilities and others that we see the potential which lies in the creation of this new philanthropy. In our own chapter we try to publicize our philanthropy through our annual Arrowcraft Sale. As a chapter, we also sponsor an annual Easter Egg hunt for the Underprivileged children in town. In the past we have also provided food for a needy family at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The variety of possible fund-raising projects for the support of our Centennial Project seems to be unlimited. There is always the possibility of collecting all the loose personal items which are left in the lounge and then selling them back to the members at a small fee. The old stand by of a rummage sale has always been a profitable project for our chapter. These are some of the ideas that our chapter has concerning our new Centennial Project and it is with great hope and much expectation that we look for-ward to seeing what the future will hold for Pi Beta Phi and her philanthropy work. A New Dream TEXAS ALPHA In 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee was established as a memorial to the founders of our fraternity. Now fifty-five years later that dream has become a reality and in this our centennial year we have a new dream. Our Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, will be our major philanthropy as we start in this our second century as a Fraternity. Texas Alpha is very enthusiastic and interested in the growth and development of our newest project, Arrow in the Smokies. As the summer craft workshop is being expanded into larger sessions and more courses of study, many of our members feel that their education would be greatly enriched if they studied at the craft workshop. Especially promising to the members of Texas Alpha will be the instructions given in therapy, teaching, and in doing volunteer work. We are always interested in learning new hobbies and crafts aid many of our members are planning to spend their summers at the Settlement School learning more about these things. Pi Beta Phi and Texas Alpha will be looking for-ward to our new philanthropy. We hope that every chapter and alum club will do their part in helping to make our next hundred years as profitable and re-warding as our past hundred years has been. LYN ARNOT Importance Realized TEXAS BETA The national philanthropic project of Pi Beta Phi which was once a dream to a few, is now a reality of which every Pi Phi can, and should be proud. Gatlinburg once only a village of isolated people has now become a productive community. The Texas Beta Pi Phis are proud to assist in this national project through annual contributions. We also have several local philanthropic projects. A number of our girls tutor in connection with a YMCA program. We also take part in "Rag Mop", through which we collect clothes for Goodwill Industries. Each year we participate in a campus-wide project in connection with Greek Week. This year we cleaned up a YMCA camp. We now sponsor two foreign orphans, sending them clothes, food, and special gifts on holidays. Each Christmas we have a party for a group of orphans, complete with our own female version of Santa Claus. We of Texas Beta realize the importance of philanthropic projects. We feel that through helping others, we, ourselves, become better people. Our thoughts can be expressed by a comment made to a Pi Phi alum by a local resident of Gatlinburg, "You Pi Phis really are angels." Active Alumnce Cooperation NEW MEXICO ALPHA At present New Mexico Alpha is involved in a magazine selling campaign to raise money for the Settlement School Fund. Each girl in the chapter will be required to sell two magazines. It was decided that this was not too much to ask. Part of this money will be used to support the Arrow in the Smokies and we feel that this will be a step in the right direction for helping it become a reality. Our active chapter does not have a local philanthropy, although our alums do. They help support Casa Angelica, a home for retarded children in Albuquerque. Last year through a home designer show they earned enough money to purchase a station wagon for the home. We helped the Alums in providing a free babysitting service for the mothers who came to see the show. Each semester our chapter gives the Mary Lovelace scholarship to a deserving active. This scholarship pays for the active's dues for the semester for which she earned it. Doug Munson was the recipient of the scholarship for this semester. A Broader Dream UTAH ALPHA In March 1912, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in the Great Smokey Mountains, was opened to thirteen eager, young students, only two short years after it was decided at convention that an educational project should be established in memory of our founders. At first the Settlement School, the first national phi76 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI lanthropy of its kind, provided an education to the mountain people through home teaching, but soon land was secured on which to build a school house, in spite of the reluctancy of the townspeople. Through the years, the once small community has expanded into a large town which now draws about five million tourists a year. At the present time the town consists of the Arrowcraft Workshop, a health center, a school house, the Loom House, and a dormatory, the Red Bard, to accommodate some of the students. Every year, hundreds of children and adults come to Gatlinburg from all parts of the country to learn all the crafts taught there. It is by these people that all the jewelry, wood craft and loom work available through every Pi Beta Phi chapter is made. All proceeds from the sale of these things goes back to the Settlement School for improvements and expansion. Every Pi Phi chapter in the United States and Canada supports our Settlement School and through each individual chapter's philanthropies program, we are able to promote improvement of the school both through the sale of the Craft Shop products and their money-making projects directed toward raising money to donate to the school. In Utah Alpha we have had a great deal of support of the Settlement School through the sale of the crafts. It is pleasing to know that people not even associated with Pi Phi call to inquire about the merchandise and the school that they've heard about from friends. Thus it is evident that the fame of the Settlement School has spread all over the country and through this continuing expansion and rise in sup-porters, the dream of a bigger, better and more adequate Settlement School will soon be a reality. KIM KOLLER "King" Crowned for Settlement School MONTANA ALPHA In the summer of 1966 two of our members, Marilyn Fitzgerald and Judi O'Donnell, had the privilege and opportunity to visit the Arrow in the Smokies. They had of course studied about Pi Beta Phi's outstanding philanthropy but both agreed they were not prepared for the large, modern school which greeted them. Several people told them how thankful and indebted they are to Pi Phi and what a wonderful project we have. One man in particular told them that his son was to graduate the following year because of assistance the Pi Phis had given him. The girls strongly urge all Pi Phis to take any opportunity they have to visit our Arrow in the Smokies. "Every member of Pi Beta Phi can be proud of this project because we are looking beyond our needs to those of others. We are not only helping others, we are preserving a beautiful art for the benefit of all. Because Montana Alpha feels that this national philanthropy is so important we do not sponsor any particular local philanthropy. Each year we hold a contest for the `King of the Hill' in which one member of each fraternity is nominated by his fraternity for this honor. These men are invited to the house several times and are asked to present some form of entertainment for us. The members of our house then vote for one of the men and on a Saturday night we hold a campus-wide `Derby Dance' to crown the winning`King of the Hill.' The other candidates are then our `Brothers of the Arrow.' The proceeds from the dance are sent to the Arrow in the Smokies as our donation. We are very proud that last year Montana Alpha donated the largest contribution. We feel that a project such as ours would be a good method for any chapter to use to promote our national philanthropy. CAROLE POFFENBERGER The Realm of "Others" WASHINGTON ALPHA Our philanthropic project in the Smokey Mountains area is the fulfillment of ,a desire embedded deep in every Pi Phi heart. College life is full of the everyday hustle and bustle of schoolwork, campus activities, dates, and friends. Our philanthropic project adds a meaningful dimension to a college career: We project ourselves beyond the realm of "self'' to the realm of "others." Because we feel that Gatlinburg is one of the primary responsibilities of our House, the Pi Phi's at Washington Alpha display the material crafts as well as the spiritual ideals of this once backward area during our September Rush. We want these prospective pledges to see the deeper meaning behind Pi Beta Phi. Each Fall, we are reminded of the significance of the Smokey Mountains project. Hundreds of people in Gatlinburg are being educated through the nationwide effort of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity; they are learning a livelihood in handicrafts; they are gaining self-respect. How do we at Washington Alpha Chapter help the Smokey Mountains project: In the Fall our House sponsors a sale of the handicrafts produced by the craftsmen of Gatlinburg. This sale provides a market for the crafts; it is open to anyone. All the girls in the house enjoy setting up the display, especially when the products are so varied. Anything from brooms to mugs to jewelry to stationery can be found at the sale. It's always fun to give the buyers a little background on our project and what it means to us. This not only makes the crafts more meaningful, but helps us to take an active part in this altruistic project! We at Washington Alpha are anxious to do our part in helping to promote the success of the people at Gatlinburg. The progress shown to date is certainly an inspiration to us all. PAM WAGNER The Warm Feeling of Giving WASHINGTON BETA The Washington Beta chapter feels that the Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the present opportunity for Pi Phi's to give of their service, time and money. We are planning to have a Settlement School program to inform members of the project and the potentials and opportunities which it opens to us. After enthusiasm is raised, a fund-raising project will follow. This project, Penny a Pound for Pi Phi (an idea from Wisconsin Beta) will tax each girl a penny for each pound of her weight. The pennies will be pasted on a poster board in the shape of a huge piggy bank for display. We feel that with adequate support this project will develop into a vital institution. It will, enrich the lives of those who take advantage of its facilities, learn a trade and become productive citizens; as well THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 77 as the lives of those who benefit from the usefullness of the products. In the age of mechanization, the Arrow in the Smokies will play its part in preserving creativity and personal pride in an object, as contrasted to the impersonal qualities of a machine-made product. . The members of Washington Beta are very proud of the philanthropies project, not only because working together towards a common goal brings unity to Pi Phi's everywhere, but also because of the personal opportunities, creative and technical, which it brings to so many. This project enables everyone to experience the warm feeling of giving. AMY RADEWAN A Worthwhile Program OREGON ALPHA Oregon Alpha of Pi Beta Phi feels that the Centennial Project: "Arrow In The Smokies" is a new and exciting addition. The Summer Craft Workshop has proved itself to be beneficial and rewarding to everyone involved, and with the expansion of more workshops, more and more people will be reached. The Craft Workshops, are beneficial in many ways. The inhabitants of the Gatlinburg area are able to gain a living because of the tourist trade drawn there, the instructors and the assistants of the Summer Craft Workshops are earning a living besides fullfilling their own aesthetic needs. The students are learning the crafts taught in order that they might re-turn to their homes and teach others. This is a never ending circle because ell those taught will continue to expand and teach others. We feel that it is an honor that Pi Beta Phi is in co-operation with the University of Tennessee in such a worthwhile program. Oregon Alpha is planning on having a skit-dinner to inform the chapter members of the Arrow in the Smokies Program. For our fund raising project we would like to have an Arrowcraft Shop Sale before the Christmas holidays. We feel the citizens of Eugene and the University of Oregon Student Body would be very interested in our crafts, and this would spread knowledge of our Centennial project, besides helping to raise our funds. Oregon Alpha's main philanthropic project is helping teach in the Handicapped Children's Swimming Program. Pi Phi, Marsha Almeter, is in charge of the program. NANCY ELMGREN A Conscious Endeavor OREGON BETA The members of Oregon Beta are very proud to be a part of Pi Beta Phi's new philanthropy project, Arrow in the Smokies. Pi Beta Phi must grow to meet the needs of it's members and nation alike. We must continue to broaden our horizons and since we are founded as a scholastic organization in what way could we better serve than by supplying an opportunity for education. Thoreau said: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeaver. Our conscious endeavor for this next one hundred years is Arrow in the Smokies. Through education we will preserve and extend our national heritage. Thus we are building a brighter future from the past. We are expanding to fill present and fu'ture needs and by doing this we will continue to grow as an organization of college women. We must not forget our heritage; we must preserve it. Oregon Beta feels that Arrow in the Smokies will help to preserve this heritage as it helps to educate our people and by helping to preserve our past will help to build a stronger and more united future. We can only wait to see what light our flame has cast by the end of this, our second, century.. Our hope is that it will continue to grow in brightness as it has during our past century. Services Extended IDAHO ALPHA Pi Beta Phi .can truly be proud of its nationally renowned philanthropic establishment, Arrow in ,the Smokies. Due to the dedication and loyalty of many individual Pi Phi alums and the support of many active chapters, and ,alum clubs, this project has grown since its establishment in 1910, by the Settlement School committee, to a greatly enlarged and expanded program partly affiliated with the University of Tennessee and making meaningful and productive the lives of many previously poor and backward people. This year, along with Pi Beta Phi's Centennial celebration, a great program is being put .into effect to expand and build this philanthropic project so that more of its services can be extended to make an even greater contribution. Idaho Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi would, like to greatly congratulate the leaders in this program and offer a Centennial wish that the Arrow in the Smokies may grow and expand in Gatlinburg, and perhaps in the future, even in. other locations where the need is great. Through our philanthropic project, all Pi Phis can make a significant contribution to the realization of Pi Phi ideals. In the area of public relations, Idaho Alpha Chap-ter of Pi. Beta Phi has contributed to the Fund for the Performing Arts Center here at the University of Idaho, a 6-million-dollar project, and also to the Cam-pus Chest Fund. CHERYL KOCH "Bigger and Better" CALIFORNIA GAMMA California Gamma, like all Pi Phi Chapters, has always been especially proud of our heritage as the pioneer in women's fraternities. As a non-profit organization we have always been proud to point out our high scholastic standards and social activities but, today, we are even prouder of the philanthropic projects that our sorority has developed. Now as Pi Beta Phi starts its second century our Chapter feels that our new philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, will be "bigger and better" yet. Because we do live across the, country it is SOMetimes difficult for us to really see the good that is being accomplished by these projects. We support them 'but we do not really know that much about 78 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI them. To remedy this we are currently planning a program for early November which will not only tell about our philanthropies, but which will, we hope, show another reason why we can be so proud to be Pi Phis. But the idea is not just to learn about and to support morally our philanthropies. We could all talk for hours about how proud we are of what we are doing and what a great project Arrow in the Smokies is but that will not make it a success. As Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice President of Philanthropies said in the September 1967 ARROW the important word for this and all other philanthropies is "yield". Our chapter realizes this and consequently we are also going to try to initiate plans for more publicity and for some fund-raising projects that will show our sup-port. California Gamma feels that the key to the success of this Centennial Project and to Pi Beta Phi's second century lies in the contributions of each and every Chapter. CHRISTI HUGGINS Symbol of Pride CALIFORNIA DELTA The year 1967 marked for Pi Beta Phi one hundred years of sisterhood through fraternity life. Yet only half a century ago that sister-hood became truly meaningful with the establishment of the national philanthropy. The Settlement School has become a symbol of pride. Not yet a member, a pledge wonders what Pi Phi represents. She questions what the purpose of Pi Phi is and what it means to national, the members, and finally to herself. She discovers the true significance of Pi Phi when she learns about the Settlement School. The school synibolizes Pi Phi's higher values and goals. The educational centers and workshops of Gatlin-burg endure and expand with the devotion and interest of actives across the nation. Donations from each chapter and alumni continually pour into the school as a genuine expression of support for the work and progress made by the philanthropy. Future expansion made possible by the donations will focus on the pro-motion of education for all types of people. Students, teachers, doctors, industrial technicians, and even re-tired persons will benefit from the classes offered. The Settlement School of Gatlinburg symbolizes the ideals of its founders and its donors and is truly something of value. LINDA DAVIS Native Crafts Kept Alive! CALIFORNIA EPSILON--Pi Beta Phi's Arrow ex-tends across the entire nation. When each Pi Phi thinks of service, her thoughts are pointed upward to that special place high in the Smokies. Here we find the starting point for the first sorority to establish their philanthropy. Pi Beta Phi felt this such a worthy endeavor it has been maintained ,all through the years. Being the oldest fraternity for women, Pi Phi's felt the need to keep alive one of the oldest and true American art cultures. Industrialism is rapidly causing the extinction of true handicrafts, but Arrow in the Smokies providesthe opportunity for these people to keep their native craft still alive. Besides the mere craft aspect, employment is created along with the recreational aspect of the school. For those people merely interested in learning a craft, the opportunity is constantly provided for them. Because university credit is given, it allows those seeking a profession in art to continue their work. The future of the Arrow in the Smokies is tremendous. Expansion of this foundation cannot help but grow because of the support it has received and will continue to receive. The second hundred years will prove to be as successful as the first hundred because Arrow in the Smokies keeps alive for future generations the artistic heritage of that area of the United States. SUSAN DRISCOLL Tremendous Job Ahead NEVADA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi can be more than hopeful about its philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. This dream of building an Arts and Crafts addition to the University of Tennessee will become a reality, just as the Settlement School has. Through the financial and moral assistance of every Pi Phi, the Settlement School has grown to be one of the largest crafts' centers of the United States. If we look at the past success of our Settlement School, we cannot fail in our hope for the future, Arrow in the Smokies. As hopeful as we are, we must realize that the construction of such a project is a tremendous job which will need the support of every member. The Pi Phis at Nevada Alpha Chapter are organizing two projects to raise funds for Arrow in the Smokies. We plan to have a Sandwich Sale and a Spaghetti Feed. Our advertisements for both these functions will explain Arrow in the Smokies, and the importance of this philanthropy should aid our success. The Sandwich Sale will consist of selling Poor Boy sandwiches to campus residents on two Sundays. The Spaghetti Feed will also be on a Sunday, because the campus cafeteria only serves brunch on Sundays. We will have the dinner on or near the University, pre-pare it ourselves, and only charge a dollar for tickets sold in advance. We hope to receive a good profit which we will donate to Arrow in the Smokies. If every Pi Phi Chapter can do something similar, Arrow in the Smokies will be transformed from a dream into a reality. STEPHANIE LORIGAN Art Appreciation Continues! ARIZONA ALPHA The Arizona Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi highly commends the progress and great eagerness toward our new Centennial project of 1966 through 1967. We are very enthusiastic to increase aid to the underprivileged people in the Gatlinburg area. By enlarging the Summer Craft Workshop, we may be able, not only to help these poverty-stricken mountain people, but also to increase the knowledge of dying traditional crafts such as stitchery and weaving that have been so much a part of the early pio (Continued on page 87) i Beta Phi Pledges These young ladies pledged Pi Beta Phi chapters at colleges and universities with a fall rush or open rush in the first semester of the 1967-68 school year.

        64 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Fulfilling Our Ambitions VERMONT ALPHA The Pi Beta Phi philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, is one which we, of the Vermont Alpha Chapter, feel personifies the backbone of the fraternity as a whole and is one which, in today's world, is part of the universal struggle for peace through assistance in helping ourselves fulfill our ambitions. If each one of us were to feel as if he or she were contributing to the world as a whole, even in the most minute detail, we would at least be satisfying one of our basic inner needs: to feel useful. Arrow in the Smokies fulfills this aspect in many people who not only are contributing factors to the establishment but who are also helping others to be so involved. Through this philanthropy we are providing an outlet for the enjoyment and skill of the surrounding people, as well as maintaining an important part of the American culture. But this "creative institution" has by no means achieved its highest potential. There is much more than can be done .and should be done, not only in our national philanthropy at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, but also in each chapter's individual philanthropy project. By developing and improving the Arrow settlement in Gatlinburg we will maintain a little of our heritage as well as supporting a living memorial. Similarly, in each individual chap-ter philanthropy, the members can find fulfillment outside of their campus or college life and assist the community at the same time. Although these philanthropies will vary, it is hoped that they will uphold the idea that not only are we helping ourselves, but also others. ANN MILLER Fine Way to Start MAINE ALPHA We at Maine Alpha are very pleased with the new extension that is to be added to the Summer Craft Workshop. We feel that this new project, located on the property of our Settlement School is a fine way to start off Pi Phi's second hundred years. We intend to make this dream of a new Arrow in the Smokies come true by giving as much support as we can. For many years Maine Alphas have been raising money for our national philanthropy in various ways. This fall we had our muu-muu and candied apple. sales, and very shortly we will be having our annual arrowcraft sale sale. The arrowcraft sale is held in our Student Union Building and is very well received by the Maine students. As well as making money by this sale we are also publicizing our Settlement School and Arrowcraft Shop. We are very fortunate in having a number of alumni in the area and these sales help to keep them informed of what is happening in our national philanthropy. Philanthropies are very important to Maine Alphas. Our present local philanthropy is an Opportunity Center for mentally retarded children. The children at the Opportunity Center greatly appreciate the parties and dances which we have for them on special occasions. On the local level we also assist the fraternities with their Christmas parties for orphan children and many of us are involved in the Companion Programwhere we spend a few hours a week with a little girl or boy from one of the surrounding towns. The Maine Alphas hope and will try their best to make Arrow in the Smokies a success. BECKY HALL "Arrow in the Arctic" ONTARIO ALPHA Since the success of the "Arrow in the Smokies" has been, recognized in full measure, the Ontario Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi felt that an article on the "Arrow in the Arctic" might be of added interest to the other chapters of Pi Beta Phi; particularly the chapters in the United States, who perhaps do not know what its specific aims and purposes are. So, perhaps we can acquaint them, with a few facts relating to what we believe to be, a progressive project in the realm of philanthropy here in Canada. The idea for the new Canadian Project was put forth by the Vancouver Alumnae Club. Their suggestion was that all the Canadian Alumni Clubs and Active Chapters annual contributions towards the buying of books for the library at Whitehorse in the Yukon, and the library at Hay River in the Northwest Territories. These libraries are being developed by the Canadian government, but needless to say, contributions are not only greatly needed but most appreciated. The librarians in charge of these two libraries have been authorized to purchase the books which will be most beneficial for educational purposes, with our contributions. We would hope that the American Chapters of Pi Beta Phi would recognize the value of our Canadian Project. We feel that the possibilities for enlarging our plans for philanthropy in this area are unlimited. Therefore, we would suggest that you might like to extend your assistance to us so that we may unite in our efforts to bring our project the success that we have made together at Gatlinburg. New Avenues for Growth CONNECTICUT ALPHA It is a truism that the educated man leads the richest life. He understands and appreciates the world around him. He is economically and intellectually independent. Thirteen years ago, it seems these beliefs were uppermost in Phi Phi's minds as they envisioned the Centennial Project, "Arrow in the Smokies." Since the new institution is fully accredited by the University of Tennessee and will run on a year round basis, individuals who be-fore could not attend the University for economic or other reasons may be able to enjoy the privilege of these courses in craft design. The establishment of such an institution opens up countless avenues for the growth and development of craft education. In the years to come, Gatlinburg may be a spot for conventions, seminar courses, and workshops in teacher-education for arts and crafts as well as professional training. Beside supporting Pi Phi's philanthropic endeavors through Magazine Agency orders, Arrowcraft sales, and Arrowcraft displays, Connecticut Alpha has other plans for supporting "Arrow in the Smokies," per THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI 65 haps the most promising of all Pi Phi projects. Each year, at the traditional Settlement School Dinner, all the sisters dress in "mountain duds" and enjoy fried chicken and corn on the cob Gatlinburg style. This year, the tips given the waitresses will be donated to "Arrow in the Smokies." After dinner, thanks to a joint effort on the part of the Program ,and Philanthropies Chairmen, the "hilly billy" sisters will be invited to an Arrowcraft Sale and a showing of slides about "Arrow in the Smokies." In addition to supporting the fraternity's national projects, Connecticut Alpha Chapter's philanthropic ideals are manifested in two local, projects: trips to the Mansfield Connecticut State School where sisters visit patients, and a foster child in Greece who is sup-ported through the chapter's friendship and contributions. GERALDINE ZORN Yankee Hernando's Hideaway VERMONT BETA Our national philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, needs no explanation for any Pi Phi. Each and every one of us realizes the importance of this national altruistic project and the opportunities it offers to others to help themselves through the Craft Workshop. Pi Beta Phi should be proud that it was the originator of a philanthropy which is not only a Craft Workshop, but also a market for the wares of weavers and craftsmen in the area. Vermont Beta donates each year to the Settlement School Fund, raising the money in numerous ways. Our main fund raising project is held each year on a Sunday in November and is entitled "Hernando's Hideaway." It is a spaghetti supper, served in "Hide-away" atmosphere, with live entertainment provided. This Pi Phi project has become a tradition on campus, and the number of people attending has increased so much each year that we are now holding three complete sittings! Our local philanthropy is the Vermont Heart Association for which we also raise funds, in what we feel is an enjoyable way. At the University of Vermont Homecoming Game, the Pi Phi's sponsor a candy apple sale with homemade apples. This has proved to be an extremely popular project, with the profits in-creasing each year. Whether working on Hernando's Hideaway, making or selling candied apples or giving volunteer time to the American Red Cross or the Tuberculosis Association, the sisters of Vermont Beta manage to stay busy giving of themselves but also realizing the satisfaction that comes from this giving. JANET STEFF Arrowcraft Kits for Sale! MASSACHUSETTS BETA The "Arrow in the Smokies" is a very real part of the lives of the girls of Massachusetts Beta. From our earliest days of pledging we are made aware of our purpose as Pi Phis. We are not merely a group of girls banded together for social aims, nor are we united solely to share in the sisterhood experience. This of course is a part of it. However, there is a very tangible reason for our belonging to a fraternity that of philanthropy. The Settlement School in Gatlinburg is a project dear to our hearts, for in maintaining this center, we have a genuine opportunity to help others. We can take pride in the fact that because of the aid of so many hundreds of Pi Phis, this school was established and has been maintained for more than half a century. Its handicrafts are known to be some of the best in the world. Our reward is the gratitude of those who are benefited by this center. This year, to do our share in promoting the "Arrow in the Smokies," we have sent for a sample kit from Arrowcraft which will contain various items of their handiwork. Committees are being set up for the general organization of the sale which will be held in November. The publicity committee will set to work on informing other members of the Greek system as well as non-Greeks all over campus of the sale. These crafts will make ideal Christmas gifts. The future of the Settlement School looks indeed bright. Pi Phi membership is forever increasing, and with new members come new ideas, new initiative. Those illustrious Pi Phis who established the Settlement School so many years ago aimed their arrows high, thus setting the pace for those who were to follow. Helping Others NEW YORK GAMMA Our centennial philanthropic project, "Arrow in the Smokies" shows Pi Beta Phi to be a mature organization capable of sup-porting itself and helping others. Our second hundred years will be typified by service in the education of the arts. We can be proud that we are mature enough to meet the challenge of educating others through our own desire to give. The accrediting of the Craft Center by the University of Tennesseee is perhaps the best indicator of outside trust in Pi Beta Phi. We are to be held responsible for the educating of many in the arts and crafts beyond the manipulation of materials. Those studying the arts and crafts will be able to express themselves in their media as well as accumulate credits. Only in a mature, responsible and respected organization would this be entrusted. We can be sure that Arrow in the Smokies will be a high water mark in the area of philanthropy. Since it is structured in such a way that no area of administration is left untouched, we can be assured that the inner workings of the project are well cared for. Our experience in the handling of the Arrowcraft work-shop will prove to be the starting point for this new project. We will be able to enlarge previous projects into a new one which will encorporate solid administration coordinated with the workings of the Craft Center. Helping others to help themselves is perhaps one of the most challenging of all problems today and is being faced by orders higher than our own fraternity. If we are to find our place in this endeavor, we must give. This is the keyword of "Arrow in the Smokies." The Settlement School in now matured. From here we 66 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI must work toward a new goal that of .a concentrated interest in the arts and craft education, in order to actualize the experience gained from previous projects. ROZANNE FARKAS Catalyst for Creativity in Society NEW YORK DELTA With the popularity today of such service projects as the Peace Corps and Vista, Pi Phis throughout the world can reflect with pride on the foresight of their older sisters. For the appearance of those indomitable wearers of the Arrow in Gatlinburg over five decades ago shows that Pi Beta Phi had al-ready penetrated a new frontier to fight for the betterment of their fellow man. Present day Gatlinburg clearly testifies to the tremendous success of our mission, but poses a new challenge as well: to project Gatlinburg beyond complacent prosperity toward being a catalyst for further creativity within the society. The gradual development of the Arts and Crafts Center illustrates Pi Beta Phi's belief that creativity springs from the individual; personal expression and satisfaction constitute the highest and ultimate good of crafts. In that way our Centennial Project, by expanding the opportunities for people of all ages and conditions to partake of the program, will exert an even greater regenerating influence on every individual. However, our project in the Smokies has also come to enjoy world-wide prestige and our new, ambitious program should inspire other craft centers to follow our pioneering step. Finally, our new institution will allow even more people the joy of viewing and possessing these crafts from the Smokies, intimately linking those distant consumers with the creative inspiration that forged the Arrow in the Smokies. As a chapter and as individuals the members of New York Delta are concerned about and interested in helping others when they most need it. The pledge training program is concerned with developing in each individual an interest not only specifically in Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic projects but also in developing an attitude of caring about the community in general which will be maintained throughout her life. A Settlement School Tea and Sale was planned in October to raise money for the Settlement School for the Arrow in the Smokies project. Christmas Orphan Party OHIO ALPHA Ohio Alpha has thought it would be a grand experience for an Ohio Alpha art major to be awarded a scholarship to the summer workshop each year. This would be sponsored in some way by Ohio Alpha. These girls would not only get training in their major, but they would be able to provide us with invaluable information concerning Settlement School as a whole. She could receive college credit at the same time. Another idea, although perhaps not as feasible, is that Pi Phi Art majors from various chapters be hired as Summer School instructors. They would be paid enough to cover their expenses, but not so much that it would be a profitable summer money-wise. Theywould get so much practical experience that the intangible rewards would be irreplaceable. Our chapter has two local philanthropic projects each year. One is an annual Christmas Orphan Party co-sponsored with the Sigma Chis. The other changes each year. This year it will be participation in the local UNICEF drive. We also sell within our own chapter some original Pi Phi Angel stationery de-signed by one of our girls. The profits from this go into our building fund for the new house. If some-thing like this were to be instituted throughout all the chapters, the proceeds could pay for a new National Arrow of the Smokies Scholarship. NANCY KINNISON Recognition of a Need OHIO BETA From the very beginning one hundred years ago, when our twelve founders bought coal and paid the rent for a Monmouth family who was unable to support itself, Pi Beta Phi has been actively involved in serving others. In 1912 we rose to a great educational need in an isolated community on the fringe of the Smoky Mountains. The original purpose was to reach the 3R's and to give special emphasis to industrial and agricultural training. This philanthropic effort has expanded over the years and has been a boom to Gatlinburg. But time moves on and needs change. As Pi Beta Phi stands on the threshold of its second century, it glances back only for encouragement from those who have gone before, then steps forward to meet a new, challenging, contemporary problem. A year-round Craft Workshop will offer professional instruction to those people who will then teach the skills to handicapped people the blind, the deaf, the elderly, the mentally retarded, and so forth. These are individuals of all age groups who have been untrained, unable to work, and financially dependent. This endeavor holds a maximum potential for service in our nation. With new skills of sewing, knitting, metal work, pottery, rug weaving, craft design, enameling, jewelry making, etc., these previously handicapped people can feel useful and contributive. It would be so easy in our rapidly changing, technologically-oriented society for these people to be for-gotten. But Pi Beta Phi has recognized the need and has devoted its time and money to this cause. (Two Ohio Beta girls will benefit from the Harriet Rutherford Johnstone Scholarship: Barbara Morrison and Kay Pattison. Opportunity for Service OHIO ZETA Our days at Ohio Zeta are busy, active ones. As sisters we participate together in all phases of fraternity life. We enjoy the pleasant seclusion of our own chapter, and its close bonds create a place apart for us. And yet, our hearts and hopes reach far beyond this secluded realm; we direct our thoughts not only inward, to one another, but also consistently upward and outward to identify with the vastness and pervasiveness of Pi Beta Phi and with the always new aspirings of our fraternity. It is with great pride and high hopes that we now THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 67 view these aspirings embodied so finely in the establishment of our sisterhood's newest philanthropy, "Arrow in the Smokies." We see "Arrow in the Smokies" as an opportunity for service unequalled even in our meritorious past. It holds a great potential for even bigger and better results than those achieved so effectively thus far. Because "Arrow in the Smokies" has been designed as a step beyond, though one highly coordinated with, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, we see its possibilities for effectiveness as greatly enhanced. Hopefully, it will be nurtured into an institution much like its forerunner but one which offers even more of the possibilities for creativity and craftsmanship and for aiding and yielding of ourselves for others. Arrowcraft Sales Lend Support D.C. ALPHA This year being our Centennial Year, the Pi Phis of the District of Columbia Alpha chapter want to lend total support to our national philanthropy, Settlement School. Through magazine sales and Arrowcraft sales we hope to make a contribution that will help Settlement School accomplish as much as it has since 1912 in Pi Beta Phi's next one hundred years. Helping others help themselves leaves a warm feeling in the hearts of the members of D.C. Alpha chapter and of Pi Phis around the world. MADELEINE WALKER Soundless Opportunity for Expansion VIRGINIA GAMMA The Pi Beta Phi philanthropy in Gatlinburg, Tennessee has snow-balled from its modest beginnings in 1910 as a memorial to the Pi Phi founders to a major source of education for people from this mountain area. Gatlinburg was chosen as the site for the sorority project because of the enormous education and health needs of the people. The school, opened in 1912 with 13 pupils, now has become an integral part of the Tennessee education system, and the number of students has increased many times. Also a part of the Pi Phi philanthropy is the Arrow Craft Shop. In 1945 the Summer Craft Workshop in conjunction with the University of Tennessee was given birth and is currently serving people from all over the world. If one looks at the value of our philanthropy, he is bound to recognize its infinite worth and nearly boundless possibilities for even further expansion. Supporting the latter part of this statement is the fact that the Tennessee education system has taken over a great deal of responsibility for the school, and consequently has given the Pi Phis more time for its Arrow Craft Shop, and for expanding into other services. It appears to the Virginia Gammas that the Arrow in the Smokies will continue to offer expanding realities as long as interest is shown; and as long as there is a need for something, the Pi Phis will strive to make it available. DONNA GORMAN Working with Special Groups VIRGINIA DELTA For over fifty years, the words Pi Beta Phi have meant to countless people the Settle ment School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. These words have meant friendship and assistance. Now with the celebration of Pi Beta Phi's Centennial, the character of the Pi Beta Phi philanthropy is changing its goals after long years, and is directing its energy toward an expanding Craft Shop. With the discontinuation of the Settlement School, the future of the "new" Arrowcraft Shop is one of unlimited opportunity. The Arrowcraft Shop is being expanded with the long-range idea that it will become a center of study and from which people can build outward. The programs planned for this year are quite ambitious, but it is the thought of future years that really excites the imagination! The study programs for this year include courses for amateurs, undergraduate and graduate students, teachers, designer craftsmen, volunteer leaders, and many more. However, it is in working with special groups, such as the handicapped, the aged, the under-privileged, the chronically ill, and the mentally retarded, that Pi Beta Phi as a philanthropy can do the greatest good. The thought of those children who are handicapped, or an old man who no longer feels useful to himself or society, being able to express themselves and to produce an item that they have created and that is recognized as being worthwhile, is thrilling. It is the idea of this kind of help and assistance that the ideals of Pi Beta Phi have always encouraged and advocated. CHRIS DAVIS Spaghetti Supper Support WEST VIRGINIA ALPHA Our chapter was in-formed of "Arrow in the Smokies" in full scope when our convention delegates gave their reports this fall. Every member thinks it is a fantastic idea. One hundred years is a long time to celebrate and we feel that starting a project like "Arrow in the Smokies" is the biggest way that all Pi Phis could celebrate. On the house tours during Rush the chapter always has one room reserved for explanation of our philanthropies. None of our members are using a fraternity scholarship at the present moment. The chapter has decided to start its own loan fund, however. Once a month it is going to have a spaghetti dinner to raise money. Anyone may come to it and all the chapter members help with this dinner in some way. $100.00 was cleared on the first dinner and I feel this will increase with publicity. Hopefully, we will be able to use some of this money to help with the "Arrow in the Smokies" project. MARCIA PUFFENBERGER Avenue for Concern NORTH CAROLINA BETA The expansion of Pi Beta Phi's national philanthropy, the Settlement School, through the Arrow in the Smokies, has heightened the interest of North Carolina Beta chap-ter. One of the distinct advantages of any organization is its potential service; and one of the bonds that holds the members of Pi Beta Phi together is concern 68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI for others. Arrow in the Smokies provides an excel-lent opportunity to take advantage of this concern. North Carolina Beta is planning an activity which will both promote good public relations and provide financial support for the new addition. An auction will be held for a fraternity wherein members of the chapter will be auctioned off. The highest bidder of each Pi Phi will have access to her services for a Saturday afternoon. She promises to wash his car, iron his shirts, or other tasks assigned to her. A bake sale will be held during the auction, and all proceeds will go to the Arrow in the Smokies. Local philanthropic projects have received increasing interest also. In past years the chapter has provided Thanksgiving baskets for needy families; given a Christmas party with a fraternity for orphans in the area; and the pledge class gave a party for some men-tally retarded children. This year two new projects have been added. Growing concern for the impoverished areas of the community surrounding the campus, with particular regard to the children, has resulted in a new program to help them. Each week a group of about fifteen children is brought to the campus. They meet with several Pi Phi's to learn about a variety of subjects. One week flowers were discussed, followed by a tour of the Duke gardens. Another week drama was explained, and the children produced their own play. As the year progresses it is hoped that the two groups will grow close together and personal relationships can be fostered. An additional Christmas project is also being planned. The Salvation Army provides dolls if volunteers will "dress" them. Each member can make an outfit during a regular meeting time, since the materials will be organized beforehand by the Philanthropies Chairmen. It is hoped that the project will both bring increased unity to the group, and be beneficial to the community. There has been an increasing amount of controversy on our campus concerning the worth of women's fraternities. A great deal of the value of Pi Beta Phi to its members is very personal and intangible. Philanthropies, both on the national and local level, are a vital factor in promoting good relations, as well as providing a meaningful involvement on the part of the participants. The expansion of Pi Beta Phi's existing philanthropy speaks for its success in the preceding years. North 'Carolina Beta is striving to make the next one hundred years even more meaningful. Monument to All Pi Phis SOUTH CAROLINA ALPHA Probably the first thing a Pi Phi learns is to be proud of her sorority, for Pi Phi has so many firsts to be proud of. One of these is being the first national sorority to create a philanthropic project. And almost as important as its being a first is the fact that as Pi Phis we all share the same goal in keeping our philanthropy going. In the Smokies one can see this project in real life. As close as our chapter is to Tennessee, the Smokies project is more than just a passing thought. Here we are provided an opportunity to see the project first hand. The Settlement School itself stands apart fromthe ever growing resort town and stands as a welcome and monument to all Pi Phis. There is a great future in our Settlement School now that its groundwork has been laid. The position of the school is ideal to reach out and grasp the en-tire area where people still need greater education facilities and training in skills. The school also can renew hope for reviving interest in the hand crafts. This chapter hopes that the Settlement School will continue to grow and tie the bonds of friendship not only to other Pi Phi sisters but to those who need help and faith. LINDA COULL Cultural and Economic Growth MICHIGAN DELTA Michigan Delta sees a great future for the Ri Beta Phi philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, both as a potentiality for service and as a creative institution. As a potential for service it will greatly benefit the people of the area by creating more jobs and by giving them the opportunity to improve their lives, both economically and culturally. By expanding the Arts and Crafts Center, there will be a greater opportunity for the people to express and develop their talents and skills in the arts and crafts. In addition to benefiting the local people, the expanded Center will be a great experience for art students, prospective teachers and any persons who are interested in art. The Arts and Crafts Center will greatly aid the economic condition of Gatlinburg and will bring in more business for the local craftsmen. To help bring about the dream of Arrow in the Smokies, Michigan Delta has had two Settlement School Sales, both of which were quite successful. One was held by the chapter in late Spring and the other was held by the Alumni Club in early November. In past years Michigan Delta has worked with needy children of the community. Last year the chap-ter adopted a family and also did work with a Catholic school. In addition to this, the chapter made tray favors for the local hospital. The chapter is still working with all three of these local philanthropies. JANE GRONBACK Christmas Village TENNESSEE BETA Tennessee Beta Pi Phis have been eagerly anticipating, and busily preparing for, Christmas Village. Sponsored by the Nashville Alumnae Club, Christmas village is held annually in mid-November at the Hippodrome in Nashville. Many local merchants set up booths at which their merchandise ranging from toys to plum puddings to sportswear is displayed and sold. The Arrowcraft Shop, too, has a booth at which its craftwork can be either bought or ordered. The proceeds from Christmas Village are donated to the Bill Wilkerson Speech and Hearing Center in Nashville. This year, Tennessee Beta Pi Phis decided to make and sell our own handiwork. The chapter was divided into four teams, to add an element of competition, and during the summer each Pi Phi made approximately ten "somethings" of her own choice. Thus the opportunity for originality and creativity was un THE ARROW OF Pt BETA PHI 69 bounded. This fall the response was amazing as we viewed the items which had been made during the summer, and discovered all sorts of "hidden" talent within the chapter. The items included such things as hand-painted waste baskets, felt Christmas stockings, covered match boxes, needlepoint calendars, crocheted coat hanger covers, hand-painted lap boards for studying, hairbows, antiqued card boxes and letter boxes, aprons, Christmas decorations, roller bags, hand-decorated stationery, pine cone flowers, and many, many more. JULIE MCGEHEE New Enthusiasm from Convention NORTH CAROLINA ALPHA Our convention delegate, in her report of the convention activities, enthusiastically spoke of the exhibit from the craft shop. She was able to give our chapter a better idea of the type and quality of work resulting from the Settlement School training. She was extremely impressed with the handicrafts and the obviously superior training that made them a possibility. Her enthusiasm stimulated the desire in all of us to perhaps make a trip as a group to see this craft work in Gatlinburg. The chapter plans to continue its magazine sale and hopefully do our share to help this beneficial and successful project expand even more rapidly in the future than it has in the past. We feel very proud to have been small contributors to a project so worthwhile. On our campus we will bear the meal and activity expense of a foreign exchange student this year. We also plan to sponsor a picnic for all undergraduate foreign students. KAREN DAVIS Development of Individual Skills INDIANA ALPHA In the early history of the quite serene Smoky Mountains, the tall proud evergreens stretch to reach the sun, the source of their life. The early mountain folk also had to look to the sun for their lives. They were farmers whose existence depended on the sun giving life to their crops. In 1912, Pi Beta Phi introduced a new light in their lives. The Settlement School was established in a valley high in the Smoky Mountains of Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The Settlement School acted like a sun in the development of the individual skills which the people of the mountains have. The Settlement School will be celebrating it's 56th. Anniversary this year, March 1968. Members of Indiana Alpha are proud of Emma Harper Turner, one of our founders, the Washington, D.C. Alpha Chapter and the Alumnae Club delegates from Washington, D.C. for initiating the idea of the Settlement School at the 1910 Convention. Just as the 111 colleges and universities, which house Pi Beta Phi Chapters, have given her members the opportunity to express their talents and skills, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School has given hundreds of people the opportunity to express their talents for making crafts. BETTE RICHARDSONFrom Abstraction to Reality INDIANA ZETA When the Indiana Zeta Pi Phi Chapter held its fifteenth anniversary luncheon this fall, the members were surprised and very pleased to find an-owcraft workshop samples on display. Until that day, the Arrow in the Smokies had been merely a vague abstraction in the minds of most of us. We had not realized that the skill and craftsmanship of those at the Arrow in the Smokies could result in such a variety of beautiful creations. Among the other activities ,at our anniversary luncheon, the Arrowcraft display renewed inspiration and pride in our national fraternity. Perhaps the awareness of and pride in our Pi Beta Phi philanthropy is part of that special quality Pi Phis all over the country seem to possess. As college women, it seems so very appropriate that we sponsor a project which does so very much to promote industry and creativity. All over the country Pi Phis can wear the golden arrow with special pride, not only as a symbol of our sisterhood, but also as a reminder of our philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. JANIS TRUSTY Gatlinburg Houseparty TENNESSEE GAMMA The members of the Tennessee Gamma chapter of Pi Beta Phi, feel most definitely that Arrow in the Smokies will become a reality. The success of our 'altruistic project of our first 100 years, the Settlement School, exemplifies the interest and effort of Pi Beta Phi's around the world. Our centennial project, the Art and Craft Center, will continue the Settlement School purpose of helping others to help themselves. Since our chapter at the University of Tennessee is the closest chapter to Gatlinburg, being only 40 miles away, we feel closely connected with the philanthropic projects of Pi Phi. Our chapter's "house party" is annually held in Gatlinburg and the pledges are given a tour of the Settlement School and Craft facilities. The Arrowcraft Shop is visited and utilized regularly by members of our chapter. The chapter has purchased an entire display of crafts from the Arrowcraft Shop to use during Fall Open House and at other times when our chapter suite is opened to visitors. Each year crafts from the shop are sold at a Christmas Bazaar in which all seventeen sororities on the University of Tennessee campus participate. We hope that in the future our chapter may help the Arrowcraft Shop in the distribution of crafts to active chapters and Alumnae Clubs across the nation and in Canada. The co-sponsorship of the Summer Craft Workshop by the University of Tennessee shows the interest of those outside the sorority in making the Pi Phi dream come true. We feel that through the utilization of facilities now in. Gatlinburg and through gifts and contributions, the Pi Phi Dream, Arrow in the Smokies, will become a center of craft development unequalled by any other. MARGARET S. YOUNG 70 THE ARROW OF N BETA PHI Pride from Proximity TENNESSEE DELTA Tennessee Delta takes special pride in our new Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, since it is located in our own state. By expanding the present accredited summer craft work-shop, adding new buildings and staff members, and maintaining the school on a year round basis, we feel that we will be giving others an opportunity for education and a fuller development of their talents in our second century of achievement. It is our hope that students will come to perfect their arts and crafts for use in rehabilitation, in teaching home economics and the mentally retarded. We give our support to this new project by asking both our members and pledges to purchase two magazines from the Pi Beta Phi magazine agency. Because we are near Gatlinburg, many of our members have had the privilege of visiting the Arrowcraft Shop. They have brought back to our chapter unique objects designed there, thus stimulating a genuine interest for some of our more talented members to attend the sessions. Our main philanthropic project last year was the adoption of a group of officers in Viet Nam. During the year we corresponded with them and sent them goodies and care packages. Projects for this fall include providing Thanksgiving baskets for needy families and Christmas gifts for underprivileged children and visiting an old folks home twice a week. We also support the Maternal Welfare League of Memphis, which is devoted to research in birth defects. We are indeed proud to make Pi Beta Phi a pioneer in its second century in a great philanthropy Arrow in the Smokies. SUSAN FEATHERSTON A Major Responsibility ALABAMA BETA "Airow in the Smokies" is our major responsibility now and in the future. We hope that our contribution will help bring this dream to a reality for Pi Phis and those who will benefit from the Arrow in the Smokies. The future of this project depends on the backing of the individual chapters. We plan to inform every member of the importance of this project and how each person can help. Our philanthropies chairman and program chairman have been working together to present several programs on the Arrow in the Smokies. Our chapter is very limited in ways of making money on campus, because of University rules against fund-raising events. Candy selling by the pledges in the spring is our only big fund-raising event. Of course the actives contribute a great deal to this project, too. Our main way of collecting funds is through individual contributions and these go to the Centennial Fund and the Settlement School. Even though we are limited in our ways of making money, we still take a great deal of pride in our philanthropies pro-gram. For our local philanthropy, we have several different projects for the year. Through the we sponsor a child of a needy family who receives guid-ance and care through a well-organized program. During Christmas, we help a fraternity give a Santa Claus party for children from the welfare department. This can be one of the most rewarding experiences to see the smiling faces of these children. Also the pledges give a party and presents to the mentally retarded children at Partlow's. Through these projects, Alabama Beta plans to con-tribute their time and efforts to our local philanthropies as well as to the "Arrow in the Smokies". JUDY LORD Contribution to Happiness and Independence ALABAMA GAMMA Of education, Abraham Lincoln said, . . . "I can only say that 'I view it as the most important subject that we as a people can be en-gaged in. . . ." With our new project, Arrow in the Smokies, Pi Beta Phi is engaging in the "important subject" of education. Our approach, however, is not the traditional readin', writin' and 'rithmetic one. By educating our senior citizens and the handicapped in the use of their talents, Arrow in the Smokies will open the door to a more useful and satisfying life for them. Alabama Gamma looks on Arrow in the Smokies as a way for each of us to contribute to the happiness and independence of others less fortunate than we. We are very enthusiastic about this new project and plan to support it wholeheartedly with our contributions. We are proud that Pi Beta Phi is pioneering yet another worthy and needed philanthropy. The Arrow in the Smokies will gleam brightly as it points upward the goal of a more full and rich life not only for those benefiting by the project, but also for those of us who will help to make it a success. MARGARET-ANNE HESTER All Out Support FLORIDA GAMMA In this the 100th year of Pi Beta Phi, Florida Gamma hopes to do everything it can to support the fraternity's Centennial project. The project, which is a Craft Workshop to be built in co-operation with the University of Tennessee, will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. The workshop will be located in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. We understand that the goal of this project is that it will become the outstanding center of education in the field of arts and crafts, drawing students from the United States, Canada and foreign nations instead of being limited to the local area. We realize that this project is quite an undertaking and that it cannot go on until the required funds are raised and made avail-able. One very successful fund raising project has already been accomplished by the girls of Florida Gamma. We put on a "Mister Legs Contest" one night in the school cafeteria. After a short speech by one of the girls about the Settlement School and the Centennial project and about just where the money would be THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 71 going, one boy from each fraternity marched around the tables in the costume which he thought would best show off his legs. Each boy was escorted by a pretty Pi Phi carrying a money box for the collection of "votes." It was all so much fun and such a success that we plan to make it a yearly thing. More fund raising projects are planned for the rest of the year as we of Florida Gamma feel that it is up to each of us to support this, the first philanthropic project supported by a fraternity and giving financial support through active chapters and alumni clubs to expand an educational program. KATHRYN ANN BROWN The Time Is Ripe! GEORGIA ALPHA--Arrow in the Smokies is living proof that the originators of the first national altruistic project of any woman's fraternity demonstrated remarkable foresight when they presented plans for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. What began as a rehabilitation center to insure the education of underprivileged residents has become a haven for art students, teachers, therapists, crafts-men and hobbyists. Because of its close proximity to the University of Georgia, which boasts one of the finest art schools in the nation, Arrow in the Smokies should continue to offer additional training to Georgia Alpha's and the nation's art students. There has been a strong in-crease in interest shown by Georgia citizens for art and cultural improvement in that field. Atlanta's new center for the performing arts, its museums and galleries have been revitalized and replenished by civic leaders aware of their importance in the community. The proposed changes and improvements at the Centennial Convention could not have come at a more opportune time in this area. The time is ripe for citizens throughout Georgia to be made aware of the expanded opportunities now available to them through Arrow in the Smokies. Georgia Alpha has conducted a minor public relations campaign for the fraternity philanthropy in the past during major rush seasons on campus. The products of the school, its mechanics, and its rewards are explained to hundreds of girls each year. Whether they are pledged to our chapter or not, these girls are made aware of the opportunities existing just a few hours from Athens. SUZANNE WEBB Project Yields International Benefits ILLINOIS EPSILON Illinois Epsilon was proud to be one of the top ten contributors to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Now, at the beginning of the fraternity's second one-hundred years, the chapter is enthusiastic about supporting our new project, Arrow in the Smokies. We are especially pleased that our organization, which has given so much to girls throughout the world, now has a project in which each of us can make contributions that will yield international benefits. As in the past, our chapter will continue to take advantage of all opportunities to advertize our philanthropic project. During rush we displayed a variety of Settlement School handicrafts. We also have plans for similar displays before Christmas and during Parents' Week-End. Our chapter feels that the success of Arrow in the Smokies will not be based solely upon monetary contributions. Only through national publicity outside of Pi Beta Phi circles will such a project become a reality, for as stated before, the benefits of Arrow in the Smokies can not help but be international, BETTY CARTER Tutoring Center WISCONSIN BETA The women of Wisconsin Beta are deeply interested in the work of our national philanthropies, especially Arrow in the Smokies. The employment which it offers to the needy people of the area undoubtedly raises their living standard and allows them the chance to enjoy a better life. However, our chapter is especially interested in the continual development of our native crafts which is fostered through the Arroweraft workshop and the new Arts and Crafts Center. It gives us all a genuine feeling of satisfaction to know that we are helping to keep a part of our American heritage alive, not only in Tennessee, but throughout the country. We realize that in our times of unrest and turbulence, our national philanthropy is working toward establishing good will throughout the world when the many foreign students who come to study return home with their new skills. Our chapter is now able to devote most of its time to our national philanthropy because we have already raised the necessary funds and achieved our goal for our local philanthropy, the Beloit Tutoring Center in Mississippi. This tutoring center has been greatly successful in the past few years in its work with the student classified as a "low achiever." And so our work goes on as we prepare for our Christmas bazaar to be held early in December to raise funds for our own Settlement School. We will be selling various types of handywork which we are now in the process of making. We happily continue this work in the true spirit of Pi Beta Phi. BETSY BLANEY What Does the Future Hold? MANITOBA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi became, with the initiation of the Settlement School at Gatlinburg, the first fraternity to have a national philanthropy; the first fraternity to show the world that they were a service instititution, not just a social club. In those early days, all that the Pi Phi's envisioned was a country school, bringing education where there had been none before, in honor of those twelve aspiring young women, so keenly interested in education them-selves, who had formed our Pi Phi. Our reality, in 1967 has grown far beyond their wildest dreams. Where there was no school, Pi Phi built a school; and staffed it, and, over the years, developed it into the university accredited institution it is today. Where there was no doctor, or even nurse, to care for the sick, aged and young children, Pi Phi brought in their own nurses, and doctors, and taught basic hygiene in 72 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the school; now there is a clinic and doctor in the town. When Pi Phi came to Gatlinburg, the hill people were poor, barely ekeing out an existence on their land. Pi Phi has taught these hill people crafts, and bought them the needed equipment; now there is thriving home industry, which Pi Phi supports in its Arrowcraft shops. Much indeed has been accomplished in the past fifty years at Gatlinburg. So who can say what the future holds for the Arrow in the Smokies? There is much that can still become, and more that we cannot envision today, but that will be accomplished. There is always a need for education, and always an opportunity for service. The future of Pi Phi holds far more than its past, at Gatlinburg in the Smokies. BARBARA EDMONDS Key to Pi Phi Future SOUTH DAKOTA ALPHA A century ago when the twelve founders of Pi Beta Phi met to organize a women's fraternity for the purpose of enhancing the nobility of womanhood, they faced the problem of proving what positive goal such an organization could accomplish. Today the same problem still exists for twentieth-century fraternity women. In comparison to the immensity of world conflicts, the acquiring of social graces and the finding of strength in the bonds of personal friendships cannot alone justify the existence of women's fraternal, groups. At a recent officers' retreat members of South Dakota Alpha heard their university's Coordinator of Student Affairs challenge them to ACT instead of REACT. Too often sororities and fraternities concentrate their efforts in rebelling against and attempting to reject the college regulations placed upon them. Truly this shows that they care and are alive, but why must every action be only a response? Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic project, Arrow in the Smokies, holds the key to the future of our college fraternity. Expanding the summer craft workshop is a definite step Pi Beta Phi can take forward showing to the public that we are not organized for the sole purpose of our personal advancement in the social aspects of life. It is pertinent for South Dakota A and all other chapters to recognize the new centennial plans for Arrow in the Smokies and show to the public that this too is the purpose of our fraternity. And thus, while doing this, we will be acting and advancing the welfare of others as well as ourselves. CINDY CIMPL Enthusiasm Spreads Rapidly MINNESOTA ALPHA At Minnesota Alpha, we had a change in feeling recently toward the Settlement School. That change is due mainly to three things. First, one of our members visited Gatlinburg last summer while on vacation and her stories about it have made it come alive for us. Secondly, our two delegates to Convention brought back an enthusiasm for Settlement School which is rapidly spreading to the whole chapter. Third, and, we feel, most important, is the new name which has been given to the project, Arrow in the Smokies. This name means more to us than the words "philanthropy" or "Settlement School." The word "Arrow" alone brings to mind the chain of friendship which exists coast to coast and generation to generation in Pi Beta Phi. It brings to mind the love and devotion we feel toward one another .and toward all that is good and true. It reminds us that we in Pi Beta Phi are striving for the highest ideals. Then, the joining of the word "Arrow" with the site of our philanthropy, the "Smokies," joins all these feelings to the Settlement School. It sets the tone for the spirit of Settlement School. Now that this spirit has become more apparent to us, it has become apparent also that it is our job to maintain and spread the spirit. To do this, we, first of all, made Settlement School a much larger part of Fall Rush Information Day. We told its story in more de-tail and displayed many of the craft. Throughout, we tried to convey the spirit of giving which started Settlement School and which keeps it growing year after year. Secondly, we have made it a point to leave the Arrowcraft catalog in the living room where waiting guests will pick it up. And we have coached all our members so that they can answer any questions the guests might ask about Gatlinburg and the School, or about the Arrowcraft Worshop and the ordering of the articles made there. Finally, we plan to add, to our annual Settlement School information program, the personal reactions of our active who visited Gatlinburg last summer and of a former active who spent a whole summer there. With these new ideas and spurred on by our new feelings about Arrow in the Smokies, we hope at Minnesota Alpha to make Settlement School known and loved, and therefore supported, by an ever-increasing number of people. J. MARCHE L Emphasis During Rush MISSOURI GAMMA Missouri Gamma puts emphasis on our national philanthropy project during rush. Because we think it is a unique idea and binds us in further sisterhood, we want to help bring success to Arrow in the Smokies. Rather than taking a chance in having some rushees miss our story by leaving discussion up to the individual rushers, we have our philanthropies chairman give a small talk on this subject to the entire group. She has a display of articles made at the Arrowcraft Shop set up and is ready to answer questions. We feel that the best way to show our interest to the public is through enthusiasm in our attitudes. We support the Settlement School as our chapter philanthropy and throughout the year we sponsor money-making projects to provide funds. Our annual mum sale at Homecoming is a major activity. We have great success with this project and are able to expand it as each year passes. Another project is the Rummage Sale we have for the public. A location in the city is sought that will provide us with the maximum expo-sure to the public. Each girl is responsible for a prearranged number of articles and rarely do we have much left after a two day sale. We also have some type of candy sale on campus, and we hope to have an apple sale later in the year. Each year we try to THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 73 have some other type of fund raising project in addition to our annual activities. Also, members are encouraged to order articles from the Settlement School through our chairman. Last year a senior, Sahanny Johnson, received the California Alpha Scholarship. We are proud to be taking active participation in support of Arrow in the Smokies. Each year we hope to build this participation and in this way push Arrow in the Smokies to great success. DEBBIE NELSON Inevitable Growth Seen ARKANSAS ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies definitely has a future, and as more than a dream in the minds of Pi Phis everywhere. With 111 active chapters and 339 alum clubs working in every state and in Canada, the entire settlement school project is bound to grow. At Arkansas Alpha, we work to promote the larger philanthropic project of Arrow in the Smokies and at the same time we are active on local projects. We have the Arrowcraft sale every year. Before the sale, we contact the alums and neighbors and faculty members, to let them know when we will have the display. By having the sale, we bring the entire Arrow in the Smokies project to the citizens of Fayetteville. The profits from the sale go back to the project. Recently our chapter joined the Chamber of Commerce and by this we hope to acquaint the Fayetteville community more with Pi Phi as a locally and nationally active fraternity. On a local level we carry on several philanthropic projects. This year we have adopted a young American Indian girl. We send money for her schooling and some of her needs and write to her often. Last year we were awarded a trophy from the Community Chest for giving the greatest contribution to their drive of all organizations on campus. We also have a Christmas party each year for underprivileged children in the community. JO ANN PRYOR Hope for the Future MISSISSIPPI ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies means hope, love, responsibility, opportunity, pride, and yield to Mississippi Alpha Pi Phis as well as Pi Phis throughout the nation. In 1912 with the organization of the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, the dream of almost half a century was realized, and each bounding step brought hope for the future to Pi Beta Phi and to those who come there to learn and work. Love, ever-present in Pi Beta Phi, found a special outlet in this national philanthropy as Pi Phis help others help themselves. Responsibility and opportunity were basic building blocks for the Settlement School. But of these pride and yield are the most important for they are interchangeable each producing the other, creating a never-ending, every-increasing cycle. At the turn of a century of happiness and growth, Pi Beta Phi adopts a centennial project which will follow in the footsteps of the Settlement School and the Arrowcraft Shop. Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the Summer Craft Workshop and will act in a more wide-ranged capacity to better meet the demands of a growing country and fraternity. Arrow in the Smokies has been made possible through planning and hard work, and with the continued support of every Pi Phi it cannot fail. EDDIE WELFORD Meeting Leisure's Challenge IOWA GAMMA Pi Beta Phi's Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is an expansion of the Craft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tenn., which is co-sponsored by the Fraternity and the University of Tennessee. The Craft Workshop offers a broad curriculum in the Arts and Crafts, and the courses offer college credit for graduate and undergraduate work. Today there is an increased amount of leisure time offered to our citizens due to automation and the specialized times. When this leisure time is added to the need in our society for individual creativity, the logical solution is a greater emphasis on arts and crafts. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, the opportunity for creative self-expression will be given. To further the growth of our philanthropy and help Arrow in the Smokies to become a reality, each chapter member must take an active interest in the project and help to raise money for its support. One way to do this is to hold Arrowcraft sales, which would acquaint our members with the quality and variety of articles made. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, it will enable individuals to develop their talents, the handicapped to become a little more independent, and older citizens to feel more worthwhile. An old Hindu Maxim sums up the responsibilities of each one of us. "He does not live in vain, who employs his wealth, his thought, his speech to advance the good of others." VICKI VOELKER Action Key to Success! IOWA ZETA Pi Beta Phi has always been concerned with helping others to help themselves, this is evident in the organization of Chapters and Clubs. This concern has been extended to people outside the membership of Pi Beta Phi through the program of the first philanthropy supported by a fraternity the Settlement School. In keeping with this idea Pi Beta Phi's Centennial project is a Craft Workshop in co-operation with the University of Tennessee to be built in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. It will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. As members of Iowa Zeta, we are proud to give our support in such an outstanding project. We know that creative arts have been found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also our Alumnae Clubs can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Se74 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. Creative crafts develop skill, provide an outlet for self-expression, increase sensitiveness as to surrounding giving dignity to common things, bring the handicapped into better adjustment, and are .a delight to the adventuresome. Iowa Zeta realizes that we must look at the coming of the new. All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. This is only possible with the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. As members of Iowa Zeta, we pledge our loyal support and are proud that we can contribute to such an excellent project. To know that we are helping other people as well as our members, sparks a feeling of pride and it is a pleasure to say that we belong to such a wonderful organization as Pi Beta Phi. ANN MONTGOMERY Improved Publicity Planned NEBRASKA BETA Nebraska Beta has started an interesting new local philanthropic project this year by offering its services to the Nebraska State Hospital. Five members a week, consisting of three actives and two pledges, work as volunteers in the hospital lounge or canteen. In this manner they are able to serve as cashiers, waitresses, and fountain girls and at the same time build positive relationships with the patients. In addition to our new local philanthropic project Nebraska Beta is planning to hold its annual Settlement School sale. Posters, announcements, and news-paper coverage will aid in publicizing the sale, which will be open to the entire campus. It is hoped that profits from this sale and magazine sales will help establish support for another Nebraska Beta project one aimed at making the benefit of Arrow in the Smokies known to more than just Pi Phis. With help from local newspapers and campus newspapers a brief description of the aims of Arrow in the Smokies will be presented. Members of the Lincoln Weaving Club and other local craft clubs will be encouraged to con-tact our chapter for information about sponsorship to Tennessee in the form of a loan or scholarship. Public relations will be improved and Pi Phi's achievements and opportunities will be made available to many out-side of our chapter. Nebraska Beta feels that the greatest way it can make Arrow in the Smokies meaningful is by sponsoring a member who can benefit from the experience . . . a member outside of our own chapter. KITTY MCMANUS Success Through Support KANSAS BETA Pi Beta Phi was founded by twelve girls at Monmouth College in 1867. Since that time its membership has grown enormously and has spread to college campuses throughout the United States and Canada. Similarly Arrow in the Smokies should grow and grow. It will do so 'because the same enthusiastic spirit and love for Pi Phi will be behind it. There are already signs of this "success through support." The idea of a centennial project was first realized at the 1954 Convention. Since that time interest has been great. Last year over one hundred thou-sand dollars was contributed to "Arrow in the Smokies !" As time goes on and Pi Phi's continue to be generous with this, their outstanding philanthropic project, Gatlinburg, Tennessee should be a huge center of activity. Numerous buildings will be gradually constructed for art and craft classes until it will be a complete center. Then this Craft Center will be of tremendous benefit to its teachers and students, as well as artists everywhere. Preserving the native arts and crafts of our country, it should become a well-known and respected cultural project. Even more important, as "Arrow in the Smokies" grows, so will the reputation of Pi Beta Phi. Through its outstanding achievements and its numerous philanthropic projects from the time of its founding, Pi Phi has already demonstrated to others its high standards and principles. Now, because of this wonderful Centennial Project, the name "Pi Beta Phi" could become synonomous with "service." And as this spirit of Pi Phi, which began in 1867, continues to grow, so will the 1967 Centennial Project "Arrow in the Smokies." MARSHA GARRETT Serving Mankind OKLAHOMA ALPHA What are the purposes of a Pi Beta Phi philanthropic project in the Smokies? This is a question that we at Oklahoma Alpha are asking and have attempted to answer. The necessity of vocational training is one answer to the need for the Pi Phi service project. Vocational training can bring industries to the area, provide jobs and give the skilled worker a sense of accomplishment. The type of craftmanship learned from the project is another answer to our question. Not only can skilled industrial techniques be taught, but skills in the crafting of handmade articles. If the handcrafting skills of the people of the Smokies can be preserved, Pi Phi can preserve the past for the future. Not only will the lives of the people of the Smokies be enriched but the lives of everyone who views their craftmanship. If we, as part of the Greek system can reach beyond our realm of membership and aid others, we have served not only ourselves but mankind. By providing service outside our membership, this project can not only answer our goal of service but can be-come our theme for the next hundred years of fraternity growth. NANCY BREEDEN Fund-raising Projects Unlimited! OKLAHOMA BETA Members of Pi Beta Phi, have always tried to be of service to the people around us and to people in need. A momentous step was taken THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 75 when in 1910, we began laying the plans for our Arrowcraft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. From this time, much progress has been made and we here at Oklahoma Beta are proud of our fraternities lead in the area of philanthropy. The Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is another significant step for our fraternity. It is one of the best ways in which the art of hand made crafts and skills can be perpetuated. Our chapter feels that there are many possibilities for the Arrow in the Smokies. With the increased amount of leisure time of our society and the growing number of people over sixty-five, there is a need to find a creative and constructive outlet for our human energies. The Arrow in the Smokies 'can provide this outlet by giving many a place to come and learn while perpetuating the art of crafts. There is also the possibility of the Arrow in the Smokies as a training ground for instructors who could help with the rehabilitation of those people in our nation who need the therapy of learning an enjoy-able, constructive, and physically beneficial skill. It is with these possibilities and others that we see the potential which lies in the creation of this new philanthropy. In our own chapter we try to publicize our philanthropy through our annual Arrowcraft Sale. As a chapter, we also sponsor an annual Easter Egg hunt for the Underprivileged children in town. In the past we have also provided food for a needy family at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The variety of possible fund-raising projects for the support of our Centennial Project seems to be unlimited. There is always the possibility of collecting all the loose personal items which are left in the lounge and then selling them back to the members at a small fee. The old stand by of a rummage sale has always been a profitable project for our chapter. These are some of the ideas that our chapter has concerning our new Centennial Project and it is with great hope and much expectation that we look for-ward to seeing what the future will hold for Pi Beta Phi and her philanthropy work. A New Dream TEXAS ALPHA In 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee was established as a memorial to the founders of our fraternity. Now fifty-five years later that dream has become a reality and in this our centennial year we have a new dream. Our Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, will be our major philanthropy as we start in this our second century as a Fraternity. Texas Alpha is very enthusiastic and interested in the growth and development of our newest project, Arrow in the Smokies. As the summer craft workshop is being expanded into larger sessions and more courses of study, many of our members feel that their education would be greatly enriched if they studied at the craft workshop. Especially promising to the members of Texas Alpha will be the instructions given in therapy, teaching, and in doing volunteer work. We are always interested in learning new hobbies and crafts aid many of our members are planning to spend their summers at the Settlement School learning more about these things. Pi Beta Phi and Texas Alpha will be looking for-ward to our new philanthropy. We hope that every chapter and alum club will do their part in helping to make our next hundred years as profitable and re-warding as our past hundred years has been. LYN ARNOT Importance Realized TEXAS BETA The national philanthropic project of Pi Beta Phi which was once a dream to a few, is now a reality of which every Pi Phi can, and should be proud. Gatlinburg once only a village of isolated people has now become a productive community. The Texas Beta Pi Phis are proud to assist in this national project through annual contributions. We also have several local philanthropic projects. A number of our girls tutor in connection with a YMCA program. We also take part in "Rag Mop", through which we collect clothes for Goodwill Industries. Each year we participate in a campus-wide project in connection with Greek Week. This year we cleaned up a YMCA camp. We now sponsor two foreign orphans, sending them clothes, food, and special gifts on holidays. Each Christmas we have a party for a group of orphans, complete with our own female version of Santa Claus. We of Texas Beta realize the importance of philanthropic projects. We feel that through helping others, we, ourselves, become better people. Our thoughts can be expressed by a comment made to a Pi Phi alum by a local resident of Gatlinburg, "You Pi Phis really are angels." Active Alumnce Cooperation NEW MEXICO ALPHA At present New Mexico Alpha is involved in a magazine selling campaign to raise money for the Settlement School Fund. Each girl in the chapter will be required to sell two magazines. It was decided that this was not too much to ask. Part of this money will be used to support the Arrow in the Smokies and we feel that this will be a step in the right direction for helping it become a reality. Our active chapter does not have a local philanthropy, although our alums do. They help support Casa Angelica, a home for retarded children in Albuquerque. Last year through a home designer show they earned enough money to purchase a station wagon for the home. We helped the Alums in providing a free babysitting service for the mothers who came to see the show. Each semester our chapter gives the Mary Lovelace scholarship to a deserving active. This scholarship pays for the active's dues for the semester for which she earned it. Doug Munson was the recipient of the scholarship for this semester. A Broader Dream UTAH ALPHA In March 1912, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in the Great Smokey Mountains, was opened to thirteen eager, young students, only two short years after it was decided at convention that an educational project should be established in memory of our founders. At first the Settlement School, the first national phi76 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI lanthropy of its kind, provided an education to the mountain people through home teaching, but soon land was secured on which to build a school house, in spite of the reluctancy of the townspeople. Through the years, the once small community has expanded into a large town which now draws about five million tourists a year. At the present time the town consists of the Arrowcraft Workshop, a health center, a school house, the Loom House, and a dormatory, the Red Bard, to accommodate some of the students. Every year, hundreds of children and adults come to Gatlinburg from all parts of the country to learn all the crafts taught there. It is by these people that all the jewelry, wood craft and loom work available through every Pi Beta Phi chapter is made. All proceeds from the sale of these things goes back to the Settlement School for improvements and expansion. Every Pi Phi chapter in the United States and Canada supports our Settlement School and through each individual chapter's philanthropies program, we are able to promote improvement of the school both through the sale of the Craft Shop products and their money-making projects directed toward raising money to donate to the school. In Utah Alpha we have had a great deal of support of the Settlement School through the sale of the crafts. It is pleasing to know that people not even associated with Pi Phi call to inquire about the merchandise and the school that they've heard about from friends. Thus it is evident that the fame of the Settlement School has spread all over the country and through this continuing expansion and rise in sup-porters, the dream of a bigger, better and more adequate Settlement School will soon be a reality. KIM KOLLER "King" Crowned for Settlement School MONTANA ALPHA In the summer of 1966 two of our members, Marilyn Fitzgerald and Judi O'Donnell, had the privilege and opportunity to visit the Arrow in the Smokies. They had of course studied about Pi Beta Phi's outstanding philanthropy but both agreed they were not prepared for the large, modern school which greeted them. Several people told them how thankful and indebted they are to Pi Phi and what a wonderful project we have. One man in particular told them that his son was to graduate the following year because of assistance the Pi Phis had given him. The girls strongly urge all Pi Phis to take any opportunity they have to visit our Arrow in the Smokies. "Every member of Pi Beta Phi can be proud of this project because we are looking beyond our needs to those of others. We are not only helping others, we are preserving a beautiful art for the benefit of all. Because Montana Alpha feels that this national philanthropy is so important we do not sponsor any particular local philanthropy. Each year we hold a contest for the `King of the Hill' in which one member of each fraternity is nominated by his fraternity for this honor. These men are invited to the house several times and are asked to present some form of entertainment for us. The members of our house then vote for one of the men and on a Saturday night we hold a campus-wide `Derby Dance' to crown the winning`King of the Hill.' The other candidates are then our `Brothers of the Arrow.' The proceeds from the dance are sent to the Arrow in the Smokies as our donation. We are very proud that last year Montana Alpha donated the largest contribution. We feel that a project such as ours would be a good method for any chapter to use to promote our national philanthropy. CAROLE POFFENBERGER The Realm of "Others" WASHINGTON ALPHA Our philanthropic project in the Smokey Mountains area is the fulfillment of ,a desire embedded deep in every Pi Phi heart. College life is full of the everyday hustle and bustle of schoolwork, campus activities, dates, and friends. Our philanthropic project adds a meaningful dimension to a college career: We project ourselves beyond the realm of "self'' to the realm of "others." Because we feel that Gatlinburg is one of the primary responsibilities of our House, the Pi Phi's at Washington Alpha display the material crafts as well as the spiritual ideals of this once backward area during our September Rush. We want these prospective pledges to see the deeper meaning behind Pi Beta Phi. Each Fall, we are reminded of the significance of the Smokey Mountains project. Hundreds of people in Gatlinburg are being educated through the nationwide effort of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity; they are learning a livelihood in handicrafts; they are gaining self-respect. How do we at Washington Alpha Chapter help the Smokey Mountains project: In the Fall our House sponsors a sale of the handicrafts produced by the craftsmen of Gatlinburg. This sale provides a market for the crafts; it is open to anyone. All the girls in the house enjoy setting up the display, especially when the products are so varied. Anything from brooms to mugs to jewelry to stationery can be found at the sale. It's always fun to give the buyers a little background on our project and what it means to us. This not only makes the crafts more meaningful, but helps us to take an active part in this altruistic project! We at Washington Alpha are anxious to do our part in helping to promote the success of the people at Gatlinburg. The progress shown to date is certainly an inspiration to us all. PAM WAGNER The Warm Feeling of Giving WASHINGTON BETA The Washington Beta chapter feels that the Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the present opportunity for Pi Phi's to give of their service, time and money. We are planning to have a Settlement School program to inform members of the project and the potentials and opportunities which it opens to us. After enthusiasm is raised, a fund-raising project will follow. This project, Penny a Pound for Pi Phi (an idea from Wisconsin Beta) will tax each girl a penny for each pound of her weight. The pennies will be pasted on a poster board in the shape of a huge piggy bank for display. We feel that with adequate support this project will develop into a vital institution. It will, enrich the lives of those who take advantage of its facilities, learn a trade and become productive citizens; as well THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 77 as the lives of those who benefit from the usefullness of the products. In the age of mechanization, the Arrow in the Smokies will play its part in preserving creativity and personal pride in an object, as contrasted to the impersonal qualities of a machine-made product. . The members of Washington Beta are very proud of the philanthropies project, not only because working together towards a common goal brings unity to Pi Phi's everywhere, but also because of the personal opportunities, creative and technical, which it brings to so many. This project enables everyone to experience the warm feeling of giving. AMY RADEWAN A Worthwhile Program OREGON ALPHA Oregon Alpha of Pi Beta Phi feels that the Centennial Project: "Arrow In The Smokies" is a new and exciting addition. The Summer Craft Workshop has proved itself to be beneficial and rewarding to everyone involved, and with the expansion of more workshops, more and more people will be reached. The Craft Workshops, are beneficial in many ways. The inhabitants of the Gatlinburg area are able to gain a living because of the tourist trade drawn there, the instructors and the assistants of the Summer Craft Workshops are earning a living besides fullfilling their own aesthetic needs. The students are learning the crafts taught in order that they might re-turn to their homes and teach others. This is a never ending circle because ell those taught will continue to expand and teach others. We feel that it is an honor that Pi Beta Phi is in co-operation with the University of Tennessee in such a worthwhile program. Oregon Alpha is planning on having a skit-dinner to inform the chapter members of the Arrow in the Smokies Program. For our fund raising project we would like to have an Arrowcraft Shop Sale before the Christmas holidays. We feel the citizens of Eugene and the University of Oregon Student Body would be very interested in our crafts, and this would spread knowledge of our Centennial project, besides helping to raise our funds. Oregon Alpha's main philanthropic project is helping teach in the Handicapped Children's Swimming Program. Pi Phi, Marsha Almeter, is in charge of the program. NANCY ELMGREN A Conscious Endeavor OREGON BETA The members of Oregon Beta are very proud to be a part of Pi Beta Phi's new philanthropy project, Arrow in the Smokies. Pi Beta Phi must grow to meet the needs of it's members and nation alike. We must continue to broaden our horizons and since we are founded as a scholastic organization in what way could we better serve than by supplying an opportunity for education. Thoreau said: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeaver. Our conscious endeavor for this next one hundred years is Arrow in the Smokies. Through education we will preserve and extend our national heritage. Thus we are building a brighter future from the past. We are expanding to fill present and fu'ture needs and by doing this we will continue to grow as an organization of college women. We must not forget our heritage; we must preserve it. Oregon Beta feels that Arrow in the Smokies will help to preserve this heritage as it helps to educate our people and by helping to preserve our past will help to build a stronger and more united future. We can only wait to see what light our flame has cast by the end of this, our second, century.. Our hope is that it will continue to grow in brightness as it has during our past century. Services Extended IDAHO ALPHA Pi Beta Phi .can truly be proud of its nationally renowned philanthropic establishment, Arrow in ,the Smokies. Due to the dedication and loyalty of many individual Pi Phi alums and the support of many active chapters, and ,alum clubs, this project has grown since its establishment in 1910, by the Settlement School committee, to a greatly enlarged and expanded program partly affiliated with the University of Tennessee and making meaningful and productive the lives of many previously poor and backward people. This year, along with Pi Beta Phi's Centennial celebration, a great program is being put .into effect to expand and build this philanthropic project so that more of its services can be extended to make an even greater contribution. Idaho Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi would, like to greatly congratulate the leaders in this program and offer a Centennial wish that the Arrow in the Smokies may grow and expand in Gatlinburg, and perhaps in the future, even in. other locations where the need is great. Through our philanthropic project, all Pi Phis can make a significant contribution to the realization of Pi Phi ideals. In the area of public relations, Idaho Alpha Chap-ter of Pi. Beta Phi has contributed to the Fund for the Performing Arts Center here at the University of Idaho, a 6-million-dollar project, and also to the Cam-pus Chest Fund. CHERYL KOCH "Bigger and Better" CALIFORNIA GAMMA California Gamma, like all Pi Phi Chapters, has always been especially proud of our heritage as the pioneer in women's fraternities. As a non-profit organization we have always been proud to point out our high scholastic standards and social activities but, today, we are even prouder of the philanthropic projects that our sorority has developed. Now as Pi Beta Phi starts its second century our Chapter feels that our new philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, will be "bigger and better" yet. Because we do live across the, country it is SOMetimes difficult for us to really see the good that is being accomplished by these projects. We support them 'but we do not really know that much about 78 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI them. To remedy this we are currently planning a program for early November which will not only tell about our philanthropies, but which will, we hope, show another reason why we can be so proud to be Pi Phis. But the idea is not just to learn about and to support morally our philanthropies. We could all talk for hours about how proud we are of what we are doing and what a great project Arrow in the Smokies is but that will not make it a success. As Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice President of Philanthropies said in the September 1967 ARROW the important word for this and all other philanthropies is "yield". Our chapter realizes this and consequently we are also going to try to initiate plans for more publicity and for some fund-raising projects that will show our sup-port. California Gamma feels that the key to the success of this Centennial Project and to Pi Beta Phi's second century lies in the contributions of each and every Chapter. CHRISTI HUGGINS Symbol of Pride CALIFORNIA DELTA The year 1967 marked for Pi Beta Phi one hundred years of sisterhood through fraternity life. Yet only half a century ago that sister-hood became truly meaningful with the establishment of the national philanthropy. The Settlement School has become a symbol of pride. Not yet a member, a pledge wonders what Pi Phi represents. She questions what the purpose of Pi Phi is and what it means to national, the members, and finally to herself. She discovers the true significance of Pi Phi when she learns about the Settlement School. The school synibolizes Pi Phi's higher values and goals. The educational centers and workshops of Gatlin-burg endure and expand with the devotion and interest of actives across the nation. Donations from each chapter and alumni continually pour into the school as a genuine expression of support for the work and progress made by the philanthropy. Future expansion made possible by the donations will focus on the pro-motion of education for all types of people. Students, teachers, doctors, industrial technicians, and even re-tired persons will benefit from the classes offered. The Settlement School of Gatlinburg symbolizes the ideals of its founders and its donors and is truly something of value. LINDA DAVIS Native Crafts Kept Alive! CALIFORNIA EPSILON--Pi Beta Phi's Arrow ex-tends across the entire nation. When each Pi Phi thinks of service, her thoughts are pointed upward to that special place high in the Smokies. Here we find the starting point for the first sorority to establish their philanthropy. Pi Beta Phi felt this such a worthy endeavor it has been maintained ,all through the years. Being the oldest fraternity for women, Pi Phi's felt the need to keep alive one of the oldest and true American art cultures. Industrialism is rapidly causing the extinction of true handicrafts, but Arrow in the Smokies providesthe opportunity for these people to keep their native craft still alive. Besides the mere craft aspect, employment is created along with the recreational aspect of the school. For those people merely interested in learning a craft, the opportunity is constantly provided for them. Because university credit is given, it allows those seeking a profession in art to continue their work. The future of the Arrow in the Smokies is tremendous. Expansion of this foundation cannot help but grow because of the support it has received and will continue to receive. The second hundred years will prove to be as successful as the first hundred because Arrow in the Smokies keeps alive for future generations the artistic heritage of that area of the United States. SUSAN DRISCOLL Tremendous Job Ahead NEVADA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi can be more than hopeful about its philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. This dream of building an Arts and Crafts addition to the University of Tennessee will become a reality, just as the Settlement School has. Through the financial and moral assistance of every Pi Phi, the Settlement School has grown to be one of the largest crafts' centers of the United States. If we look at the past success of our Settlement School, we cannot fail in our hope for the future, Arrow in the Smokies. As hopeful as we are, we must realize that the construction of such a project is a tremendous job which will need the support of every member. The Pi Phis at Nevada Alpha Chapter are organizing two projects to raise funds for Arrow in the Smokies. We plan to have a Sandwich Sale and a Spaghetti Feed. Our advertisements for both these functions will explain Arrow in the Smokies, and the importance of this philanthropy should aid our success. The Sandwich Sale will consist of selling Poor Boy sandwiches to campus residents on two Sundays. The Spaghetti Feed will also be on a Sunday, because the campus cafeteria only serves brunch on Sundays. We will have the dinner on or near the University, pre-pare it ourselves, and only charge a dollar for tickets sold in advance. We hope to receive a good profit which we will donate to Arrow in the Smokies. If every Pi Phi Chapter can do something similar, Arrow in the Smokies will be transformed from a dream into a reality. STEPHANIE LORIGAN Art Appreciation Continues! ARIZONA ALPHA The Arizona Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi highly commends the progress and great eagerness toward our new Centennial project of 1966 through 1967. We are very enthusiastic to increase aid to the underprivileged people in the Gatlinburg area. By enlarging the Summer Craft Workshop, we may be able, not only to help these poverty-stricken mountain people, but also to increase the knowledge of dying traditional crafts such as stitchery and weaving that have been so much a part of the early pio (Continued on page 87) i Beta Phi Pledges These young ladies pledged Pi Beta Phi chapters at colleges and universities with a fall rush or open rush in the first semester of the 1967-68 school year.

        66 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI must work toward a new goal that of .a concentrated interest in the arts and craft education, in order to actualize the experience gained from previous projects. ROZANNE FARKAS Catalyst for Creativity in Society NEW YORK DELTA With the popularity today of such service projects as the Peace Corps and Vista, Pi Phis throughout the world can reflect with pride on the foresight of their older sisters. For the appearance of those indomitable wearers of the Arrow in Gatlinburg over five decades ago shows that Pi Beta Phi had al-ready penetrated a new frontier to fight for the betterment of their fellow man. Present day Gatlinburg clearly testifies to the tremendous success of our mission, but poses a new challenge as well: to project Gatlinburg beyond complacent prosperity toward being a catalyst for further creativity within the society. The gradual development of the Arts and Crafts Center illustrates Pi Beta Phi's belief that creativity springs from the individual; personal expression and satisfaction constitute the highest and ultimate good of crafts. In that way our Centennial Project, by expanding the opportunities for people of all ages and conditions to partake of the program, will exert an even greater regenerating influence on every individual. However, our project in the Smokies has also come to enjoy world-wide prestige and our new, ambitious program should inspire other craft centers to follow our pioneering step. Finally, our new institution will allow even more people the joy of viewing and possessing these crafts from the Smokies, intimately linking those distant consumers with the creative inspiration that forged the Arrow in the Smokies. As a chapter and as individuals the members of New York Delta are concerned about and interested in helping others when they most need it. The pledge training program is concerned with developing in each individual an interest not only specifically in Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic projects but also in developing an attitude of caring about the community in general which will be maintained throughout her life. A Settlement School Tea and Sale was planned in October to raise money for the Settlement School for the Arrow in the Smokies project. Christmas Orphan Party OHIO ALPHA Ohio Alpha has thought it would be a grand experience for an Ohio Alpha art major to be awarded a scholarship to the summer workshop each year. This would be sponsored in some way by Ohio Alpha. These girls would not only get training in their major, but they would be able to provide us with invaluable information concerning Settlement School as a whole. She could receive college credit at the same time. Another idea, although perhaps not as feasible, is that Pi Phi Art majors from various chapters be hired as Summer School instructors. They would be paid enough to cover their expenses, but not so much that it would be a profitable summer money-wise. Theywould get so much practical experience that the intangible rewards would be irreplaceable. Our chapter has two local philanthropic projects each year. One is an annual Christmas Orphan Party co-sponsored with the Sigma Chis. The other changes each year. This year it will be participation in the local UNICEF drive. We also sell within our own chapter some original Pi Phi Angel stationery de-signed by one of our girls. The profits from this go into our building fund for the new house. If some-thing like this were to be instituted throughout all the chapters, the proceeds could pay for a new National Arrow of the Smokies Scholarship. NANCY KINNISON Recognition of a Need OHIO BETA From the very beginning one hundred years ago, when our twelve founders bought coal and paid the rent for a Monmouth family who was unable to support itself, Pi Beta Phi has been actively involved in serving others. In 1912 we rose to a great educational need in an isolated community on the fringe of the Smoky Mountains. The original purpose was to reach the 3R's and to give special emphasis to industrial and agricultural training. This philanthropic effort has expanded over the years and has been a boom to Gatlinburg. But time moves on and needs change. As Pi Beta Phi stands on the threshold of its second century, it glances back only for encouragement from those who have gone before, then steps forward to meet a new, challenging, contemporary problem. A year-round Craft Workshop will offer professional instruction to those people who will then teach the skills to handicapped people the blind, the deaf, the elderly, the mentally retarded, and so forth. These are individuals of all age groups who have been untrained, unable to work, and financially dependent. This endeavor holds a maximum potential for service in our nation. With new skills of sewing, knitting, metal work, pottery, rug weaving, craft design, enameling, jewelry making, etc., these previously handicapped people can feel useful and contributive. It would be so easy in our rapidly changing, technologically-oriented society for these people to be for-gotten. But Pi Beta Phi has recognized the need and has devoted its time and money to this cause. (Two Ohio Beta girls will benefit from the Harriet Rutherford Johnstone Scholarship: Barbara Morrison and Kay Pattison. Opportunity for Service OHIO ZETA Our days at Ohio Zeta are busy, active ones. As sisters we participate together in all phases of fraternity life. We enjoy the pleasant seclusion of our own chapter, and its close bonds create a place apart for us. And yet, our hearts and hopes reach far beyond this secluded realm; we direct our thoughts not only inward, to one another, but also consistently upward and outward to identify with the vastness and pervasiveness of Pi Beta Phi and with the always new aspirings of our fraternity. It is with great pride and high hopes that we now THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 67 view these aspirings embodied so finely in the establishment of our sisterhood's newest philanthropy, "Arrow in the Smokies." We see "Arrow in the Smokies" as an opportunity for service unequalled even in our meritorious past. It holds a great potential for even bigger and better results than those achieved so effectively thus far. Because "Arrow in the Smokies" has been designed as a step beyond, though one highly coordinated with, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, we see its possibilities for effectiveness as greatly enhanced. Hopefully, it will be nurtured into an institution much like its forerunner but one which offers even more of the possibilities for creativity and craftsmanship and for aiding and yielding of ourselves for others. Arrowcraft Sales Lend Support D.C. ALPHA This year being our Centennial Year, the Pi Phis of the District of Columbia Alpha chapter want to lend total support to our national philanthropy, Settlement School. Through magazine sales and Arrowcraft sales we hope to make a contribution that will help Settlement School accomplish as much as it has since 1912 in Pi Beta Phi's next one hundred years. Helping others help themselves leaves a warm feeling in the hearts of the members of D.C. Alpha chapter and of Pi Phis around the world. MADELEINE WALKER Soundless Opportunity for Expansion VIRGINIA GAMMA The Pi Beta Phi philanthropy in Gatlinburg, Tennessee has snow-balled from its modest beginnings in 1910 as a memorial to the Pi Phi founders to a major source of education for people from this mountain area. Gatlinburg was chosen as the site for the sorority project because of the enormous education and health needs of the people. The school, opened in 1912 with 13 pupils, now has become an integral part of the Tennessee education system, and the number of students has increased many times. Also a part of the Pi Phi philanthropy is the Arrow Craft Shop. In 1945 the Summer Craft Workshop in conjunction with the University of Tennessee was given birth and is currently serving people from all over the world. If one looks at the value of our philanthropy, he is bound to recognize its infinite worth and nearly boundless possibilities for even further expansion. Supporting the latter part of this statement is the fact that the Tennessee education system has taken over a great deal of responsibility for the school, and consequently has given the Pi Phis more time for its Arrow Craft Shop, and for expanding into other services. It appears to the Virginia Gammas that the Arrow in the Smokies will continue to offer expanding realities as long as interest is shown; and as long as there is a need for something, the Pi Phis will strive to make it available. DONNA GORMAN Working with Special Groups VIRGINIA DELTA For over fifty years, the words Pi Beta Phi have meant to countless people the Settle ment School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. These words have meant friendship and assistance. Now with the celebration of Pi Beta Phi's Centennial, the character of the Pi Beta Phi philanthropy is changing its goals after long years, and is directing its energy toward an expanding Craft Shop. With the discontinuation of the Settlement School, the future of the "new" Arrowcraft Shop is one of unlimited opportunity. The Arrowcraft Shop is being expanded with the long-range idea that it will become a center of study and from which people can build outward. The programs planned for this year are quite ambitious, but it is the thought of future years that really excites the imagination! The study programs for this year include courses for amateurs, undergraduate and graduate students, teachers, designer craftsmen, volunteer leaders, and many more. However, it is in working with special groups, such as the handicapped, the aged, the under-privileged, the chronically ill, and the mentally retarded, that Pi Beta Phi as a philanthropy can do the greatest good. The thought of those children who are handicapped, or an old man who no longer feels useful to himself or society, being able to express themselves and to produce an item that they have created and that is recognized as being worthwhile, is thrilling. It is the idea of this kind of help and assistance that the ideals of Pi Beta Phi have always encouraged and advocated. CHRIS DAVIS Spaghetti Supper Support WEST VIRGINIA ALPHA Our chapter was in-formed of "Arrow in the Smokies" in full scope when our convention delegates gave their reports this fall. Every member thinks it is a fantastic idea. One hundred years is a long time to celebrate and we feel that starting a project like "Arrow in the Smokies" is the biggest way that all Pi Phis could celebrate. On the house tours during Rush the chapter always has one room reserved for explanation of our philanthropies. None of our members are using a fraternity scholarship at the present moment. The chapter has decided to start its own loan fund, however. Once a month it is going to have a spaghetti dinner to raise money. Anyone may come to it and all the chapter members help with this dinner in some way. $100.00 was cleared on the first dinner and I feel this will increase with publicity. Hopefully, we will be able to use some of this money to help with the "Arrow in the Smokies" project. MARCIA PUFFENBERGER Avenue for Concern NORTH CAROLINA BETA The expansion of Pi Beta Phi's national philanthropy, the Settlement School, through the Arrow in the Smokies, has heightened the interest of North Carolina Beta chap-ter. One of the distinct advantages of any organization is its potential service; and one of the bonds that holds the members of Pi Beta Phi together is concern 68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI for others. Arrow in the Smokies provides an excel-lent opportunity to take advantage of this concern. North Carolina Beta is planning an activity which will both promote good public relations and provide financial support for the new addition. An auction will be held for a fraternity wherein members of the chapter will be auctioned off. The highest bidder of each Pi Phi will have access to her services for a Saturday afternoon. She promises to wash his car, iron his shirts, or other tasks assigned to her. A bake sale will be held during the auction, and all proceeds will go to the Arrow in the Smokies. Local philanthropic projects have received increasing interest also. In past years the chapter has provided Thanksgiving baskets for needy families; given a Christmas party with a fraternity for orphans in the area; and the pledge class gave a party for some men-tally retarded children. This year two new projects have been added. Growing concern for the impoverished areas of the community surrounding the campus, with particular regard to the children, has resulted in a new program to help them. Each week a group of about fifteen children is brought to the campus. They meet with several Pi Phi's to learn about a variety of subjects. One week flowers were discussed, followed by a tour of the Duke gardens. Another week drama was explained, and the children produced their own play. As the year progresses it is hoped that the two groups will grow close together and personal relationships can be fostered. An additional Christmas project is also being planned. The Salvation Army provides dolls if volunteers will "dress" them. Each member can make an outfit during a regular meeting time, since the materials will be organized beforehand by the Philanthropies Chairmen. It is hoped that the project will both bring increased unity to the group, and be beneficial to the community. There has been an increasing amount of controversy on our campus concerning the worth of women's fraternities. A great deal of the value of Pi Beta Phi to its members is very personal and intangible. Philanthropies, both on the national and local level, are a vital factor in promoting good relations, as well as providing a meaningful involvement on the part of the participants. The expansion of Pi Beta Phi's existing philanthropy speaks for its success in the preceding years. North 'Carolina Beta is striving to make the next one hundred years even more meaningful. Monument to All Pi Phis SOUTH CAROLINA ALPHA Probably the first thing a Pi Phi learns is to be proud of her sorority, for Pi Phi has so many firsts to be proud of. One of these is being the first national sorority to create a philanthropic project. And almost as important as its being a first is the fact that as Pi Phis we all share the same goal in keeping our philanthropy going. In the Smokies one can see this project in real life. As close as our chapter is to Tennessee, the Smokies project is more than just a passing thought. Here we are provided an opportunity to see the project first hand. The Settlement School itself stands apart fromthe ever growing resort town and stands as a welcome and monument to all Pi Phis. There is a great future in our Settlement School now that its groundwork has been laid. The position of the school is ideal to reach out and grasp the en-tire area where people still need greater education facilities and training in skills. The school also can renew hope for reviving interest in the hand crafts. This chapter hopes that the Settlement School will continue to grow and tie the bonds of friendship not only to other Pi Phi sisters but to those who need help and faith. LINDA COULL Cultural and Economic Growth MICHIGAN DELTA Michigan Delta sees a great future for the Ri Beta Phi philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, both as a potentiality for service and as a creative institution. As a potential for service it will greatly benefit the people of the area by creating more jobs and by giving them the opportunity to improve their lives, both economically and culturally. By expanding the Arts and Crafts Center, there will be a greater opportunity for the people to express and develop their talents and skills in the arts and crafts. In addition to benefiting the local people, the expanded Center will be a great experience for art students, prospective teachers and any persons who are interested in art. The Arts and Crafts Center will greatly aid the economic condition of Gatlinburg and will bring in more business for the local craftsmen. To help bring about the dream of Arrow in the Smokies, Michigan Delta has had two Settlement School Sales, both of which were quite successful. One was held by the chapter in late Spring and the other was held by the Alumni Club in early November. In past years Michigan Delta has worked with needy children of the community. Last year the chap-ter adopted a family and also did work with a Catholic school. In addition to this, the chapter made tray favors for the local hospital. The chapter is still working with all three of these local philanthropies. JANE GRONBACK Christmas Village TENNESSEE BETA Tennessee Beta Pi Phis have been eagerly anticipating, and busily preparing for, Christmas Village. Sponsored by the Nashville Alumnae Club, Christmas village is held annually in mid-November at the Hippodrome in Nashville. Many local merchants set up booths at which their merchandise ranging from toys to plum puddings to sportswear is displayed and sold. The Arrowcraft Shop, too, has a booth at which its craftwork can be either bought or ordered. The proceeds from Christmas Village are donated to the Bill Wilkerson Speech and Hearing Center in Nashville. This year, Tennessee Beta Pi Phis decided to make and sell our own handiwork. The chapter was divided into four teams, to add an element of competition, and during the summer each Pi Phi made approximately ten "somethings" of her own choice. Thus the opportunity for originality and creativity was un THE ARROW OF Pt BETA PHI 69 bounded. This fall the response was amazing as we viewed the items which had been made during the summer, and discovered all sorts of "hidden" talent within the chapter. The items included such things as hand-painted waste baskets, felt Christmas stockings, covered match boxes, needlepoint calendars, crocheted coat hanger covers, hand-painted lap boards for studying, hairbows, antiqued card boxes and letter boxes, aprons, Christmas decorations, roller bags, hand-decorated stationery, pine cone flowers, and many, many more. JULIE MCGEHEE New Enthusiasm from Convention NORTH CAROLINA ALPHA Our convention delegate, in her report of the convention activities, enthusiastically spoke of the exhibit from the craft shop. She was able to give our chapter a better idea of the type and quality of work resulting from the Settlement School training. She was extremely impressed with the handicrafts and the obviously superior training that made them a possibility. Her enthusiasm stimulated the desire in all of us to perhaps make a trip as a group to see this craft work in Gatlinburg. The chapter plans to continue its magazine sale and hopefully do our share to help this beneficial and successful project expand even more rapidly in the future than it has in the past. We feel very proud to have been small contributors to a project so worthwhile. On our campus we will bear the meal and activity expense of a foreign exchange student this year. We also plan to sponsor a picnic for all undergraduate foreign students. KAREN DAVIS Development of Individual Skills INDIANA ALPHA In the early history of the quite serene Smoky Mountains, the tall proud evergreens stretch to reach the sun, the source of their life. The early mountain folk also had to look to the sun for their lives. They were farmers whose existence depended on the sun giving life to their crops. In 1912, Pi Beta Phi introduced a new light in their lives. The Settlement School was established in a valley high in the Smoky Mountains of Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The Settlement School acted like a sun in the development of the individual skills which the people of the mountains have. The Settlement School will be celebrating it's 56th. Anniversary this year, March 1968. Members of Indiana Alpha are proud of Emma Harper Turner, one of our founders, the Washington, D.C. Alpha Chapter and the Alumnae Club delegates from Washington, D.C. for initiating the idea of the Settlement School at the 1910 Convention. Just as the 111 colleges and universities, which house Pi Beta Phi Chapters, have given her members the opportunity to express their talents and skills, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School has given hundreds of people the opportunity to express their talents for making crafts. BETTE RICHARDSONFrom Abstraction to Reality INDIANA ZETA When the Indiana Zeta Pi Phi Chapter held its fifteenth anniversary luncheon this fall, the members were surprised and very pleased to find an-owcraft workshop samples on display. Until that day, the Arrow in the Smokies had been merely a vague abstraction in the minds of most of us. We had not realized that the skill and craftsmanship of those at the Arrow in the Smokies could result in such a variety of beautiful creations. Among the other activities ,at our anniversary luncheon, the Arrowcraft display renewed inspiration and pride in our national fraternity. Perhaps the awareness of and pride in our Pi Beta Phi philanthropy is part of that special quality Pi Phis all over the country seem to possess. As college women, it seems so very appropriate that we sponsor a project which does so very much to promote industry and creativity. All over the country Pi Phis can wear the golden arrow with special pride, not only as a symbol of our sisterhood, but also as a reminder of our philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. JANIS TRUSTY Gatlinburg Houseparty TENNESSEE GAMMA The members of the Tennessee Gamma chapter of Pi Beta Phi, feel most definitely that Arrow in the Smokies will become a reality. The success of our 'altruistic project of our first 100 years, the Settlement School, exemplifies the interest and effort of Pi Beta Phi's around the world. Our centennial project, the Art and Craft Center, will continue the Settlement School purpose of helping others to help themselves. Since our chapter at the University of Tennessee is the closest chapter to Gatlinburg, being only 40 miles away, we feel closely connected with the philanthropic projects of Pi Phi. Our chapter's "house party" is annually held in Gatlinburg and the pledges are given a tour of the Settlement School and Craft facilities. The Arrowcraft Shop is visited and utilized regularly by members of our chapter. The chapter has purchased an entire display of crafts from the Arrowcraft Shop to use during Fall Open House and at other times when our chapter suite is opened to visitors. Each year crafts from the shop are sold at a Christmas Bazaar in which all seventeen sororities on the University of Tennessee campus participate. We hope that in the future our chapter may help the Arrowcraft Shop in the distribution of crafts to active chapters and Alumnae Clubs across the nation and in Canada. The co-sponsorship of the Summer Craft Workshop by the University of Tennessee shows the interest of those outside the sorority in making the Pi Phi dream come true. We feel that through the utilization of facilities now in. Gatlinburg and through gifts and contributions, the Pi Phi Dream, Arrow in the Smokies, will become a center of craft development unequalled by any other. MARGARET S. YOUNG 70 THE ARROW OF N BETA PHI Pride from Proximity TENNESSEE DELTA Tennessee Delta takes special pride in our new Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, since it is located in our own state. By expanding the present accredited summer craft work-shop, adding new buildings and staff members, and maintaining the school on a year round basis, we feel that we will be giving others an opportunity for education and a fuller development of their talents in our second century of achievement. It is our hope that students will come to perfect their arts and crafts for use in rehabilitation, in teaching home economics and the mentally retarded. We give our support to this new project by asking both our members and pledges to purchase two magazines from the Pi Beta Phi magazine agency. Because we are near Gatlinburg, many of our members have had the privilege of visiting the Arrowcraft Shop. They have brought back to our chapter unique objects designed there, thus stimulating a genuine interest for some of our more talented members to attend the sessions. Our main philanthropic project last year was the adoption of a group of officers in Viet Nam. During the year we corresponded with them and sent them goodies and care packages. Projects for this fall include providing Thanksgiving baskets for needy families and Christmas gifts for underprivileged children and visiting an old folks home twice a week. We also support the Maternal Welfare League of Memphis, which is devoted to research in birth defects. We are indeed proud to make Pi Beta Phi a pioneer in its second century in a great philanthropy Arrow in the Smokies. SUSAN FEATHERSTON A Major Responsibility ALABAMA BETA "Airow in the Smokies" is our major responsibility now and in the future. We hope that our contribution will help bring this dream to a reality for Pi Phis and those who will benefit from the Arrow in the Smokies. The future of this project depends on the backing of the individual chapters. We plan to inform every member of the importance of this project and how each person can help. Our philanthropies chairman and program chairman have been working together to present several programs on the Arrow in the Smokies. Our chapter is very limited in ways of making money on campus, because of University rules against fund-raising events. Candy selling by the pledges in the spring is our only big fund-raising event. Of course the actives contribute a great deal to this project, too. Our main way of collecting funds is through individual contributions and these go to the Centennial Fund and the Settlement School. Even though we are limited in our ways of making money, we still take a great deal of pride in our philanthropies pro-gram. For our local philanthropy, we have several different projects for the year. Through the we sponsor a child of a needy family who receives guid-ance and care through a well-organized program. During Christmas, we help a fraternity give a Santa Claus party for children from the welfare department. This can be one of the most rewarding experiences to see the smiling faces of these children. Also the pledges give a party and presents to the mentally retarded children at Partlow's. Through these projects, Alabama Beta plans to con-tribute their time and efforts to our local philanthropies as well as to the "Arrow in the Smokies". JUDY LORD Contribution to Happiness and Independence ALABAMA GAMMA Of education, Abraham Lincoln said, . . . "I can only say that 'I view it as the most important subject that we as a people can be en-gaged in. . . ." With our new project, Arrow in the Smokies, Pi Beta Phi is engaging in the "important subject" of education. Our approach, however, is not the traditional readin', writin' and 'rithmetic one. By educating our senior citizens and the handicapped in the use of their talents, Arrow in the Smokies will open the door to a more useful and satisfying life for them. Alabama Gamma looks on Arrow in the Smokies as a way for each of us to contribute to the happiness and independence of others less fortunate than we. We are very enthusiastic about this new project and plan to support it wholeheartedly with our contributions. We are proud that Pi Beta Phi is pioneering yet another worthy and needed philanthropy. The Arrow in the Smokies will gleam brightly as it points upward the goal of a more full and rich life not only for those benefiting by the project, but also for those of us who will help to make it a success. MARGARET-ANNE HESTER All Out Support FLORIDA GAMMA In this the 100th year of Pi Beta Phi, Florida Gamma hopes to do everything it can to support the fraternity's Centennial project. The project, which is a Craft Workshop to be built in co-operation with the University of Tennessee, will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. The workshop will be located in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. We understand that the goal of this project is that it will become the outstanding center of education in the field of arts and crafts, drawing students from the United States, Canada and foreign nations instead of being limited to the local area. We realize that this project is quite an undertaking and that it cannot go on until the required funds are raised and made avail-able. One very successful fund raising project has already been accomplished by the girls of Florida Gamma. We put on a "Mister Legs Contest" one night in the school cafeteria. After a short speech by one of the girls about the Settlement School and the Centennial project and about just where the money would be THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 71 going, one boy from each fraternity marched around the tables in the costume which he thought would best show off his legs. Each boy was escorted by a pretty Pi Phi carrying a money box for the collection of "votes." It was all so much fun and such a success that we plan to make it a yearly thing. More fund raising projects are planned for the rest of the year as we of Florida Gamma feel that it is up to each of us to support this, the first philanthropic project supported by a fraternity and giving financial support through active chapters and alumni clubs to expand an educational program. KATHRYN ANN BROWN The Time Is Ripe! GEORGIA ALPHA--Arrow in the Smokies is living proof that the originators of the first national altruistic project of any woman's fraternity demonstrated remarkable foresight when they presented plans for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. What began as a rehabilitation center to insure the education of underprivileged residents has become a haven for art students, teachers, therapists, crafts-men and hobbyists. Because of its close proximity to the University of Georgia, which boasts one of the finest art schools in the nation, Arrow in the Smokies should continue to offer additional training to Georgia Alpha's and the nation's art students. There has been a strong in-crease in interest shown by Georgia citizens for art and cultural improvement in that field. Atlanta's new center for the performing arts, its museums and galleries have been revitalized and replenished by civic leaders aware of their importance in the community. The proposed changes and improvements at the Centennial Convention could not have come at a more opportune time in this area. The time is ripe for citizens throughout Georgia to be made aware of the expanded opportunities now available to them through Arrow in the Smokies. Georgia Alpha has conducted a minor public relations campaign for the fraternity philanthropy in the past during major rush seasons on campus. The products of the school, its mechanics, and its rewards are explained to hundreds of girls each year. Whether they are pledged to our chapter or not, these girls are made aware of the opportunities existing just a few hours from Athens. SUZANNE WEBB Project Yields International Benefits ILLINOIS EPSILON Illinois Epsilon was proud to be one of the top ten contributors to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Now, at the beginning of the fraternity's second one-hundred years, the chapter is enthusiastic about supporting our new project, Arrow in the Smokies. We are especially pleased that our organization, which has given so much to girls throughout the world, now has a project in which each of us can make contributions that will yield international benefits. As in the past, our chapter will continue to take advantage of all opportunities to advertize our philanthropic project. During rush we displayed a variety of Settlement School handicrafts. We also have plans for similar displays before Christmas and during Parents' Week-End. Our chapter feels that the success of Arrow in the Smokies will not be based solely upon monetary contributions. Only through national publicity outside of Pi Beta Phi circles will such a project become a reality, for as stated before, the benefits of Arrow in the Smokies can not help but be international, BETTY CARTER Tutoring Center WISCONSIN BETA The women of Wisconsin Beta are deeply interested in the work of our national philanthropies, especially Arrow in the Smokies. The employment which it offers to the needy people of the area undoubtedly raises their living standard and allows them the chance to enjoy a better life. However, our chapter is especially interested in the continual development of our native crafts which is fostered through the Arroweraft workshop and the new Arts and Crafts Center. It gives us all a genuine feeling of satisfaction to know that we are helping to keep a part of our American heritage alive, not only in Tennessee, but throughout the country. We realize that in our times of unrest and turbulence, our national philanthropy is working toward establishing good will throughout the world when the many foreign students who come to study return home with their new skills. Our chapter is now able to devote most of its time to our national philanthropy because we have already raised the necessary funds and achieved our goal for our local philanthropy, the Beloit Tutoring Center in Mississippi. This tutoring center has been greatly successful in the past few years in its work with the student classified as a "low achiever." And so our work goes on as we prepare for our Christmas bazaar to be held early in December to raise funds for our own Settlement School. We will be selling various types of handywork which we are now in the process of making. We happily continue this work in the true spirit of Pi Beta Phi. BETSY BLANEY What Does the Future Hold? MANITOBA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi became, with the initiation of the Settlement School at Gatlinburg, the first fraternity to have a national philanthropy; the first fraternity to show the world that they were a service instititution, not just a social club. In those early days, all that the Pi Phi's envisioned was a country school, bringing education where there had been none before, in honor of those twelve aspiring young women, so keenly interested in education them-selves, who had formed our Pi Phi. Our reality, in 1967 has grown far beyond their wildest dreams. Where there was no school, Pi Phi built a school; and staffed it, and, over the years, developed it into the university accredited institution it is today. Where there was no doctor, or even nurse, to care for the sick, aged and young children, Pi Phi brought in their own nurses, and doctors, and taught basic hygiene in 72 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the school; now there is a clinic and doctor in the town. When Pi Phi came to Gatlinburg, the hill people were poor, barely ekeing out an existence on their land. Pi Phi has taught these hill people crafts, and bought them the needed equipment; now there is thriving home industry, which Pi Phi supports in its Arrowcraft shops. Much indeed has been accomplished in the past fifty years at Gatlinburg. So who can say what the future holds for the Arrow in the Smokies? There is much that can still become, and more that we cannot envision today, but that will be accomplished. There is always a need for education, and always an opportunity for service. The future of Pi Phi holds far more than its past, at Gatlinburg in the Smokies. BARBARA EDMONDS Key to Pi Phi Future SOUTH DAKOTA ALPHA A century ago when the twelve founders of Pi Beta Phi met to organize a women's fraternity for the purpose of enhancing the nobility of womanhood, they faced the problem of proving what positive goal such an organization could accomplish. Today the same problem still exists for twentieth-century fraternity women. In comparison to the immensity of world conflicts, the acquiring of social graces and the finding of strength in the bonds of personal friendships cannot alone justify the existence of women's fraternal, groups. At a recent officers' retreat members of South Dakota Alpha heard their university's Coordinator of Student Affairs challenge them to ACT instead of REACT. Too often sororities and fraternities concentrate their efforts in rebelling against and attempting to reject the college regulations placed upon them. Truly this shows that they care and are alive, but why must every action be only a response? Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic project, Arrow in the Smokies, holds the key to the future of our college fraternity. Expanding the summer craft workshop is a definite step Pi Beta Phi can take forward showing to the public that we are not organized for the sole purpose of our personal advancement in the social aspects of life. It is pertinent for South Dakota A and all other chapters to recognize the new centennial plans for Arrow in the Smokies and show to the public that this too is the purpose of our fraternity. And thus, while doing this, we will be acting and advancing the welfare of others as well as ourselves. CINDY CIMPL Enthusiasm Spreads Rapidly MINNESOTA ALPHA At Minnesota Alpha, we had a change in feeling recently toward the Settlement School. That change is due mainly to three things. First, one of our members visited Gatlinburg last summer while on vacation and her stories about it have made it come alive for us. Secondly, our two delegates to Convention brought back an enthusiasm for Settlement School which is rapidly spreading to the whole chapter. Third, and, we feel, most important, is the new name which has been given to the project, Arrow in the Smokies. This name means more to us than the words "philanthropy" or "Settlement School." The word "Arrow" alone brings to mind the chain of friendship which exists coast to coast and generation to generation in Pi Beta Phi. It brings to mind the love and devotion we feel toward one another .and toward all that is good and true. It reminds us that we in Pi Beta Phi are striving for the highest ideals. Then, the joining of the word "Arrow" with the site of our philanthropy, the "Smokies," joins all these feelings to the Settlement School. It sets the tone for the spirit of Settlement School. Now that this spirit has become more apparent to us, it has become apparent also that it is our job to maintain and spread the spirit. To do this, we, first of all, made Settlement School a much larger part of Fall Rush Information Day. We told its story in more de-tail and displayed many of the craft. Throughout, we tried to convey the spirit of giving which started Settlement School and which keeps it growing year after year. Secondly, we have made it a point to leave the Arrowcraft catalog in the living room where waiting guests will pick it up. And we have coached all our members so that they can answer any questions the guests might ask about Gatlinburg and the School, or about the Arrowcraft Worshop and the ordering of the articles made there. Finally, we plan to add, to our annual Settlement School information program, the personal reactions of our active who visited Gatlinburg last summer and of a former active who spent a whole summer there. With these new ideas and spurred on by our new feelings about Arrow in the Smokies, we hope at Minnesota Alpha to make Settlement School known and loved, and therefore supported, by an ever-increasing number of people. J. MARCHE L Emphasis During Rush MISSOURI GAMMA Missouri Gamma puts emphasis on our national philanthropy project during rush. Because we think it is a unique idea and binds us in further sisterhood, we want to help bring success to Arrow in the Smokies. Rather than taking a chance in having some rushees miss our story by leaving discussion up to the individual rushers, we have our philanthropies chairman give a small talk on this subject to the entire group. She has a display of articles made at the Arrowcraft Shop set up and is ready to answer questions. We feel that the best way to show our interest to the public is through enthusiasm in our attitudes. We support the Settlement School as our chapter philanthropy and throughout the year we sponsor money-making projects to provide funds. Our annual mum sale at Homecoming is a major activity. We have great success with this project and are able to expand it as each year passes. Another project is the Rummage Sale we have for the public. A location in the city is sought that will provide us with the maximum expo-sure to the public. Each girl is responsible for a prearranged number of articles and rarely do we have much left after a two day sale. We also have some type of candy sale on campus, and we hope to have an apple sale later in the year. Each year we try to THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 73 have some other type of fund raising project in addition to our annual activities. Also, members are encouraged to order articles from the Settlement School through our chairman. Last year a senior, Sahanny Johnson, received the California Alpha Scholarship. We are proud to be taking active participation in support of Arrow in the Smokies. Each year we hope to build this participation and in this way push Arrow in the Smokies to great success. DEBBIE NELSON Inevitable Growth Seen ARKANSAS ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies definitely has a future, and as more than a dream in the minds of Pi Phis everywhere. With 111 active chapters and 339 alum clubs working in every state and in Canada, the entire settlement school project is bound to grow. At Arkansas Alpha, we work to promote the larger philanthropic project of Arrow in the Smokies and at the same time we are active on local projects. We have the Arrowcraft sale every year. Before the sale, we contact the alums and neighbors and faculty members, to let them know when we will have the display. By having the sale, we bring the entire Arrow in the Smokies project to the citizens of Fayetteville. The profits from the sale go back to the project. Recently our chapter joined the Chamber of Commerce and by this we hope to acquaint the Fayetteville community more with Pi Phi as a locally and nationally active fraternity. On a local level we carry on several philanthropic projects. This year we have adopted a young American Indian girl. We send money for her schooling and some of her needs and write to her often. Last year we were awarded a trophy from the Community Chest for giving the greatest contribution to their drive of all organizations on campus. We also have a Christmas party each year for underprivileged children in the community. JO ANN PRYOR Hope for the Future MISSISSIPPI ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies means hope, love, responsibility, opportunity, pride, and yield to Mississippi Alpha Pi Phis as well as Pi Phis throughout the nation. In 1912 with the organization of the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, the dream of almost half a century was realized, and each bounding step brought hope for the future to Pi Beta Phi and to those who come there to learn and work. Love, ever-present in Pi Beta Phi, found a special outlet in this national philanthropy as Pi Phis help others help themselves. Responsibility and opportunity were basic building blocks for the Settlement School. But of these pride and yield are the most important for they are interchangeable each producing the other, creating a never-ending, every-increasing cycle. At the turn of a century of happiness and growth, Pi Beta Phi adopts a centennial project which will follow in the footsteps of the Settlement School and the Arrowcraft Shop. Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the Summer Craft Workshop and will act in a more wide-ranged capacity to better meet the demands of a growing country and fraternity. Arrow in the Smokies has been made possible through planning and hard work, and with the continued support of every Pi Phi it cannot fail. EDDIE WELFORD Meeting Leisure's Challenge IOWA GAMMA Pi Beta Phi's Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is an expansion of the Craft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tenn., which is co-sponsored by the Fraternity and the University of Tennessee. The Craft Workshop offers a broad curriculum in the Arts and Crafts, and the courses offer college credit for graduate and undergraduate work. Today there is an increased amount of leisure time offered to our citizens due to automation and the specialized times. When this leisure time is added to the need in our society for individual creativity, the logical solution is a greater emphasis on arts and crafts. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, the opportunity for creative self-expression will be given. To further the growth of our philanthropy and help Arrow in the Smokies to become a reality, each chapter member must take an active interest in the project and help to raise money for its support. One way to do this is to hold Arrowcraft sales, which would acquaint our members with the quality and variety of articles made. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, it will enable individuals to develop their talents, the handicapped to become a little more independent, and older citizens to feel more worthwhile. An old Hindu Maxim sums up the responsibilities of each one of us. "He does not live in vain, who employs his wealth, his thought, his speech to advance the good of others." VICKI VOELKER Action Key to Success! IOWA ZETA Pi Beta Phi has always been concerned with helping others to help themselves, this is evident in the organization of Chapters and Clubs. This concern has been extended to people outside the membership of Pi Beta Phi through the program of the first philanthropy supported by a fraternity the Settlement School. In keeping with this idea Pi Beta Phi's Centennial project is a Craft Workshop in co-operation with the University of Tennessee to be built in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. It will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. As members of Iowa Zeta, we are proud to give our support in such an outstanding project. We know that creative arts have been found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also our Alumnae Clubs can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Se74 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. Creative crafts develop skill, provide an outlet for self-expression, increase sensitiveness as to surrounding giving dignity to common things, bring the handicapped into better adjustment, and are .a delight to the adventuresome. Iowa Zeta realizes that we must look at the coming of the new. All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. This is only possible with the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. As members of Iowa Zeta, we pledge our loyal support and are proud that we can contribute to such an excellent project. To know that we are helping other people as well as our members, sparks a feeling of pride and it is a pleasure to say that we belong to such a wonderful organization as Pi Beta Phi. ANN MONTGOMERY Improved Publicity Planned NEBRASKA BETA Nebraska Beta has started an interesting new local philanthropic project this year by offering its services to the Nebraska State Hospital. Five members a week, consisting of three actives and two pledges, work as volunteers in the hospital lounge or canteen. In this manner they are able to serve as cashiers, waitresses, and fountain girls and at the same time build positive relationships with the patients. In addition to our new local philanthropic project Nebraska Beta is planning to hold its annual Settlement School sale. Posters, announcements, and news-paper coverage will aid in publicizing the sale, which will be open to the entire campus. It is hoped that profits from this sale and magazine sales will help establish support for another Nebraska Beta project one aimed at making the benefit of Arrow in the Smokies known to more than just Pi Phis. With help from local newspapers and campus newspapers a brief description of the aims of Arrow in the Smokies will be presented. Members of the Lincoln Weaving Club and other local craft clubs will be encouraged to con-tact our chapter for information about sponsorship to Tennessee in the form of a loan or scholarship. Public relations will be improved and Pi Phi's achievements and opportunities will be made available to many out-side of our chapter. Nebraska Beta feels that the greatest way it can make Arrow in the Smokies meaningful is by sponsoring a member who can benefit from the experience . . . a member outside of our own chapter. KITTY MCMANUS Success Through Support KANSAS BETA Pi Beta Phi was founded by twelve girls at Monmouth College in 1867. Since that time its membership has grown enormously and has spread to college campuses throughout the United States and Canada. Similarly Arrow in the Smokies should grow and grow. It will do so 'because the same enthusiastic spirit and love for Pi Phi will be behind it. There are already signs of this "success through support." The idea of a centennial project was first realized at the 1954 Convention. Since that time interest has been great. Last year over one hundred thou-sand dollars was contributed to "Arrow in the Smokies !" As time goes on and Pi Phi's continue to be generous with this, their outstanding philanthropic project, Gatlinburg, Tennessee should be a huge center of activity. Numerous buildings will be gradually constructed for art and craft classes until it will be a complete center. Then this Craft Center will be of tremendous benefit to its teachers and students, as well as artists everywhere. Preserving the native arts and crafts of our country, it should become a well-known and respected cultural project. Even more important, as "Arrow in the Smokies" grows, so will the reputation of Pi Beta Phi. Through its outstanding achievements and its numerous philanthropic projects from the time of its founding, Pi Phi has already demonstrated to others its high standards and principles. Now, because of this wonderful Centennial Project, the name "Pi Beta Phi" could become synonomous with "service." And as this spirit of Pi Phi, which began in 1867, continues to grow, so will the 1967 Centennial Project "Arrow in the Smokies." MARSHA GARRETT Serving Mankind OKLAHOMA ALPHA What are the purposes of a Pi Beta Phi philanthropic project in the Smokies? This is a question that we at Oklahoma Alpha are asking and have attempted to answer. The necessity of vocational training is one answer to the need for the Pi Phi service project. Vocational training can bring industries to the area, provide jobs and give the skilled worker a sense of accomplishment. The type of craftmanship learned from the project is another answer to our question. Not only can skilled industrial techniques be taught, but skills in the crafting of handmade articles. If the handcrafting skills of the people of the Smokies can be preserved, Pi Phi can preserve the past for the future. Not only will the lives of the people of the Smokies be enriched but the lives of everyone who views their craftmanship. If we, as part of the Greek system can reach beyond our realm of membership and aid others, we have served not only ourselves but mankind. By providing service outside our membership, this project can not only answer our goal of service but can be-come our theme for the next hundred years of fraternity growth. NANCY BREEDEN Fund-raising Projects Unlimited! OKLAHOMA BETA Members of Pi Beta Phi, have always tried to be of service to the people around us and to people in need. A momentous step was taken THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 75 when in 1910, we began laying the plans for our Arrowcraft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. From this time, much progress has been made and we here at Oklahoma Beta are proud of our fraternities lead in the area of philanthropy. The Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is another significant step for our fraternity. It is one of the best ways in which the art of hand made crafts and skills can be perpetuated. Our chapter feels that there are many possibilities for the Arrow in the Smokies. With the increased amount of leisure time of our society and the growing number of people over sixty-five, there is a need to find a creative and constructive outlet for our human energies. The Arrow in the Smokies 'can provide this outlet by giving many a place to come and learn while perpetuating the art of crafts. There is also the possibility of the Arrow in the Smokies as a training ground for instructors who could help with the rehabilitation of those people in our nation who need the therapy of learning an enjoy-able, constructive, and physically beneficial skill. It is with these possibilities and others that we see the potential which lies in the creation of this new philanthropy. In our own chapter we try to publicize our philanthropy through our annual Arrowcraft Sale. As a chapter, we also sponsor an annual Easter Egg hunt for the Underprivileged children in town. In the past we have also provided food for a needy family at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The variety of possible fund-raising projects for the support of our Centennial Project seems to be unlimited. There is always the possibility of collecting all the loose personal items which are left in the lounge and then selling them back to the members at a small fee. The old stand by of a rummage sale has always been a profitable project for our chapter. These are some of the ideas that our chapter has concerning our new Centennial Project and it is with great hope and much expectation that we look for-ward to seeing what the future will hold for Pi Beta Phi and her philanthropy work. A New Dream TEXAS ALPHA In 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee was established as a memorial to the founders of our fraternity. Now fifty-five years later that dream has become a reality and in this our centennial year we have a new dream. Our Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, will be our major philanthropy as we start in this our second century as a Fraternity. Texas Alpha is very enthusiastic and interested in the growth and development of our newest project, Arrow in the Smokies. As the summer craft workshop is being expanded into larger sessions and more courses of study, many of our members feel that their education would be greatly enriched if they studied at the craft workshop. Especially promising to the members of Texas Alpha will be the instructions given in therapy, teaching, and in doing volunteer work. We are always interested in learning new hobbies and crafts aid many of our members are planning to spend their summers at the Settlement School learning more about these things. Pi Beta Phi and Texas Alpha will be looking for-ward to our new philanthropy. We hope that every chapter and alum club will do their part in helping to make our next hundred years as profitable and re-warding as our past hundred years has been. LYN ARNOT Importance Realized TEXAS BETA The national philanthropic project of Pi Beta Phi which was once a dream to a few, is now a reality of which every Pi Phi can, and should be proud. Gatlinburg once only a village of isolated people has now become a productive community. The Texas Beta Pi Phis are proud to assist in this national project through annual contributions. We also have several local philanthropic projects. A number of our girls tutor in connection with a YMCA program. We also take part in "Rag Mop", through which we collect clothes for Goodwill Industries. Each year we participate in a campus-wide project in connection with Greek Week. This year we cleaned up a YMCA camp. We now sponsor two foreign orphans, sending them clothes, food, and special gifts on holidays. Each Christmas we have a party for a group of orphans, complete with our own female version of Santa Claus. We of Texas Beta realize the importance of philanthropic projects. We feel that through helping others, we, ourselves, become better people. Our thoughts can be expressed by a comment made to a Pi Phi alum by a local resident of Gatlinburg, "You Pi Phis really are angels." Active Alumnce Cooperation NEW MEXICO ALPHA At present New Mexico Alpha is involved in a magazine selling campaign to raise money for the Settlement School Fund. Each girl in the chapter will be required to sell two magazines. It was decided that this was not too much to ask. Part of this money will be used to support the Arrow in the Smokies and we feel that this will be a step in the right direction for helping it become a reality. Our active chapter does not have a local philanthropy, although our alums do. They help support Casa Angelica, a home for retarded children in Albuquerque. Last year through a home designer show they earned enough money to purchase a station wagon for the home. We helped the Alums in providing a free babysitting service for the mothers who came to see the show. Each semester our chapter gives the Mary Lovelace scholarship to a deserving active. This scholarship pays for the active's dues for the semester for which she earned it. Doug Munson was the recipient of the scholarship for this semester. A Broader Dream UTAH ALPHA In March 1912, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in the Great Smokey Mountains, was opened to thirteen eager, young students, only two short years after it was decided at convention that an educational project should be established in memory of our founders. At first the Settlement School, the first national phi76 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI lanthropy of its kind, provided an education to the mountain people through home teaching, but soon land was secured on which to build a school house, in spite of the reluctancy of the townspeople. Through the years, the once small community has expanded into a large town which now draws about five million tourists a year. At the present time the town consists of the Arrowcraft Workshop, a health center, a school house, the Loom House, and a dormatory, the Red Bard, to accommodate some of the students. Every year, hundreds of children and adults come to Gatlinburg from all parts of the country to learn all the crafts taught there. It is by these people that all the jewelry, wood craft and loom work available through every Pi Beta Phi chapter is made. All proceeds from the sale of these things goes back to the Settlement School for improvements and expansion. Every Pi Phi chapter in the United States and Canada supports our Settlement School and through each individual chapter's philanthropies program, we are able to promote improvement of the school both through the sale of the Craft Shop products and their money-making projects directed toward raising money to donate to the school. In Utah Alpha we have had a great deal of support of the Settlement School through the sale of the crafts. It is pleasing to know that people not even associated with Pi Phi call to inquire about the merchandise and the school that they've heard about from friends. Thus it is evident that the fame of the Settlement School has spread all over the country and through this continuing expansion and rise in sup-porters, the dream of a bigger, better and more adequate Settlement School will soon be a reality. KIM KOLLER "King" Crowned for Settlement School MONTANA ALPHA In the summer of 1966 two of our members, Marilyn Fitzgerald and Judi O'Donnell, had the privilege and opportunity to visit the Arrow in the Smokies. They had of course studied about Pi Beta Phi's outstanding philanthropy but both agreed they were not prepared for the large, modern school which greeted them. Several people told them how thankful and indebted they are to Pi Phi and what a wonderful project we have. One man in particular told them that his son was to graduate the following year because of assistance the Pi Phis had given him. The girls strongly urge all Pi Phis to take any opportunity they have to visit our Arrow in the Smokies. "Every member of Pi Beta Phi can be proud of this project because we are looking beyond our needs to those of others. We are not only helping others, we are preserving a beautiful art for the benefit of all. Because Montana Alpha feels that this national philanthropy is so important we do not sponsor any particular local philanthropy. Each year we hold a contest for the `King of the Hill' in which one member of each fraternity is nominated by his fraternity for this honor. These men are invited to the house several times and are asked to present some form of entertainment for us. The members of our house then vote for one of the men and on a Saturday night we hold a campus-wide `Derby Dance' to crown the winning`King of the Hill.' The other candidates are then our `Brothers of the Arrow.' The proceeds from the dance are sent to the Arrow in the Smokies as our donation. We are very proud that last year Montana Alpha donated the largest contribution. We feel that a project such as ours would be a good method for any chapter to use to promote our national philanthropy. CAROLE POFFENBERGER The Realm of "Others" WASHINGTON ALPHA Our philanthropic project in the Smokey Mountains area is the fulfillment of ,a desire embedded deep in every Pi Phi heart. College life is full of the everyday hustle and bustle of schoolwork, campus activities, dates, and friends. Our philanthropic project adds a meaningful dimension to a college career: We project ourselves beyond the realm of "self'' to the realm of "others." Because we feel that Gatlinburg is one of the primary responsibilities of our House, the Pi Phi's at Washington Alpha display the material crafts as well as the spiritual ideals of this once backward area during our September Rush. We want these prospective pledges to see the deeper meaning behind Pi Beta Phi. Each Fall, we are reminded of the significance of the Smokey Mountains project. Hundreds of people in Gatlinburg are being educated through the nationwide effort of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity; they are learning a livelihood in handicrafts; they are gaining self-respect. How do we at Washington Alpha Chapter help the Smokey Mountains project: In the Fall our House sponsors a sale of the handicrafts produced by the craftsmen of Gatlinburg. This sale provides a market for the crafts; it is open to anyone. All the girls in the house enjoy setting up the display, especially when the products are so varied. Anything from brooms to mugs to jewelry to stationery can be found at the sale. It's always fun to give the buyers a little background on our project and what it means to us. This not only makes the crafts more meaningful, but helps us to take an active part in this altruistic project! We at Washington Alpha are anxious to do our part in helping to promote the success of the people at Gatlinburg. The progress shown to date is certainly an inspiration to us all. PAM WAGNER The Warm Feeling of Giving WASHINGTON BETA The Washington Beta chapter feels that the Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the present opportunity for Pi Phi's to give of their service, time and money. We are planning to have a Settlement School program to inform members of the project and the potentials and opportunities which it opens to us. After enthusiasm is raised, a fund-raising project will follow. This project, Penny a Pound for Pi Phi (an idea from Wisconsin Beta) will tax each girl a penny for each pound of her weight. The pennies will be pasted on a poster board in the shape of a huge piggy bank for display. We feel that with adequate support this project will develop into a vital institution. It will, enrich the lives of those who take advantage of its facilities, learn a trade and become productive citizens; as well THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 77 as the lives of those who benefit from the usefullness of the products. In the age of mechanization, the Arrow in the Smokies will play its part in preserving creativity and personal pride in an object, as contrasted to the impersonal qualities of a machine-made product. . The members of Washington Beta are very proud of the philanthropies project, not only because working together towards a common goal brings unity to Pi Phi's everywhere, but also because of the personal opportunities, creative and technical, which it brings to so many. This project enables everyone to experience the warm feeling of giving. AMY RADEWAN A Worthwhile Program OREGON ALPHA Oregon Alpha of Pi Beta Phi feels that the Centennial Project: "Arrow In The Smokies" is a new and exciting addition. The Summer Craft Workshop has proved itself to be beneficial and rewarding to everyone involved, and with the expansion of more workshops, more and more people will be reached. The Craft Workshops, are beneficial in many ways. The inhabitants of the Gatlinburg area are able to gain a living because of the tourist trade drawn there, the instructors and the assistants of the Summer Craft Workshops are earning a living besides fullfilling their own aesthetic needs. The students are learning the crafts taught in order that they might re-turn to their homes and teach others. This is a never ending circle because ell those taught will continue to expand and teach others. We feel that it is an honor that Pi Beta Phi is in co-operation with the University of Tennessee in such a worthwhile program. Oregon Alpha is planning on having a skit-dinner to inform the chapter members of the Arrow in the Smokies Program. For our fund raising project we would like to have an Arrowcraft Shop Sale before the Christmas holidays. We feel the citizens of Eugene and the University of Oregon Student Body would be very interested in our crafts, and this would spread knowledge of our Centennial project, besides helping to raise our funds. Oregon Alpha's main philanthropic project is helping teach in the Handicapped Children's Swimming Program. Pi Phi, Marsha Almeter, is in charge of the program. NANCY ELMGREN A Conscious Endeavor OREGON BETA The members of Oregon Beta are very proud to be a part of Pi Beta Phi's new philanthropy project, Arrow in the Smokies. Pi Beta Phi must grow to meet the needs of it's members and nation alike. We must continue to broaden our horizons and since we are founded as a scholastic organization in what way could we better serve than by supplying an opportunity for education. Thoreau said: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeaver. Our conscious endeavor for this next one hundred years is Arrow in the Smokies. Through education we will preserve and extend our national heritage. Thus we are building a brighter future from the past. We are expanding to fill present and fu'ture needs and by doing this we will continue to grow as an organization of college women. We must not forget our heritage; we must preserve it. Oregon Beta feels that Arrow in the Smokies will help to preserve this heritage as it helps to educate our people and by helping to preserve our past will help to build a stronger and more united future. We can only wait to see what light our flame has cast by the end of this, our second, century.. Our hope is that it will continue to grow in brightness as it has during our past century. Services Extended IDAHO ALPHA Pi Beta Phi .can truly be proud of its nationally renowned philanthropic establishment, Arrow in ,the Smokies. Due to the dedication and loyalty of many individual Pi Phi alums and the support of many active chapters, and ,alum clubs, this project has grown since its establishment in 1910, by the Settlement School committee, to a greatly enlarged and expanded program partly affiliated with the University of Tennessee and making meaningful and productive the lives of many previously poor and backward people. This year, along with Pi Beta Phi's Centennial celebration, a great program is being put .into effect to expand and build this philanthropic project so that more of its services can be extended to make an even greater contribution. Idaho Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi would, like to greatly congratulate the leaders in this program and offer a Centennial wish that the Arrow in the Smokies may grow and expand in Gatlinburg, and perhaps in the future, even in. other locations where the need is great. Through our philanthropic project, all Pi Phis can make a significant contribution to the realization of Pi Phi ideals. In the area of public relations, Idaho Alpha Chap-ter of Pi. Beta Phi has contributed to the Fund for the Performing Arts Center here at the University of Idaho, a 6-million-dollar project, and also to the Cam-pus Chest Fund. CHERYL KOCH "Bigger and Better" CALIFORNIA GAMMA California Gamma, like all Pi Phi Chapters, has always been especially proud of our heritage as the pioneer in women's fraternities. As a non-profit organization we have always been proud to point out our high scholastic standards and social activities but, today, we are even prouder of the philanthropic projects that our sorority has developed. Now as Pi Beta Phi starts its second century our Chapter feels that our new philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, will be "bigger and better" yet. Because we do live across the, country it is SOMetimes difficult for us to really see the good that is being accomplished by these projects. We support them 'but we do not really know that much about 78 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI them. To remedy this we are currently planning a program for early November which will not only tell about our philanthropies, but which will, we hope, show another reason why we can be so proud to be Pi Phis. But the idea is not just to learn about and to support morally our philanthropies. We could all talk for hours about how proud we are of what we are doing and what a great project Arrow in the Smokies is but that will not make it a success. As Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice President of Philanthropies said in the September 1967 ARROW the important word for this and all other philanthropies is "yield". Our chapter realizes this and consequently we are also going to try to initiate plans for more publicity and for some fund-raising projects that will show our sup-port. California Gamma feels that the key to the success of this Centennial Project and to Pi Beta Phi's second century lies in the contributions of each and every Chapter. CHRISTI HUGGINS Symbol of Pride CALIFORNIA DELTA The year 1967 marked for Pi Beta Phi one hundred years of sisterhood through fraternity life. Yet only half a century ago that sister-hood became truly meaningful with the establishment of the national philanthropy. The Settlement School has become a symbol of pride. Not yet a member, a pledge wonders what Pi Phi represents. She questions what the purpose of Pi Phi is and what it means to national, the members, and finally to herself. She discovers the true significance of Pi Phi when she learns about the Settlement School. The school synibolizes Pi Phi's higher values and goals. The educational centers and workshops of Gatlin-burg endure and expand with the devotion and interest of actives across the nation. Donations from each chapter and alumni continually pour into the school as a genuine expression of support for the work and progress made by the philanthropy. Future expansion made possible by the donations will focus on the pro-motion of education for all types of people. Students, teachers, doctors, industrial technicians, and even re-tired persons will benefit from the classes offered. The Settlement School of Gatlinburg symbolizes the ideals of its founders and its donors and is truly something of value. LINDA DAVIS Native Crafts Kept Alive! CALIFORNIA EPSILON--Pi Beta Phi's Arrow ex-tends across the entire nation. When each Pi Phi thinks of service, her thoughts are pointed upward to that special place high in the Smokies. Here we find the starting point for the first sorority to establish their philanthropy. Pi Beta Phi felt this such a worthy endeavor it has been maintained ,all through the years. Being the oldest fraternity for women, Pi Phi's felt the need to keep alive one of the oldest and true American art cultures. Industrialism is rapidly causing the extinction of true handicrafts, but Arrow in the Smokies providesthe opportunity for these people to keep their native craft still alive. Besides the mere craft aspect, employment is created along with the recreational aspect of the school. For those people merely interested in learning a craft, the opportunity is constantly provided for them. Because university credit is given, it allows those seeking a profession in art to continue their work. The future of the Arrow in the Smokies is tremendous. Expansion of this foundation cannot help but grow because of the support it has received and will continue to receive. The second hundred years will prove to be as successful as the first hundred because Arrow in the Smokies keeps alive for future generations the artistic heritage of that area of the United States. SUSAN DRISCOLL Tremendous Job Ahead NEVADA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi can be more than hopeful about its philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. This dream of building an Arts and Crafts addition to the University of Tennessee will become a reality, just as the Settlement School has. Through the financial and moral assistance of every Pi Phi, the Settlement School has grown to be one of the largest crafts' centers of the United States. If we look at the past success of our Settlement School, we cannot fail in our hope for the future, Arrow in the Smokies. As hopeful as we are, we must realize that the construction of such a project is a tremendous job which will need the support of every member. The Pi Phis at Nevada Alpha Chapter are organizing two projects to raise funds for Arrow in the Smokies. We plan to have a Sandwich Sale and a Spaghetti Feed. Our advertisements for both these functions will explain Arrow in the Smokies, and the importance of this philanthropy should aid our success. The Sandwich Sale will consist of selling Poor Boy sandwiches to campus residents on two Sundays. The Spaghetti Feed will also be on a Sunday, because the campus cafeteria only serves brunch on Sundays. We will have the dinner on or near the University, pre-pare it ourselves, and only charge a dollar for tickets sold in advance. We hope to receive a good profit which we will donate to Arrow in the Smokies. If every Pi Phi Chapter can do something similar, Arrow in the Smokies will be transformed from a dream into a reality. STEPHANIE LORIGAN Art Appreciation Continues! ARIZONA ALPHA The Arizona Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi highly commends the progress and great eagerness toward our new Centennial project of 1966 through 1967. We are very enthusiastic to increase aid to the underprivileged people in the Gatlinburg area. By enlarging the Summer Craft Workshop, we may be able, not only to help these poverty-stricken mountain people, but also to increase the knowledge of dying traditional crafts such as stitchery and weaving that have been so much a part of the early pio (Continued on page 87) i Beta Phi Pledges These young ladies pledged Pi Beta Phi chapters at colleges and universities with a fall rush or open rush in the first semester of the 1967-68 school year.

        68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI for others. Arrow in the Smokies provides an excel-lent opportunity to take advantage of this concern. North Carolina Beta is planning an activity which will both promote good public relations and provide financial support for the new addition. An auction will be held for a fraternity wherein members of the chapter will be auctioned off. The highest bidder of each Pi Phi will have access to her services for a Saturday afternoon. She promises to wash his car, iron his shirts, or other tasks assigned to her. A bake sale will be held during the auction, and all proceeds will go to the Arrow in the Smokies. Local philanthropic projects have received increasing interest also. In past years the chapter has provided Thanksgiving baskets for needy families; given a Christmas party with a fraternity for orphans in the area; and the pledge class gave a party for some men-tally retarded children. This year two new projects have been added. Growing concern for the impoverished areas of the community surrounding the campus, with particular regard to the children, has resulted in a new program to help them. Each week a group of about fifteen children is brought to the campus. They meet with several Pi Phi's to learn about a variety of subjects. One week flowers were discussed, followed by a tour of the Duke gardens. Another week drama was explained, and the children produced their own play. As the year progresses it is hoped that the two groups will grow close together and personal relationships can be fostered. An additional Christmas project is also being planned. The Salvation Army provides dolls if volunteers will "dress" them. Each member can make an outfit during a regular meeting time, since the materials will be organized beforehand by the Philanthropies Chairmen. It is hoped that the project will both bring increased unity to the group, and be beneficial to the community. There has been an increasing amount of controversy on our campus concerning the worth of women's fraternities. A great deal of the value of Pi Beta Phi to its members is very personal and intangible. Philanthropies, both on the national and local level, are a vital factor in promoting good relations, as well as providing a meaningful involvement on the part of the participants. The expansion of Pi Beta Phi's existing philanthropy speaks for its success in the preceding years. North 'Carolina Beta is striving to make the next one hundred years even more meaningful. Monument to All Pi Phis SOUTH CAROLINA ALPHA Probably the first thing a Pi Phi learns is to be proud of her sorority, for Pi Phi has so many firsts to be proud of. One of these is being the first national sorority to create a philanthropic project. And almost as important as its being a first is the fact that as Pi Phis we all share the same goal in keeping our philanthropy going. In the Smokies one can see this project in real life. As close as our chapter is to Tennessee, the Smokies project is more than just a passing thought. Here we are provided an opportunity to see the project first hand. The Settlement School itself stands apart fromthe ever growing resort town and stands as a welcome and monument to all Pi Phis. There is a great future in our Settlement School now that its groundwork has been laid. The position of the school is ideal to reach out and grasp the en-tire area where people still need greater education facilities and training in skills. The school also can renew hope for reviving interest in the hand crafts. This chapter hopes that the Settlement School will continue to grow and tie the bonds of friendship not only to other Pi Phi sisters but to those who need help and faith. LINDA COULL Cultural and Economic Growth MICHIGAN DELTA Michigan Delta sees a great future for the Ri Beta Phi philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, both as a potentiality for service and as a creative institution. As a potential for service it will greatly benefit the people of the area by creating more jobs and by giving them the opportunity to improve their lives, both economically and culturally. By expanding the Arts and Crafts Center, there will be a greater opportunity for the people to express and develop their talents and skills in the arts and crafts. In addition to benefiting the local people, the expanded Center will be a great experience for art students, prospective teachers and any persons who are interested in art. The Arts and Crafts Center will greatly aid the economic condition of Gatlinburg and will bring in more business for the local craftsmen. To help bring about the dream of Arrow in the Smokies, Michigan Delta has had two Settlement School Sales, both of which were quite successful. One was held by the chapter in late Spring and the other was held by the Alumni Club in early November. In past years Michigan Delta has worked with needy children of the community. Last year the chap-ter adopted a family and also did work with a Catholic school. In addition to this, the chapter made tray favors for the local hospital. The chapter is still working with all three of these local philanthropies. JANE GRONBACK Christmas Village TENNESSEE BETA Tennessee Beta Pi Phis have been eagerly anticipating, and busily preparing for, Christmas Village. Sponsored by the Nashville Alumnae Club, Christmas village is held annually in mid-November at the Hippodrome in Nashville. Many local merchants set up booths at which their merchandise ranging from toys to plum puddings to sportswear is displayed and sold. The Arrowcraft Shop, too, has a booth at which its craftwork can be either bought or ordered. The proceeds from Christmas Village are donated to the Bill Wilkerson Speech and Hearing Center in Nashville. This year, Tennessee Beta Pi Phis decided to make and sell our own handiwork. The chapter was divided into four teams, to add an element of competition, and during the summer each Pi Phi made approximately ten "somethings" of her own choice. Thus the opportunity for originality and creativity was un THE ARROW OF Pt BETA PHI 69 bounded. This fall the response was amazing as we viewed the items which had been made during the summer, and discovered all sorts of "hidden" talent within the chapter. The items included such things as hand-painted waste baskets, felt Christmas stockings, covered match boxes, needlepoint calendars, crocheted coat hanger covers, hand-painted lap boards for studying, hairbows, antiqued card boxes and letter boxes, aprons, Christmas decorations, roller bags, hand-decorated stationery, pine cone flowers, and many, many more. JULIE MCGEHEE New Enthusiasm from Convention NORTH CAROLINA ALPHA Our convention delegate, in her report of the convention activities, enthusiastically spoke of the exhibit from the craft shop. She was able to give our chapter a better idea of the type and quality of work resulting from the Settlement School training. She was extremely impressed with the handicrafts and the obviously superior training that made them a possibility. Her enthusiasm stimulated the desire in all of us to perhaps make a trip as a group to see this craft work in Gatlinburg. The chapter plans to continue its magazine sale and hopefully do our share to help this beneficial and successful project expand even more rapidly in the future than it has in the past. We feel very proud to have been small contributors to a project so worthwhile. On our campus we will bear the meal and activity expense of a foreign exchange student this year. We also plan to sponsor a picnic for all undergraduate foreign students. KAREN DAVIS Development of Individual Skills INDIANA ALPHA In the early history of the quite serene Smoky Mountains, the tall proud evergreens stretch to reach the sun, the source of their life. The early mountain folk also had to look to the sun for their lives. They were farmers whose existence depended on the sun giving life to their crops. In 1912, Pi Beta Phi introduced a new light in their lives. The Settlement School was established in a valley high in the Smoky Mountains of Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The Settlement School acted like a sun in the development of the individual skills which the people of the mountains have. The Settlement School will be celebrating it's 56th. Anniversary this year, March 1968. Members of Indiana Alpha are proud of Emma Harper Turner, one of our founders, the Washington, D.C. Alpha Chapter and the Alumnae Club delegates from Washington, D.C. for initiating the idea of the Settlement School at the 1910 Convention. Just as the 111 colleges and universities, which house Pi Beta Phi Chapters, have given her members the opportunity to express their talents and skills, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School has given hundreds of people the opportunity to express their talents for making crafts. BETTE RICHARDSONFrom Abstraction to Reality INDIANA ZETA When the Indiana Zeta Pi Phi Chapter held its fifteenth anniversary luncheon this fall, the members were surprised and very pleased to find an-owcraft workshop samples on display. Until that day, the Arrow in the Smokies had been merely a vague abstraction in the minds of most of us. We had not realized that the skill and craftsmanship of those at the Arrow in the Smokies could result in such a variety of beautiful creations. Among the other activities ,at our anniversary luncheon, the Arrowcraft display renewed inspiration and pride in our national fraternity. Perhaps the awareness of and pride in our Pi Beta Phi philanthropy is part of that special quality Pi Phis all over the country seem to possess. As college women, it seems so very appropriate that we sponsor a project which does so very much to promote industry and creativity. All over the country Pi Phis can wear the golden arrow with special pride, not only as a symbol of our sisterhood, but also as a reminder of our philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. JANIS TRUSTY Gatlinburg Houseparty TENNESSEE GAMMA The members of the Tennessee Gamma chapter of Pi Beta Phi, feel most definitely that Arrow in the Smokies will become a reality. The success of our 'altruistic project of our first 100 years, the Settlement School, exemplifies the interest and effort of Pi Beta Phi's around the world. Our centennial project, the Art and Craft Center, will continue the Settlement School purpose of helping others to help themselves. Since our chapter at the University of Tennessee is the closest chapter to Gatlinburg, being only 40 miles away, we feel closely connected with the philanthropic projects of Pi Phi. Our chapter's "house party" is annually held in Gatlinburg and the pledges are given a tour of the Settlement School and Craft facilities. The Arrowcraft Shop is visited and utilized regularly by members of our chapter. The chapter has purchased an entire display of crafts from the Arrowcraft Shop to use during Fall Open House and at other times when our chapter suite is opened to visitors. Each year crafts from the shop are sold at a Christmas Bazaar in which all seventeen sororities on the University of Tennessee campus participate. We hope that in the future our chapter may help the Arrowcraft Shop in the distribution of crafts to active chapters and Alumnae Clubs across the nation and in Canada. The co-sponsorship of the Summer Craft Workshop by the University of Tennessee shows the interest of those outside the sorority in making the Pi Phi dream come true. We feel that through the utilization of facilities now in. Gatlinburg and through gifts and contributions, the Pi Phi Dream, Arrow in the Smokies, will become a center of craft development unequalled by any other. MARGARET S. YOUNG 70 THE ARROW OF N BETA PHI Pride from Proximity TENNESSEE DELTA Tennessee Delta takes special pride in our new Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, since it is located in our own state. By expanding the present accredited summer craft work-shop, adding new buildings and staff members, and maintaining the school on a year round basis, we feel that we will be giving others an opportunity for education and a fuller development of their talents in our second century of achievement. It is our hope that students will come to perfect their arts and crafts for use in rehabilitation, in teaching home economics and the mentally retarded. We give our support to this new project by asking both our members and pledges to purchase two magazines from the Pi Beta Phi magazine agency. Because we are near Gatlinburg, many of our members have had the privilege of visiting the Arrowcraft Shop. They have brought back to our chapter unique objects designed there, thus stimulating a genuine interest for some of our more talented members to attend the sessions. Our main philanthropic project last year was the adoption of a group of officers in Viet Nam. During the year we corresponded with them and sent them goodies and care packages. Projects for this fall include providing Thanksgiving baskets for needy families and Christmas gifts for underprivileged children and visiting an old folks home twice a week. We also support the Maternal Welfare League of Memphis, which is devoted to research in birth defects. We are indeed proud to make Pi Beta Phi a pioneer in its second century in a great philanthropy Arrow in the Smokies. SUSAN FEATHERSTON A Major Responsibility ALABAMA BETA "Airow in the Smokies" is our major responsibility now and in the future. We hope that our contribution will help bring this dream to a reality for Pi Phis and those who will benefit from the Arrow in the Smokies. The future of this project depends on the backing of the individual chapters. We plan to inform every member of the importance of this project and how each person can help. Our philanthropies chairman and program chairman have been working together to present several programs on the Arrow in the Smokies. Our chapter is very limited in ways of making money on campus, because of University rules against fund-raising events. Candy selling by the pledges in the spring is our only big fund-raising event. Of course the actives contribute a great deal to this project, too. Our main way of collecting funds is through individual contributions and these go to the Centennial Fund and the Settlement School. Even though we are limited in our ways of making money, we still take a great deal of pride in our philanthropies pro-gram. For our local philanthropy, we have several different projects for the year. Through the we sponsor a child of a needy family who receives guid-ance and care through a well-organized program. During Christmas, we help a fraternity give a Santa Claus party for children from the welfare department. This can be one of the most rewarding experiences to see the smiling faces of these children. Also the pledges give a party and presents to the mentally retarded children at Partlow's. Through these projects, Alabama Beta plans to con-tribute their time and efforts to our local philanthropies as well as to the "Arrow in the Smokies". JUDY LORD Contribution to Happiness and Independence ALABAMA GAMMA Of education, Abraham Lincoln said, . . . "I can only say that 'I view it as the most important subject that we as a people can be en-gaged in. . . ." With our new project, Arrow in the Smokies, Pi Beta Phi is engaging in the "important subject" of education. Our approach, however, is not the traditional readin', writin' and 'rithmetic one. By educating our senior citizens and the handicapped in the use of their talents, Arrow in the Smokies will open the door to a more useful and satisfying life for them. Alabama Gamma looks on Arrow in the Smokies as a way for each of us to contribute to the happiness and independence of others less fortunate than we. We are very enthusiastic about this new project and plan to support it wholeheartedly with our contributions. We are proud that Pi Beta Phi is pioneering yet another worthy and needed philanthropy. The Arrow in the Smokies will gleam brightly as it points upward the goal of a more full and rich life not only for those benefiting by the project, but also for those of us who will help to make it a success. MARGARET-ANNE HESTER All Out Support FLORIDA GAMMA In this the 100th year of Pi Beta Phi, Florida Gamma hopes to do everything it can to support the fraternity's Centennial project. The project, which is a Craft Workshop to be built in co-operation with the University of Tennessee, will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. The workshop will be located in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. We understand that the goal of this project is that it will become the outstanding center of education in the field of arts and crafts, drawing students from the United States, Canada and foreign nations instead of being limited to the local area. We realize that this project is quite an undertaking and that it cannot go on until the required funds are raised and made avail-able. One very successful fund raising project has already been accomplished by the girls of Florida Gamma. We put on a "Mister Legs Contest" one night in the school cafeteria. After a short speech by one of the girls about the Settlement School and the Centennial project and about just where the money would be THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 71 going, one boy from each fraternity marched around the tables in the costume which he thought would best show off his legs. Each boy was escorted by a pretty Pi Phi carrying a money box for the collection of "votes." It was all so much fun and such a success that we plan to make it a yearly thing. More fund raising projects are planned for the rest of the year as we of Florida Gamma feel that it is up to each of us to support this, the first philanthropic project supported by a fraternity and giving financial support through active chapters and alumni clubs to expand an educational program. KATHRYN ANN BROWN The Time Is Ripe! GEORGIA ALPHA--Arrow in the Smokies is living proof that the originators of the first national altruistic project of any woman's fraternity demonstrated remarkable foresight when they presented plans for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. What began as a rehabilitation center to insure the education of underprivileged residents has become a haven for art students, teachers, therapists, crafts-men and hobbyists. Because of its close proximity to the University of Georgia, which boasts one of the finest art schools in the nation, Arrow in the Smokies should continue to offer additional training to Georgia Alpha's and the nation's art students. There has been a strong in-crease in interest shown by Georgia citizens for art and cultural improvement in that field. Atlanta's new center for the performing arts, its museums and galleries have been revitalized and replenished by civic leaders aware of their importance in the community. The proposed changes and improvements at the Centennial Convention could not have come at a more opportune time in this area. The time is ripe for citizens throughout Georgia to be made aware of the expanded opportunities now available to them through Arrow in the Smokies. Georgia Alpha has conducted a minor public relations campaign for the fraternity philanthropy in the past during major rush seasons on campus. The products of the school, its mechanics, and its rewards are explained to hundreds of girls each year. Whether they are pledged to our chapter or not, these girls are made aware of the opportunities existing just a few hours from Athens. SUZANNE WEBB Project Yields International Benefits ILLINOIS EPSILON Illinois Epsilon was proud to be one of the top ten contributors to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Now, at the beginning of the fraternity's second one-hundred years, the chapter is enthusiastic about supporting our new project, Arrow in the Smokies. We are especially pleased that our organization, which has given so much to girls throughout the world, now has a project in which each of us can make contributions that will yield international benefits. As in the past, our chapter will continue to take advantage of all opportunities to advertize our philanthropic project. During rush we displayed a variety of Settlement School handicrafts. We also have plans for similar displays before Christmas and during Parents' Week-End. Our chapter feels that the success of Arrow in the Smokies will not be based solely upon monetary contributions. Only through national publicity outside of Pi Beta Phi circles will such a project become a reality, for as stated before, the benefits of Arrow in the Smokies can not help but be international, BETTY CARTER Tutoring Center WISCONSIN BETA The women of Wisconsin Beta are deeply interested in the work of our national philanthropies, especially Arrow in the Smokies. The employment which it offers to the needy people of the area undoubtedly raises their living standard and allows them the chance to enjoy a better life. However, our chapter is especially interested in the continual development of our native crafts which is fostered through the Arroweraft workshop and the new Arts and Crafts Center. It gives us all a genuine feeling of satisfaction to know that we are helping to keep a part of our American heritage alive, not only in Tennessee, but throughout the country. We realize that in our times of unrest and turbulence, our national philanthropy is working toward establishing good will throughout the world when the many foreign students who come to study return home with their new skills. Our chapter is now able to devote most of its time to our national philanthropy because we have already raised the necessary funds and achieved our goal for our local philanthropy, the Beloit Tutoring Center in Mississippi. This tutoring center has been greatly successful in the past few years in its work with the student classified as a "low achiever." And so our work goes on as we prepare for our Christmas bazaar to be held early in December to raise funds for our own Settlement School. We will be selling various types of handywork which we are now in the process of making. We happily continue this work in the true spirit of Pi Beta Phi. BETSY BLANEY What Does the Future Hold? MANITOBA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi became, with the initiation of the Settlement School at Gatlinburg, the first fraternity to have a national philanthropy; the first fraternity to show the world that they were a service instititution, not just a social club. In those early days, all that the Pi Phi's envisioned was a country school, bringing education where there had been none before, in honor of those twelve aspiring young women, so keenly interested in education them-selves, who had formed our Pi Phi. Our reality, in 1967 has grown far beyond their wildest dreams. Where there was no school, Pi Phi built a school; and staffed it, and, over the years, developed it into the university accredited institution it is today. Where there was no doctor, or even nurse, to care for the sick, aged and young children, Pi Phi brought in their own nurses, and doctors, and taught basic hygiene in 72 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the school; now there is a clinic and doctor in the town. When Pi Phi came to Gatlinburg, the hill people were poor, barely ekeing out an existence on their land. Pi Phi has taught these hill people crafts, and bought them the needed equipment; now there is thriving home industry, which Pi Phi supports in its Arrowcraft shops. Much indeed has been accomplished in the past fifty years at Gatlinburg. So who can say what the future holds for the Arrow in the Smokies? There is much that can still become, and more that we cannot envision today, but that will be accomplished. There is always a need for education, and always an opportunity for service. The future of Pi Phi holds far more than its past, at Gatlinburg in the Smokies. BARBARA EDMONDS Key to Pi Phi Future SOUTH DAKOTA ALPHA A century ago when the twelve founders of Pi Beta Phi met to organize a women's fraternity for the purpose of enhancing the nobility of womanhood, they faced the problem of proving what positive goal such an organization could accomplish. Today the same problem still exists for twentieth-century fraternity women. In comparison to the immensity of world conflicts, the acquiring of social graces and the finding of strength in the bonds of personal friendships cannot alone justify the existence of women's fraternal, groups. At a recent officers' retreat members of South Dakota Alpha heard their university's Coordinator of Student Affairs challenge them to ACT instead of REACT. Too often sororities and fraternities concentrate their efforts in rebelling against and attempting to reject the college regulations placed upon them. Truly this shows that they care and are alive, but why must every action be only a response? Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic project, Arrow in the Smokies, holds the key to the future of our college fraternity. Expanding the summer craft workshop is a definite step Pi Beta Phi can take forward showing to the public that we are not organized for the sole purpose of our personal advancement in the social aspects of life. It is pertinent for South Dakota A and all other chapters to recognize the new centennial plans for Arrow in the Smokies and show to the public that this too is the purpose of our fraternity. And thus, while doing this, we will be acting and advancing the welfare of others as well as ourselves. CINDY CIMPL Enthusiasm Spreads Rapidly MINNESOTA ALPHA At Minnesota Alpha, we had a change in feeling recently toward the Settlement School. That change is due mainly to three things. First, one of our members visited Gatlinburg last summer while on vacation and her stories about it have made it come alive for us. Secondly, our two delegates to Convention brought back an enthusiasm for Settlement School which is rapidly spreading to the whole chapter. Third, and, we feel, most important, is the new name which has been given to the project, Arrow in the Smokies. This name means more to us than the words "philanthropy" or "Settlement School." The word "Arrow" alone brings to mind the chain of friendship which exists coast to coast and generation to generation in Pi Beta Phi. It brings to mind the love and devotion we feel toward one another .and toward all that is good and true. It reminds us that we in Pi Beta Phi are striving for the highest ideals. Then, the joining of the word "Arrow" with the site of our philanthropy, the "Smokies," joins all these feelings to the Settlement School. It sets the tone for the spirit of Settlement School. Now that this spirit has become more apparent to us, it has become apparent also that it is our job to maintain and spread the spirit. To do this, we, first of all, made Settlement School a much larger part of Fall Rush Information Day. We told its story in more de-tail and displayed many of the craft. Throughout, we tried to convey the spirit of giving which started Settlement School and which keeps it growing year after year. Secondly, we have made it a point to leave the Arrowcraft catalog in the living room where waiting guests will pick it up. And we have coached all our members so that they can answer any questions the guests might ask about Gatlinburg and the School, or about the Arrowcraft Worshop and the ordering of the articles made there. Finally, we plan to add, to our annual Settlement School information program, the personal reactions of our active who visited Gatlinburg last summer and of a former active who spent a whole summer there. With these new ideas and spurred on by our new feelings about Arrow in the Smokies, we hope at Minnesota Alpha to make Settlement School known and loved, and therefore supported, by an ever-increasing number of people. J. MARCHE L Emphasis During Rush MISSOURI GAMMA Missouri Gamma puts emphasis on our national philanthropy project during rush. Because we think it is a unique idea and binds us in further sisterhood, we want to help bring success to Arrow in the Smokies. Rather than taking a chance in having some rushees miss our story by leaving discussion up to the individual rushers, we have our philanthropies chairman give a small talk on this subject to the entire group. She has a display of articles made at the Arrowcraft Shop set up and is ready to answer questions. We feel that the best way to show our interest to the public is through enthusiasm in our attitudes. We support the Settlement School as our chapter philanthropy and throughout the year we sponsor money-making projects to provide funds. Our annual mum sale at Homecoming is a major activity. We have great success with this project and are able to expand it as each year passes. Another project is the Rummage Sale we have for the public. A location in the city is sought that will provide us with the maximum expo-sure to the public. Each girl is responsible for a prearranged number of articles and rarely do we have much left after a two day sale. We also have some type of candy sale on campus, and we hope to have an apple sale later in the year. Each year we try to THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 73 have some other type of fund raising project in addition to our annual activities. Also, members are encouraged to order articles from the Settlement School through our chairman. Last year a senior, Sahanny Johnson, received the California Alpha Scholarship. We are proud to be taking active participation in support of Arrow in the Smokies. Each year we hope to build this participation and in this way push Arrow in the Smokies to great success. DEBBIE NELSON Inevitable Growth Seen ARKANSAS ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies definitely has a future, and as more than a dream in the minds of Pi Phis everywhere. With 111 active chapters and 339 alum clubs working in every state and in Canada, the entire settlement school project is bound to grow. At Arkansas Alpha, we work to promote the larger philanthropic project of Arrow in the Smokies and at the same time we are active on local projects. We have the Arrowcraft sale every year. Before the sale, we contact the alums and neighbors and faculty members, to let them know when we will have the display. By having the sale, we bring the entire Arrow in the Smokies project to the citizens of Fayetteville. The profits from the sale go back to the project. Recently our chapter joined the Chamber of Commerce and by this we hope to acquaint the Fayetteville community more with Pi Phi as a locally and nationally active fraternity. On a local level we carry on several philanthropic projects. This year we have adopted a young American Indian girl. We send money for her schooling and some of her needs and write to her often. Last year we were awarded a trophy from the Community Chest for giving the greatest contribution to their drive of all organizations on campus. We also have a Christmas party each year for underprivileged children in the community. JO ANN PRYOR Hope for the Future MISSISSIPPI ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies means hope, love, responsibility, opportunity, pride, and yield to Mississippi Alpha Pi Phis as well as Pi Phis throughout the nation. In 1912 with the organization of the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, the dream of almost half a century was realized, and each bounding step brought hope for the future to Pi Beta Phi and to those who come there to learn and work. Love, ever-present in Pi Beta Phi, found a special outlet in this national philanthropy as Pi Phis help others help themselves. Responsibility and opportunity were basic building blocks for the Settlement School. But of these pride and yield are the most important for they are interchangeable each producing the other, creating a never-ending, every-increasing cycle. At the turn of a century of happiness and growth, Pi Beta Phi adopts a centennial project which will follow in the footsteps of the Settlement School and the Arrowcraft Shop. Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the Summer Craft Workshop and will act in a more wide-ranged capacity to better meet the demands of a growing country and fraternity. Arrow in the Smokies has been made possible through planning and hard work, and with the continued support of every Pi Phi it cannot fail. EDDIE WELFORD Meeting Leisure's Challenge IOWA GAMMA Pi Beta Phi's Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is an expansion of the Craft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tenn., which is co-sponsored by the Fraternity and the University of Tennessee. The Craft Workshop offers a broad curriculum in the Arts and Crafts, and the courses offer college credit for graduate and undergraduate work. Today there is an increased amount of leisure time offered to our citizens due to automation and the specialized times. When this leisure time is added to the need in our society for individual creativity, the logical solution is a greater emphasis on arts and crafts. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, the opportunity for creative self-expression will be given. To further the growth of our philanthropy and help Arrow in the Smokies to become a reality, each chapter member must take an active interest in the project and help to raise money for its support. One way to do this is to hold Arrowcraft sales, which would acquaint our members with the quality and variety of articles made. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, it will enable individuals to develop their talents, the handicapped to become a little more independent, and older citizens to feel more worthwhile. An old Hindu Maxim sums up the responsibilities of each one of us. "He does not live in vain, who employs his wealth, his thought, his speech to advance the good of others." VICKI VOELKER Action Key to Success! IOWA ZETA Pi Beta Phi has always been concerned with helping others to help themselves, this is evident in the organization of Chapters and Clubs. This concern has been extended to people outside the membership of Pi Beta Phi through the program of the first philanthropy supported by a fraternity the Settlement School. In keeping with this idea Pi Beta Phi's Centennial project is a Craft Workshop in co-operation with the University of Tennessee to be built in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. It will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. As members of Iowa Zeta, we are proud to give our support in such an outstanding project. We know that creative arts have been found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also our Alumnae Clubs can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Se74 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. Creative crafts develop skill, provide an outlet for self-expression, increase sensitiveness as to surrounding giving dignity to common things, bring the handicapped into better adjustment, and are .a delight to the adventuresome. Iowa Zeta realizes that we must look at the coming of the new. All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. This is only possible with the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. As members of Iowa Zeta, we pledge our loyal support and are proud that we can contribute to such an excellent project. To know that we are helping other people as well as our members, sparks a feeling of pride and it is a pleasure to say that we belong to such a wonderful organization as Pi Beta Phi. ANN MONTGOMERY Improved Publicity Planned NEBRASKA BETA Nebraska Beta has started an interesting new local philanthropic project this year by offering its services to the Nebraska State Hospital. Five members a week, consisting of three actives and two pledges, work as volunteers in the hospital lounge or canteen. In this manner they are able to serve as cashiers, waitresses, and fountain girls and at the same time build positive relationships with the patients. In addition to our new local philanthropic project Nebraska Beta is planning to hold its annual Settlement School sale. Posters, announcements, and news-paper coverage will aid in publicizing the sale, which will be open to the entire campus. It is hoped that profits from this sale and magazine sales will help establish support for another Nebraska Beta project one aimed at making the benefit of Arrow in the Smokies known to more than just Pi Phis. With help from local newspapers and campus newspapers a brief description of the aims of Arrow in the Smokies will be presented. Members of the Lincoln Weaving Club and other local craft clubs will be encouraged to con-tact our chapter for information about sponsorship to Tennessee in the form of a loan or scholarship. Public relations will be improved and Pi Phi's achievements and opportunities will be made available to many out-side of our chapter. Nebraska Beta feels that the greatest way it can make Arrow in the Smokies meaningful is by sponsoring a member who can benefit from the experience . . . a member outside of our own chapter. KITTY MCMANUS Success Through Support KANSAS BETA Pi Beta Phi was founded by twelve girls at Monmouth College in 1867. Since that time its membership has grown enormously and has spread to college campuses throughout the United States and Canada. Similarly Arrow in the Smokies should grow and grow. It will do so 'because the same enthusiastic spirit and love for Pi Phi will be behind it. There are already signs of this "success through support." The idea of a centennial project was first realized at the 1954 Convention. Since that time interest has been great. Last year over one hundred thou-sand dollars was contributed to "Arrow in the Smokies !" As time goes on and Pi Phi's continue to be generous with this, their outstanding philanthropic project, Gatlinburg, Tennessee should be a huge center of activity. Numerous buildings will be gradually constructed for art and craft classes until it will be a complete center. Then this Craft Center will be of tremendous benefit to its teachers and students, as well as artists everywhere. Preserving the native arts and crafts of our country, it should become a well-known and respected cultural project. Even more important, as "Arrow in the Smokies" grows, so will the reputation of Pi Beta Phi. Through its outstanding achievements and its numerous philanthropic projects from the time of its founding, Pi Phi has already demonstrated to others its high standards and principles. Now, because of this wonderful Centennial Project, the name "Pi Beta Phi" could become synonomous with "service." And as this spirit of Pi Phi, which began in 1867, continues to grow, so will the 1967 Centennial Project "Arrow in the Smokies." MARSHA GARRETT Serving Mankind OKLAHOMA ALPHA What are the purposes of a Pi Beta Phi philanthropic project in the Smokies? This is a question that we at Oklahoma Alpha are asking and have attempted to answer. The necessity of vocational training is one answer to the need for the Pi Phi service project. Vocational training can bring industries to the area, provide jobs and give the skilled worker a sense of accomplishment. The type of craftmanship learned from the project is another answer to our question. Not only can skilled industrial techniques be taught, but skills in the crafting of handmade articles. If the handcrafting skills of the people of the Smokies can be preserved, Pi Phi can preserve the past for the future. Not only will the lives of the people of the Smokies be enriched but the lives of everyone who views their craftmanship. If we, as part of the Greek system can reach beyond our realm of membership and aid others, we have served not only ourselves but mankind. By providing service outside our membership, this project can not only answer our goal of service but can be-come our theme for the next hundred years of fraternity growth. NANCY BREEDEN Fund-raising Projects Unlimited! OKLAHOMA BETA Members of Pi Beta Phi, have always tried to be of service to the people around us and to people in need. A momentous step was taken THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 75 when in 1910, we began laying the plans for our Arrowcraft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. From this time, much progress has been made and we here at Oklahoma Beta are proud of our fraternities lead in the area of philanthropy. The Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is another significant step for our fraternity. It is one of the best ways in which the art of hand made crafts and skills can be perpetuated. Our chapter feels that there are many possibilities for the Arrow in the Smokies. With the increased amount of leisure time of our society and the growing number of people over sixty-five, there is a need to find a creative and constructive outlet for our human energies. The Arrow in the Smokies 'can provide this outlet by giving many a place to come and learn while perpetuating the art of crafts. There is also the possibility of the Arrow in the Smokies as a training ground for instructors who could help with the rehabilitation of those people in our nation who need the therapy of learning an enjoy-able, constructive, and physically beneficial skill. It is with these possibilities and others that we see the potential which lies in the creation of this new philanthropy. In our own chapter we try to publicize our philanthropy through our annual Arrowcraft Sale. As a chapter, we also sponsor an annual Easter Egg hunt for the Underprivileged children in town. In the past we have also provided food for a needy family at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The variety of possible fund-raising projects for the support of our Centennial Project seems to be unlimited. There is always the possibility of collecting all the loose personal items which are left in the lounge and then selling them back to the members at a small fee. The old stand by of a rummage sale has always been a profitable project for our chapter. These are some of the ideas that our chapter has concerning our new Centennial Project and it is with great hope and much expectation that we look for-ward to seeing what the future will hold for Pi Beta Phi and her philanthropy work. A New Dream TEXAS ALPHA In 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee was established as a memorial to the founders of our fraternity. Now fifty-five years later that dream has become a reality and in this our centennial year we have a new dream. Our Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, will be our major philanthropy as we start in this our second century as a Fraternity. Texas Alpha is very enthusiastic and interested in the growth and development of our newest project, Arrow in the Smokies. As the summer craft workshop is being expanded into larger sessions and more courses of study, many of our members feel that their education would be greatly enriched if they studied at the craft workshop. Especially promising to the members of Texas Alpha will be the instructions given in therapy, teaching, and in doing volunteer work. We are always interested in learning new hobbies and crafts aid many of our members are planning to spend their summers at the Settlement School learning more about these things. Pi Beta Phi and Texas Alpha will be looking for-ward to our new philanthropy. We hope that every chapter and alum club will do their part in helping to make our next hundred years as profitable and re-warding as our past hundred years has been. LYN ARNOT Importance Realized TEXAS BETA The national philanthropic project of Pi Beta Phi which was once a dream to a few, is now a reality of which every Pi Phi can, and should be proud. Gatlinburg once only a village of isolated people has now become a productive community. The Texas Beta Pi Phis are proud to assist in this national project through annual contributions. We also have several local philanthropic projects. A number of our girls tutor in connection with a YMCA program. We also take part in "Rag Mop", through which we collect clothes for Goodwill Industries. Each year we participate in a campus-wide project in connection with Greek Week. This year we cleaned up a YMCA camp. We now sponsor two foreign orphans, sending them clothes, food, and special gifts on holidays. Each Christmas we have a party for a group of orphans, complete with our own female version of Santa Claus. We of Texas Beta realize the importance of philanthropic projects. We feel that through helping others, we, ourselves, become better people. Our thoughts can be expressed by a comment made to a Pi Phi alum by a local resident of Gatlinburg, "You Pi Phis really are angels." Active Alumnce Cooperation NEW MEXICO ALPHA At present New Mexico Alpha is involved in a magazine selling campaign to raise money for the Settlement School Fund. Each girl in the chapter will be required to sell two magazines. It was decided that this was not too much to ask. Part of this money will be used to support the Arrow in the Smokies and we feel that this will be a step in the right direction for helping it become a reality. Our active chapter does not have a local philanthropy, although our alums do. They help support Casa Angelica, a home for retarded children in Albuquerque. Last year through a home designer show they earned enough money to purchase a station wagon for the home. We helped the Alums in providing a free babysitting service for the mothers who came to see the show. Each semester our chapter gives the Mary Lovelace scholarship to a deserving active. This scholarship pays for the active's dues for the semester for which she earned it. Doug Munson was the recipient of the scholarship for this semester. A Broader Dream UTAH ALPHA In March 1912, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in the Great Smokey Mountains, was opened to thirteen eager, young students, only two short years after it was decided at convention that an educational project should be established in memory of our founders. At first the Settlement School, the first national phi76 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI lanthropy of its kind, provided an education to the mountain people through home teaching, but soon land was secured on which to build a school house, in spite of the reluctancy of the townspeople. Through the years, the once small community has expanded into a large town which now draws about five million tourists a year. At the present time the town consists of the Arrowcraft Workshop, a health center, a school house, the Loom House, and a dormatory, the Red Bard, to accommodate some of the students. Every year, hundreds of children and adults come to Gatlinburg from all parts of the country to learn all the crafts taught there. It is by these people that all the jewelry, wood craft and loom work available through every Pi Beta Phi chapter is made. All proceeds from the sale of these things goes back to the Settlement School for improvements and expansion. Every Pi Phi chapter in the United States and Canada supports our Settlement School and through each individual chapter's philanthropies program, we are able to promote improvement of the school both through the sale of the Craft Shop products and their money-making projects directed toward raising money to donate to the school. In Utah Alpha we have had a great deal of support of the Settlement School through the sale of the crafts. It is pleasing to know that people not even associated with Pi Phi call to inquire about the merchandise and the school that they've heard about from friends. Thus it is evident that the fame of the Settlement School has spread all over the country and through this continuing expansion and rise in sup-porters, the dream of a bigger, better and more adequate Settlement School will soon be a reality. KIM KOLLER "King" Crowned for Settlement School MONTANA ALPHA In the summer of 1966 two of our members, Marilyn Fitzgerald and Judi O'Donnell, had the privilege and opportunity to visit the Arrow in the Smokies. They had of course studied about Pi Beta Phi's outstanding philanthropy but both agreed they were not prepared for the large, modern school which greeted them. Several people told them how thankful and indebted they are to Pi Phi and what a wonderful project we have. One man in particular told them that his son was to graduate the following year because of assistance the Pi Phis had given him. The girls strongly urge all Pi Phis to take any opportunity they have to visit our Arrow in the Smokies. "Every member of Pi Beta Phi can be proud of this project because we are looking beyond our needs to those of others. We are not only helping others, we are preserving a beautiful art for the benefit of all. Because Montana Alpha feels that this national philanthropy is so important we do not sponsor any particular local philanthropy. Each year we hold a contest for the `King of the Hill' in which one member of each fraternity is nominated by his fraternity for this honor. These men are invited to the house several times and are asked to present some form of entertainment for us. The members of our house then vote for one of the men and on a Saturday night we hold a campus-wide `Derby Dance' to crown the winning`King of the Hill.' The other candidates are then our `Brothers of the Arrow.' The proceeds from the dance are sent to the Arrow in the Smokies as our donation. We are very proud that last year Montana Alpha donated the largest contribution. We feel that a project such as ours would be a good method for any chapter to use to promote our national philanthropy. CAROLE POFFENBERGER The Realm of "Others" WASHINGTON ALPHA Our philanthropic project in the Smokey Mountains area is the fulfillment of ,a desire embedded deep in every Pi Phi heart. College life is full of the everyday hustle and bustle of schoolwork, campus activities, dates, and friends. Our philanthropic project adds a meaningful dimension to a college career: We project ourselves beyond the realm of "self'' to the realm of "others." Because we feel that Gatlinburg is one of the primary responsibilities of our House, the Pi Phi's at Washington Alpha display the material crafts as well as the spiritual ideals of this once backward area during our September Rush. We want these prospective pledges to see the deeper meaning behind Pi Beta Phi. Each Fall, we are reminded of the significance of the Smokey Mountains project. Hundreds of people in Gatlinburg are being educated through the nationwide effort of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity; they are learning a livelihood in handicrafts; they are gaining self-respect. How do we at Washington Alpha Chapter help the Smokey Mountains project: In the Fall our House sponsors a sale of the handicrafts produced by the craftsmen of Gatlinburg. This sale provides a market for the crafts; it is open to anyone. All the girls in the house enjoy setting up the display, especially when the products are so varied. Anything from brooms to mugs to jewelry to stationery can be found at the sale. It's always fun to give the buyers a little background on our project and what it means to us. This not only makes the crafts more meaningful, but helps us to take an active part in this altruistic project! We at Washington Alpha are anxious to do our part in helping to promote the success of the people at Gatlinburg. The progress shown to date is certainly an inspiration to us all. PAM WAGNER The Warm Feeling of Giving WASHINGTON BETA The Washington Beta chapter feels that the Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the present opportunity for Pi Phi's to give of their service, time and money. We are planning to have a Settlement School program to inform members of the project and the potentials and opportunities which it opens to us. After enthusiasm is raised, a fund-raising project will follow. This project, Penny a Pound for Pi Phi (an idea from Wisconsin Beta) will tax each girl a penny for each pound of her weight. The pennies will be pasted on a poster board in the shape of a huge piggy bank for display. We feel that with adequate support this project will develop into a vital institution. It will, enrich the lives of those who take advantage of its facilities, learn a trade and become productive citizens; as well THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 77 as the lives of those who benefit from the usefullness of the products. In the age of mechanization, the Arrow in the Smokies will play its part in preserving creativity and personal pride in an object, as contrasted to the impersonal qualities of a machine-made product. . The members of Washington Beta are very proud of the philanthropies project, not only because working together towards a common goal brings unity to Pi Phi's everywhere, but also because of the personal opportunities, creative and technical, which it brings to so many. This project enables everyone to experience the warm feeling of giving. AMY RADEWAN A Worthwhile Program OREGON ALPHA Oregon Alpha of Pi Beta Phi feels that the Centennial Project: "Arrow In The Smokies" is a new and exciting addition. The Summer Craft Workshop has proved itself to be beneficial and rewarding to everyone involved, and with the expansion of more workshops, more and more people will be reached. The Craft Workshops, are beneficial in many ways. The inhabitants of the Gatlinburg area are able to gain a living because of the tourist trade drawn there, the instructors and the assistants of the Summer Craft Workshops are earning a living besides fullfilling their own aesthetic needs. The students are learning the crafts taught in order that they might re-turn to their homes and teach others. This is a never ending circle because ell those taught will continue to expand and teach others. We feel that it is an honor that Pi Beta Phi is in co-operation with the University of Tennessee in such a worthwhile program. Oregon Alpha is planning on having a skit-dinner to inform the chapter members of the Arrow in the Smokies Program. For our fund raising project we would like to have an Arrowcraft Shop Sale before the Christmas holidays. We feel the citizens of Eugene and the University of Oregon Student Body would be very interested in our crafts, and this would spread knowledge of our Centennial project, besides helping to raise our funds. Oregon Alpha's main philanthropic project is helping teach in the Handicapped Children's Swimming Program. Pi Phi, Marsha Almeter, is in charge of the program. NANCY ELMGREN A Conscious Endeavor OREGON BETA The members of Oregon Beta are very proud to be a part of Pi Beta Phi's new philanthropy project, Arrow in the Smokies. Pi Beta Phi must grow to meet the needs of it's members and nation alike. We must continue to broaden our horizons and since we are founded as a scholastic organization in what way could we better serve than by supplying an opportunity for education. Thoreau said: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeaver. Our conscious endeavor for this next one hundred years is Arrow in the Smokies. Through education we will preserve and extend our national heritage. Thus we are building a brighter future from the past. We are expanding to fill present and fu'ture needs and by doing this we will continue to grow as an organization of college women. We must not forget our heritage; we must preserve it. Oregon Beta feels that Arrow in the Smokies will help to preserve this heritage as it helps to educate our people and by helping to preserve our past will help to build a stronger and more united future. We can only wait to see what light our flame has cast by the end of this, our second, century.. Our hope is that it will continue to grow in brightness as it has during our past century. Services Extended IDAHO ALPHA Pi Beta Phi .can truly be proud of its nationally renowned philanthropic establishment, Arrow in ,the Smokies. Due to the dedication and loyalty of many individual Pi Phi alums and the support of many active chapters, and ,alum clubs, this project has grown since its establishment in 1910, by the Settlement School committee, to a greatly enlarged and expanded program partly affiliated with the University of Tennessee and making meaningful and productive the lives of many previously poor and backward people. This year, along with Pi Beta Phi's Centennial celebration, a great program is being put .into effect to expand and build this philanthropic project so that more of its services can be extended to make an even greater contribution. Idaho Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi would, like to greatly congratulate the leaders in this program and offer a Centennial wish that the Arrow in the Smokies may grow and expand in Gatlinburg, and perhaps in the future, even in. other locations where the need is great. Through our philanthropic project, all Pi Phis can make a significant contribution to the realization of Pi Phi ideals. In the area of public relations, Idaho Alpha Chap-ter of Pi. Beta Phi has contributed to the Fund for the Performing Arts Center here at the University of Idaho, a 6-million-dollar project, and also to the Cam-pus Chest Fund. CHERYL KOCH "Bigger and Better" CALIFORNIA GAMMA California Gamma, like all Pi Phi Chapters, has always been especially proud of our heritage as the pioneer in women's fraternities. As a non-profit organization we have always been proud to point out our high scholastic standards and social activities but, today, we are even prouder of the philanthropic projects that our sorority has developed. Now as Pi Beta Phi starts its second century our Chapter feels that our new philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, will be "bigger and better" yet. Because we do live across the, country it is SOMetimes difficult for us to really see the good that is being accomplished by these projects. We support them 'but we do not really know that much about 78 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI them. To remedy this we are currently planning a program for early November which will not only tell about our philanthropies, but which will, we hope, show another reason why we can be so proud to be Pi Phis. But the idea is not just to learn about and to support morally our philanthropies. We could all talk for hours about how proud we are of what we are doing and what a great project Arrow in the Smokies is but that will not make it a success. As Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice President of Philanthropies said in the September 1967 ARROW the important word for this and all other philanthropies is "yield". Our chapter realizes this and consequently we are also going to try to initiate plans for more publicity and for some fund-raising projects that will show our sup-port. California Gamma feels that the key to the success of this Centennial Project and to Pi Beta Phi's second century lies in the contributions of each and every Chapter. CHRISTI HUGGINS Symbol of Pride CALIFORNIA DELTA The year 1967 marked for Pi Beta Phi one hundred years of sisterhood through fraternity life. Yet only half a century ago that sister-hood became truly meaningful with the establishment of the national philanthropy. The Settlement School has become a symbol of pride. Not yet a member, a pledge wonders what Pi Phi represents. She questions what the purpose of Pi Phi is and what it means to national, the members, and finally to herself. She discovers the true significance of Pi Phi when she learns about the Settlement School. The school synibolizes Pi Phi's higher values and goals. The educational centers and workshops of Gatlin-burg endure and expand with the devotion and interest of actives across the nation. Donations from each chapter and alumni continually pour into the school as a genuine expression of support for the work and progress made by the philanthropy. Future expansion made possible by the donations will focus on the pro-motion of education for all types of people. Students, teachers, doctors, industrial technicians, and even re-tired persons will benefit from the classes offered. The Settlement School of Gatlinburg symbolizes the ideals of its founders and its donors and is truly something of value. LINDA DAVIS Native Crafts Kept Alive! CALIFORNIA EPSILON--Pi Beta Phi's Arrow ex-tends across the entire nation. When each Pi Phi thinks of service, her thoughts are pointed upward to that special place high in the Smokies. Here we find the starting point for the first sorority to establish their philanthropy. Pi Beta Phi felt this such a worthy endeavor it has been maintained ,all through the years. Being the oldest fraternity for women, Pi Phi's felt the need to keep alive one of the oldest and true American art cultures. Industrialism is rapidly causing the extinction of true handicrafts, but Arrow in the Smokies providesthe opportunity for these people to keep their native craft still alive. Besides the mere craft aspect, employment is created along with the recreational aspect of the school. For those people merely interested in learning a craft, the opportunity is constantly provided for them. Because university credit is given, it allows those seeking a profession in art to continue their work. The future of the Arrow in the Smokies is tremendous. Expansion of this foundation cannot help but grow because of the support it has received and will continue to receive. The second hundred years will prove to be as successful as the first hundred because Arrow in the Smokies keeps alive for future generations the artistic heritage of that area of the United States. SUSAN DRISCOLL Tremendous Job Ahead NEVADA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi can be more than hopeful about its philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. This dream of building an Arts and Crafts addition to the University of Tennessee will become a reality, just as the Settlement School has. Through the financial and moral assistance of every Pi Phi, the Settlement School has grown to be one of the largest crafts' centers of the United States. If we look at the past success of our Settlement School, we cannot fail in our hope for the future, Arrow in the Smokies. As hopeful as we are, we must realize that the construction of such a project is a tremendous job which will need the support of every member. The Pi Phis at Nevada Alpha Chapter are organizing two projects to raise funds for Arrow in the Smokies. We plan to have a Sandwich Sale and a Spaghetti Feed. Our advertisements for both these functions will explain Arrow in the Smokies, and the importance of this philanthropy should aid our success. The Sandwich Sale will consist of selling Poor Boy sandwiches to campus residents on two Sundays. The Spaghetti Feed will also be on a Sunday, because the campus cafeteria only serves brunch on Sundays. We will have the dinner on or near the University, pre-pare it ourselves, and only charge a dollar for tickets sold in advance. We hope to receive a good profit which we will donate to Arrow in the Smokies. If every Pi Phi Chapter can do something similar, Arrow in the Smokies will be transformed from a dream into a reality. STEPHANIE LORIGAN Art Appreciation Continues! ARIZONA ALPHA The Arizona Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi highly commends the progress and great eagerness toward our new Centennial project of 1966 through 1967. We are very enthusiastic to increase aid to the underprivileged people in the Gatlinburg area. By enlarging the Summer Craft Workshop, we may be able, not only to help these poverty-stricken mountain people, but also to increase the knowledge of dying traditional crafts such as stitchery and weaving that have been so much a part of the early pio (Continued on page 87) i Beta Phi Pledges These young ladies pledged Pi Beta Phi chapters at colleges and universities with a fall rush or open rush in the first semester of the 1967-68 school year.

        70 THE ARROW OF N BETA PHI Pride from Proximity TENNESSEE DELTA Tennessee Delta takes special pride in our new Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, since it is located in our own state. By expanding the present accredited summer craft work-shop, adding new buildings and staff members, and maintaining the school on a year round basis, we feel that we will be giving others an opportunity for education and a fuller development of their talents in our second century of achievement. It is our hope that students will come to perfect their arts and crafts for use in rehabilitation, in teaching home economics and the mentally retarded. We give our support to this new project by asking both our members and pledges to purchase two magazines from the Pi Beta Phi magazine agency. Because we are near Gatlinburg, many of our members have had the privilege of visiting the Arrowcraft Shop. They have brought back to our chapter unique objects designed there, thus stimulating a genuine interest for some of our more talented members to attend the sessions. Our main philanthropic project last year was the adoption of a group of officers in Viet Nam. During the year we corresponded with them and sent them goodies and care packages. Projects for this fall include providing Thanksgiving baskets for needy families and Christmas gifts for underprivileged children and visiting an old folks home twice a week. We also support the Maternal Welfare League of Memphis, which is devoted to research in birth defects. We are indeed proud to make Pi Beta Phi a pioneer in its second century in a great philanthropy Arrow in the Smokies. SUSAN FEATHERSTON A Major Responsibility ALABAMA BETA "Airow in the Smokies" is our major responsibility now and in the future. We hope that our contribution will help bring this dream to a reality for Pi Phis and those who will benefit from the Arrow in the Smokies. The future of this project depends on the backing of the individual chapters. We plan to inform every member of the importance of this project and how each person can help. Our philanthropies chairman and program chairman have been working together to present several programs on the Arrow in the Smokies. Our chapter is very limited in ways of making money on campus, because of University rules against fund-raising events. Candy selling by the pledges in the spring is our only big fund-raising event. Of course the actives contribute a great deal to this project, too. Our main way of collecting funds is through individual contributions and these go to the Centennial Fund and the Settlement School. Even though we are limited in our ways of making money, we still take a great deal of pride in our philanthropies pro-gram. For our local philanthropy, we have several different projects for the year. Through the we sponsor a child of a needy family who receives guid-ance and care through a well-organized program. During Christmas, we help a fraternity give a Santa Claus party for children from the welfare department. This can be one of the most rewarding experiences to see the smiling faces of these children. Also the pledges give a party and presents to the mentally retarded children at Partlow's. Through these projects, Alabama Beta plans to con-tribute their time and efforts to our local philanthropies as well as to the "Arrow in the Smokies". JUDY LORD Contribution to Happiness and Independence ALABAMA GAMMA Of education, Abraham Lincoln said, . . . "I can only say that 'I view it as the most important subject that we as a people can be en-gaged in. . . ." With our new project, Arrow in the Smokies, Pi Beta Phi is engaging in the "important subject" of education. Our approach, however, is not the traditional readin', writin' and 'rithmetic one. By educating our senior citizens and the handicapped in the use of their talents, Arrow in the Smokies will open the door to a more useful and satisfying life for them. Alabama Gamma looks on Arrow in the Smokies as a way for each of us to contribute to the happiness and independence of others less fortunate than we. We are very enthusiastic about this new project and plan to support it wholeheartedly with our contributions. We are proud that Pi Beta Phi is pioneering yet another worthy and needed philanthropy. The Arrow in the Smokies will gleam brightly as it points upward the goal of a more full and rich life not only for those benefiting by the project, but also for those of us who will help to make it a success. MARGARET-ANNE HESTER All Out Support FLORIDA GAMMA In this the 100th year of Pi Beta Phi, Florida Gamma hopes to do everything it can to support the fraternity's Centennial project. The project, which is a Craft Workshop to be built in co-operation with the University of Tennessee, will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. The workshop will be located in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. We understand that the goal of this project is that it will become the outstanding center of education in the field of arts and crafts, drawing students from the United States, Canada and foreign nations instead of being limited to the local area. We realize that this project is quite an undertaking and that it cannot go on until the required funds are raised and made avail-able. One very successful fund raising project has already been accomplished by the girls of Florida Gamma. We put on a "Mister Legs Contest" one night in the school cafeteria. After a short speech by one of the girls about the Settlement School and the Centennial project and about just where the money would be THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 71 going, one boy from each fraternity marched around the tables in the costume which he thought would best show off his legs. Each boy was escorted by a pretty Pi Phi carrying a money box for the collection of "votes." It was all so much fun and such a success that we plan to make it a yearly thing. More fund raising projects are planned for the rest of the year as we of Florida Gamma feel that it is up to each of us to support this, the first philanthropic project supported by a fraternity and giving financial support through active chapters and alumni clubs to expand an educational program. KATHRYN ANN BROWN The Time Is Ripe! GEORGIA ALPHA--Arrow in the Smokies is living proof that the originators of the first national altruistic project of any woman's fraternity demonstrated remarkable foresight when they presented plans for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. What began as a rehabilitation center to insure the education of underprivileged residents has become a haven for art students, teachers, therapists, crafts-men and hobbyists. Because of its close proximity to the University of Georgia, which boasts one of the finest art schools in the nation, Arrow in the Smokies should continue to offer additional training to Georgia Alpha's and the nation's art students. There has been a strong in-crease in interest shown by Georgia citizens for art and cultural improvement in that field. Atlanta's new center for the performing arts, its museums and galleries have been revitalized and replenished by civic leaders aware of their importance in the community. The proposed changes and improvements at the Centennial Convention could not have come at a more opportune time in this area. The time is ripe for citizens throughout Georgia to be made aware of the expanded opportunities now available to them through Arrow in the Smokies. Georgia Alpha has conducted a minor public relations campaign for the fraternity philanthropy in the past during major rush seasons on campus. The products of the school, its mechanics, and its rewards are explained to hundreds of girls each year. Whether they are pledged to our chapter or not, these girls are made aware of the opportunities existing just a few hours from Athens. SUZANNE WEBB Project Yields International Benefits ILLINOIS EPSILON Illinois Epsilon was proud to be one of the top ten contributors to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Now, at the beginning of the fraternity's second one-hundred years, the chapter is enthusiastic about supporting our new project, Arrow in the Smokies. We are especially pleased that our organization, which has given so much to girls throughout the world, now has a project in which each of us can make contributions that will yield international benefits. As in the past, our chapter will continue to take advantage of all opportunities to advertize our philanthropic project. During rush we displayed a variety of Settlement School handicrafts. We also have plans for similar displays before Christmas and during Parents' Week-End. Our chapter feels that the success of Arrow in the Smokies will not be based solely upon monetary contributions. Only through national publicity outside of Pi Beta Phi circles will such a project become a reality, for as stated before, the benefits of Arrow in the Smokies can not help but be international, BETTY CARTER Tutoring Center WISCONSIN BETA The women of Wisconsin Beta are deeply interested in the work of our national philanthropies, especially Arrow in the Smokies. The employment which it offers to the needy people of the area undoubtedly raises their living standard and allows them the chance to enjoy a better life. However, our chapter is especially interested in the continual development of our native crafts which is fostered through the Arroweraft workshop and the new Arts and Crafts Center. It gives us all a genuine feeling of satisfaction to know that we are helping to keep a part of our American heritage alive, not only in Tennessee, but throughout the country. We realize that in our times of unrest and turbulence, our national philanthropy is working toward establishing good will throughout the world when the many foreign students who come to study return home with their new skills. Our chapter is now able to devote most of its time to our national philanthropy because we have already raised the necessary funds and achieved our goal for our local philanthropy, the Beloit Tutoring Center in Mississippi. This tutoring center has been greatly successful in the past few years in its work with the student classified as a "low achiever." And so our work goes on as we prepare for our Christmas bazaar to be held early in December to raise funds for our own Settlement School. We will be selling various types of handywork which we are now in the process of making. We happily continue this work in the true spirit of Pi Beta Phi. BETSY BLANEY What Does the Future Hold? MANITOBA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi became, with the initiation of the Settlement School at Gatlinburg, the first fraternity to have a national philanthropy; the first fraternity to show the world that they were a service instititution, not just a social club. In those early days, all that the Pi Phi's envisioned was a country school, bringing education where there had been none before, in honor of those twelve aspiring young women, so keenly interested in education them-selves, who had formed our Pi Phi. Our reality, in 1967 has grown far beyond their wildest dreams. Where there was no school, Pi Phi built a school; and staffed it, and, over the years, developed it into the university accredited institution it is today. Where there was no doctor, or even nurse, to care for the sick, aged and young children, Pi Phi brought in their own nurses, and doctors, and taught basic hygiene in 72 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the school; now there is a clinic and doctor in the town. When Pi Phi came to Gatlinburg, the hill people were poor, barely ekeing out an existence on their land. Pi Phi has taught these hill people crafts, and bought them the needed equipment; now there is thriving home industry, which Pi Phi supports in its Arrowcraft shops. Much indeed has been accomplished in the past fifty years at Gatlinburg. So who can say what the future holds for the Arrow in the Smokies? There is much that can still become, and more that we cannot envision today, but that will be accomplished. There is always a need for education, and always an opportunity for service. The future of Pi Phi holds far more than its past, at Gatlinburg in the Smokies. BARBARA EDMONDS Key to Pi Phi Future SOUTH DAKOTA ALPHA A century ago when the twelve founders of Pi Beta Phi met to organize a women's fraternity for the purpose of enhancing the nobility of womanhood, they faced the problem of proving what positive goal such an organization could accomplish. Today the same problem still exists for twentieth-century fraternity women. In comparison to the immensity of world conflicts, the acquiring of social graces and the finding of strength in the bonds of personal friendships cannot alone justify the existence of women's fraternal, groups. At a recent officers' retreat members of South Dakota Alpha heard their university's Coordinator of Student Affairs challenge them to ACT instead of REACT. Too often sororities and fraternities concentrate their efforts in rebelling against and attempting to reject the college regulations placed upon them. Truly this shows that they care and are alive, but why must every action be only a response? Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic project, Arrow in the Smokies, holds the key to the future of our college fraternity. Expanding the summer craft workshop is a definite step Pi Beta Phi can take forward showing to the public that we are not organized for the sole purpose of our personal advancement in the social aspects of life. It is pertinent for South Dakota A and all other chapters to recognize the new centennial plans for Arrow in the Smokies and show to the public that this too is the purpose of our fraternity. And thus, while doing this, we will be acting and advancing the welfare of others as well as ourselves. CINDY CIMPL Enthusiasm Spreads Rapidly MINNESOTA ALPHA At Minnesota Alpha, we had a change in feeling recently toward the Settlement School. That change is due mainly to three things. First, one of our members visited Gatlinburg last summer while on vacation and her stories about it have made it come alive for us. Secondly, our two delegates to Convention brought back an enthusiasm for Settlement School which is rapidly spreading to the whole chapter. Third, and, we feel, most important, is the new name which has been given to the project, Arrow in the Smokies. This name means more to us than the words "philanthropy" or "Settlement School." The word "Arrow" alone brings to mind the chain of friendship which exists coast to coast and generation to generation in Pi Beta Phi. It brings to mind the love and devotion we feel toward one another .and toward all that is good and true. It reminds us that we in Pi Beta Phi are striving for the highest ideals. Then, the joining of the word "Arrow" with the site of our philanthropy, the "Smokies," joins all these feelings to the Settlement School. It sets the tone for the spirit of Settlement School. Now that this spirit has become more apparent to us, it has become apparent also that it is our job to maintain and spread the spirit. To do this, we, first of all, made Settlement School a much larger part of Fall Rush Information Day. We told its story in more de-tail and displayed many of the craft. Throughout, we tried to convey the spirit of giving which started Settlement School and which keeps it growing year after year. Secondly, we have made it a point to leave the Arrowcraft catalog in the living room where waiting guests will pick it up. And we have coached all our members so that they can answer any questions the guests might ask about Gatlinburg and the School, or about the Arrowcraft Worshop and the ordering of the articles made there. Finally, we plan to add, to our annual Settlement School information program, the personal reactions of our active who visited Gatlinburg last summer and of a former active who spent a whole summer there. With these new ideas and spurred on by our new feelings about Arrow in the Smokies, we hope at Minnesota Alpha to make Settlement School known and loved, and therefore supported, by an ever-increasing number of people. J. MARCHE L Emphasis During Rush MISSOURI GAMMA Missouri Gamma puts emphasis on our national philanthropy project during rush. Because we think it is a unique idea and binds us in further sisterhood, we want to help bring success to Arrow in the Smokies. Rather than taking a chance in having some rushees miss our story by leaving discussion up to the individual rushers, we have our philanthropies chairman give a small talk on this subject to the entire group. She has a display of articles made at the Arrowcraft Shop set up and is ready to answer questions. We feel that the best way to show our interest to the public is through enthusiasm in our attitudes. We support the Settlement School as our chapter philanthropy and throughout the year we sponsor money-making projects to provide funds. Our annual mum sale at Homecoming is a major activity. We have great success with this project and are able to expand it as each year passes. Another project is the Rummage Sale we have for the public. A location in the city is sought that will provide us with the maximum expo-sure to the public. Each girl is responsible for a prearranged number of articles and rarely do we have much left after a two day sale. We also have some type of candy sale on campus, and we hope to have an apple sale later in the year. Each year we try to THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 73 have some other type of fund raising project in addition to our annual activities. Also, members are encouraged to order articles from the Settlement School through our chairman. Last year a senior, Sahanny Johnson, received the California Alpha Scholarship. We are proud to be taking active participation in support of Arrow in the Smokies. Each year we hope to build this participation and in this way push Arrow in the Smokies to great success. DEBBIE NELSON Inevitable Growth Seen ARKANSAS ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies definitely has a future, and as more than a dream in the minds of Pi Phis everywhere. With 111 active chapters and 339 alum clubs working in every state and in Canada, the entire settlement school project is bound to grow. At Arkansas Alpha, we work to promote the larger philanthropic project of Arrow in the Smokies and at the same time we are active on local projects. We have the Arrowcraft sale every year. Before the sale, we contact the alums and neighbors and faculty members, to let them know when we will have the display. By having the sale, we bring the entire Arrow in the Smokies project to the citizens of Fayetteville. The profits from the sale go back to the project. Recently our chapter joined the Chamber of Commerce and by this we hope to acquaint the Fayetteville community more with Pi Phi as a locally and nationally active fraternity. On a local level we carry on several philanthropic projects. This year we have adopted a young American Indian girl. We send money for her schooling and some of her needs and write to her often. Last year we were awarded a trophy from the Community Chest for giving the greatest contribution to their drive of all organizations on campus. We also have a Christmas party each year for underprivileged children in the community. JO ANN PRYOR Hope for the Future MISSISSIPPI ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies means hope, love, responsibility, opportunity, pride, and yield to Mississippi Alpha Pi Phis as well as Pi Phis throughout the nation. In 1912 with the organization of the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, the dream of almost half a century was realized, and each bounding step brought hope for the future to Pi Beta Phi and to those who come there to learn and work. Love, ever-present in Pi Beta Phi, found a special outlet in this national philanthropy as Pi Phis help others help themselves. Responsibility and opportunity were basic building blocks for the Settlement School. But of these pride and yield are the most important for they are interchangeable each producing the other, creating a never-ending, every-increasing cycle. At the turn of a century of happiness and growth, Pi Beta Phi adopts a centennial project which will follow in the footsteps of the Settlement School and the Arrowcraft Shop. Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the Summer Craft Workshop and will act in a more wide-ranged capacity to better meet the demands of a growing country and fraternity. Arrow in the Smokies has been made possible through planning and hard work, and with the continued support of every Pi Phi it cannot fail. EDDIE WELFORD Meeting Leisure's Challenge IOWA GAMMA Pi Beta Phi's Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is an expansion of the Craft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tenn., which is co-sponsored by the Fraternity and the University of Tennessee. The Craft Workshop offers a broad curriculum in the Arts and Crafts, and the courses offer college credit for graduate and undergraduate work. Today there is an increased amount of leisure time offered to our citizens due to automation and the specialized times. When this leisure time is added to the need in our society for individual creativity, the logical solution is a greater emphasis on arts and crafts. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, the opportunity for creative self-expression will be given. To further the growth of our philanthropy and help Arrow in the Smokies to become a reality, each chapter member must take an active interest in the project and help to raise money for its support. One way to do this is to hold Arrowcraft sales, which would acquaint our members with the quality and variety of articles made. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, it will enable individuals to develop their talents, the handicapped to become a little more independent, and older citizens to feel more worthwhile. An old Hindu Maxim sums up the responsibilities of each one of us. "He does not live in vain, who employs his wealth, his thought, his speech to advance the good of others." VICKI VOELKER Action Key to Success! IOWA ZETA Pi Beta Phi has always been concerned with helping others to help themselves, this is evident in the organization of Chapters and Clubs. This concern has been extended to people outside the membership of Pi Beta Phi through the program of the first philanthropy supported by a fraternity the Settlement School. In keeping with this idea Pi Beta Phi's Centennial project is a Craft Workshop in co-operation with the University of Tennessee to be built in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. It will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. As members of Iowa Zeta, we are proud to give our support in such an outstanding project. We know that creative arts have been found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also our Alumnae Clubs can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Se74 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. Creative crafts develop skill, provide an outlet for self-expression, increase sensitiveness as to surrounding giving dignity to common things, bring the handicapped into better adjustment, and are .a delight to the adventuresome. Iowa Zeta realizes that we must look at the coming of the new. All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. This is only possible with the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. As members of Iowa Zeta, we pledge our loyal support and are proud that we can contribute to such an excellent project. To know that we are helping other people as well as our members, sparks a feeling of pride and it is a pleasure to say that we belong to such a wonderful organization as Pi Beta Phi. ANN MONTGOMERY Improved Publicity Planned NEBRASKA BETA Nebraska Beta has started an interesting new local philanthropic project this year by offering its services to the Nebraska State Hospital. Five members a week, consisting of three actives and two pledges, work as volunteers in the hospital lounge or canteen. In this manner they are able to serve as cashiers, waitresses, and fountain girls and at the same time build positive relationships with the patients. In addition to our new local philanthropic project Nebraska Beta is planning to hold its annual Settlement School sale. Posters, announcements, and news-paper coverage will aid in publicizing the sale, which will be open to the entire campus. It is hoped that profits from this sale and magazine sales will help establish support for another Nebraska Beta project one aimed at making the benefit of Arrow in the Smokies known to more than just Pi Phis. With help from local newspapers and campus newspapers a brief description of the aims of Arrow in the Smokies will be presented. Members of the Lincoln Weaving Club and other local craft clubs will be encouraged to con-tact our chapter for information about sponsorship to Tennessee in the form of a loan or scholarship. Public relations will be improved and Pi Phi's achievements and opportunities will be made available to many out-side of our chapter. Nebraska Beta feels that the greatest way it can make Arrow in the Smokies meaningful is by sponsoring a member who can benefit from the experience . . . a member outside of our own chapter. KITTY MCMANUS Success Through Support KANSAS BETA Pi Beta Phi was founded by twelve girls at Monmouth College in 1867. Since that time its membership has grown enormously and has spread to college campuses throughout the United States and Canada. Similarly Arrow in the Smokies should grow and grow. It will do so 'because the same enthusiastic spirit and love for Pi Phi will be behind it. There are already signs of this "success through support." The idea of a centennial project was first realized at the 1954 Convention. Since that time interest has been great. Last year over one hundred thou-sand dollars was contributed to "Arrow in the Smokies !" As time goes on and Pi Phi's continue to be generous with this, their outstanding philanthropic project, Gatlinburg, Tennessee should be a huge center of activity. Numerous buildings will be gradually constructed for art and craft classes until it will be a complete center. Then this Craft Center will be of tremendous benefit to its teachers and students, as well as artists everywhere. Preserving the native arts and crafts of our country, it should become a well-known and respected cultural project. Even more important, as "Arrow in the Smokies" grows, so will the reputation of Pi Beta Phi. Through its outstanding achievements and its numerous philanthropic projects from the time of its founding, Pi Phi has already demonstrated to others its high standards and principles. Now, because of this wonderful Centennial Project, the name "Pi Beta Phi" could become synonomous with "service." And as this spirit of Pi Phi, which began in 1867, continues to grow, so will the 1967 Centennial Project "Arrow in the Smokies." MARSHA GARRETT Serving Mankind OKLAHOMA ALPHA What are the purposes of a Pi Beta Phi philanthropic project in the Smokies? This is a question that we at Oklahoma Alpha are asking and have attempted to answer. The necessity of vocational training is one answer to the need for the Pi Phi service project. Vocational training can bring industries to the area, provide jobs and give the skilled worker a sense of accomplishment. The type of craftmanship learned from the project is another answer to our question. Not only can skilled industrial techniques be taught, but skills in the crafting of handmade articles. If the handcrafting skills of the people of the Smokies can be preserved, Pi Phi can preserve the past for the future. Not only will the lives of the people of the Smokies be enriched but the lives of everyone who views their craftmanship. If we, as part of the Greek system can reach beyond our realm of membership and aid others, we have served not only ourselves but mankind. By providing service outside our membership, this project can not only answer our goal of service but can be-come our theme for the next hundred years of fraternity growth. NANCY BREEDEN Fund-raising Projects Unlimited! OKLAHOMA BETA Members of Pi Beta Phi, have always tried to be of service to the people around us and to people in need. A momentous step was taken THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 75 when in 1910, we began laying the plans for our Arrowcraft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. From this time, much progress has been made and we here at Oklahoma Beta are proud of our fraternities lead in the area of philanthropy. The Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is another significant step for our fraternity. It is one of the best ways in which the art of hand made crafts and skills can be perpetuated. Our chapter feels that there are many possibilities for the Arrow in the Smokies. With the increased amount of leisure time of our society and the growing number of people over sixty-five, there is a need to find a creative and constructive outlet for our human energies. The Arrow in the Smokies 'can provide this outlet by giving many a place to come and learn while perpetuating the art of crafts. There is also the possibility of the Arrow in the Smokies as a training ground for instructors who could help with the rehabilitation of those people in our nation who need the therapy of learning an enjoy-able, constructive, and physically beneficial skill. It is with these possibilities and others that we see the potential which lies in the creation of this new philanthropy. In our own chapter we try to publicize our philanthropy through our annual Arrowcraft Sale. As a chapter, we also sponsor an annual Easter Egg hunt for the Underprivileged children in town. In the past we have also provided food for a needy family at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The variety of possible fund-raising projects for the support of our Centennial Project seems to be unlimited. There is always the possibility of collecting all the loose personal items which are left in the lounge and then selling them back to the members at a small fee. The old stand by of a rummage sale has always been a profitable project for our chapter. These are some of the ideas that our chapter has concerning our new Centennial Project and it is with great hope and much expectation that we look for-ward to seeing what the future will hold for Pi Beta Phi and her philanthropy work. A New Dream TEXAS ALPHA In 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee was established as a memorial to the founders of our fraternity. Now fifty-five years later that dream has become a reality and in this our centennial year we have a new dream. Our Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, will be our major philanthropy as we start in this our second century as a Fraternity. Texas Alpha is very enthusiastic and interested in the growth and development of our newest project, Arrow in the Smokies. As the summer craft workshop is being expanded into larger sessions and more courses of study, many of our members feel that their education would be greatly enriched if they studied at the craft workshop. Especially promising to the members of Texas Alpha will be the instructions given in therapy, teaching, and in doing volunteer work. We are always interested in learning new hobbies and crafts aid many of our members are planning to spend their summers at the Settlement School learning more about these things. Pi Beta Phi and Texas Alpha will be looking for-ward to our new philanthropy. We hope that every chapter and alum club will do their part in helping to make our next hundred years as profitable and re-warding as our past hundred years has been. LYN ARNOT Importance Realized TEXAS BETA The national philanthropic project of Pi Beta Phi which was once a dream to a few, is now a reality of which every Pi Phi can, and should be proud. Gatlinburg once only a village of isolated people has now become a productive community. The Texas Beta Pi Phis are proud to assist in this national project through annual contributions. We also have several local philanthropic projects. A number of our girls tutor in connection with a YMCA program. We also take part in "Rag Mop", through which we collect clothes for Goodwill Industries. Each year we participate in a campus-wide project in connection with Greek Week. This year we cleaned up a YMCA camp. We now sponsor two foreign orphans, sending them clothes, food, and special gifts on holidays. Each Christmas we have a party for a group of orphans, complete with our own female version of Santa Claus. We of Texas Beta realize the importance of philanthropic projects. We feel that through helping others, we, ourselves, become better people. Our thoughts can be expressed by a comment made to a Pi Phi alum by a local resident of Gatlinburg, "You Pi Phis really are angels." Active Alumnce Cooperation NEW MEXICO ALPHA At present New Mexico Alpha is involved in a magazine selling campaign to raise money for the Settlement School Fund. Each girl in the chapter will be required to sell two magazines. It was decided that this was not too much to ask. Part of this money will be used to support the Arrow in the Smokies and we feel that this will be a step in the right direction for helping it become a reality. Our active chapter does not have a local philanthropy, although our alums do. They help support Casa Angelica, a home for retarded children in Albuquerque. Last year through a home designer show they earned enough money to purchase a station wagon for the home. We helped the Alums in providing a free babysitting service for the mothers who came to see the show. Each semester our chapter gives the Mary Lovelace scholarship to a deserving active. This scholarship pays for the active's dues for the semester for which she earned it. Doug Munson was the recipient of the scholarship for this semester. A Broader Dream UTAH ALPHA In March 1912, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in the Great Smokey Mountains, was opened to thirteen eager, young students, only two short years after it was decided at convention that an educational project should be established in memory of our founders. At first the Settlement School, the first national phi76 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI lanthropy of its kind, provided an education to the mountain people through home teaching, but soon land was secured on which to build a school house, in spite of the reluctancy of the townspeople. Through the years, the once small community has expanded into a large town which now draws about five million tourists a year. At the present time the town consists of the Arrowcraft Workshop, a health center, a school house, the Loom House, and a dormatory, the Red Bard, to accommodate some of the students. Every year, hundreds of children and adults come to Gatlinburg from all parts of the country to learn all the crafts taught there. It is by these people that all the jewelry, wood craft and loom work available through every Pi Beta Phi chapter is made. All proceeds from the sale of these things goes back to the Settlement School for improvements and expansion. Every Pi Phi chapter in the United States and Canada supports our Settlement School and through each individual chapter's philanthropies program, we are able to promote improvement of the school both through the sale of the Craft Shop products and their money-making projects directed toward raising money to donate to the school. In Utah Alpha we have had a great deal of support of the Settlement School through the sale of the crafts. It is pleasing to know that people not even associated with Pi Phi call to inquire about the merchandise and the school that they've heard about from friends. Thus it is evident that the fame of the Settlement School has spread all over the country and through this continuing expansion and rise in sup-porters, the dream of a bigger, better and more adequate Settlement School will soon be a reality. KIM KOLLER "King" Crowned for Settlement School MONTANA ALPHA In the summer of 1966 two of our members, Marilyn Fitzgerald and Judi O'Donnell, had the privilege and opportunity to visit the Arrow in the Smokies. They had of course studied about Pi Beta Phi's outstanding philanthropy but both agreed they were not prepared for the large, modern school which greeted them. Several people told them how thankful and indebted they are to Pi Phi and what a wonderful project we have. One man in particular told them that his son was to graduate the following year because of assistance the Pi Phis had given him. The girls strongly urge all Pi Phis to take any opportunity they have to visit our Arrow in the Smokies. "Every member of Pi Beta Phi can be proud of this project because we are looking beyond our needs to those of others. We are not only helping others, we are preserving a beautiful art for the benefit of all. Because Montana Alpha feels that this national philanthropy is so important we do not sponsor any particular local philanthropy. Each year we hold a contest for the `King of the Hill' in which one member of each fraternity is nominated by his fraternity for this honor. These men are invited to the house several times and are asked to present some form of entertainment for us. The members of our house then vote for one of the men and on a Saturday night we hold a campus-wide `Derby Dance' to crown the winning`King of the Hill.' The other candidates are then our `Brothers of the Arrow.' The proceeds from the dance are sent to the Arrow in the Smokies as our donation. We are very proud that last year Montana Alpha donated the largest contribution. We feel that a project such as ours would be a good method for any chapter to use to promote our national philanthropy. CAROLE POFFENBERGER The Realm of "Others" WASHINGTON ALPHA Our philanthropic project in the Smokey Mountains area is the fulfillment of ,a desire embedded deep in every Pi Phi heart. College life is full of the everyday hustle and bustle of schoolwork, campus activities, dates, and friends. Our philanthropic project adds a meaningful dimension to a college career: We project ourselves beyond the realm of "self'' to the realm of "others." Because we feel that Gatlinburg is one of the primary responsibilities of our House, the Pi Phi's at Washington Alpha display the material crafts as well as the spiritual ideals of this once backward area during our September Rush. We want these prospective pledges to see the deeper meaning behind Pi Beta Phi. Each Fall, we are reminded of the significance of the Smokey Mountains project. Hundreds of people in Gatlinburg are being educated through the nationwide effort of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity; they are learning a livelihood in handicrafts; they are gaining self-respect. How do we at Washington Alpha Chapter help the Smokey Mountains project: In the Fall our House sponsors a sale of the handicrafts produced by the craftsmen of Gatlinburg. This sale provides a market for the crafts; it is open to anyone. All the girls in the house enjoy setting up the display, especially when the products are so varied. Anything from brooms to mugs to jewelry to stationery can be found at the sale. It's always fun to give the buyers a little background on our project and what it means to us. This not only makes the crafts more meaningful, but helps us to take an active part in this altruistic project! We at Washington Alpha are anxious to do our part in helping to promote the success of the people at Gatlinburg. The progress shown to date is certainly an inspiration to us all. PAM WAGNER The Warm Feeling of Giving WASHINGTON BETA The Washington Beta chapter feels that the Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the present opportunity for Pi Phi's to give of their service, time and money. We are planning to have a Settlement School program to inform members of the project and the potentials and opportunities which it opens to us. After enthusiasm is raised, a fund-raising project will follow. This project, Penny a Pound for Pi Phi (an idea from Wisconsin Beta) will tax each girl a penny for each pound of her weight. The pennies will be pasted on a poster board in the shape of a huge piggy bank for display. We feel that with adequate support this project will develop into a vital institution. It will, enrich the lives of those who take advantage of its facilities, learn a trade and become productive citizens; as well THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 77 as the lives of those who benefit from the usefullness of the products. In the age of mechanization, the Arrow in the Smokies will play its part in preserving creativity and personal pride in an object, as contrasted to the impersonal qualities of a machine-made product. . The members of Washington Beta are very proud of the philanthropies project, not only because working together towards a common goal brings unity to Pi Phi's everywhere, but also because of the personal opportunities, creative and technical, which it brings to so many. This project enables everyone to experience the warm feeling of giving. AMY RADEWAN A Worthwhile Program OREGON ALPHA Oregon Alpha of Pi Beta Phi feels that the Centennial Project: "Arrow In The Smokies" is a new and exciting addition. The Summer Craft Workshop has proved itself to be beneficial and rewarding to everyone involved, and with the expansion of more workshops, more and more people will be reached. The Craft Workshops, are beneficial in many ways. The inhabitants of the Gatlinburg area are able to gain a living because of the tourist trade drawn there, the instructors and the assistants of the Summer Craft Workshops are earning a living besides fullfilling their own aesthetic needs. The students are learning the crafts taught in order that they might re-turn to their homes and teach others. This is a never ending circle because ell those taught will continue to expand and teach others. We feel that it is an honor that Pi Beta Phi is in co-operation with the University of Tennessee in such a worthwhile program. Oregon Alpha is planning on having a skit-dinner to inform the chapter members of the Arrow in the Smokies Program. For our fund raising project we would like to have an Arrowcraft Shop Sale before the Christmas holidays. We feel the citizens of Eugene and the University of Oregon Student Body would be very interested in our crafts, and this would spread knowledge of our Centennial project, besides helping to raise our funds. Oregon Alpha's main philanthropic project is helping teach in the Handicapped Children's Swimming Program. Pi Phi, Marsha Almeter, is in charge of the program. NANCY ELMGREN A Conscious Endeavor OREGON BETA The members of Oregon Beta are very proud to be a part of Pi Beta Phi's new philanthropy project, Arrow in the Smokies. Pi Beta Phi must grow to meet the needs of it's members and nation alike. We must continue to broaden our horizons and since we are founded as a scholastic organization in what way could we better serve than by supplying an opportunity for education. Thoreau said: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeaver. Our conscious endeavor for this next one hundred years is Arrow in the Smokies. Through education we will preserve and extend our national heritage. Thus we are building a brighter future from the past. We are expanding to fill present and fu'ture needs and by doing this we will continue to grow as an organization of college women. We must not forget our heritage; we must preserve it. Oregon Beta feels that Arrow in the Smokies will help to preserve this heritage as it helps to educate our people and by helping to preserve our past will help to build a stronger and more united future. We can only wait to see what light our flame has cast by the end of this, our second, century.. Our hope is that it will continue to grow in brightness as it has during our past century. Services Extended IDAHO ALPHA Pi Beta Phi .can truly be proud of its nationally renowned philanthropic establishment, Arrow in ,the Smokies. Due to the dedication and loyalty of many individual Pi Phi alums and the support of many active chapters, and ,alum clubs, this project has grown since its establishment in 1910, by the Settlement School committee, to a greatly enlarged and expanded program partly affiliated with the University of Tennessee and making meaningful and productive the lives of many previously poor and backward people. This year, along with Pi Beta Phi's Centennial celebration, a great program is being put .into effect to expand and build this philanthropic project so that more of its services can be extended to make an even greater contribution. Idaho Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi would, like to greatly congratulate the leaders in this program and offer a Centennial wish that the Arrow in the Smokies may grow and expand in Gatlinburg, and perhaps in the future, even in. other locations where the need is great. Through our philanthropic project, all Pi Phis can make a significant contribution to the realization of Pi Phi ideals. In the area of public relations, Idaho Alpha Chap-ter of Pi. Beta Phi has contributed to the Fund for the Performing Arts Center here at the University of Idaho, a 6-million-dollar project, and also to the Cam-pus Chest Fund. CHERYL KOCH "Bigger and Better" CALIFORNIA GAMMA California Gamma, like all Pi Phi Chapters, has always been especially proud of our heritage as the pioneer in women's fraternities. As a non-profit organization we have always been proud to point out our high scholastic standards and social activities but, today, we are even prouder of the philanthropic projects that our sorority has developed. Now as Pi Beta Phi starts its second century our Chapter feels that our new philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, will be "bigger and better" yet. Because we do live across the, country it is SOMetimes difficult for us to really see the good that is being accomplished by these projects. We support them 'but we do not really know that much about 78 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI them. To remedy this we are currently planning a program for early November which will not only tell about our philanthropies, but which will, we hope, show another reason why we can be so proud to be Pi Phis. But the idea is not just to learn about and to support morally our philanthropies. We could all talk for hours about how proud we are of what we are doing and what a great project Arrow in the Smokies is but that will not make it a success. As Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice President of Philanthropies said in the September 1967 ARROW the important word for this and all other philanthropies is "yield". Our chapter realizes this and consequently we are also going to try to initiate plans for more publicity and for some fund-raising projects that will show our sup-port. California Gamma feels that the key to the success of this Centennial Project and to Pi Beta Phi's second century lies in the contributions of each and every Chapter. CHRISTI HUGGINS Symbol of Pride CALIFORNIA DELTA The year 1967 marked for Pi Beta Phi one hundred years of sisterhood through fraternity life. Yet only half a century ago that sister-hood became truly meaningful with the establishment of the national philanthropy. The Settlement School has become a symbol of pride. Not yet a member, a pledge wonders what Pi Phi represents. She questions what the purpose of Pi Phi is and what it means to national, the members, and finally to herself. She discovers the true significance of Pi Phi when she learns about the Settlement School. The school synibolizes Pi Phi's higher values and goals. The educational centers and workshops of Gatlin-burg endure and expand with the devotion and interest of actives across the nation. Donations from each chapter and alumni continually pour into the school as a genuine expression of support for the work and progress made by the philanthropy. Future expansion made possible by the donations will focus on the pro-motion of education for all types of people. Students, teachers, doctors, industrial technicians, and even re-tired persons will benefit from the classes offered. The Settlement School of Gatlinburg symbolizes the ideals of its founders and its donors and is truly something of value. LINDA DAVIS Native Crafts Kept Alive! CALIFORNIA EPSILON--Pi Beta Phi's Arrow ex-tends across the entire nation. When each Pi Phi thinks of service, her thoughts are pointed upward to that special place high in the Smokies. Here we find the starting point for the first sorority to establish their philanthropy. Pi Beta Phi felt this such a worthy endeavor it has been maintained ,all through the years. Being the oldest fraternity for women, Pi Phi's felt the need to keep alive one of the oldest and true American art cultures. Industrialism is rapidly causing the extinction of true handicrafts, but Arrow in the Smokies providesthe opportunity for these people to keep their native craft still alive. Besides the mere craft aspect, employment is created along with the recreational aspect of the school. For those people merely interested in learning a craft, the opportunity is constantly provided for them. Because university credit is given, it allows those seeking a profession in art to continue their work. The future of the Arrow in the Smokies is tremendous. Expansion of this foundation cannot help but grow because of the support it has received and will continue to receive. The second hundred years will prove to be as successful as the first hundred because Arrow in the Smokies keeps alive for future generations the artistic heritage of that area of the United States. SUSAN DRISCOLL Tremendous Job Ahead NEVADA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi can be more than hopeful about its philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. This dream of building an Arts and Crafts addition to the University of Tennessee will become a reality, just as the Settlement School has. Through the financial and moral assistance of every Pi Phi, the Settlement School has grown to be one of the largest crafts' centers of the United States. If we look at the past success of our Settlement School, we cannot fail in our hope for the future, Arrow in the Smokies. As hopeful as we are, we must realize that the construction of such a project is a tremendous job which will need the support of every member. The Pi Phis at Nevada Alpha Chapter are organizing two projects to raise funds for Arrow in the Smokies. We plan to have a Sandwich Sale and a Spaghetti Feed. Our advertisements for both these functions will explain Arrow in the Smokies, and the importance of this philanthropy should aid our success. The Sandwich Sale will consist of selling Poor Boy sandwiches to campus residents on two Sundays. The Spaghetti Feed will also be on a Sunday, because the campus cafeteria only serves brunch on Sundays. We will have the dinner on or near the University, pre-pare it ourselves, and only charge a dollar for tickets sold in advance. We hope to receive a good profit which we will donate to Arrow in the Smokies. If every Pi Phi Chapter can do something similar, Arrow in the Smokies will be transformed from a dream into a reality. STEPHANIE LORIGAN Art Appreciation Continues! ARIZONA ALPHA The Arizona Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi highly commends the progress and great eagerness toward our new Centennial project of 1966 through 1967. We are very enthusiastic to increase aid to the underprivileged people in the Gatlinburg area. By enlarging the Summer Craft Workshop, we may be able, not only to help these poverty-stricken mountain people, but also to increase the knowledge of dying traditional crafts such as stitchery and weaving that have been so much a part of the early pio (Continued on page 87) i Beta Phi Pledges These young ladies pledged Pi Beta Phi chapters at colleges and universities with a fall rush or open rush in the first semester of the 1967-68 school year.

        72 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the school; now there is a clinic and doctor in the town. When Pi Phi came to Gatlinburg, the hill people were poor, barely ekeing out an existence on their land. Pi Phi has taught these hill people crafts, and bought them the needed equipment; now there is thriving home industry, which Pi Phi supports in its Arrowcraft shops. Much indeed has been accomplished in the past fifty years at Gatlinburg. So who can say what the future holds for the Arrow in the Smokies? There is much that can still become, and more that we cannot envision today, but that will be accomplished. There is always a need for education, and always an opportunity for service. The future of Pi Phi holds far more than its past, at Gatlinburg in the Smokies. BARBARA EDMONDS Key to Pi Phi Future SOUTH DAKOTA ALPHA A century ago when the twelve founders of Pi Beta Phi met to organize a women's fraternity for the purpose of enhancing the nobility of womanhood, they faced the problem of proving what positive goal such an organization could accomplish. Today the same problem still exists for twentieth-century fraternity women. In comparison to the immensity of world conflicts, the acquiring of social graces and the finding of strength in the bonds of personal friendships cannot alone justify the existence of women's fraternal, groups. At a recent officers' retreat members of South Dakota Alpha heard their university's Coordinator of Student Affairs challenge them to ACT instead of REACT. Too often sororities and fraternities concentrate their efforts in rebelling against and attempting to reject the college regulations placed upon them. Truly this shows that they care and are alive, but why must every action be only a response? Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic project, Arrow in the Smokies, holds the key to the future of our college fraternity. Expanding the summer craft workshop is a definite step Pi Beta Phi can take forward showing to the public that we are not organized for the sole purpose of our personal advancement in the social aspects of life. It is pertinent for South Dakota A and all other chapters to recognize the new centennial plans for Arrow in the Smokies and show to the public that this too is the purpose of our fraternity. And thus, while doing this, we will be acting and advancing the welfare of others as well as ourselves. CINDY CIMPL Enthusiasm Spreads Rapidly MINNESOTA ALPHA At Minnesota Alpha, we had a change in feeling recently toward the Settlement School. That change is due mainly to three things. First, one of our members visited Gatlinburg last summer while on vacation and her stories about it have made it come alive for us. Secondly, our two delegates to Convention brought back an enthusiasm for Settlement School which is rapidly spreading to the whole chapter. Third, and, we feel, most important, is the new name which has been given to the project, Arrow in the Smokies. This name means more to us than the words "philanthropy" or "Settlement School." The word "Arrow" alone brings to mind the chain of friendship which exists coast to coast and generation to generation in Pi Beta Phi. It brings to mind the love and devotion we feel toward one another .and toward all that is good and true. It reminds us that we in Pi Beta Phi are striving for the highest ideals. Then, the joining of the word "Arrow" with the site of our philanthropy, the "Smokies," joins all these feelings to the Settlement School. It sets the tone for the spirit of Settlement School. Now that this spirit has become more apparent to us, it has become apparent also that it is our job to maintain and spread the spirit. To do this, we, first of all, made Settlement School a much larger part of Fall Rush Information Day. We told its story in more de-tail and displayed many of the craft. Throughout, we tried to convey the spirit of giving which started Settlement School and which keeps it growing year after year. Secondly, we have made it a point to leave the Arrowcraft catalog in the living room where waiting guests will pick it up. And we have coached all our members so that they can answer any questions the guests might ask about Gatlinburg and the School, or about the Arrowcraft Worshop and the ordering of the articles made there. Finally, we plan to add, to our annual Settlement School information program, the personal reactions of our active who visited Gatlinburg last summer and of a former active who spent a whole summer there. With these new ideas and spurred on by our new feelings about Arrow in the Smokies, we hope at Minnesota Alpha to make Settlement School known and loved, and therefore supported, by an ever-increasing number of people. J. MARCHE L Emphasis During Rush MISSOURI GAMMA Missouri Gamma puts emphasis on our national philanthropy project during rush. Because we think it is a unique idea and binds us in further sisterhood, we want to help bring success to Arrow in the Smokies. Rather than taking a chance in having some rushees miss our story by leaving discussion up to the individual rushers, we have our philanthropies chairman give a small talk on this subject to the entire group. She has a display of articles made at the Arrowcraft Shop set up and is ready to answer questions. We feel that the best way to show our interest to the public is through enthusiasm in our attitudes. We support the Settlement School as our chapter philanthropy and throughout the year we sponsor money-making projects to provide funds. Our annual mum sale at Homecoming is a major activity. We have great success with this project and are able to expand it as each year passes. Another project is the Rummage Sale we have for the public. A location in the city is sought that will provide us with the maximum expo-sure to the public. Each girl is responsible for a prearranged number of articles and rarely do we have much left after a two day sale. We also have some type of candy sale on campus, and we hope to have an apple sale later in the year. Each year we try to THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 73 have some other type of fund raising project in addition to our annual activities. Also, members are encouraged to order articles from the Settlement School through our chairman. Last year a senior, Sahanny Johnson, received the California Alpha Scholarship. We are proud to be taking active participation in support of Arrow in the Smokies. Each year we hope to build this participation and in this way push Arrow in the Smokies to great success. DEBBIE NELSON Inevitable Growth Seen ARKANSAS ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies definitely has a future, and as more than a dream in the minds of Pi Phis everywhere. With 111 active chapters and 339 alum clubs working in every state and in Canada, the entire settlement school project is bound to grow. At Arkansas Alpha, we work to promote the larger philanthropic project of Arrow in the Smokies and at the same time we are active on local projects. We have the Arrowcraft sale every year. Before the sale, we contact the alums and neighbors and faculty members, to let them know when we will have the display. By having the sale, we bring the entire Arrow in the Smokies project to the citizens of Fayetteville. The profits from the sale go back to the project. Recently our chapter joined the Chamber of Commerce and by this we hope to acquaint the Fayetteville community more with Pi Phi as a locally and nationally active fraternity. On a local level we carry on several philanthropic projects. This year we have adopted a young American Indian girl. We send money for her schooling and some of her needs and write to her often. Last year we were awarded a trophy from the Community Chest for giving the greatest contribution to their drive of all organizations on campus. We also have a Christmas party each year for underprivileged children in the community. JO ANN PRYOR Hope for the Future MISSISSIPPI ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies means hope, love, responsibility, opportunity, pride, and yield to Mississippi Alpha Pi Phis as well as Pi Phis throughout the nation. In 1912 with the organization of the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, the dream of almost half a century was realized, and each bounding step brought hope for the future to Pi Beta Phi and to those who come there to learn and work. Love, ever-present in Pi Beta Phi, found a special outlet in this national philanthropy as Pi Phis help others help themselves. Responsibility and opportunity were basic building blocks for the Settlement School. But of these pride and yield are the most important for they are interchangeable each producing the other, creating a never-ending, every-increasing cycle. At the turn of a century of happiness and growth, Pi Beta Phi adopts a centennial project which will follow in the footsteps of the Settlement School and the Arrowcraft Shop. Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the Summer Craft Workshop and will act in a more wide-ranged capacity to better meet the demands of a growing country and fraternity. Arrow in the Smokies has been made possible through planning and hard work, and with the continued support of every Pi Phi it cannot fail. EDDIE WELFORD Meeting Leisure's Challenge IOWA GAMMA Pi Beta Phi's Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is an expansion of the Craft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tenn., which is co-sponsored by the Fraternity and the University of Tennessee. The Craft Workshop offers a broad curriculum in the Arts and Crafts, and the courses offer college credit for graduate and undergraduate work. Today there is an increased amount of leisure time offered to our citizens due to automation and the specialized times. When this leisure time is added to the need in our society for individual creativity, the logical solution is a greater emphasis on arts and crafts. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, the opportunity for creative self-expression will be given. To further the growth of our philanthropy and help Arrow in the Smokies to become a reality, each chapter member must take an active interest in the project and help to raise money for its support. One way to do this is to hold Arrowcraft sales, which would acquaint our members with the quality and variety of articles made. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, it will enable individuals to develop their talents, the handicapped to become a little more independent, and older citizens to feel more worthwhile. An old Hindu Maxim sums up the responsibilities of each one of us. "He does not live in vain, who employs his wealth, his thought, his speech to advance the good of others." VICKI VOELKER Action Key to Success! IOWA ZETA Pi Beta Phi has always been concerned with helping others to help themselves, this is evident in the organization of Chapters and Clubs. This concern has been extended to people outside the membership of Pi Beta Phi through the program of the first philanthropy supported by a fraternity the Settlement School. In keeping with this idea Pi Beta Phi's Centennial project is a Craft Workshop in co-operation with the University of Tennessee to be built in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. It will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. As members of Iowa Zeta, we are proud to give our support in such an outstanding project. We know that creative arts have been found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also our Alumnae Clubs can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Se74 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. Creative crafts develop skill, provide an outlet for self-expression, increase sensitiveness as to surrounding giving dignity to common things, bring the handicapped into better adjustment, and are .a delight to the adventuresome. Iowa Zeta realizes that we must look at the coming of the new. All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. This is only possible with the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. As members of Iowa Zeta, we pledge our loyal support and are proud that we can contribute to such an excellent project. To know that we are helping other people as well as our members, sparks a feeling of pride and it is a pleasure to say that we belong to such a wonderful organization as Pi Beta Phi. ANN MONTGOMERY Improved Publicity Planned NEBRASKA BETA Nebraska Beta has started an interesting new local philanthropic project this year by offering its services to the Nebraska State Hospital. Five members a week, consisting of three actives and two pledges, work as volunteers in the hospital lounge or canteen. In this manner they are able to serve as cashiers, waitresses, and fountain girls and at the same time build positive relationships with the patients. In addition to our new local philanthropic project Nebraska Beta is planning to hold its annual Settlement School sale. Posters, announcements, and news-paper coverage will aid in publicizing the sale, which will be open to the entire campus. It is hoped that profits from this sale and magazine sales will help establish support for another Nebraska Beta project one aimed at making the benefit of Arrow in the Smokies known to more than just Pi Phis. With help from local newspapers and campus newspapers a brief description of the aims of Arrow in the Smokies will be presented. Members of the Lincoln Weaving Club and other local craft clubs will be encouraged to con-tact our chapter for information about sponsorship to Tennessee in the form of a loan or scholarship. Public relations will be improved and Pi Phi's achievements and opportunities will be made available to many out-side of our chapter. Nebraska Beta feels that the greatest way it can make Arrow in the Smokies meaningful is by sponsoring a member who can benefit from the experience . . . a member outside of our own chapter. KITTY MCMANUS Success Through Support KANSAS BETA Pi Beta Phi was founded by twelve girls at Monmouth College in 1867. Since that time its membership has grown enormously and has spread to college campuses throughout the United States and Canada. Similarly Arrow in the Smokies should grow and grow. It will do so 'because the same enthusiastic spirit and love for Pi Phi will be behind it. There are already signs of this "success through support." The idea of a centennial project was first realized at the 1954 Convention. Since that time interest has been great. Last year over one hundred thou-sand dollars was contributed to "Arrow in the Smokies !" As time goes on and Pi Phi's continue to be generous with this, their outstanding philanthropic project, Gatlinburg, Tennessee should be a huge center of activity. Numerous buildings will be gradually constructed for art and craft classes until it will be a complete center. Then this Craft Center will be of tremendous benefit to its teachers and students, as well as artists everywhere. Preserving the native arts and crafts of our country, it should become a well-known and respected cultural project. Even more important, as "Arrow in the Smokies" grows, so will the reputation of Pi Beta Phi. Through its outstanding achievements and its numerous philanthropic projects from the time of its founding, Pi Phi has already demonstrated to others its high standards and principles. Now, because of this wonderful Centennial Project, the name "Pi Beta Phi" could become synonomous with "service." And as this spirit of Pi Phi, which began in 1867, continues to grow, so will the 1967 Centennial Project "Arrow in the Smokies." MARSHA GARRETT Serving Mankind OKLAHOMA ALPHA What are the purposes of a Pi Beta Phi philanthropic project in the Smokies? This is a question that we at Oklahoma Alpha are asking and have attempted to answer. The necessity of vocational training is one answer to the need for the Pi Phi service project. Vocational training can bring industries to the area, provide jobs and give the skilled worker a sense of accomplishment. The type of craftmanship learned from the project is another answer to our question. Not only can skilled industrial techniques be taught, but skills in the crafting of handmade articles. If the handcrafting skills of the people of the Smokies can be preserved, Pi Phi can preserve the past for the future. Not only will the lives of the people of the Smokies be enriched but the lives of everyone who views their craftmanship. If we, as part of the Greek system can reach beyond our realm of membership and aid others, we have served not only ourselves but mankind. By providing service outside our membership, this project can not only answer our goal of service but can be-come our theme for the next hundred years of fraternity growth. NANCY BREEDEN Fund-raising Projects Unlimited! OKLAHOMA BETA Members of Pi Beta Phi, have always tried to be of service to the people around us and to people in need. A momentous step was taken THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 75 when in 1910, we began laying the plans for our Arrowcraft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. From this time, much progress has been made and we here at Oklahoma Beta are proud of our fraternities lead in the area of philanthropy. The Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is another significant step for our fraternity. It is one of the best ways in which the art of hand made crafts and skills can be perpetuated. Our chapter feels that there are many possibilities for the Arrow in the Smokies. With the increased amount of leisure time of our society and the growing number of people over sixty-five, there is a need to find a creative and constructive outlet for our human energies. The Arrow in the Smokies 'can provide this outlet by giving many a place to come and learn while perpetuating the art of crafts. There is also the possibility of the Arrow in the Smokies as a training ground for instructors who could help with the rehabilitation of those people in our nation who need the therapy of learning an enjoy-able, constructive, and physically beneficial skill. It is with these possibilities and others that we see the potential which lies in the creation of this new philanthropy. In our own chapter we try to publicize our philanthropy through our annual Arrowcraft Sale. As a chapter, we also sponsor an annual Easter Egg hunt for the Underprivileged children in town. In the past we have also provided food for a needy family at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The variety of possible fund-raising projects for the support of our Centennial Project seems to be unlimited. There is always the possibility of collecting all the loose personal items which are left in the lounge and then selling them back to the members at a small fee. The old stand by of a rummage sale has always been a profitable project for our chapter. These are some of the ideas that our chapter has concerning our new Centennial Project and it is with great hope and much expectation that we look for-ward to seeing what the future will hold for Pi Beta Phi and her philanthropy work. A New Dream TEXAS ALPHA In 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee was established as a memorial to the founders of our fraternity. Now fifty-five years later that dream has become a reality and in this our centennial year we have a new dream. Our Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, will be our major philanthropy as we start in this our second century as a Fraternity. Texas Alpha is very enthusiastic and interested in the growth and development of our newest project, Arrow in the Smokies. As the summer craft workshop is being expanded into larger sessions and more courses of study, many of our members feel that their education would be greatly enriched if they studied at the craft workshop. Especially promising to the members of Texas Alpha will be the instructions given in therapy, teaching, and in doing volunteer work. We are always interested in learning new hobbies and crafts aid many of our members are planning to spend their summers at the Settlement School learning more about these things. Pi Beta Phi and Texas Alpha will be looking for-ward to our new philanthropy. We hope that every chapter and alum club will do their part in helping to make our next hundred years as profitable and re-warding as our past hundred years has been. LYN ARNOT Importance Realized TEXAS BETA The national philanthropic project of Pi Beta Phi which was once a dream to a few, is now a reality of which every Pi Phi can, and should be proud. Gatlinburg once only a village of isolated people has now become a productive community. The Texas Beta Pi Phis are proud to assist in this national project through annual contributions. We also have several local philanthropic projects. A number of our girls tutor in connection with a YMCA program. We also take part in "Rag Mop", through which we collect clothes for Goodwill Industries. Each year we participate in a campus-wide project in connection with Greek Week. This year we cleaned up a YMCA camp. We now sponsor two foreign orphans, sending them clothes, food, and special gifts on holidays. Each Christmas we have a party for a group of orphans, complete with our own female version of Santa Claus. We of Texas Beta realize the importance of philanthropic projects. We feel that through helping others, we, ourselves, become better people. Our thoughts can be expressed by a comment made to a Pi Phi alum by a local resident of Gatlinburg, "You Pi Phis really are angels." Active Alumnce Cooperation NEW MEXICO ALPHA At present New Mexico Alpha is involved in a magazine selling campaign to raise money for the Settlement School Fund. Each girl in the chapter will be required to sell two magazines. It was decided that this was not too much to ask. Part of this money will be used to support the Arrow in the Smokies and we feel that this will be a step in the right direction for helping it become a reality. Our active chapter does not have a local philanthropy, although our alums do. They help support Casa Angelica, a home for retarded children in Albuquerque. Last year through a home designer show they earned enough money to purchase a station wagon for the home. We helped the Alums in providing a free babysitting service for the mothers who came to see the show. Each semester our chapter gives the Mary Lovelace scholarship to a deserving active. This scholarship pays for the active's dues for the semester for which she earned it. Doug Munson was the recipient of the scholarship for this semester. A Broader Dream UTAH ALPHA In March 1912, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in the Great Smokey Mountains, was opened to thirteen eager, young students, only two short years after it was decided at convention that an educational project should be established in memory of our founders. At first the Settlement School, the first national phi76 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI lanthropy of its kind, provided an education to the mountain people through home teaching, but soon land was secured on which to build a school house, in spite of the reluctancy of the townspeople. Through the years, the once small community has expanded into a large town which now draws about five million tourists a year. At the present time the town consists of the Arrowcraft Workshop, a health center, a school house, the Loom House, and a dormatory, the Red Bard, to accommodate some of the students. Every year, hundreds of children and adults come to Gatlinburg from all parts of the country to learn all the crafts taught there. It is by these people that all the jewelry, wood craft and loom work available through every Pi Beta Phi chapter is made. All proceeds from the sale of these things goes back to the Settlement School for improvements and expansion. Every Pi Phi chapter in the United States and Canada supports our Settlement School and through each individual chapter's philanthropies program, we are able to promote improvement of the school both through the sale of the Craft Shop products and their money-making projects directed toward raising money to donate to the school. In Utah Alpha we have had a great deal of support of the Settlement School through the sale of the crafts. It is pleasing to know that people not even associated with Pi Phi call to inquire about the merchandise and the school that they've heard about from friends. Thus it is evident that the fame of the Settlement School has spread all over the country and through this continuing expansion and rise in sup-porters, the dream of a bigger, better and more adequate Settlement School will soon be a reality. KIM KOLLER "King" Crowned for Settlement School MONTANA ALPHA In the summer of 1966 two of our members, Marilyn Fitzgerald and Judi O'Donnell, had the privilege and opportunity to visit the Arrow in the Smokies. They had of course studied about Pi Beta Phi's outstanding philanthropy but both agreed they were not prepared for the large, modern school which greeted them. Several people told them how thankful and indebted they are to Pi Phi and what a wonderful project we have. One man in particular told them that his son was to graduate the following year because of assistance the Pi Phis had given him. The girls strongly urge all Pi Phis to take any opportunity they have to visit our Arrow in the Smokies. "Every member of Pi Beta Phi can be proud of this project because we are looking beyond our needs to those of others. We are not only helping others, we are preserving a beautiful art for the benefit of all. Because Montana Alpha feels that this national philanthropy is so important we do not sponsor any particular local philanthropy. Each year we hold a contest for the `King of the Hill' in which one member of each fraternity is nominated by his fraternity for this honor. These men are invited to the house several times and are asked to present some form of entertainment for us. The members of our house then vote for one of the men and on a Saturday night we hold a campus-wide `Derby Dance' to crown the winning`King of the Hill.' The other candidates are then our `Brothers of the Arrow.' The proceeds from the dance are sent to the Arrow in the Smokies as our donation. We are very proud that last year Montana Alpha donated the largest contribution. We feel that a project such as ours would be a good method for any chapter to use to promote our national philanthropy. CAROLE POFFENBERGER The Realm of "Others" WASHINGTON ALPHA Our philanthropic project in the Smokey Mountains area is the fulfillment of ,a desire embedded deep in every Pi Phi heart. College life is full of the everyday hustle and bustle of schoolwork, campus activities, dates, and friends. Our philanthropic project adds a meaningful dimension to a college career: We project ourselves beyond the realm of "self'' to the realm of "others." Because we feel that Gatlinburg is one of the primary responsibilities of our House, the Pi Phi's at Washington Alpha display the material crafts as well as the spiritual ideals of this once backward area during our September Rush. We want these prospective pledges to see the deeper meaning behind Pi Beta Phi. Each Fall, we are reminded of the significance of the Smokey Mountains project. Hundreds of people in Gatlinburg are being educated through the nationwide effort of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity; they are learning a livelihood in handicrafts; they are gaining self-respect. How do we at Washington Alpha Chapter help the Smokey Mountains project: In the Fall our House sponsors a sale of the handicrafts produced by the craftsmen of Gatlinburg. This sale provides a market for the crafts; it is open to anyone. All the girls in the house enjoy setting up the display, especially when the products are so varied. Anything from brooms to mugs to jewelry to stationery can be found at the sale. It's always fun to give the buyers a little background on our project and what it means to us. This not only makes the crafts more meaningful, but helps us to take an active part in this altruistic project! We at Washington Alpha are anxious to do our part in helping to promote the success of the people at Gatlinburg. The progress shown to date is certainly an inspiration to us all. PAM WAGNER The Warm Feeling of Giving WASHINGTON BETA The Washington Beta chapter feels that the Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the present opportunity for Pi Phi's to give of their service, time and money. We are planning to have a Settlement School program to inform members of the project and the potentials and opportunities which it opens to us. After enthusiasm is raised, a fund-raising project will follow. This project, Penny a Pound for Pi Phi (an idea from Wisconsin Beta) will tax each girl a penny for each pound of her weight. The pennies will be pasted on a poster board in the shape of a huge piggy bank for display. We feel that with adequate support this project will develop into a vital institution. It will, enrich the lives of those who take advantage of its facilities, learn a trade and become productive citizens; as well THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 77 as the lives of those who benefit from the usefullness of the products. In the age of mechanization, the Arrow in the Smokies will play its part in preserving creativity and personal pride in an object, as contrasted to the impersonal qualities of a machine-made product. . The members of Washington Beta are very proud of the philanthropies project, not only because working together towards a common goal brings unity to Pi Phi's everywhere, but also because of the personal opportunities, creative and technical, which it brings to so many. This project enables everyone to experience the warm feeling of giving. AMY RADEWAN A Worthwhile Program OREGON ALPHA Oregon Alpha of Pi Beta Phi feels that the Centennial Project: "Arrow In The Smokies" is a new and exciting addition. The Summer Craft Workshop has proved itself to be beneficial and rewarding to everyone involved, and with the expansion of more workshops, more and more people will be reached. The Craft Workshops, are beneficial in many ways. The inhabitants of the Gatlinburg area are able to gain a living because of the tourist trade drawn there, the instructors and the assistants of the Summer Craft Workshops are earning a living besides fullfilling their own aesthetic needs. The students are learning the crafts taught in order that they might re-turn to their homes and teach others. This is a never ending circle because ell those taught will continue to expand and teach others. We feel that it is an honor that Pi Beta Phi is in co-operation with the University of Tennessee in such a worthwhile program. Oregon Alpha is planning on having a skit-dinner to inform the chapter members of the Arrow in the Smokies Program. For our fund raising project we would like to have an Arrowcraft Shop Sale before the Christmas holidays. We feel the citizens of Eugene and the University of Oregon Student Body would be very interested in our crafts, and this would spread knowledge of our Centennial project, besides helping to raise our funds. Oregon Alpha's main philanthropic project is helping teach in the Handicapped Children's Swimming Program. Pi Phi, Marsha Almeter, is in charge of the program. NANCY ELMGREN A Conscious Endeavor OREGON BETA The members of Oregon Beta are very proud to be a part of Pi Beta Phi's new philanthropy project, Arrow in the Smokies. Pi Beta Phi must grow to meet the needs of it's members and nation alike. We must continue to broaden our horizons and since we are founded as a scholastic organization in what way could we better serve than by supplying an opportunity for education. Thoreau said: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeaver. Our conscious endeavor for this next one hundred years is Arrow in the Smokies. Through education we will preserve and extend our national heritage. Thus we are building a brighter future from the past. We are expanding to fill present and fu'ture needs and by doing this we will continue to grow as an organization of college women. We must not forget our heritage; we must preserve it. Oregon Beta feels that Arrow in the Smokies will help to preserve this heritage as it helps to educate our people and by helping to preserve our past will help to build a stronger and more united future. We can only wait to see what light our flame has cast by the end of this, our second, century.. Our hope is that it will continue to grow in brightness as it has during our past century. Services Extended IDAHO ALPHA Pi Beta Phi .can truly be proud of its nationally renowned philanthropic establishment, Arrow in ,the Smokies. Due to the dedication and loyalty of many individual Pi Phi alums and the support of many active chapters, and ,alum clubs, this project has grown since its establishment in 1910, by the Settlement School committee, to a greatly enlarged and expanded program partly affiliated with the University of Tennessee and making meaningful and productive the lives of many previously poor and backward people. This year, along with Pi Beta Phi's Centennial celebration, a great program is being put .into effect to expand and build this philanthropic project so that more of its services can be extended to make an even greater contribution. Idaho Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi would, like to greatly congratulate the leaders in this program and offer a Centennial wish that the Arrow in the Smokies may grow and expand in Gatlinburg, and perhaps in the future, even in. other locations where the need is great. Through our philanthropic project, all Pi Phis can make a significant contribution to the realization of Pi Phi ideals. In the area of public relations, Idaho Alpha Chap-ter of Pi. Beta Phi has contributed to the Fund for the Performing Arts Center here at the University of Idaho, a 6-million-dollar project, and also to the Cam-pus Chest Fund. CHERYL KOCH "Bigger and Better" CALIFORNIA GAMMA California Gamma, like all Pi Phi Chapters, has always been especially proud of our heritage as the pioneer in women's fraternities. As a non-profit organization we have always been proud to point out our high scholastic standards and social activities but, today, we are even prouder of the philanthropic projects that our sorority has developed. Now as Pi Beta Phi starts its second century our Chapter feels that our new philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, will be "bigger and better" yet. Because we do live across the, country it is SOMetimes difficult for us to really see the good that is being accomplished by these projects. We support them 'but we do not really know that much about 78 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI them. To remedy this we are currently planning a program for early November which will not only tell about our philanthropies, but which will, we hope, show another reason why we can be so proud to be Pi Phis. But the idea is not just to learn about and to support morally our philanthropies. We could all talk for hours about how proud we are of what we are doing and what a great project Arrow in the Smokies is but that will not make it a success. As Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice President of Philanthropies said in the September 1967 ARROW the important word for this and all other philanthropies is "yield". Our chapter realizes this and consequently we are also going to try to initiate plans for more publicity and for some fund-raising projects that will show our sup-port. California Gamma feels that the key to the success of this Centennial Project and to Pi Beta Phi's second century lies in the contributions of each and every Chapter. CHRISTI HUGGINS Symbol of Pride CALIFORNIA DELTA The year 1967 marked for Pi Beta Phi one hundred years of sisterhood through fraternity life. Yet only half a century ago that sister-hood became truly meaningful with the establishment of the national philanthropy. The Settlement School has become a symbol of pride. Not yet a member, a pledge wonders what Pi Phi represents. She questions what the purpose of Pi Phi is and what it means to national, the members, and finally to herself. She discovers the true significance of Pi Phi when she learns about the Settlement School. The school synibolizes Pi Phi's higher values and goals. The educational centers and workshops of Gatlin-burg endure and expand with the devotion and interest of actives across the nation. Donations from each chapter and alumni continually pour into the school as a genuine expression of support for the work and progress made by the philanthropy. Future expansion made possible by the donations will focus on the pro-motion of education for all types of people. Students, teachers, doctors, industrial technicians, and even re-tired persons will benefit from the classes offered. The Settlement School of Gatlinburg symbolizes the ideals of its founders and its donors and is truly something of value. LINDA DAVIS Native Crafts Kept Alive! CALIFORNIA EPSILON--Pi Beta Phi's Arrow ex-tends across the entire nation. When each Pi Phi thinks of service, her thoughts are pointed upward to that special place high in the Smokies. Here we find the starting point for the first sorority to establish their philanthropy. Pi Beta Phi felt this such a worthy endeavor it has been maintained ,all through the years. Being the oldest fraternity for women, Pi Phi's felt the need to keep alive one of the oldest and true American art cultures. Industrialism is rapidly causing the extinction of true handicrafts, but Arrow in the Smokies providesthe opportunity for these people to keep their native craft still alive. Besides the mere craft aspect, employment is created along with the recreational aspect of the school. For those people merely interested in learning a craft, the opportunity is constantly provided for them. Because university credit is given, it allows those seeking a profession in art to continue their work. The future of the Arrow in the Smokies is tremendous. Expansion of this foundation cannot help but grow because of the support it has received and will continue to receive. The second hundred years will prove to be as successful as the first hundred because Arrow in the Smokies keeps alive for future generations the artistic heritage of that area of the United States. SUSAN DRISCOLL Tremendous Job Ahead NEVADA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi can be more than hopeful about its philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. This dream of building an Arts and Crafts addition to the University of Tennessee will become a reality, just as the Settlement School has. Through the financial and moral assistance of every Pi Phi, the Settlement School has grown to be one of the largest crafts' centers of the United States. If we look at the past success of our Settlement School, we cannot fail in our hope for the future, Arrow in the Smokies. As hopeful as we are, we must realize that the construction of such a project is a tremendous job which will need the support of every member. The Pi Phis at Nevada Alpha Chapter are organizing two projects to raise funds for Arrow in the Smokies. We plan to have a Sandwich Sale and a Spaghetti Feed. Our advertisements for both these functions will explain Arrow in the Smokies, and the importance of this philanthropy should aid our success. The Sandwich Sale will consist of selling Poor Boy sandwiches to campus residents on two Sundays. The Spaghetti Feed will also be on a Sunday, because the campus cafeteria only serves brunch on Sundays. We will have the dinner on or near the University, pre-pare it ourselves, and only charge a dollar for tickets sold in advance. We hope to receive a good profit which we will donate to Arrow in the Smokies. If every Pi Phi Chapter can do something similar, Arrow in the Smokies will be transformed from a dream into a reality. STEPHANIE LORIGAN Art Appreciation Continues! ARIZONA ALPHA The Arizona Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi highly commends the progress and great eagerness toward our new Centennial project of 1966 through 1967. We are very enthusiastic to increase aid to the underprivileged people in the Gatlinburg area. By enlarging the Summer Craft Workshop, we may be able, not only to help these poverty-stricken mountain people, but also to increase the knowledge of dying traditional crafts such as stitchery and weaving that have been so much a part of the early pio (Continued on page 87) i Beta Phi Pledges These young ladies pledged Pi Beta Phi chapters at colleges and universities with a fall rush or open rush in the first semester of the 1967-68 school year.

        74 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. Creative crafts develop skill, provide an outlet for self-expression, increase sensitiveness as to surrounding giving dignity to common things, bring the handicapped into better adjustment, and are .a delight to the adventuresome. Iowa Zeta realizes that we must look at the coming of the new. All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. This is only possible with the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. As members of Iowa Zeta, we pledge our loyal support and are proud that we can contribute to such an excellent project. To know that we are helping other people as well as our members, sparks a feeling of pride and it is a pleasure to say that we belong to such a wonderful organization as Pi Beta Phi. ANN MONTGOMERY Improved Publicity Planned NEBRASKA BETA Nebraska Beta has started an interesting new local philanthropic project this year by offering its services to the Nebraska State Hospital. Five members a week, consisting of three actives and two pledges, work as volunteers in the hospital lounge or canteen. In this manner they are able to serve as cashiers, waitresses, and fountain girls and at the same time build positive relationships with the patients. In addition to our new local philanthropic project Nebraska Beta is planning to hold its annual Settlement School sale. Posters, announcements, and news-paper coverage will aid in publicizing the sale, which will be open to the entire campus. It is hoped that profits from this sale and magazine sales will help establish support for another Nebraska Beta project one aimed at making the benefit of Arrow in the Smokies known to more than just Pi Phis. With help from local newspapers and campus newspapers a brief description of the aims of Arrow in the Smokies will be presented. Members of the Lincoln Weaving Club and other local craft clubs will be encouraged to con-tact our chapter for information about sponsorship to Tennessee in the form of a loan or scholarship. Public relations will be improved and Pi Phi's achievements and opportunities will be made available to many out-side of our chapter. Nebraska Beta feels that the greatest way it can make Arrow in the Smokies meaningful is by sponsoring a member who can benefit from the experience . . . a member outside of our own chapter. KITTY MCMANUS Success Through Support KANSAS BETA Pi Beta Phi was founded by twelve girls at Monmouth College in 1867. Since that time its membership has grown enormously and has spread to college campuses throughout the United States and Canada. Similarly Arrow in the Smokies should grow and grow. It will do so 'because the same enthusiastic spirit and love for Pi Phi will be behind it. There are already signs of this "success through support." The idea of a centennial project was first realized at the 1954 Convention. Since that time interest has been great. Last year over one hundred thou-sand dollars was contributed to "Arrow in the Smokies !" As time goes on and Pi Phi's continue to be generous with this, their outstanding philanthropic project, Gatlinburg, Tennessee should be a huge center of activity. Numerous buildings will be gradually constructed for art and craft classes until it will be a complete center. Then this Craft Center will be of tremendous benefit to its teachers and students, as well as artists everywhere. Preserving the native arts and crafts of our country, it should become a well-known and respected cultural project. Even more important, as "Arrow in the Smokies" grows, so will the reputation of Pi Beta Phi. Through its outstanding achievements and its numerous philanthropic projects from the time of its founding, Pi Phi has already demonstrated to others its high standards and principles. Now, because of this wonderful Centennial Project, the name "Pi Beta Phi" could become synonomous with "service." And as this spirit of Pi Phi, which began in 1867, continues to grow, so will the 1967 Centennial Project "Arrow in the Smokies." MARSHA GARRETT Serving Mankind OKLAHOMA ALPHA What are the purposes of a Pi Beta Phi philanthropic project in the Smokies? This is a question that we at Oklahoma Alpha are asking and have attempted to answer. The necessity of vocational training is one answer to the need for the Pi Phi service project. Vocational training can bring industries to the area, provide jobs and give the skilled worker a sense of accomplishment. The type of craftmanship learned from the project is another answer to our question. Not only can skilled industrial techniques be taught, but skills in the crafting of handmade articles. If the handcrafting skills of the people of the Smokies can be preserved, Pi Phi can preserve the past for the future. Not only will the lives of the people of the Smokies be enriched but the lives of everyone who views their craftmanship. If we, as part of the Greek system can reach beyond our realm of membership and aid others, we have served not only ourselves but mankind. By providing service outside our membership, this project can not only answer our goal of service but can be-come our theme for the next hundred years of fraternity growth. NANCY BREEDEN Fund-raising Projects Unlimited! OKLAHOMA BETA Members of Pi Beta Phi, have always tried to be of service to the people around us and to people in need. A momentous step was taken THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 75 when in 1910, we began laying the plans for our Arrowcraft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. From this time, much progress has been made and we here at Oklahoma Beta are proud of our fraternities lead in the area of philanthropy. The Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is another significant step for our fraternity. It is one of the best ways in which the art of hand made crafts and skills can be perpetuated. Our chapter feels that there are many possibilities for the Arrow in the Smokies. With the increased amount of leisure time of our society and the growing number of people over sixty-five, there is a need to find a creative and constructive outlet for our human energies. The Arrow in the Smokies 'can provide this outlet by giving many a place to come and learn while perpetuating the art of crafts. There is also the possibility of the Arrow in the Smokies as a training ground for instructors who could help with the rehabilitation of those people in our nation who need the therapy of learning an enjoy-able, constructive, and physically beneficial skill. It is with these possibilities and others that we see the potential which lies in the creation of this new philanthropy. In our own chapter we try to publicize our philanthropy through our annual Arrowcraft Sale. As a chapter, we also sponsor an annual Easter Egg hunt for the Underprivileged children in town. In the past we have also provided food for a needy family at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The variety of possible fund-raising projects for the support of our Centennial Project seems to be unlimited. There is always the possibility of collecting all the loose personal items which are left in the lounge and then selling them back to the members at a small fee. The old stand by of a rummage sale has always been a profitable project for our chapter. These are some of the ideas that our chapter has concerning our new Centennial Project and it is with great hope and much expectation that we look for-ward to seeing what the future will hold for Pi Beta Phi and her philanthropy work. A New Dream TEXAS ALPHA In 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee was established as a memorial to the founders of our fraternity. Now fifty-five years later that dream has become a reality and in this our centennial year we have a new dream. Our Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, will be our major philanthropy as we start in this our second century as a Fraternity. Texas Alpha is very enthusiastic and interested in the growth and development of our newest project, Arrow in the Smokies. As the summer craft workshop is being expanded into larger sessions and more courses of study, many of our members feel that their education would be greatly enriched if they studied at the craft workshop. Especially promising to the members of Texas Alpha will be the instructions given in therapy, teaching, and in doing volunteer work. We are always interested in learning new hobbies and crafts aid many of our members are planning to spend their summers at the Settlement School learning more about these things. Pi Beta Phi and Texas Alpha will be looking for-ward to our new philanthropy. We hope that every chapter and alum club will do their part in helping to make our next hundred years as profitable and re-warding as our past hundred years has been. LYN ARNOT Importance Realized TEXAS BETA The national philanthropic project of Pi Beta Phi which was once a dream to a few, is now a reality of which every Pi Phi can, and should be proud. Gatlinburg once only a village of isolated people has now become a productive community. The Texas Beta Pi Phis are proud to assist in this national project through annual contributions. We also have several local philanthropic projects. A number of our girls tutor in connection with a YMCA program. We also take part in "Rag Mop", through which we collect clothes for Goodwill Industries. Each year we participate in a campus-wide project in connection with Greek Week. This year we cleaned up a YMCA camp. We now sponsor two foreign orphans, sending them clothes, food, and special gifts on holidays. Each Christmas we have a party for a group of orphans, complete with our own female version of Santa Claus. We of Texas Beta realize the importance of philanthropic projects. We feel that through helping others, we, ourselves, become better people. Our thoughts can be expressed by a comment made to a Pi Phi alum by a local resident of Gatlinburg, "You Pi Phis really are angels." Active Alumnce Cooperation NEW MEXICO ALPHA At present New Mexico Alpha is involved in a magazine selling campaign to raise money for the Settlement School Fund. Each girl in the chapter will be required to sell two magazines. It was decided that this was not too much to ask. Part of this money will be used to support the Arrow in the Smokies and we feel that this will be a step in the right direction for helping it become a reality. Our active chapter does not have a local philanthropy, although our alums do. They help support Casa Angelica, a home for retarded children in Albuquerque. Last year through a home designer show they earned enough money to purchase a station wagon for the home. We helped the Alums in providing a free babysitting service for the mothers who came to see the show. Each semester our chapter gives the Mary Lovelace scholarship to a deserving active. This scholarship pays for the active's dues for the semester for which she earned it. Doug Munson was the recipient of the scholarship for this semester. A Broader Dream UTAH ALPHA In March 1912, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in the Great Smokey Mountains, was opened to thirteen eager, young students, only two short years after it was decided at convention that an educational project should be established in memory of our founders. At first the Settlement School, the first national phi76 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI lanthropy of its kind, provided an education to the mountain people through home teaching, but soon land was secured on which to build a school house, in spite of the reluctancy of the townspeople. Through the years, the once small community has expanded into a large town which now draws about five million tourists a year. At the present time the town consists of the Arrowcraft Workshop, a health center, a school house, the Loom House, and a dormatory, the Red Bard, to accommodate some of the students. Every year, hundreds of children and adults come to Gatlinburg from all parts of the country to learn all the crafts taught there. It is by these people that all the jewelry, wood craft and loom work available through every Pi Beta Phi chapter is made. All proceeds from the sale of these things goes back to the Settlement School for improvements and expansion. Every Pi Phi chapter in the United States and Canada supports our Settlement School and through each individual chapter's philanthropies program, we are able to promote improvement of the school both through the sale of the Craft Shop products and their money-making projects directed toward raising money to donate to the school. In Utah Alpha we have had a great deal of support of the Settlement School through the sale of the crafts. It is pleasing to know that people not even associated with Pi Phi call to inquire about the merchandise and the school that they've heard about from friends. Thus it is evident that the fame of the Settlement School has spread all over the country and through this continuing expansion and rise in sup-porters, the dream of a bigger, better and more adequate Settlement School will soon be a reality. KIM KOLLER "King" Crowned for Settlement School MONTANA ALPHA In the summer of 1966 two of our members, Marilyn Fitzgerald and Judi O'Donnell, had the privilege and opportunity to visit the Arrow in the Smokies. They had of course studied about Pi Beta Phi's outstanding philanthropy but both agreed they were not prepared for the large, modern school which greeted them. Several people told them how thankful and indebted they are to Pi Phi and what a wonderful project we have. One man in particular told them that his son was to graduate the following year because of assistance the Pi Phis had given him. The girls strongly urge all Pi Phis to take any opportunity they have to visit our Arrow in the Smokies. "Every member of Pi Beta Phi can be proud of this project because we are looking beyond our needs to those of others. We are not only helping others, we are preserving a beautiful art for the benefit of all. Because Montana Alpha feels that this national philanthropy is so important we do not sponsor any particular local philanthropy. Each year we hold a contest for the `King of the Hill' in which one member of each fraternity is nominated by his fraternity for this honor. These men are invited to the house several times and are asked to present some form of entertainment for us. The members of our house then vote for one of the men and on a Saturday night we hold a campus-wide `Derby Dance' to crown the winning`King of the Hill.' The other candidates are then our `Brothers of the Arrow.' The proceeds from the dance are sent to the Arrow in the Smokies as our donation. We are very proud that last year Montana Alpha donated the largest contribution. We feel that a project such as ours would be a good method for any chapter to use to promote our national philanthropy. CAROLE POFFENBERGER The Realm of "Others" WASHINGTON ALPHA Our philanthropic project in the Smokey Mountains area is the fulfillment of ,a desire embedded deep in every Pi Phi heart. College life is full of the everyday hustle and bustle of schoolwork, campus activities, dates, and friends. Our philanthropic project adds a meaningful dimension to a college career: We project ourselves beyond the realm of "self'' to the realm of "others." Because we feel that Gatlinburg is one of the primary responsibilities of our House, the Pi Phi's at Washington Alpha display the material crafts as well as the spiritual ideals of this once backward area during our September Rush. We want these prospective pledges to see the deeper meaning behind Pi Beta Phi. Each Fall, we are reminded of the significance of the Smokey Mountains project. Hundreds of people in Gatlinburg are being educated through the nationwide effort of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity; they are learning a livelihood in handicrafts; they are gaining self-respect. How do we at Washington Alpha Chapter help the Smokey Mountains project: In the Fall our House sponsors a sale of the handicrafts produced by the craftsmen of Gatlinburg. This sale provides a market for the crafts; it is open to anyone. All the girls in the house enjoy setting up the display, especially when the products are so varied. Anything from brooms to mugs to jewelry to stationery can be found at the sale. It's always fun to give the buyers a little background on our project and what it means to us. This not only makes the crafts more meaningful, but helps us to take an active part in this altruistic project! We at Washington Alpha are anxious to do our part in helping to promote the success of the people at Gatlinburg. The progress shown to date is certainly an inspiration to us all. PAM WAGNER The Warm Feeling of Giving WASHINGTON BETA The Washington Beta chapter feels that the Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the present opportunity for Pi Phi's to give of their service, time and money. We are planning to have a Settlement School program to inform members of the project and the potentials and opportunities which it opens to us. After enthusiasm is raised, a fund-raising project will follow. This project, Penny a Pound for Pi Phi (an idea from Wisconsin Beta) will tax each girl a penny for each pound of her weight. The pennies will be pasted on a poster board in the shape of a huge piggy bank for display. We feel that with adequate support this project will develop into a vital institution. It will, enrich the lives of those who take advantage of its facilities, learn a trade and become productive citizens; as well THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 77 as the lives of those who benefit from the usefullness of the products. In the age of mechanization, the Arrow in the Smokies will play its part in preserving creativity and personal pride in an object, as contrasted to the impersonal qualities of a machine-made product. . The members of Washington Beta are very proud of the philanthropies project, not only because working together towards a common goal brings unity to Pi Phi's everywhere, but also because of the personal opportunities, creative and technical, which it brings to so many. This project enables everyone to experience the warm feeling of giving. AMY RADEWAN A Worthwhile Program OREGON ALPHA Oregon Alpha of Pi Beta Phi feels that the Centennial Project: "Arrow In The Smokies" is a new and exciting addition. The Summer Craft Workshop has proved itself to be beneficial and rewarding to everyone involved, and with the expansion of more workshops, more and more people will be reached. The Craft Workshops, are beneficial in many ways. The inhabitants of the Gatlinburg area are able to gain a living because of the tourist trade drawn there, the instructors and the assistants of the Summer Craft Workshops are earning a living besides fullfilling their own aesthetic needs. The students are learning the crafts taught in order that they might re-turn to their homes and teach others. This is a never ending circle because ell those taught will continue to expand and teach others. We feel that it is an honor that Pi Beta Phi is in co-operation with the University of Tennessee in such a worthwhile program. Oregon Alpha is planning on having a skit-dinner to inform the chapter members of the Arrow in the Smokies Program. For our fund raising project we would like to have an Arrowcraft Shop Sale before the Christmas holidays. We feel the citizens of Eugene and the University of Oregon Student Body would be very interested in our crafts, and this would spread knowledge of our Centennial project, besides helping to raise our funds. Oregon Alpha's main philanthropic project is helping teach in the Handicapped Children's Swimming Program. Pi Phi, Marsha Almeter, is in charge of the program. NANCY ELMGREN A Conscious Endeavor OREGON BETA The members of Oregon Beta are very proud to be a part of Pi Beta Phi's new philanthropy project, Arrow in the Smokies. Pi Beta Phi must grow to meet the needs of it's members and nation alike. We must continue to broaden our horizons and since we are founded as a scholastic organization in what way could we better serve than by supplying an opportunity for education. Thoreau said: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeaver. Our conscious endeavor for this next one hundred years is Arrow in the Smokies. Through education we will preserve and extend our national heritage. Thus we are building a brighter future from the past. We are expanding to fill present and fu'ture needs and by doing this we will continue to grow as an organization of college women. We must not forget our heritage; we must preserve it. Oregon Beta feels that Arrow in the Smokies will help to preserve this heritage as it helps to educate our people and by helping to preserve our past will help to build a stronger and more united future. We can only wait to see what light our flame has cast by the end of this, our second, century.. Our hope is that it will continue to grow in brightness as it has during our past century. Services Extended IDAHO ALPHA Pi Beta Phi .can truly be proud of its nationally renowned philanthropic establishment, Arrow in ,the Smokies. Due to the dedication and loyalty of many individual Pi Phi alums and the support of many active chapters, and ,alum clubs, this project has grown since its establishment in 1910, by the Settlement School committee, to a greatly enlarged and expanded program partly affiliated with the University of Tennessee and making meaningful and productive the lives of many previously poor and backward people. This year, along with Pi Beta Phi's Centennial celebration, a great program is being put .into effect to expand and build this philanthropic project so that more of its services can be extended to make an even greater contribution. Idaho Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi would, like to greatly congratulate the leaders in this program and offer a Centennial wish that the Arrow in the Smokies may grow and expand in Gatlinburg, and perhaps in the future, even in. other locations where the need is great. Through our philanthropic project, all Pi Phis can make a significant contribution to the realization of Pi Phi ideals. In the area of public relations, Idaho Alpha Chap-ter of Pi. Beta Phi has contributed to the Fund for the Performing Arts Center here at the University of Idaho, a 6-million-dollar project, and also to the Cam-pus Chest Fund. CHERYL KOCH "Bigger and Better" CALIFORNIA GAMMA California Gamma, like all Pi Phi Chapters, has always been especially proud of our heritage as the pioneer in women's fraternities. As a non-profit organization we have always been proud to point out our high scholastic standards and social activities but, today, we are even prouder of the philanthropic projects that our sorority has developed. Now as Pi Beta Phi starts its second century our Chapter feels that our new philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, will be "bigger and better" yet. Because we do live across the, country it is SOMetimes difficult for us to really see the good that is being accomplished by these projects. We support them 'but we do not really know that much about 78 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI them. To remedy this we are currently planning a program for early November which will not only tell about our philanthropies, but which will, we hope, show another reason why we can be so proud to be Pi Phis. But the idea is not just to learn about and to support morally our philanthropies. We could all talk for hours about how proud we are of what we are doing and what a great project Arrow in the Smokies is but that will not make it a success. As Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice President of Philanthropies said in the September 1967 ARROW the important word for this and all other philanthropies is "yield". Our chapter realizes this and consequently we are also going to try to initiate plans for more publicity and for some fund-raising projects that will show our sup-port. California Gamma feels that the key to the success of this Centennial Project and to Pi Beta Phi's second century lies in the contributions of each and every Chapter. CHRISTI HUGGINS Symbol of Pride CALIFORNIA DELTA The year 1967 marked for Pi Beta Phi one hundred years of sisterhood through fraternity life. Yet only half a century ago that sister-hood became truly meaningful with the establishment of the national philanthropy. The Settlement School has become a symbol of pride. Not yet a member, a pledge wonders what Pi Phi represents. She questions what the purpose of Pi Phi is and what it means to national, the members, and finally to herself. She discovers the true significance of Pi Phi when she learns about the Settlement School. The school synibolizes Pi Phi's higher values and goals. The educational centers and workshops of Gatlin-burg endure and expand with the devotion and interest of actives across the nation. Donations from each chapter and alumni continually pour into the school as a genuine expression of support for the work and progress made by the philanthropy. Future expansion made possible by the donations will focus on the pro-motion of education for all types of people. Students, teachers, doctors, industrial technicians, and even re-tired persons will benefit from the classes offered. The Settlement School of Gatlinburg symbolizes the ideals of its founders and its donors and is truly something of value. LINDA DAVIS Native Crafts Kept Alive! CALIFORNIA EPSILON--Pi Beta Phi's Arrow ex-tends across the entire nation. When each Pi Phi thinks of service, her thoughts are pointed upward to that special place high in the Smokies. Here we find the starting point for the first sorority to establish their philanthropy. Pi Beta Phi felt this such a worthy endeavor it has been maintained ,all through the years. Being the oldest fraternity for women, Pi Phi's felt the need to keep alive one of the oldest and true American art cultures. Industrialism is rapidly causing the extinction of true handicrafts, but Arrow in the Smokies providesthe opportunity for these people to keep their native craft still alive. Besides the mere craft aspect, employment is created along with the recreational aspect of the school. For those people merely interested in learning a craft, the opportunity is constantly provided for them. Because university credit is given, it allows those seeking a profession in art to continue their work. The future of the Arrow in the Smokies is tremendous. Expansion of this foundation cannot help but grow because of the support it has received and will continue to receive. The second hundred years will prove to be as successful as the first hundred because Arrow in the Smokies keeps alive for future generations the artistic heritage of that area of the United States. SUSAN DRISCOLL Tremendous Job Ahead NEVADA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi can be more than hopeful about its philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. This dream of building an Arts and Crafts addition to the University of Tennessee will become a reality, just as the Settlement School has. Through the financial and moral assistance of every Pi Phi, the Settlement School has grown to be one of the largest crafts' centers of the United States. If we look at the past success of our Settlement School, we cannot fail in our hope for the future, Arrow in the Smokies. As hopeful as we are, we must realize that the construction of such a project is a tremendous job which will need the support of every member. The Pi Phis at Nevada Alpha Chapter are organizing two projects to raise funds for Arrow in the Smokies. We plan to have a Sandwich Sale and a Spaghetti Feed. Our advertisements for both these functions will explain Arrow in the Smokies, and the importance of this philanthropy should aid our success. The Sandwich Sale will consist of selling Poor Boy sandwiches to campus residents on two Sundays. The Spaghetti Feed will also be on a Sunday, because the campus cafeteria only serves brunch on Sundays. We will have the dinner on or near the University, pre-pare it ourselves, and only charge a dollar for tickets sold in advance. We hope to receive a good profit which we will donate to Arrow in the Smokies. If every Pi Phi Chapter can do something similar, Arrow in the Smokies will be transformed from a dream into a reality. STEPHANIE LORIGAN Art Appreciation Continues! ARIZONA ALPHA The Arizona Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi highly commends the progress and great eagerness toward our new Centennial project of 1966 through 1967. We are very enthusiastic to increase aid to the underprivileged people in the Gatlinburg area. By enlarging the Summer Craft Workshop, we may be able, not only to help these poverty-stricken mountain people, but also to increase the knowledge of dying traditional crafts such as stitchery and weaving that have been so much a part of the early pio (Continued on page 87) i Beta Phi Pledges These young ladies pledged Pi Beta Phi chapters at colleges and universities with a fall rush or open rush in the first semester of the 1967-68 school year.

"Every member of Pi Beta Phi can be proud of this project because we are looking beyond our needs to those of others. We are not only helping others, we are preserving a beautiful art for the benefit of all. Because Montana Alpha feels that this national philanthropy is so important we do not sponsor any particular local philanthropy. Each year we hold a contest for the `King of the Hill' in which one member of each fraternity is nominated by his fraternity for this honor. These men are invited to the house several times and are asked to present some form of entertainment for us. The members of our house then vote for one of the men and on a Saturday night we hold a campus-wide `Derby Dance' to crown the winning`King of the Hill.' The other candidates are then our `Brothers of the Arrow.' The proceeds from the dance are sent to the Arrow in the Smokies as our donation. We are very proud that last year Montana Alpha donated the largest contribution. We feel that a project such as ours would be a good method for any chapter to use to promote our national philanthropy. CAROLE POFFENBERGER The Realm of "Others" WASHINGTON ALPHA Our philanthropic project in the Smokey Mountains area is the fulfillment of ,a desire embedded deep in every Pi Phi heart. College life is full of the everyday hustle and bustle of schoolwork, campus activities, dates, and friends. Our philanthropic project adds a meaningful dimension to a college career: We project ourselves beyond the realm of "self'' to the realm of "others." Because we feel that Gatlinburg is one of the primary responsibilities of our House, the Pi Phi's at Washington Alpha display the material crafts as well as the spiritual ideals of this once backward area during our September Rush. We want these prospective pledges to see the deeper meaning behind Pi Beta Phi. Each Fall, we are reminded of the significance of the Smokey Mountains project. Hundreds of people in Gatlinburg are being educated through the nationwide effort of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity; they are learning a livelihood in handicrafts; they are gaining self-respect. How do we at Washington Alpha Chapter help the Smokey Mountains project: In the Fall our House sponsors a sale of the handicrafts produced by the craftsmen of Gatlinburg. This sale provides a market for the crafts; it is open to anyone. All the girls in the house enjoy setting up the display, especially when the products are so varied. Anything from brooms to mugs to jewelry to stationery can be found at the sale. It's always fun to give the buyers a little background on our project and what it means to us. This not only makes the crafts more meaningful, but helps us to take an active part in this altruistic project! We at Washington Alpha are anxious to do our part in helping to promote the success of the people at Gatlinburg. The progress shown to date is certainly an inspiration to us all. PAM WAGNER The Warm Feeling of Giving WASHINGTON BETA The Washington Beta chapter feels that the Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the present opportunity for Pi Phi's to give of their service, time and money. We are planning to have a Settlement School program to inform members of the project and the potentials and opportunities which it opens to us. After enthusiasm is raised, a fund-raising project will follow. This project, Penny a Pound for Pi Phi (an idea from Wisconsin Beta) will tax each girl a penny for each pound of her weight. The pennies will be pasted on a poster board in the shape of a huge piggy bank for display. We feel that with adequate support this project will develop into a vital institution. It will, enrich the lives of those who take advantage of its facilities, learn a trade and become productive citizens; as well THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 77 as the lives of those who benefit from the usefullness of the products. In the age of mechanization, the Arrow in the Smokies will play its part in preserving creativity and personal pride in an object, as contrasted to the impersonal qualities of a machine-made product. . The members of Washington Beta are very proud of the philanthropies project, not only because working together towards a common goal brings unity to Pi Phi's everywhere, but also because of the personal opportunities, creative and technical, which it brings to so many. This project enables everyone to experience the warm feeling of giving. AMY RADEWAN A Worthwhile Program OREGON ALPHA Oregon Alpha of Pi Beta Phi feels that the Centennial Project: "Arrow In The Smokies" is a new and exciting addition. The Summer Craft Workshop has proved itself to be beneficial and rewarding to everyone involved, and with the expansion of more workshops, more and more people will be reached. The Craft Workshops, are beneficial in many ways. The inhabitants of the Gatlinburg area are able to gain a living because of the tourist trade drawn there, the instructors and the assistants of the Summer Craft Workshops are earning a living besides fullfilling their own aesthetic needs. The students are learning the crafts taught in order that they might re-turn to their homes and teach others. This is a never ending circle because ell those taught will continue to expand and teach others. We feel that it is an honor that Pi Beta Phi is in co-operation with the University of Tennessee in such a worthwhile program. Oregon Alpha is planning on having a skit-dinner to inform the chapter members of the Arrow in the Smokies Program. For our fund raising project we would like to have an Arrowcraft Shop Sale before the Christmas holidays. We feel the citizens of Eugene and the University of Oregon Student Body would be very interested in our crafts, and this would spread knowledge of our Centennial project, besides helping to raise our funds. Oregon Alpha's main philanthropic project is helping teach in the Handicapped Children's Swimming Program. Pi Phi, Marsha Almeter, is in charge of the program. NANCY ELMGREN A Conscious Endeavor OREGON BETA The members of Oregon Beta are very proud to be a part of Pi Beta Phi's new philanthropy project, Arrow in the Smokies. Pi Beta Phi must grow to meet the needs of it's members and nation alike. We must continue to broaden our horizons and since we are founded as a scholastic organization in what way could we better serve than by supplying an opportunity for education. Thoreau said: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeaver. Our conscious endeavor for this next one hundred years is Arrow in the Smokies. Through education we will preserve and extend our national heritage. Thus we are building a brighter future from the past. We are expanding to fill present and fu'ture needs and by doing this we will continue to grow as an organization of college women. We must not forget our heritage; we must preserve it. Oregon Beta feels that Arrow in the Smokies will help to preserve this heritage as it helps to educate our people and by helping to preserve our past will help to build a stronger and more united future. We can only wait to see what light our flame has cast by the end of this, our second, century.. Our hope is that it will continue to grow in brightness as it has during our past century. Services Extended IDAHO ALPHA Pi Beta Phi .can truly be proud of its nationally renowned philanthropic establishment, Arrow in ,the Smokies. Due to the dedication and loyalty of many individual Pi Phi alums and the support of many active chapters, and ,alum clubs, this project has grown since its establishment in 1910, by the Settlement School committee, to a greatly enlarged and expanded program partly affiliated with the University of Tennessee and making meaningful and productive the lives of many previously poor and backward people. This year, along with Pi Beta Phi's Centennial celebration, a great program is being put .into effect to expand and build this philanthropic project so that more of its services can be extended to make an even greater contribution. Idaho Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi would, like to greatly congratulate the leaders in this program and offer a Centennial wish that the Arrow in the Smokies may grow and expand in Gatlinburg, and perhaps in the future, even in. other locations where the need is great. Through our philanthropic project, all Pi Phis can make a significant contribution to the realization of Pi Phi ideals. In the area of public relations, Idaho Alpha Chap-ter of Pi. Beta Phi has contributed to the Fund for the Performing Arts Center here at the University of Idaho, a 6-million-dollar project, and also to the Cam-pus Chest Fund. CHERYL KOCH "Bigger and Better" CALIFORNIA GAMMA California Gamma, like all Pi Phi Chapters, has always been especially proud of our heritage as the pioneer in women's fraternities. As a non-profit organization we have always been proud to point out our high scholastic standards and social activities but, today, we are even prouder of the philanthropic projects that our sorority has developed. Now as Pi Beta Phi starts its second century our Chapter feels that our new philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, will be "bigger and better" yet. Because we do live across the, country it is SOMetimes difficult for us to really see the good that is being accomplished by these projects. We support them 'but we do not really know that much about 78 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI them. To remedy this we are currently planning a program for early November which will not only tell about our philanthropies, but which will, we hope, show another reason why we can be so proud to be Pi Phis. But the idea is not just to learn about and to support morally our philanthropies. We could all talk for hours about how proud we are of what we are doing and what a great project Arrow in the Smokies is but that will not make it a success. As Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice President of Philanthropies said in the September 1967 ARROW the important word for this and all other philanthropies is "yield". Our chapter realizes this and consequently we are also going to try to initiate plans for more publicity and for some fund-raising projects that will show our sup-port. California Gamma feels that the key to the success of this Centennial Project and to Pi Beta Phi's second century lies in the contributions of each and every Chapter. CHRISTI HUGGINS Symbol of Pride CALIFORNIA DELTA The year 1967 marked for Pi Beta Phi one hundred years of sisterhood through fraternity life. Yet only half a century ago that sister-hood became truly meaningful with the establishment of the national philanthropy. The Settlement School has become a symbol of pride. Not yet a member, a pledge wonders what Pi Phi represents. She questions what the purpose of Pi Phi is and what it means to national, the members, and finally to herself. She discovers the true significance of Pi Phi when she learns about the Settlement School. The school synibolizes Pi Phi's higher values and goals. The educational centers and workshops of Gatlin-burg endure and expand with the devotion and interest of actives across the nation. Donations from each chapter and alumni continually pour into the school as a genuine expression of support for the work and progress made by the philanthropy. Future expansion made possible by the donations will focus on the pro-motion of education for all types of people. Students, teachers, doctors, industrial technicians, and even re-tired persons will benefit from the classes offered. The Settlement School of Gatlinburg symbolizes the ideals of its founders and its donors and is truly something of value. LINDA DAVIS Native Crafts Kept Alive! CALIFORNIA EPSILON--Pi Beta Phi's Arrow ex-tends across the entire nation. When each Pi Phi thinks of service, her thoughts are pointed upward to that special place high in the Smokies. Here we find the starting point for the first sorority to establish their philanthropy. Pi Beta Phi felt this such a worthy endeavor it has been maintained ,all through the years. Being the oldest fraternity for women, Pi Phi's felt the need to keep alive one of the oldest and true American art cultures. Industrialism is rapidly causing the extinction of true handicrafts, but Arrow in the Smokies providesthe opportunity for these people to keep their native craft still alive. Besides the mere craft aspect, employment is created along with the recreational aspect of the school. For those people merely interested in learning a craft, the opportunity is constantly provided for them. Because university credit is given, it allows those seeking a profession in art to continue their work. The future of the Arrow in the Smokies is tremendous. Expansion of this foundation cannot help but grow because of the support it has received and will continue to receive. The second hundred years will prove to be as successful as the first hundred because Arrow in the Smokies keeps alive for future generations the artistic heritage of that area of the United States. SUSAN DRISCOLL Tremendous Job Ahead NEVADA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi can be more than hopeful about its philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. This dream of building an Arts and Crafts addition to the University of Tennessee will become a reality, just as the Settlement School has. Through the financial and moral assistance of every Pi Phi, the Settlement School has grown to be one of the largest crafts' centers of the United States. If we look at the past success of our Settlement School, we cannot fail in our hope for the future, Arrow in the Smokies. As hopeful as we are, we must realize that the construction of such a project is a tremendous job which will need the support of every member. The Pi Phis at Nevada Alpha Chapter are organizing two projects to raise funds for Arrow in the Smokies. We plan to have a Sandwich Sale and a Spaghetti Feed. Our advertisements for both these functions will explain Arrow in the Smokies, and the importance of this philanthropy should aid our success. The Sandwich Sale will consist of selling Poor Boy sandwiches to campus residents on two Sundays. The Spaghetti Feed will also be on a Sunday, because the campus cafeteria only serves brunch on Sundays. We will have the dinner on or near the University, pre-pare it ourselves, and only charge a dollar for tickets sold in advance. We hope to receive a good profit which we will donate to Arrow in the Smokies. If every Pi Phi Chapter can do something similar, Arrow in the Smokies will be transformed from a dream into a reality. STEPHANIE LORIGAN Art Appreciation Continues! ARIZONA ALPHA The Arizona Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi highly commends the progress and great eagerness toward our new Centennial project of 1966 through 1967. We are very enthusiastic to increase aid to the underprivileged people in the Gatlinburg area.

In many ways the responsibility for its permanence and success rests with today's active chapter members. These young Pi Phis are members of a generation that has been too often misjudged because of the excesses of its vocal malcontents. There is solid and heartening evidence that today's children of affluence are not children of indifference in relation to the needs of their fellows. Indeed, there is much dedication on their part as individuals and accomplishment as a result of their group efforts to demonstrate their deep feeling of commitment to the ideal in the area of human relationships. In the hope that it might help them coalesce their thinking about this new project to set down their views on it and their work for it, they were asked to discuss those thoughts for Fraternity Forum. Once again the young women of Pi Beta Phi have given their sisters cause for pride and confidence with their grasp of the realities and their vision of the ideal as they view the challenge of the new national philanthropy of their Fraternity, which a Cornell Pi Phi has described as a "catalyst for creativity in society." 63 [cat etmtt JOtcutivi 64 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Fulfilling Our Ambitions VERMONT ALPHA The Pi Beta Phi philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, is one which we, of the Vermont Alpha Chapter, feel personifies the backbone of the fraternity as a whole and is one which, in today's world, is part of the universal struggle for peace through assistance in helping ourselves fulfill our ambitions. If each one of us were to feel as if he or she were contributing to the world as a whole, even in the most minute detail, we would at least be satisfying one of our basic inner needs: to feel useful. Arrow in the Smokies fulfills this aspect in many people who not only are contributing factors to the establishment but who are also helping others to be so involved. Through this philanthropy we are providing an outlet for the enjoyment and skill of the surrounding people, as well as maintaining an important part of the American culture. But this "creative institution" has by no means achieved its highest potential. There is much more than can be done .and should be done, not only in our national philanthropy at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, but also in each chapter's individual philanthropy project. By developing and improving the Arrow settlement in Gatlinburg we will maintain a little of our heritage as well as supporting a living memorial. Similarly, in each individual chap-ter philanthropy, the members can find fulfillment outside of their campus or college life and assist the community at the same time. Although these philanthropies will vary, it is hoped that they will uphold the idea that not only are we helping ourselves, but also others. ANN MILLER Fine Way to Start MAINE ALPHA We at Maine Alpha are very pleased with the new extension that is to be added to the Summer Craft Workshop. We feel that this new project, located on the property of our Settlement School is a fine way to start off Pi Phi's second hundred years. We intend to make this dream of a new Arrow in the Smokies come true by giving as much support as we can. For many years Maine Alphas have been raising money for our national philanthropy in various ways. This fall we had our muu-muu and candied apple. sales, and very shortly we will be having our annual arrowcraft sale sale. The arrowcraft sale is held in our Student Union Building and is very well received by the Maine students. As well as making money by this sale we are also publicizing our Settlement School and Arrowcraft Shop. We are very fortunate in having a number of alumni in the area and these sales help to keep them informed of what is happening in our national philanthropy. Philanthropies are very important to Maine Alphas. Our present local philanthropy is an Opportunity Center for mentally retarded children. The children at the Opportunity Center greatly appreciate the parties and dances which we have for them on special occasions. On the local level we also assist the fraternities with their Christmas parties for orphan children and many of us are involved in the Companion Programwhere we spend a few hours a week with a little girl or boy from one of the surrounding towns. The Maine Alphas hope and will try their best to make Arrow in the Smokies a success. BECKY HALL "Arrow in the Arctic" ONTARIO ALPHA Since the success of the "Arrow in the Smokies" has been, recognized in full measure, the Ontario Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi felt that an article on the "Arrow in the Arctic" might be of added interest to the other chapters of Pi Beta Phi; particularly the chapters in the United States, who perhaps do not know what its specific aims and purposes are. So, perhaps we can acquaint them, with a few facts relating to what we believe to be, a progressive project in the realm of philanthropy here in Canada. The idea for the new Canadian Project was put forth by the Vancouver Alumnae Club. Their suggestion was that all the Canadian Alumni Clubs and Active Chapters annual contributions towards the buying of books for the library at Whitehorse in the Yukon, and the library at Hay River in the Northwest Territories. These libraries are being developed by the Canadian government, but needless to say, contributions are not only greatly needed but most appreciated. The librarians in charge of these two libraries have been authorized to purchase the books which will be most beneficial for educational purposes, with our contributions. We would hope that the American Chapters of Pi Beta Phi would recognize the value of our Canadian Project. We feel that the possibilities for enlarging our plans for philanthropy in this area are unlimited. Therefore, we would suggest that you might like to extend your assistance to us so that we may unite in our efforts to bring our project the success that we have made together at Gatlinburg. New Avenues for Growth CONNECTICUT ALPHA It is a truism that the educated man leads the richest life. He understands and appreciates the world around him. He is economically and intellectually independent. Thirteen years ago, it seems these beliefs were uppermost in Phi Phi's minds as they envisioned the Centennial Project, "Arrow in the Smokies." Since the new institution is fully accredited by the University of Tennessee and will run on a year round basis, individuals who be-fore could not attend the University for economic or other reasons may be able to enjoy the privilege of these courses in craft design. The establishment of such an institution opens up countless avenues for the growth and development of craft education. In the years to come, Gatlinburg may be a spot for conventions, seminar courses, and workshops in teacher-education for arts and crafts as well as professional training. Beside supporting Pi Phi's philanthropic endeavors through Magazine Agency orders, Arrowcraft sales, and Arrowcraft displays, Connecticut Alpha has other plans for supporting "Arrow in the Smokies," per THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI 65 haps the most promising of all Pi Phi projects. Each year, at the traditional Settlement School Dinner, all the sisters dress in "mountain duds" and enjoy fried chicken and corn on the cob Gatlinburg style. This year, the tips given the waitresses will be donated to "Arrow in the Smokies." After dinner, thanks to a joint effort on the part of the Program ,and Philanthropies Chairmen, the "hilly billy" sisters will be invited to an Arrowcraft Sale and a showing of slides about "Arrow in the Smokies." In addition to supporting the fraternity's national projects, Connecticut Alpha Chapter's philanthropic ideals are manifested in two local, projects: trips to the Mansfield Connecticut State School where sisters visit patients, and a foster child in Greece who is sup-ported through the chapter's friendship and contributions. GERALDINE ZORN Yankee Hernando's Hideaway VERMONT BETA Our national philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, needs no explanation for any Pi Phi. Each and every one of us realizes the importance of this national altruistic project and the opportunities it offers to others to help themselves through the Craft Workshop. Pi Beta Phi should be proud that it was the originator of a philanthropy which is not only a Craft Workshop, but also a market for the wares of weavers and craftsmen in the area. Vermont Beta donates each year to the Settlement School Fund, raising the money in numerous ways. Our main fund raising project is held each year on a Sunday in November and is entitled "Hernando's Hideaway." It is a spaghetti supper, served in "Hide-away" atmosphere, with live entertainment provided. This Pi Phi project has become a tradition on campus, and the number of people attending has increased so much each year that we are now holding three complete sittings! Our local philanthropy is the Vermont Heart Association for which we also raise funds, in what we feel is an enjoyable way. At the University of Vermont Homecoming Game, the Pi Phi's sponsor a candy apple sale with homemade apples. This has proved to be an extremely popular project, with the profits in-creasing each year. Whether working on Hernando's Hideaway, making or selling candied apples or giving volunteer time to the American Red Cross or the Tuberculosis Association, the sisters of Vermont Beta manage to stay busy giving of themselves but also realizing the satisfaction that comes from this giving. JANET STEFF Arrowcraft Kits for Sale! MASSACHUSETTS BETA The "Arrow in the Smokies" is a very real part of the lives of the girls of Massachusetts Beta. From our earliest days of pledging we are made aware of our purpose as Pi Phis. We are not merely a group of girls banded together for social aims, nor are we united solely to share in the sisterhood experience. This of course is a part of it. However, there is a very tangible reason for our belonging to a fraternity that of philanthropy. The Settlement School in Gatlinburg is a project dear to our hearts, for in maintaining this center, we have a genuine opportunity to help others. We can take pride in the fact that because of the aid of so many hundreds of Pi Phis, this school was established and has been maintained for more than half a century. Its handicrafts are known to be some of the best in the world. Our reward is the gratitude of those who are benefited by this center. This year, to do our share in promoting the "Arrow in the Smokies," we have sent for a sample kit from Arrowcraft which will contain various items of their handiwork. Committees are being set up for the general organization of the sale which will be held in November. The publicity committee will set to work on informing other members of the Greek system as well as non-Greeks all over campus of the sale. These crafts will make ideal Christmas gifts. The future of the Settlement School looks indeed bright. Pi Phi membership is forever increasing, and with new members come new ideas, new initiative. Those illustrious Pi Phis who established the Settlement School so many years ago aimed their arrows high, thus setting the pace for those who were to follow. Helping Others NEW YORK GAMMA Our centennial philanthropic project, "Arrow in the Smokies" shows Pi Beta Phi to be a mature organization capable of sup-porting itself and helping others. Our second hundred years will be typified by service in the education of the arts. We can be proud that we are mature enough to meet the challenge of educating others through our own desire to give. The accrediting of the Craft Center by the University of Tennesseee is perhaps the best indicator of outside trust in Pi Beta Phi. We are to be held responsible for the educating of many in the arts and crafts beyond the manipulation of materials. Those studying the arts and crafts will be able to express themselves in their media as well as accumulate credits. Only in a mature, responsible and respected organization would this be entrusted. We can be sure that Arrow in the Smokies will be a high water mark in the area of philanthropy. Since it is structured in such a way that no area of administration is left untouched, we can be assured that the inner workings of the project are well cared for. Our experience in the handling of the Arrowcraft work-shop will prove to be the starting point for this new project. We will be able to enlarge previous projects into a new one which will encorporate solid administration coordinated with the workings of the Craft Center. Helping others to help themselves is perhaps one of the most challenging of all problems today and is being faced by orders higher than our own fraternity. If we are to find our place in this endeavor, we must give. This is the keyword of "Arrow in the Smokies." The Settlement School in now matured. From here we 66 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI must work toward a new goal that of .a concentrated interest in the arts and craft education, in order to actualize the experience gained from previous projects. ROZANNE FARKAS Catalyst for Creativity in Society NEW YORK DELTA With the popularity today of such service projects as the Peace Corps and Vista, Pi Phis throughout the world can reflect with pride on the foresight of their older sisters. For the appearance of those indomitable wearers of the Arrow in Gatlinburg over five decades ago shows that Pi Beta Phi had al-ready penetrated a new frontier to fight for the betterment of their fellow man. Present day Gatlinburg clearly testifies to the tremendous success of our mission, but poses a new challenge as well: to project Gatlinburg beyond complacent prosperity toward being a catalyst for further creativity within the society. The gradual development of the Arts and Crafts Center illustrates Pi Beta Phi's belief that creativity springs from the individual; personal expression and satisfaction constitute the highest and ultimate good of crafts. In that way our Centennial Project, by expanding the opportunities for people of all ages and conditions to partake of the program, will exert an even greater regenerating influence on every individual. However, our project in the Smokies has also come to enjoy world-wide prestige and our new, ambitious program should inspire other craft centers to follow our pioneering step. Finally, our new institution will allow even more people the joy of viewing and possessing these crafts from the Smokies, intimately linking those distant consumers with the creative inspiration that forged the Arrow in the Smokies. As a chapter and as individuals the members of New York Delta are concerned about and interested in helping others when they most need it. The pledge training program is concerned with developing in each individual an interest not only specifically in Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic projects but also in developing an attitude of caring about the community in general which will be maintained throughout her life. A Settlement School Tea and Sale was planned in October to raise money for the Settlement School for the Arrow in the Smokies project. Christmas Orphan Party OHIO ALPHA Ohio Alpha has thought it would be a grand experience for an Ohio Alpha art major to be awarded a scholarship to the summer workshop each year. This would be sponsored in some way by Ohio Alpha. These girls would not only get training in their major, but they would be able to provide us with invaluable information concerning Settlement School as a whole. She could receive college credit at the same time. Another idea, although perhaps not as feasible, is that Pi Phi Art majors from various chapters be hired as Summer School instructors. They would be paid enough to cover their expenses, but not so much that it would be a profitable summer money-wise. Theywould get so much practical experience that the intangible rewards would be irreplaceable. Our chapter has two local philanthropic projects each year. One is an annual Christmas Orphan Party co-sponsored with the Sigma Chis. The other changes each year. This year it will be participation in the local UNICEF drive. We also sell within our own chapter some original Pi Phi Angel stationery de-signed by one of our girls. The profits from this go into our building fund for the new house. If some-thing like this were to be instituted throughout all the chapters, the proceeds could pay for a new National Arrow of the Smokies Scholarship. NANCY KINNISON Recognition of a Need OHIO BETA From the very beginning one hundred years ago, when our twelve founders bought coal and paid the rent for a Monmouth family who was unable to support itself, Pi Beta Phi has been actively involved in serving others. In 1912 we rose to a great educational need in an isolated community on the fringe of the Smoky Mountains. The original purpose was to reach the 3R's and to give special emphasis to industrial and agricultural training. This philanthropic effort has expanded over the years and has been a boom to Gatlinburg. But time moves on and needs change. As Pi Beta Phi stands on the threshold of its second century, it glances back only for encouragement from those who have gone before, then steps forward to meet a new, challenging, contemporary problem. A year-round Craft Workshop will offer professional instruction to those people who will then teach the skills to handicapped people the blind, the deaf, the elderly, the mentally retarded, and so forth. These are individuals of all age groups who have been untrained, unable to work, and financially dependent. This endeavor holds a maximum potential for service in our nation. With new skills of sewing, knitting, metal work, pottery, rug weaving, craft design, enameling, jewelry making, etc., these previously handicapped people can feel useful and contributive. It would be so easy in our rapidly changing, technologically-oriented society for these people to be for-gotten. But Pi Beta Phi has recognized the need and has devoted its time and money to this cause. (Two Ohio Beta girls will benefit from the Harriet Rutherford Johnstone Scholarship: Barbara Morrison and Kay Pattison. Opportunity for Service OHIO ZETA Our days at Ohio Zeta are busy, active ones. As sisters we participate together in all phases of fraternity life. We enjoy the pleasant seclusion of our own chapter, and its close bonds create a place apart for us. And yet, our hearts and hopes reach far beyond this secluded realm; we direct our thoughts not only inward, to one another, but also consistently upward and outward to identify with the vastness and pervasiveness of Pi Beta Phi and with the always new aspirings of our fraternity. It is with great pride and high hopes that we now THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 67 view these aspirings embodied so finely in the establishment of our sisterhood's newest philanthropy, "Arrow in the Smokies." We see "Arrow in the Smokies" as an opportunity for service unequalled even in our meritorious past. It holds a great potential for even bigger and better results than those achieved so effectively thus far. Because "Arrow in the Smokies" has been designed as a step beyond, though one highly coordinated with, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, we see its possibilities for effectiveness as greatly enhanced. Hopefully, it will be nurtured into an institution much like its forerunner but one which offers even more of the possibilities for creativity and craftsmanship and for aiding and yielding of ourselves for others. Arrowcraft Sales Lend Support D.C. ALPHA This year being our Centennial Year, the Pi Phis of the District of Columbia Alpha chapter want to lend total support to our national philanthropy, Settlement School. Through magazine sales and Arrowcraft sales we hope to make a contribution that will help Settlement School accomplish as much as it has since 1912 in Pi Beta Phi's next one hundred years. Helping others help themselves leaves a warm feeling in the hearts of the members of D.C. Alpha chapter and of Pi Phis around the world. MADELEINE WALKER Soundless Opportunity for Expansion VIRGINIA GAMMA The Pi Beta Phi philanthropy in Gatlinburg, Tennessee has snow-balled from its modest beginnings in 1910 as a memorial to the Pi Phi founders to a major source of education for people from this mountain area. Gatlinburg was chosen as the site for the sorority project because of the enormous education and health needs of the people. The school, opened in 1912 with 13 pupils, now has become an integral part of the Tennessee education system, and the number of students has increased many times. Also a part of the Pi Phi philanthropy is the Arrow Craft Shop. In 1945 the Summer Craft Workshop in conjunction with the University of Tennessee was given birth and is currently serving people from all over the world. If one looks at the value of our philanthropy, he is bound to recognize its infinite worth and nearly boundless possibilities for even further expansion. Supporting the latter part of this statement is the fact that the Tennessee education system has taken over a great deal of responsibility for the school, and consequently has given the Pi Phis more time for its Arrow Craft Shop, and for expanding into other services. It appears to the Virginia Gammas that the Arrow in the Smokies will continue to offer expanding realities as long as interest is shown; and as long as there is a need for something, the Pi Phis will strive to make it available. DONNA GORMAN Working with Special Groups VIRGINIA DELTA For over fifty years, the words Pi Beta Phi have meant to countless people the Settle ment School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. These words have meant friendship and assistance. Now with the celebration of Pi Beta Phi's Centennial, the character of the Pi Beta Phi philanthropy is changing its goals after long years, and is directing its energy toward an expanding Craft Shop. With the discontinuation of the Settlement School, the future of the "new" Arrowcraft Shop is one of unlimited opportunity. The Arrowcraft Shop is being expanded with the long-range idea that it will become a center of study and from which people can build outward. The programs planned for this year are quite ambitious, but it is the thought of future years that really excites the imagination! The study programs for this year include courses for amateurs, undergraduate and graduate students, teachers, designer craftsmen, volunteer leaders, and many more. However, it is in working with special groups, such as the handicapped, the aged, the under-privileged, the chronically ill, and the mentally retarded, that Pi Beta Phi as a philanthropy can do the greatest good. The thought of those children who are handicapped, or an old man who no longer feels useful to himself or society, being able to express themselves and to produce an item that they have created and that is recognized as being worthwhile, is thrilling. It is the idea of this kind of help and assistance that the ideals of Pi Beta Phi have always encouraged and advocated. CHRIS DAVIS Spaghetti Supper Support WEST VIRGINIA ALPHA Our chapter was in-formed of "Arrow in the Smokies" in full scope when our convention delegates gave their reports this fall. Every member thinks it is a fantastic idea. One hundred years is a long time to celebrate and we feel that starting a project like "Arrow in the Smokies" is the biggest way that all Pi Phis could celebrate. On the house tours during Rush the chapter always has one room reserved for explanation of our philanthropies. None of our members are using a fraternity scholarship at the present moment. The chapter has decided to start its own loan fund, however. Once a month it is going to have a spaghetti dinner to raise money. Anyone may come to it and all the chapter members help with this dinner in some way. $100.00 was cleared on the first dinner and I feel this will increase with publicity. Hopefully, we will be able to use some of this money to help with the "Arrow in the Smokies" project. MARCIA PUFFENBERGER Avenue for Concern NORTH CAROLINA BETA The expansion of Pi Beta Phi's national philanthropy, the Settlement School, through the Arrow in the Smokies, has heightened the interest of North Carolina Beta chap-ter. One of the distinct advantages of any organization is its potential service; and one of the bonds that holds the members of Pi Beta Phi together is concern 68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI for others. Arrow in the Smokies provides an excel-lent opportunity to take advantage of this concern. North Carolina Beta is planning an activity which will both promote good public relations and provide financial support for the new addition. An auction will be held for a fraternity wherein members of the chapter will be auctioned off. The highest bidder of each Pi Phi will have access to her services for a Saturday afternoon. She promises to wash his car, iron his shirts, or other tasks assigned to her. A bake sale will be held during the auction, and all proceeds will go to the Arrow in the Smokies. Local philanthropic projects have received increasing interest also. In past years the chapter has provided Thanksgiving baskets for needy families; given a Christmas party with a fraternity for orphans in the area; and the pledge class gave a party for some men-tally retarded children. This year two new projects have been added. Growing concern for the impoverished areas of the community surrounding the campus, with particular regard to the children, has resulted in a new program to help them. Each week a group of about fifteen children is brought to the campus. They meet with several Pi Phi's to learn about a variety of subjects. One week flowers were discussed, followed by a tour of the Duke gardens. Another week drama was explained, and the children produced their own play. As the year progresses it is hoped that the two groups will grow close together and personal relationships can be fostered. An additional Christmas project is also being planned. The Salvation Army provides dolls if volunteers will "dress" them. Each member can make an outfit during a regular meeting time, since the materials will be organized beforehand by the Philanthropies Chairmen. It is hoped that the project will both bring increased unity to the group, and be beneficial to the community. There has been an increasing amount of controversy on our campus concerning the worth of women's fraternities. A great deal of the value of Pi Beta Phi to its members is very personal and intangible. Philanthropies, both on the national and local level, are a vital factor in promoting good relations, as well as providing a meaningful involvement on the part of the participants. The expansion of Pi Beta Phi's existing philanthropy speaks for its success in the preceding years. North 'Carolina Beta is striving to make the next one hundred years even more meaningful. Monument to All Pi Phis SOUTH CAROLINA ALPHA Probably the first thing a Pi Phi learns is to be proud of her sorority, for Pi Phi has so many firsts to be proud of. One of these is being the first national sorority to create a philanthropic project. And almost as important as its being a first is the fact that as Pi Phis we all share the same goal in keeping our philanthropy going. In the Smokies one can see this project in real life. As close as our chapter is to Tennessee, the Smokies project is more than just a passing thought. Here we are provided an opportunity to see the project first hand. The Settlement School itself stands apart fromthe ever growing resort town and stands as a welcome and monument to all Pi Phis. There is a great future in our Settlement School now that its groundwork has been laid. The position of the school is ideal to reach out and grasp the en-tire area where people still need greater education facilities and training in skills. The school also can renew hope for reviving interest in the hand crafts. This chapter hopes that the Settlement School will continue to grow and tie the bonds of friendship not only to other Pi Phi sisters but to those who need help and faith. LINDA COULL Cultural and Economic Growth MICHIGAN DELTA Michigan Delta sees a great future for the Ri Beta Phi philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, both as a potentiality for service and as a creative institution. As a potential for service it will greatly benefit the people of the area by creating more jobs and by giving them the opportunity to improve their lives, both economically and culturally. By expanding the Arts and Crafts Center, there will be a greater opportunity for the people to express and develop their talents and skills in the arts and crafts. In addition to benefiting the local people, the expanded Center will be a great experience for art students, prospective teachers and any persons who are interested in art. The Arts and Crafts Center will greatly aid the economic condition of Gatlinburg and will bring in more business for the local craftsmen. To help bring about the dream of Arrow in the Smokies, Michigan Delta has had two Settlement School Sales, both of which were quite successful. One was held by the chapter in late Spring and the other was held by the Alumni Club in early November. In past years Michigan Delta has worked with needy children of the community. Last year the chap-ter adopted a family and also did work with a Catholic school. In addition to this, the chapter made tray favors for the local hospital. The chapter is still working with all three of these local philanthropies. JANE GRONBACK Christmas Village TENNESSEE BETA Tennessee Beta Pi Phis have been eagerly anticipating, and busily preparing for, Christmas Village. Sponsored by the Nashville Alumnae Club, Christmas village is held annually in mid-November at the Hippodrome in Nashville. Many local merchants set up booths at which their merchandise ranging from toys to plum puddings to sportswear is displayed and sold. The Arrowcraft Shop, too, has a booth at which its craftwork can be either bought or ordered. The proceeds from Christmas Village are donated to the Bill Wilkerson Speech and Hearing Center in Nashville. This year, Tennessee Beta Pi Phis decided to make and sell our own handiwork. The chapter was divided into four teams, to add an element of competition, and during the summer each Pi Phi made approximately ten "somethings" of her own choice. Thus the opportunity for originality and creativity was un THE ARROW OF Pt BETA PHI 69 bounded. This fall the response was amazing as we viewed the items which had been made during the summer, and discovered all sorts of "hidden" talent within the chapter. The items included such things as hand-painted waste baskets, felt Christmas stockings, covered match boxes, needlepoint calendars, crocheted coat hanger covers, hand-painted lap boards for studying, hairbows, antiqued card boxes and letter boxes, aprons, Christmas decorations, roller bags, hand-decorated stationery, pine cone flowers, and many, many more. JULIE MCGEHEE New Enthusiasm from Convention NORTH CAROLINA ALPHA Our convention delegate, in her report of the convention activities, enthusiastically spoke of the exhibit from the craft shop. She was able to give our chapter a better idea of the type and quality of work resulting from the Settlement School training. She was extremely impressed with the handicrafts and the obviously superior training that made them a possibility. Her enthusiasm stimulated the desire in all of us to perhaps make a trip as a group to see this craft work in Gatlinburg. The chapter plans to continue its magazine sale and hopefully do our share to help this beneficial and successful project expand even more rapidly in the future than it has in the past. We feel very proud to have been small contributors to a project so worthwhile. On our campus we will bear the meal and activity expense of a foreign exchange student this year. We also plan to sponsor a picnic for all undergraduate foreign students. KAREN DAVIS Development of Individual Skills INDIANA ALPHA In the early history of the quite serene Smoky Mountains, the tall proud evergreens stretch to reach the sun, the source of their life. The early mountain folk also had to look to the sun for their lives. They were farmers whose existence depended on the sun giving life to their crops. In 1912, Pi Beta Phi introduced a new light in their lives. The Settlement School was established in a valley high in the Smoky Mountains of Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The Settlement School acted like a sun in the development of the individual skills which the people of the mountains have. The Settlement School will be celebrating it's 56th. Anniversary this year, March 1968. Members of Indiana Alpha are proud of Emma Harper Turner, one of our founders, the Washington, D.C. Alpha Chapter and the Alumnae Club delegates from Washington, D.C. for initiating the idea of the Settlement School at the 1910 Convention. Just as the 111 colleges and universities, which house Pi Beta Phi Chapters, have given her members the opportunity to express their talents and skills, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School has given hundreds of people the opportunity to express their talents for making crafts. BETTE RICHARDSONFrom Abstraction to Reality INDIANA ZETA When the Indiana Zeta Pi Phi Chapter held its fifteenth anniversary luncheon this fall, the members were surprised and very pleased to find an-owcraft workshop samples on display. Until that day, the Arrow in the Smokies had been merely a vague abstraction in the minds of most of us. We had not realized that the skill and craftsmanship of those at the Arrow in the Smokies could result in such a variety of beautiful creations. Among the other activities ,at our anniversary luncheon, the Arrowcraft display renewed inspiration and pride in our national fraternity. Perhaps the awareness of and pride in our Pi Beta Phi philanthropy is part of that special quality Pi Phis all over the country seem to possess. As college women, it seems so very appropriate that we sponsor a project which does so very much to promote industry and creativity. All over the country Pi Phis can wear the golden arrow with special pride, not only as a symbol of our sisterhood, but also as a reminder of our philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. JANIS TRUSTY Gatlinburg Houseparty TENNESSEE GAMMA The members of the Tennessee Gamma chapter of Pi Beta Phi, feel most definitely that Arrow in the Smokies will become a reality. The success of our 'altruistic project of our first 100 years, the Settlement School, exemplifies the interest and effort of Pi Beta Phi's around the world. Our centennial project, the Art and Craft Center, will continue the Settlement School purpose of helping others to help themselves. Since our chapter at the University of Tennessee is the closest chapter to Gatlinburg, being only 40 miles away, we feel closely connected with the philanthropic projects of Pi Phi. Our chapter's "house party" is annually held in Gatlinburg and the pledges are given a tour of the Settlement School and Craft facilities. The Arrowcraft Shop is visited and utilized regularly by members of our chapter. The chapter has purchased an entire display of crafts from the Arrowcraft Shop to use during Fall Open House and at other times when our chapter suite is opened to visitors. Each year crafts from the shop are sold at a Christmas Bazaar in which all seventeen sororities on the University of Tennessee campus participate. We hope that in the future our chapter may help the Arrowcraft Shop in the distribution of crafts to active chapters and Alumnae Clubs across the nation and in Canada. The co-sponsorship of the Summer Craft Workshop by the University of Tennessee shows the interest of those outside the sorority in making the Pi Phi dream come true. We feel that through the utilization of facilities now in. Gatlinburg and through gifts and contributions, the Pi Phi Dream, Arrow in the Smokies, will become a center of craft development unequalled by any other. MARGARET S. YOUNG 70 THE ARROW OF N BETA PHI Pride from Proximity TENNESSEE DELTA Tennessee Delta takes special pride in our new Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, since it is located in our own state. By expanding the present accredited summer craft work-shop, adding new buildings and staff members, and maintaining the school on a year round basis, we feel that we will be giving others an opportunity for education and a fuller development of their talents in our second century of achievement. It is our hope that students will come to perfect their arts and crafts for use in rehabilitation, in teaching home economics and the mentally retarded. We give our support to this new project by asking both our members and pledges to purchase two magazines from the Pi Beta Phi magazine agency. Because we are near Gatlinburg, many of our members have had the privilege of visiting the Arrowcraft Shop. They have brought back to our chapter unique objects designed there, thus stimulating a genuine interest for some of our more talented members to attend the sessions. Our main philanthropic project last year was the adoption of a group of officers in Viet Nam. During the year we corresponded with them and sent them goodies and care packages. Projects for this fall include providing Thanksgiving baskets for needy families and Christmas gifts for underprivileged children and visiting an old folks home twice a week. We also support the Maternal Welfare League of Memphis, which is devoted to research in birth defects. We are indeed proud to make Pi Beta Phi a pioneer in its second century in a great philanthropy Arrow in the Smokies. SUSAN FEATHERSTON A Major Responsibility ALABAMA BETA "Airow in the Smokies" is our major responsibility now and in the future. We hope that our contribution will help bring this dream to a reality for Pi Phis and those who will benefit from the Arrow in the Smokies. The future of this project depends on the backing of the individual chapters. We plan to inform every member of the importance of this project and how each person can help. Our philanthropies chairman and program chairman have been working together to present several programs on the Arrow in the Smokies. Our chapter is very limited in ways of making money on campus, because of University rules against fund-raising events. Candy selling by the pledges in the spring is our only big fund-raising event. Of course the actives contribute a great deal to this project, too. Our main way of collecting funds is through individual contributions and these go to the Centennial Fund and the Settlement School. Even though we are limited in our ways of making money, we still take a great deal of pride in our philanthropies pro-gram. For our local philanthropy, we have several different projects for the year. Through the we sponsor a child of a needy family who receives guid-ance and care through a well-organized program. During Christmas, we help a fraternity give a Santa Claus party for children from the welfare department. This can be one of the most rewarding experiences to see the smiling faces of these children. Also the pledges give a party and presents to the mentally retarded children at Partlow's. Through these projects, Alabama Beta plans to con-tribute their time and efforts to our local philanthropies as well as to the "Arrow in the Smokies". JUDY LORD Contribution to Happiness and Independence ALABAMA GAMMA Of education, Abraham Lincoln said, . . . "I can only say that 'I view it as the most important subject that we as a people can be en-gaged in. . . ." With our new project, Arrow in the Smokies, Pi Beta Phi is engaging in the "important subject" of education. Our approach, however, is not the traditional readin', writin' and 'rithmetic one. By educating our senior citizens and the handicapped in the use of their talents, Arrow in the Smokies will open the door to a more useful and satisfying life for them. Alabama Gamma looks on Arrow in the Smokies as a way for each of us to contribute to the happiness and independence of others less fortunate than we. We are very enthusiastic about this new project and plan to support it wholeheartedly with our contributions. We are proud that Pi Beta Phi is pioneering yet another worthy and needed philanthropy. The Arrow in the Smokies will gleam brightly as it points upward the goal of a more full and rich life not only for those benefiting by the project, but also for those of us who will help to make it a success. MARGARET-ANNE HESTER All Out Support FLORIDA GAMMA In this the 100th year of Pi Beta Phi, Florida Gamma hopes to do everything it can to support the fraternity's Centennial project. The project, which is a Craft Workshop to be built in co-operation with the University of Tennessee, will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. The workshop will be located in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. We understand that the goal of this project is that it will become the outstanding center of education in the field of arts and crafts, drawing students from the United States, Canada and foreign nations instead of being limited to the local area. We realize that this project is quite an undertaking and that it cannot go on until the required funds are raised and made avail-able. One very successful fund raising project has already been accomplished by the girls of Florida Gamma. We put on a "Mister Legs Contest" one night in the school cafeteria. After a short speech by one of the girls about the Settlement School and the Centennial project and about just where the money would be THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 71 going, one boy from each fraternity marched around the tables in the costume which he thought would best show off his legs. Each boy was escorted by a pretty Pi Phi carrying a money box for the collection of "votes." It was all so much fun and such a success that we plan to make it a yearly thing. More fund raising projects are planned for the rest of the year as we of Florida Gamma feel that it is up to each of us to support this, the first philanthropic project supported by a fraternity and giving financial support through active chapters and alumni clubs to expand an educational program. KATHRYN ANN BROWN The Time Is Ripe! GEORGIA ALPHA--Arrow in the Smokies is living proof that the originators of the first national altruistic project of any woman's fraternity demonstrated remarkable foresight when they presented plans for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. What began as a rehabilitation center to insure the education of underprivileged residents has become a haven for art students, teachers, therapists, crafts-men and hobbyists. Because of its close proximity to the University of Georgia, which boasts one of the finest art schools in the nation, Arrow in the Smokies should continue to offer additional training to Georgia Alpha's and the nation's art students. There has been a strong in-crease in interest shown by Georgia citizens for art and cultural improvement in that field. Atlanta's new center for the performing arts, its museums and galleries have been revitalized and replenished by civic leaders aware of their importance in the community. The proposed changes and improvements at the Centennial Convention could not have come at a more opportune time in this area. The time is ripe for citizens throughout Georgia to be made aware of the expanded opportunities now available to them through Arrow in the Smokies. Georgia Alpha has conducted a minor public relations campaign for the fraternity philanthropy in the past during major rush seasons on campus. The products of the school, its mechanics, and its rewards are explained to hundreds of girls each year. Whether they are pledged to our chapter or not, these girls are made aware of the opportunities existing just a few hours from Athens. SUZANNE WEBB Project Yields International Benefits ILLINOIS EPSILON Illinois Epsilon was proud to be one of the top ten contributors to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Now, at the beginning of the fraternity's second one-hundred years, the chapter is enthusiastic about supporting our new project, Arrow in the Smokies. We are especially pleased that our organization, which has given so much to girls throughout the world, now has a project in which each of us can make contributions that will yield international benefits. As in the past, our chapter will continue to take advantage of all opportunities to advertize our philanthropic project. During rush we displayed a variety of Settlement School handicrafts. We also have plans for similar displays before Christmas and during Parents' Week-End. Our chapter feels that the success of Arrow in the Smokies will not be based solely upon monetary contributions. Only through national publicity outside of Pi Beta Phi circles will such a project become a reality, for as stated before, the benefits of Arrow in the Smokies can not help but be international, BETTY CARTER Tutoring Center WISCONSIN BETA The women of Wisconsin Beta are deeply interested in the work of our national philanthropies, especially Arrow in the Smokies. The employment which it offers to the needy people of the area undoubtedly raises their living standard and allows them the chance to enjoy a better life. However, our chapter is especially interested in the continual development of our native crafts which is fostered through the Arroweraft workshop and the new Arts and Crafts Center. It gives us all a genuine feeling of satisfaction to know that we are helping to keep a part of our American heritage alive, not only in Tennessee, but throughout the country. We realize that in our times of unrest and turbulence, our national philanthropy is working toward establishing good will throughout the world when the many foreign students who come to study return home with their new skills. Our chapter is now able to devote most of its time to our national philanthropy because we have already raised the necessary funds and achieved our goal for our local philanthropy, the Beloit Tutoring Center in Mississippi. This tutoring center has been greatly successful in the past few years in its work with the student classified as a "low achiever." And so our work goes on as we prepare for our Christmas bazaar to be held early in December to raise funds for our own Settlement School. We will be selling various types of handywork which we are now in the process of making. We happily continue this work in the true spirit of Pi Beta Phi. BETSY BLANEY What Does the Future Hold? MANITOBA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi became, with the initiation of the Settlement School at Gatlinburg, the first fraternity to have a national philanthropy; the first fraternity to show the world that they were a service instititution, not just a social club. In those early days, all that the Pi Phi's envisioned was a country school, bringing education where there had been none before, in honor of those twelve aspiring young women, so keenly interested in education them-selves, who had formed our Pi Phi. Our reality, in 1967 has grown far beyond their wildest dreams. Where there was no school, Pi Phi built a school; and staffed it, and, over the years, developed it into the university accredited institution it is today. Where there was no doctor, or even nurse, to care for the sick, aged and young children, Pi Phi brought in their own nurses, and doctors, and taught basic hygiene in 72 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the school; now there is a clinic and doctor in the town. When Pi Phi came to Gatlinburg, the hill people were poor, barely ekeing out an existence on their land. Pi Phi has taught these hill people crafts, and bought them the needed equipment; now there is thriving home industry, which Pi Phi supports in its Arrowcraft shops. Much indeed has been accomplished in the past fifty years at Gatlinburg. So who can say what the future holds for the Arrow in the Smokies? There is much that can still become, and more that we cannot envision today, but that will be accomplished. There is always a need for education, and always an opportunity for service. The future of Pi Phi holds far more than its past, at Gatlinburg in the Smokies. BARBARA EDMONDS Key to Pi Phi Future SOUTH DAKOTA ALPHA A century ago when the twelve founders of Pi Beta Phi met to organize a women's fraternity for the purpose of enhancing the nobility of womanhood, they faced the problem of proving what positive goal such an organization could accomplish. Today the same problem still exists for twentieth-century fraternity women. In comparison to the immensity of world conflicts, the acquiring of social graces and the finding of strength in the bonds of personal friendships cannot alone justify the existence of women's fraternal, groups. At a recent officers' retreat members of South Dakota Alpha heard their university's Coordinator of Student Affairs challenge them to ACT instead of REACT. Too often sororities and fraternities concentrate their efforts in rebelling against and attempting to reject the college regulations placed upon them. Truly this shows that they care and are alive, but why must every action be only a response? Pi Beta Phi's philanthropic project, Arrow in the Smokies, holds the key to the future of our college fraternity. Expanding the summer craft workshop is a definite step Pi Beta Phi can take forward showing to the public that we are not organized for the sole purpose of our personal advancement in the social aspects of life. It is pertinent for South Dakota A and all other chapters to recognize the new centennial plans for Arrow in the Smokies and show to the public that this too is the purpose of our fraternity. And thus, while doing this, we will be acting and advancing the welfare of others as well as ourselves. CINDY CIMPL Enthusiasm Spreads Rapidly MINNESOTA ALPHA At Minnesota Alpha, we had a change in feeling recently toward the Settlement School. That change is due mainly to three things. First, one of our members visited Gatlinburg last summer while on vacation and her stories about it have made it come alive for us. Secondly, our two delegates to Convention brought back an enthusiasm for Settlement School which is rapidly spreading to the whole chapter. Third, and, we feel, most important, is the new name which has been given to the project, Arrow in the Smokies. This name means more to us than the words "philanthropy" or "Settlement School." The word "Arrow" alone brings to mind the chain of friendship which exists coast to coast and generation to generation in Pi Beta Phi. It brings to mind the love and devotion we feel toward one another .and toward all that is good and true. It reminds us that we in Pi Beta Phi are striving for the highest ideals. Then, the joining of the word "Arrow" with the site of our philanthropy, the "Smokies," joins all these feelings to the Settlement School. It sets the tone for the spirit of Settlement School. Now that this spirit has become more apparent to us, it has become apparent also that it is our job to maintain and spread the spirit. To do this, we, first of all, made Settlement School a much larger part of Fall Rush Information Day. We told its story in more de-tail and displayed many of the craft. Throughout, we tried to convey the spirit of giving which started Settlement School and which keeps it growing year after year. Secondly, we have made it a point to leave the Arrowcraft catalog in the living room where waiting guests will pick it up. And we have coached all our members so that they can answer any questions the guests might ask about Gatlinburg and the School, or about the Arrowcraft Worshop and the ordering of the articles made there. Finally, we plan to add, to our annual Settlement School information program, the personal reactions of our active who visited Gatlinburg last summer and of a former active who spent a whole summer there. With these new ideas and spurred on by our new feelings about Arrow in the Smokies, we hope at Minnesota Alpha to make Settlement School known and loved, and therefore supported, by an ever-increasing number of people. J. MARCHE L Emphasis During Rush MISSOURI GAMMA Missouri Gamma puts emphasis on our national philanthropy project during rush. Because we think it is a unique idea and binds us in further sisterhood, we want to help bring success to Arrow in the Smokies. Rather than taking a chance in having some rushees miss our story by leaving discussion up to the individual rushers, we have our philanthropies chairman give a small talk on this subject to the entire group. She has a display of articles made at the Arrowcraft Shop set up and is ready to answer questions. We feel that the best way to show our interest to the public is through enthusiasm in our attitudes. We support the Settlement School as our chapter philanthropy and throughout the year we sponsor money-making projects to provide funds. Our annual mum sale at Homecoming is a major activity. We have great success with this project and are able to expand it as each year passes. Another project is the Rummage Sale we have for the public. A location in the city is sought that will provide us with the maximum expo-sure to the public. Each girl is responsible for a prearranged number of articles and rarely do we have much left after a two day sale. We also have some type of candy sale on campus, and we hope to have an apple sale later in the year. Each year we try to THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 73 have some other type of fund raising project in addition to our annual activities. Also, members are encouraged to order articles from the Settlement School through our chairman. Last year a senior, Sahanny Johnson, received the California Alpha Scholarship. We are proud to be taking active participation in support of Arrow in the Smokies. Each year we hope to build this participation and in this way push Arrow in the Smokies to great success. DEBBIE NELSON Inevitable Growth Seen ARKANSAS ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies definitely has a future, and as more than a dream in the minds of Pi Phis everywhere. With 111 active chapters and 339 alum clubs working in every state and in Canada, the entire settlement school project is bound to grow. At Arkansas Alpha, we work to promote the larger philanthropic project of Arrow in the Smokies and at the same time we are active on local projects. We have the Arrowcraft sale every year. Before the sale, we contact the alums and neighbors and faculty members, to let them know when we will have the display. By having the sale, we bring the entire Arrow in the Smokies project to the citizens of Fayetteville. The profits from the sale go back to the project. Recently our chapter joined the Chamber of Commerce and by this we hope to acquaint the Fayetteville community more with Pi Phi as a locally and nationally active fraternity. On a local level we carry on several philanthropic projects. This year we have adopted a young American Indian girl. We send money for her schooling and some of her needs and write to her often. Last year we were awarded a trophy from the Community Chest for giving the greatest contribution to their drive of all organizations on campus. We also have a Christmas party each year for underprivileged children in the community. JO ANN PRYOR Hope for the Future MISSISSIPPI ALPHA Arrow in the Smokies means hope, love, responsibility, opportunity, pride, and yield to Mississippi Alpha Pi Phis as well as Pi Phis throughout the nation. In 1912 with the organization of the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, the dream of almost half a century was realized, and each bounding step brought hope for the future to Pi Beta Phi and to those who come there to learn and work. Love, ever-present in Pi Beta Phi, found a special outlet in this national philanthropy as Pi Phis help others help themselves. Responsibility and opportunity were basic building blocks for the Settlement School. But of these pride and yield are the most important for they are interchangeable each producing the other, creating a never-ending, every-increasing cycle. At the turn of a century of happiness and growth, Pi Beta Phi adopts a centennial project which will follow in the footsteps of the Settlement School and the Arrowcraft Shop. Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the Summer Craft Workshop and will act in a more wide-ranged capacity to better meet the demands of a growing country and fraternity. Arrow in the Smokies has been made possible through planning and hard work, and with the continued support of every Pi Phi it cannot fail. EDDIE WELFORD Meeting Leisure's Challenge IOWA GAMMA Pi Beta Phi's Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is an expansion of the Craft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tenn., which is co-sponsored by the Fraternity and the University of Tennessee. The Craft Workshop offers a broad curriculum in the Arts and Crafts, and the courses offer college credit for graduate and undergraduate work. Today there is an increased amount of leisure time offered to our citizens due to automation and the specialized times. When this leisure time is added to the need in our society for individual creativity, the logical solution is a greater emphasis on arts and crafts. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, the opportunity for creative self-expression will be given. To further the growth of our philanthropy and help Arrow in the Smokies to become a reality, each chapter member must take an active interest in the project and help to raise money for its support. One way to do this is to hold Arrowcraft sales, which would acquaint our members with the quality and variety of articles made. If Arrow in the Smokies becomes a reality, it will enable individuals to develop their talents, the handicapped to become a little more independent, and older citizens to feel more worthwhile. An old Hindu Maxim sums up the responsibilities of each one of us. "He does not live in vain, who employs his wealth, his thought, his speech to advance the good of others." VICKI VOELKER Action Key to Success! IOWA ZETA Pi Beta Phi has always been concerned with helping others to help themselves, this is evident in the organization of Chapters and Clubs. This concern has been extended to people outside the membership of Pi Beta Phi through the program of the first philanthropy supported by a fraternity the Settlement School. In keeping with this idea Pi Beta Phi's Centennial project is a Craft Workshop in co-operation with the University of Tennessee to be built in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on the Settlement School property. It will be an extension of the Summer Craft Workshop, which has been sponsored by the fraternity since 1945. As members of Iowa Zeta, we are proud to give our support in such an outstanding project. We know that creative arts have been found to be most beneficial to everyone's life. Not only can we go to the school for our own enjoyment, but also our Alumnae Clubs can send a therapist to learn the crafts and then have him or her return to our own communities to help teach these crafts to the mentally and physically handicapped, those in correctional institutions, or the Se74 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nior Citizens, so that they may lead happier and more useful lives. The possibilities for helping people all over the world not just in one small locality is unlimited. Many crafts are mentioned in the Bible. Creative crafts develop skill, provide an outlet for self-expression, increase sensitiveness as to surrounding giving dignity to common things, bring the handicapped into better adjustment, and are .a delight to the adventuresome. Iowa Zeta realizes that we must look at the coming of the new. All aspects of the conditions under which man lives have changed and continue to change with accelerating speed. We must look at what we have been doing and what we thought we ought to be doing. Action is the key to success. This is only possible with the loyalty of thousands of Pi Beta Phis. As members of Iowa Zeta, we pledge our loyal support and are proud that we can contribute to such an excellent project. To know that we are helping other people as well as our members, sparks a feeling of pride and it is a pleasure to say that we belong to such a wonderful organization as Pi Beta Phi. ANN MONTGOMERY Improved Publicity Planned NEBRASKA BETA Nebraska Beta has started an interesting new local philanthropic project this year by offering its services to the Nebraska State Hospital. Five members a week, consisting of three actives and two pledges, work as volunteers in the hospital lounge or canteen. In this manner they are able to serve as cashiers, waitresses, and fountain girls and at the same time build positive relationships with the patients. In addition to our new local philanthropic project Nebraska Beta is planning to hold its annual Settlement School sale. Posters, announcements, and news-paper coverage will aid in publicizing the sale, which will be open to the entire campus. It is hoped that profits from this sale and magazine sales will help establish support for another Nebraska Beta project one aimed at making the benefit of Arrow in the Smokies known to more than just Pi Phis. With help from local newspapers and campus newspapers a brief description of the aims of Arrow in the Smokies will be presented. Members of the Lincoln Weaving Club and other local craft clubs will be encouraged to con-tact our chapter for information about sponsorship to Tennessee in the form of a loan or scholarship. Public relations will be improved and Pi Phi's achievements and opportunities will be made available to many out-side of our chapter. Nebraska Beta feels that the greatest way it can make Arrow in the Smokies meaningful is by sponsoring a member who can benefit from the experience . . . a member outside of our own chapter. KITTY MCMANUS Success Through Support KANSAS BETA Pi Beta Phi was founded by twelve girls at Monmouth College in 1867. Since that time its membership has grown enormously and has spread to college campuses throughout the United States and Canada. Similarly Arrow in the Smokies should grow and grow. It will do so 'because the same enthusiastic spirit and love for Pi Phi will be behind it. There are already signs of this "success through support." The idea of a centennial project was first realized at the 1954 Convention. Since that time interest has been great. Last year over one hundred thou-sand dollars was contributed to "Arrow in the Smokies !" As time goes on and Pi Phi's continue to be generous with this, their outstanding philanthropic project, Gatlinburg, Tennessee should be a huge center of activity. Numerous buildings will be gradually constructed for art and craft classes until it will be a complete center. Then this Craft Center will be of tremendous benefit to its teachers and students, as well as artists everywhere. Preserving the native arts and crafts of our country, it should become a well-known and respected cultural project. Even more important, as "Arrow in the Smokies" grows, so will the reputation of Pi Beta Phi. Through its outstanding achievements and its numerous philanthropic projects from the time of its founding, Pi Phi has already demonstrated to others its high standards and principles. Now, because of this wonderful Centennial Project, the name "Pi Beta Phi" could become synonomous with "service." And as this spirit of Pi Phi, which began in 1867, continues to grow, so will the 1967 Centennial Project "Arrow in the Smokies." MARSHA GARRETT Serving Mankind OKLAHOMA ALPHA What are the purposes of a Pi Beta Phi philanthropic project in the Smokies? This is a question that we at Oklahoma Alpha are asking and have attempted to answer. The necessity of vocational training is one answer to the need for the Pi Phi service project. Vocational training can bring industries to the area, provide jobs and give the skilled worker a sense of accomplishment. The type of craftmanship learned from the project is another answer to our question. Not only can skilled industrial techniques be taught, but skills in the crafting of handmade articles. If the handcrafting skills of the people of the Smokies can be preserved, Pi Phi can preserve the past for the future. Not only will the lives of the people of the Smokies be enriched but the lives of everyone who views their craftmanship. If we, as part of the Greek system can reach beyond our realm of membership and aid others, we have served not only ourselves but mankind. By providing service outside our membership, this project can not only answer our goal of service but can be-come our theme for the next hundred years of fraternity growth. NANCY BREEDEN Fund-raising Projects Unlimited! OKLAHOMA BETA Members of Pi Beta Phi, have always tried to be of service to the people around us and to people in need. A momentous step was taken THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 75 when in 1910, we began laying the plans for our Arrowcraft Workshop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. From this time, much progress has been made and we here at Oklahoma Beta are proud of our fraternities lead in the area of philanthropy. The Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, is another significant step for our fraternity. It is one of the best ways in which the art of hand made crafts and skills can be perpetuated. Our chapter feels that there are many possibilities for the Arrow in the Smokies. With the increased amount of leisure time of our society and the growing number of people over sixty-five, there is a need to find a creative and constructive outlet for our human energies. The Arrow in the Smokies 'can provide this outlet by giving many a place to come and learn while perpetuating the art of crafts. There is also the possibility of the Arrow in the Smokies as a training ground for instructors who could help with the rehabilitation of those people in our nation who need the therapy of learning an enjoy-able, constructive, and physically beneficial skill. It is with these possibilities and others that we see the potential which lies in the creation of this new philanthropy. In our own chapter we try to publicize our philanthropy through our annual Arrowcraft Sale. As a chapter, we also sponsor an annual Easter Egg hunt for the Underprivileged children in town. In the past we have also provided food for a needy family at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The variety of possible fund-raising projects for the support of our Centennial Project seems to be unlimited. There is always the possibility of collecting all the loose personal items which are left in the lounge and then selling them back to the members at a small fee. The old stand by of a rummage sale has always been a profitable project for our chapter. These are some of the ideas that our chapter has concerning our new Centennial Project and it is with great hope and much expectation that we look for-ward to seeing what the future will hold for Pi Beta Phi and her philanthropy work. A New Dream TEXAS ALPHA In 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee was established as a memorial to the founders of our fraternity. Now fifty-five years later that dream has become a reality and in this our centennial year we have a new dream. Our Centennial Project, Arrow in the Smokies, will be our major philanthropy as we start in this our second century as a Fraternity. Texas Alpha is very enthusiastic and interested in the growth and development of our newest project, Arrow in the Smokies. As the summer craft workshop is being expanded into larger sessions and more courses of study, many of our members feel that their education would be greatly enriched if they studied at the craft workshop. Especially promising to the members of Texas Alpha will be the instructions given in therapy, teaching, and in doing volunteer work. We are always interested in learning new hobbies and crafts aid many of our members are planning to spend their summers at the Settlement School learning more about these things. Pi Beta Phi and Texas Alpha will be looking for-ward to our new philanthropy. We hope that every chapter and alum club will do their part in helping to make our next hundred years as profitable and re-warding as our past hundred years has been. LYN ARNOT Importance Realized TEXAS BETA The national philanthropic project of Pi Beta Phi which was once a dream to a few, is now a reality of which every Pi Phi can, and should be proud. Gatlinburg once only a village of isolated people has now become a productive community. The Texas Beta Pi Phis are proud to assist in this national project through annual contributions. We also have several local philanthropic projects. A number of our girls tutor in connection with a YMCA program. We also take part in "Rag Mop", through which we collect clothes for Goodwill Industries. Each year we participate in a campus-wide project in connection with Greek Week. This year we cleaned up a YMCA camp. We now sponsor two foreign orphans, sending them clothes, food, and special gifts on holidays. Each Christmas we have a party for a group of orphans, complete with our own female version of Santa Claus. We of Texas Beta realize the importance of philanthropic projects. We feel that through helping others, we, ourselves, become better people. Our thoughts can be expressed by a comment made to a Pi Phi alum by a local resident of Gatlinburg, "You Pi Phis really are angels." Active Alumnce Cooperation NEW MEXICO ALPHA At present New Mexico Alpha is involved in a magazine selling campaign to raise money for the Settlement School Fund. Each girl in the chapter will be required to sell two magazines. It was decided that this was not too much to ask. Part of this money will be used to support the Arrow in the Smokies and we feel that this will be a step in the right direction for helping it become a reality. Our active chapter does not have a local philanthropy, although our alums do. They help support Casa Angelica, a home for retarded children in Albuquerque. Last year through a home designer show they earned enough money to purchase a station wagon for the home. We helped the Alums in providing a free babysitting service for the mothers who came to see the show. Each semester our chapter gives the Mary Lovelace scholarship to a deserving active. This scholarship pays for the active's dues for the semester for which she earned it. Doug Munson was the recipient of the scholarship for this semester. A Broader Dream UTAH ALPHA In March 1912, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in the Great Smokey Mountains, was opened to thirteen eager, young students, only two short years after it was decided at convention that an educational project should be established in memory of our founders. At first the Settlement School, the first national phi76 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI lanthropy of its kind, provided an education to the mountain people through home teaching, but soon land was secured on which to build a school house, in spite of the reluctancy of the townspeople. Through the years, the once small community has expanded into a large town which now draws about five million tourists a year. At the present time the town consists of the Arrowcraft Workshop, a health center, a school house, the Loom House, and a dormatory, the Red Bard, to accommodate some of the students. Every year, hundreds of children and adults come to Gatlinburg from all parts of the country to learn all the crafts taught there. It is by these people that all the jewelry, wood craft and loom work available through every Pi Beta Phi chapter is made. All proceeds from the sale of these things goes back to the Settlement School for improvements and expansion. Every Pi Phi chapter in the United States and Canada supports our Settlement School and through each individual chapter's philanthropies program, we are able to promote improvement of the school both through the sale of the Craft Shop products and their money-making projects directed toward raising money to donate to the school. In Utah Alpha we have had a great deal of support of the Settlement School through the sale of the crafts. It is pleasing to know that people not even associated with Pi Phi call to inquire about the merchandise and the school that they've heard about from friends. Thus it is evident that the fame of the Settlement School has spread all over the country and through this continuing expansion and rise in sup-porters, the dream of a bigger, better and more adequate Settlement School will soon be a reality. KIM KOLLER "King" Crowned for Settlement School MONTANA ALPHA In the summer of 1966 two of our members, Marilyn Fitzgerald and Judi O'Donnell, had the privilege and opportunity to visit the Arrow in the Smokies. They had of course studied about Pi Beta Phi's outstanding philanthropy but both agreed they were not prepared for the large, modern school which greeted them. Several people told them how thankful and indebted they are to Pi Phi and what a wonderful project we have. One man in particular told them that his son was to graduate the following year because of assistance the Pi Phis had given him. The girls strongly urge all Pi Phis to take any opportunity they have to visit our Arrow in the Smokies. "Every member of Pi Beta Phi can be proud of this project because we are looking beyond our needs to those of others. We are not only helping others, we are preserving a beautiful art for the benefit of all. Because Montana Alpha feels that this national philanthropy is so important we do not sponsor any particular local philanthropy. Each year we hold a contest for the `King of the Hill' in which one member of each fraternity is nominated by his fraternity for this honor. These men are invited to the house several times and are asked to present some form of entertainment for us. The members of our house then vote for one of the men and on a Saturday night we hold a campus-wide `Derby Dance' to crown the winning`King of the Hill.' The other candidates are then our `Brothers of the Arrow.' The proceeds from the dance are sent to the Arrow in the Smokies as our donation. We are very proud that last year Montana Alpha donated the largest contribution. We feel that a project such as ours would be a good method for any chapter to use to promote our national philanthropy. CAROLE POFFENBERGER The Realm of "Others" WASHINGTON ALPHA Our philanthropic project in the Smokey Mountains area is the fulfillment of ,a desire embedded deep in every Pi Phi heart. College life is full of the everyday hustle and bustle of schoolwork, campus activities, dates, and friends. Our philanthropic project adds a meaningful dimension to a college career: We project ourselves beyond the realm of "self'' to the realm of "others." Because we feel that Gatlinburg is one of the primary responsibilities of our House, the Pi Phi's at Washington Alpha display the material crafts as well as the spiritual ideals of this once backward area during our September Rush. We want these prospective pledges to see the deeper meaning behind Pi Beta Phi. Each Fall, we are reminded of the significance of the Smokey Mountains project. Hundreds of people in Gatlinburg are being educated through the nationwide effort of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity; they are learning a livelihood in handicrafts; they are gaining self-respect. How do we at Washington Alpha Chapter help the Smokey Mountains project: In the Fall our House sponsors a sale of the handicrafts produced by the craftsmen of Gatlinburg. This sale provides a market for the crafts; it is open to anyone. All the girls in the house enjoy setting up the display, especially when the products are so varied. Anything from brooms to mugs to jewelry to stationery can be found at the sale. It's always fun to give the buyers a little background on our project and what it means to us. This not only makes the crafts more meaningful, but helps us to take an active part in this altruistic project! We at Washington Alpha are anxious to do our part in helping to promote the success of the people at Gatlinburg. The progress shown to date is certainly an inspiration to us all. PAM WAGNER The Warm Feeling of Giving WASHINGTON BETA The Washington Beta chapter feels that the Arrow in the Smokies is an ex-tension of the present opportunity for Pi Phi's to give of their service, time and money. We are planning to have a Settlement School program to inform members of the project and the potentials and opportunities which it opens to us. After enthusiasm is raised, a fund-raising project will follow. This project, Penny a Pound for Pi Phi (an idea from Wisconsin Beta) will tax each girl a penny for each pound of her weight. The pennies will be pasted on a poster board in the shape of a huge piggy bank for display. We feel that with adequate support this project will develop into a vital institution. It will, enrich the lives of those who take advantage of its facilities, learn a trade and become productive citizens; as well THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 77 as the lives of those who benefit from the usefullness of the products. In the age of mechanization, the Arrow in the Smokies will play its part in preserving creativity and personal pride in an object, as contrasted to the impersonal qualities of a machine-made product. . The members of Washington Beta are very proud of the philanthropies project, not only because working together towards a common goal brings unity to Pi Phi's everywhere, but also because of the personal opportunities, creative and technical, which it brings to so many. This project enables everyone to experience the warm feeling of giving. AMY RADEWAN A Worthwhile Program OREGON ALPHA Oregon Alpha of Pi Beta Phi feels that the Centennial Project: "Arrow In The Smokies" is a new and exciting addition. The Summer Craft Workshop has proved itself to be beneficial and rewarding to everyone involved, and with the expansion of more workshops, more and more people will be reached. The Craft Workshops, are beneficial in many ways. The inhabitants of the Gatlinburg area are able to gain a living because of the tourist trade drawn there, the instructors and the assistants of the Summer Craft Workshops are earning a living besides fullfilling their own aesthetic needs. The students are learning the crafts taught in order that they might re-turn to their homes and teach others. This is a never ending circle because ell those taught will continue to expand and teach others. We feel that it is an honor that Pi Beta Phi is in co-operation with the University of Tennessee in such a worthwhile program. Oregon Alpha is planning on having a skit-dinner to inform the chapter members of the Arrow in the Smokies Program. For our fund raising project we would like to have an Arrowcraft Shop Sale before the Christmas holidays. We feel the citizens of Eugene and the University of Oregon Student Body would be very interested in our crafts, and this would spread knowledge of our Centennial project, besides helping to raise our funds. Oregon Alpha's main philanthropic project is helping teach in the Handicapped Children's Swimming Program. Pi Phi, Marsha Almeter, is in charge of the program. NANCY ELMGREN A Conscious Endeavor OREGON BETA The members of Oregon Beta are very proud to be a part of Pi Beta Phi's new philanthropy project, Arrow in the Smokies. Pi Beta Phi must grow to meet the needs of it's members and nation alike. We must continue to broaden our horizons and since we are founded as a scholastic organization in what way could we better serve than by supplying an opportunity for education. Thoreau said: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeaver. Our conscious endeavor for this next one hundred years is Arrow in the Smokies. Through education we will preserve and extend our national heritage. Thus we are building a brighter future from the past. We are expanding to fill present and fu'ture needs and by doing this we will continue to grow as an organization of college women. We must not forget our heritage; we must preserve it. Oregon Beta feels that Arrow in the Smokies will help to preserve this heritage as it helps to educate our people and by helping to preserve our past will help to build a stronger and more united future. We can only wait to see what light our flame has cast by the end of this, our second, century.. Our hope is that it will continue to grow in brightness as it has during our past century. Services Extended IDAHO ALPHA Pi Beta Phi .can truly be proud of its nationally renowned philanthropic establishment, Arrow in ,the Smokies. Due to the dedication and loyalty of many individual Pi Phi alums and the support of many active chapters, and ,alum clubs, this project has grown since its establishment in 1910, by the Settlement School committee, to a greatly enlarged and expanded program partly affiliated with the University of Tennessee and making meaningful and productive the lives of many previously poor and backward people. This year, along with Pi Beta Phi's Centennial celebration, a great program is being put .into effect to expand and build this philanthropic project so that more of its services can be extended to make an even greater contribution. Idaho Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi would, like to greatly congratulate the leaders in this program and offer a Centennial wish that the Arrow in the Smokies may grow and expand in Gatlinburg, and perhaps in the future, even in. other locations where the need is great. Through our philanthropic project, all Pi Phis can make a significant contribution to the realization of Pi Phi ideals. In the area of public relations, Idaho Alpha Chap-ter of Pi. Beta Phi has contributed to the Fund for the Performing Arts Center here at the University of Idaho, a 6-million-dollar project, and also to the Cam-pus Chest Fund. CHERYL KOCH "Bigger and Better" CALIFORNIA GAMMA California Gamma, like all Pi Phi Chapters, has always been especially proud of our heritage as the pioneer in women's fraternities. As a non-profit organization we have always been proud to point out our high scholastic standards and social activities but, today, we are even prouder of the philanthropic projects that our sorority has developed. Now as Pi Beta Phi starts its second century our Chapter feels that our new philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies, will be "bigger and better" yet. Because we do live across the, country it is SOMetimes difficult for us to really see the good that is being accomplished by these projects. We support them 'but we do not really know that much about 78 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI them. To remedy this we are currently planning a program for early November which will not only tell about our philanthropies, but which will, we hope, show another reason why we can be so proud to be Pi Phis. But the idea is not just to learn about and to support morally our philanthropies. We could all talk for hours about how proud we are of what we are doing and what a great project Arrow in the Smokies is but that will not make it a success. As Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice President of Philanthropies said in the September 1967 ARROW the important word for this and all other philanthropies is "yield". Our chapter realizes this and consequently we are also going to try to initiate plans for more publicity and for some fund-raising projects that will show our sup-port. California Gamma feels that the key to the success of this Centennial Project and to Pi Beta Phi's second century lies in the contributions of each and every Chapter. CHRISTI HUGGINS Symbol of Pride CALIFORNIA DELTA The year 1967 marked for Pi Beta Phi one hundred years of sisterhood through fraternity life. Yet only half a century ago that sister-hood became truly meaningful with the establishment of the national philanthropy. The Settlement School has become a symbol of pride. Not yet a member, a pledge wonders what Pi Phi represents. She questions what the purpose of Pi Phi is and what it means to national, the members, and finally to herself. She discovers the true significance of Pi Phi when she learns about the Settlement School. The school synibolizes Pi Phi's higher values and goals. The educational centers and workshops of Gatlin-burg endure and expand with the devotion and interest of actives across the nation. Donations from each chapter and alumni continually pour into the school as a genuine expression of support for the work and progress made by the philanthropy. Future expansion made possible by the donations will focus on the pro-motion of education for all types of people. Students, teachers, doctors, industrial technicians, and even re-tired persons will benefit from the classes offered. The Settlement School of Gatlinburg symbolizes the ideals of its founders and its donors and is truly something of value. LINDA DAVIS Native Crafts Kept Alive! CALIFORNIA EPSILON--Pi Beta Phi's Arrow ex-tends across the entire nation. When each Pi Phi thinks of service, her thoughts are pointed upward to that special place high in the Smokies. Here we find the starting point for the first sorority to establish their philanthropy. Pi Beta Phi felt this such a worthy endeavor it has been maintained ,all through the years. Being the oldest fraternity for women, Pi Phi's felt the need to keep alive one of the oldest and true American art cultures. Industrialism is rapidly causing the extinction of true handicrafts, but Arrow in the Smokies providesthe opportunity for these people to keep their native craft still alive. Besides the mere craft aspect, employment is created along with the recreational aspect of the school. For those people merely interested in learning a craft, the opportunity is constantly provided for them. Because university credit is given, it allows those seeking a profession in art to continue their work. The future of the Arrow in the Smokies is tremendous. Expansion of this foundation cannot help but grow because of the support it has received and will continue to receive. The second hundred years will prove to be as successful as the first hundred because Arrow in the Smokies keeps alive for future generations the artistic heritage of that area of the United States. SUSAN DRISCOLL Tremendous Job Ahead NEVADA ALPHA Pi Beta Phi can be more than hopeful about its philanthropy, Arrow in the Smokies. This dream of building an Arts and Crafts addition to the University of Tennessee will become a reality, just as the Settlement School has. Through the financial and moral assistance of every Pi Phi, the Settlement School has grown to be one of the largest crafts' centers of the United States. If we look at the past success of our Settlement School, we cannot fail in our hope for the future, Arrow in the Smokies. As hopeful as we are, we must realize that the construction of such a project is a tremendous job which will need the support of every member. The Pi Phis at Nevada Alpha Chapter are organizing two projects to raise funds for Arrow in the Smokies. We plan to have a Sandwich Sale and a Spaghetti Feed. Our advertisements for both these functions will explain Arrow in the Smokies, and the importance of this philanthropy should aid our success. The Sandwich Sale will consist of selling Poor Boy sandwiches to campus residents on two Sundays. The Spaghetti Feed will also be on a Sunday, because the campus cafeteria only serves brunch on Sundays. We will have the dinner on or near the University, pre-pare it ourselves, and only charge a dollar for tickets sold in advance. We hope to receive a good profit which we will donate to Arrow in the Smokies. If every Pi Phi Chapter can do something similar, Arrow in the Smokies will be transformed from a dream into a reality. STEPHANIE LORIGAN Art Appreciation Continues! ARIZONA ALPHA The Arizona Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi highly commends the progress and great eagerness toward our new Centennial project of 1966 through 1967. We are very enthusiastic to increase aid to the underprivileged people in the Gatlinburg area. By enlarging the Summer Craft Workshop, we may be able, not only to help these poverty-stricken mountain people, but also to increase the knowledge of dying traditional crafts such as stitchery and weaving that have been so much a part of the early pio (Continued on page 87) i Beta Phi Pledges These young ladies pledged Pi Beta Phi chapters at colleges and universities with a fall rush or open rush in the first semester of the 1967-68 school year.
