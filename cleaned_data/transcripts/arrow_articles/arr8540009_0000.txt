Having taken weaving at both sessions of the summer Workshop, she feels she has broadened her knowledge and will be better prepared to work with the 150 girls at the school. She is especially looking forward to instructing them in "double weaving" which will enable them to make dresses completely on the loom without any stitching. The girls usually want to keep some of the things they have woven and are allowed to do so within their allowance. Gladys was recipient of a scholarship given by the Philadelphia-Delco Pi Beta Phi Alumnae Club.

Helen has the following to say about Arrowmont, "Each summer I have attended the Craft Workshop, I have been tremendously impressed with the quality of instruction provided and with the intense concentration which students of all ages bring to their work. It is this force of deep personal involvement, I believe, which has been a special quality of past success and which can also be that necessary quality for the future success of Arrowmont. As a Pi Phi,. it is very satisfying to know from first hand experience that the 100-year memorial to our Founders is building on several well-established fraternity traditions. Among many others, I would mention these: Service to others in a needed and meaningful way; Support regular and generous from chapters and clubs; Good Taste and beauty amid the functional in the facilities planned for our new school; Excellence in the educative process we sponsor as a fraternity; and Flexibility to develop certain aspects of our philanthropy as the needs of the future unfold."
