It was attended with all the interest and excitement that such an occasion brings to any other graduating class. The proof not only of the ambition of the children them-selves, but also of the stimulating effect of their teachers, lies in the fact that the six expect to finish high school and then go to college. Reva Andes, who hopes to take up nursing, will enter Murphy, a North-ern Methodist school in Sevierville. The boys will finish at the Sevier County High School, in the same town. Rex Parton looks ahead to the time when he can devote himself to science. John Carver will go into business, while Leon Clabo will train for aviation. Manfurd Houser and Hugh Watson have not ,yet decided their future careers. 394 THE MAY ARROW PI PHI OYS AT It E I \ EA By DON SMITH To most of the boys who finish the tenth grade at the Settlement School the problem naturally arises, Shall I finish high school and, if so, where shall I go? The matter of funds, as might be expected, is always of primary consideration. No school offers more opportunities for self-help than Berea Academy at Berea, Kentucky. For the past few years quite a number of our boys have turned to this school after leaving Little Pigeon. Among these are Woodrow and Orville Oakley, sons of Wiley Oakley, local guide and lover of nature, who calls himself the Roamin' Man of the Mountains. Woodrow, the older of the two, is interested in woodworking and earns much of his expenses in the Berea furniture shop. Orville is socially inclined and has made quite a bit with, his teaching of the local mountain folk games to the students and faculty at Berea. Recently he was awarded a trip to New York to teach folk games to groups there. Assisted by a Berea pro OOKS FO ss, Most people who like books began to read when they were youngsters, and if the children in the Settlement School are ever going to'learn to love reading, they must have all manner of books in their hands now. Books that fit into class work and are on the level of the children's general reading ability are needed badly. In times past when pleas such as this have been published, Pi Phis have responded generously by sending .books from their own shelves. Because certain types are so much in demand, lists suit-able for different grades are beingfessor, he is writing a book of folk games. Another of the Pi Phi boys is Carl Ogle, who is making a fine record at Berea. He is especially to be admired for he had the misfortune to lose one of his hands several years ago in a hunting accident. In spite of this handicap, he was a star forward on the Pi Phi basketball team and still plays a good game in fast competition. Carl, together with Everett (Shorty) Kirk-land, another Pi Phi graduate, a little fellow who carries quite a bit of Cherokee blood in his -veins, won all major honors in the academy livestock judging contest with more than eighty con, testants. This fall we sent Lavator Cotter, and Muncy Mouser entered since Christmas. We are justly proud of the record our boys are making at Berea, and we appreciate the fact that none of our graduates has ever been refused en-trance when many others have to be turned away. THE SCHOOL printed in order that ARROW readers may know just what is wanted. If every Pi Phi who glances through "News From Little Pigeon" would search through her library and send even one volume from this list to Maryalice Chaffee, Director, in Gatlinburg, scores of children would be benefited.

And I am leaving on the morning of Easter Sunday to go to St. Louis, and follow the trail of the Lewis and Clark Exploring Party up the Missouri River, across the Rockies near the Canadian border, and down the Columbia River to the Coast. All this with a view to a future historical novel. I may say frankly however, that I am not following their trail too closely. They made it by boat, and on foot. I am doing it in a brand new little Ford car my first Ford, and though I have had it one whole week I have not yet even so much as laid a finger to its steering wheel. A good deal of our driving will be on side roads, you see, be-cause we want as nearly as possible to visit all their camp sites, and it seems that in 1804 they didn't have the present motor roads. I am shocked to learn that they didn't even have Kansas City. I can hardly imagine a United States without a Kansas City. It took them three years for the little jaunt. We expect to accomplish it in ten weeks. Incidentally, I expect to visit both Yellowstone and Glacier on the trip but alas, I am afraid I shall not be able to make the dates of the Convention. I will speak a good word for the coming Pi Phis however and if they get there first, perhaps they will speak a good word for me! Cordially and sincerely, ETHEL HUESTON If there ever was an indefatigable author, this is one! Just a little over a year ago, she returned from the Black Hills in South Dakota, where she wrote three books ending with Blithe Bald-win. When she reached New York, she established, in conjunction with some newspaper friends of many years, aweekly paper entitled The Villager devoted to the historic and romantic section of New York represented by the two opposite poles of Manhattan, Washington Square, and Greenwich ETHEL POWELSON HUSTON "Imagine U.S. Without Kansas City" Village, lying right next door to each other. She devoted the entire year to editorial work for the paper and got it off to a good running start. So, on January 1 she retired from active editorial participation to devote her time to a new book. Incidentally, the Hungarian rights to her next-to-last novel, That Hastings Girl, were satisfactorily disposed of though Mrs. Hueston can't understand why anybody in Hungary should want to read a light novel of the Black Hills.

Just a little over a year ago, she returned from the Black Hills in South Dakota, where she wrote three books ending with Blithe Bald-win.

She devoted the entire year to editorial work for the paper and got it off to a good running start. So, on January 1 she retired from active editorial participation to devote her time to a new book. Incidentally, the Hungarian rights to her next-to-last novel, That Hastings Girl, were satisfactorily disposed of though Mrs. Hueston can't understand why anybody in Hungary should want to read a light novel of the Black Hills.

It was attended with all the interest and excitement that such an occasion brings to any other graduating class. The proof not only of the ambition of the children them-selves, but also of the stimulating effect of their teachers, lies in the fact that the six expect to finish high school and then go to college. Reva Andes, who hopes to take up nursing, will enter Murphy, a North-ern Methodist school in Sevierville. The boys will finish at the Sevier County High School, in the same town. Rex Parton looks ahead to the time when he can devote himself to science. John Carver will go into business, while Leon Clabo will train for aviation. Manfurd Houser and Hugh Watson have not ,yet decided their future careers. 394 THE MAY ARROW PI PHI OYS AT It E I \ EA By DON SMITH To most of the boys who finish the tenth grade at the Settlement School the problem naturally arises, Shall I finish high school and, if so, where shall I go? The matter of funds, as might be expected, is always of primary consideration. No school offers more opportunities for self-help than Berea Academy at Berea, Kentucky. For the past few years quite a number of our boys have turned to this school after leaving Little Pigeon. Among these are Woodrow and Orville Oakley, sons of Wiley Oakley, local guide and lover of nature, who calls himself the Roamin' Man of the Mountains. Woodrow, the older of the two, is interested in woodworking and earns much of his expenses in the Berea furniture shop. Orville is socially inclined and has made quite a bit with, his teaching of the local mountain folk games to the students and faculty at Berea. Recently he was awarded a trip to New York to teach folk games to groups there. Assisted by a Berea pro OOKS FO ss, Most people who like books began to read when they were youngsters, and if the children in the Settlement School are ever going to'learn to love reading, they must have all manner of books in their hands now. Books that fit into class work and are on the level of the children's general reading ability are needed badly. In times past when pleas such as this have been published, Pi Phis have responded generously by sending .books from their own shelves. Because certain types are so much in demand, lists suit-able for different grades are beingfessor, he is writing a book of folk games. Another of the Pi Phi boys is Carl Ogle, who is making a fine record at Berea. He is especially to be admired for he had the misfortune to lose one of his hands several years ago in a hunting accident. In spite of this handicap, he was a star forward on the Pi Phi basketball team and still plays a good game in fast competition. Carl, together with Everett (Shorty) Kirk-land, another Pi Phi graduate, a little fellow who carries quite a bit of Cherokee blood in his -veins, won all major honors in the academy livestock judging contest with more than eighty con, testants. This fall we sent Lavator Cotter, and Muncy Mouser entered since Christmas. We are justly proud of the record our boys are making at Berea, and we appreciate the fact that none of our graduates has ever been refused en-trance when many others have to be turned away. THE SCHOOL printed in order that ARROW readers may know just what is wanted. If every Pi Phi who glances through "News From Little Pigeon" would search through her library and send even one volume from this list to Maryalice Chaffee, Director, in Gatlinburg, scores of children would be benefited.

JONEL) Letters from Ethel Hueston, Iowa A, are always bright spots in your editor's mail. Here's one the postman left this morning: I have been working rather too haphazardly on a new novel. And I am leaving on the morning of Easter Sunday to go to St. Louis, and follow the trail of the Lewis and Clark Exploring Party up the Missouri River, across the Rockies near the Canadian border, and down the Columbia River to the Coast. All this with a view to a future historical novel. I may say frankly however, that I am not following their trail too closely. They made it by boat, and on foot. I am doing it in a brand new little Ford car my first Ford, and though I have had it one whole week I have not yet even so much as laid a finger to its steering wheel. A good deal of our driving will be on side roads, you see, be-cause we want as nearly as possible to visit all their camp sites, and it seems that in 1804 they didn't have the present motor roads. I am shocked to learn that they didn't even have Kansas City. I can hardly imagine a United States without a Kansas City. It took them three years for the little jaunt. We expect to accomplish it in ten weeks. Incidentally, I expect to visit both Yellowstone and Glacier on the trip but alas, I am afraid I shall not be able to make the dates of the Convention. I will speak a good word for the coming Pi Phis however and if they get there first, perhaps they will speak a good word for me!
