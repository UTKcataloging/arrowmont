        Settieffl,ent SLOE 1eeport SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE And a star shall lead A far-reaching and momentous decision was made at the 1910 Swarthmore Convention when the alumni and regular sessions overwhelmingly approved to the motion to establish a settlement school in the Appalachian mountains as a "thank you offering to our Founders at the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity." It seems especially fitting that the idea, as presented by Emma Harper Turner, former Grand President, and club delegate, had originated within the Alumnae Club of Washington, D.C. More than any other single city, Washington is the one that symbolizes our faith, concern and affection for our country. So, too, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School has become the symbol of the national character, strength and unity of our fraternity. There is no other bond, excepting our ceremonies and the fact that all Pi Phis are college women, quite so common to all our members. It took two years of committee meetings, correspondence, conferences, study and several trips of investigation to secure just the right location. The general area selected was the most educationally needy in the country, and the specific county selected had the fewest schools, so basically the decision was one of eliminating other places. That was how the fraternity came to the community of Gatlinburg, a tiny hamlet, in a beautiful valley along the Little Pigeon River, and surrounded by the Great Smoky Mountains in southeast Tennessee, The fraternity's star of service to others settled itself in that vicinity, and early in 1912 it began to send out its first rays of light. It is well to remember that Education in the settlement began almost as much by neighborhood endeavor as by that of the fraternity. A brief review of the early days may clarify the unusual arrangement under which the school situation developed over the years. Before the site had been selected, the committee in charge had recommended that the fraternity cooperate with existing public schools, if possible, under arrangements satisfactory to Pi Beta Phi. In choosing a mountain locale, we were dealing with people as individual and rugged as their environment. Isolation had made them extremely reserved with outsiders and they needed to be shown and sold! They were intelligent but suspicious as to why "them wimmen" wanted to start a school, believing at first that we had a hidden religious purpose! After Sevier County had been selected, negotiations were opened with the school board and the people of the Gatlinburg community, but they become so delayed that the committee decided to enter the area independently and conduct all further arrangements from the spot. Thus our first school session was for 3 months following the 4-month school year which was all the county could provide. 14 pupils enrolled for that Pi Phi term and it closed with 33 enrolled. The following fall, the Pi Phi teacher worked jointly with the native teacher, and again the fraternity afterward provided an independent session which started with 40 pupils and ended with 75! All during the year negotiations had been going on, and after seeing the initial success, the school board offered to give a clear absolute deed to the county school property (a 1 room building atop an almost inaccessable hill) and turn over all teacher pay as long as Pi Beta Phi maintained a public and free school in the lower grades. Seeing ahead to more than minimum education and desiring a better location for the settlement, it seemed to the committee in charge that it was more desirable for the fraternity to erect its own more-adequate building and on its own land, thus assuring a freer hand in the thing we had come to do Astutely realiz-ing that if the local residents themselves contributed some-thing to the effort they would better support our efforts, there was much to be worked out mutually. These negotiations dangled along for over a year and were resolved only after the fraternity representatives set a deadline for local action, saying that unless it was forthcoming we would go to another community where inducements would be offered to build a school. Thus, through cooperation, it did come about that Pi Beta Phi was asked to stay, and the property desired for a school site was purchased for $600 from the fraternity and $1200 from the local residents. In return for the deed, Pi Beta Phi promised to maintain a school for at least 10 years, to build a new school house, and to provide good teachers. The promised school building was erected by the fraternity in 1913-14. It had 5 large classrooms, 3 of which could be made into one room for assemblies. After this evidence of good faith, the school board, beginning August 1914, voted to turn over to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the year's appropriation-$375. The 1915 school year closed with an enrollment of 158. This was the beginning; in time pupils were grouped according to grade, and little by little higher grades were added. In addition there was expansion of education to rural schools up the "hollers" and creeks. By 1928 the need for a separate high school was acute and that building was erected nearby. In 1943, the fraternity believed the proper time had come for the county to take back the major operation of the schools in the district, and since that time we have leased for $1 a year the play areas and two school buildings erected by the fraternity. In 1949, we deeded for $1 approximately 2 acres of land on which it built a new building for the primary grades, and later, a combination cafeteria-gymnasium. The grade school built in 1914 by the fraternity for about $3700 is still used for grades 4, 5, and 6. In time, that 46-year old building, as well as the 32-year old high school building, will have to give way to progress and more modern buildings. During 1959-60, 25 full-time and 3 part-time teachers instructed 607 students at "Pi Beta Phi School." The conventional state framework is followed in all grades, while the extra teachers supplied by the fraternity enable the school to receive an A rating. These teachers are in Music, Art and Crafts, and Woodworking. Sharon Dexter, Illinois Zeta, Assistant to the Director, taught two Journalism classes which published the weekly school paper, The Mountain Echo. Sharon resigned in June to be married, and these classes will not be continued in the coming year. Our Health Center is adjacent to the school grounds, and our nurse will continue looking after the students as before. The Grace Coolidge Library is located in the high school building and many books were added during the year by the county, PTA and Pi Beta Phi funds. The room is used regularly as a study hall and a library, enabling ready access to the books there. There is a bronze plaque honoring Mrs. Coolidge on the entrance door to the library, and an autographed picture hangs on one wall of the double room. The light of education has many facets, and for the purposes of this report we shall seek to identify the other individual points of our present-day Settlement School star. The Dormitory Program has an older sheen on its point of our star than is usually realized though the exact date it began to shine has proven illusive. There is evidence that it began gradually as certain needs arose and finally 42 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI these excerpts from the emerged into print full-grown, as February, 1936 History Issue of the ARROW indicate: "An experiment was tried at the School in the fall session of 1919 called the 'Country Home.' The girls brought their supplies from their home, did all their work during the week, and then on Friday afternoon packed up again and returned home. Abbey Runyan of the School staff lived in the home with the girls and supervised their work." "Projects under consideration during (1919) . were . . the making of some provision for older boys to earn their 'schooling' . . ." "In the fall of 1921, Anna Dowell, Iowa Beta , . supervised the work of six girls in the Mary Pollard cottage . . . teaching a course in practical housewifery." "The remodeling of the Stuart and Pollard cottages (1923-4) met the immediate needs, both being used as girls' dormitories. The Committee rented the Higinbotham-Bishop Cottage for a boys' dormitory which served adequately." From these references it seems logical to conclude that the Settlement School dormitories are at least approaching a 40-year background, and that the program has be.en concerned primarily with students of junior and senior high school age. This year 7 boys and 9 girls comp, leted the school term in the dormitories. Full capacity .is 20. Ruth Schantz Spelman, Illinois Epsilon, was again the genial housemother for girls at Stuart, while our Director, Marion Mueller, and Mrs. Adams, our cook at Staff, effectively shared supervision of the boys at Teachers. These girls and boys live too far from school for daily trips even by bus. They pay $5 per month, supplementing that token fee by doing extra chores, such as serving table, helping with meals and dishes, caring for their rooms, feeding chickens, painting, cutting grass, raking leaves, etc. They always have their meals with the resident personnel in the large dining room at staff house. The pro-gram enables the students to participate in after-school activities they otherwise would miss. There is no doubt that this kind of service keeps many boys and girls in school longer than they ever would stay without it. School officials continually praise the dormitory program as a most valuable contribution, and they wish more students could have the same kind of youth supervision. Health is a third point of service on our Settlement School star. The need for basic sanitation, nutrition and disease prevention became evident the first year the school was established, but it was 8 years before a full-time nurse was provided. In the meantime the plea had been heard. In 1914 three of our Founders started a fund with $150 for the establishment of a hospital "in loving memory of Jennie Nicol of Alpha." By 1917 the fund had grown to $900. Then World War I intervened and plans were delayed. Finally in 1920, Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario Alpha, came as the school's first nurse. (She re-visited Gatlinburg this spring and found it hard to recon.-cile the present town with the one she knew 40 years ago.) On May 8, 1922, the long-needed "hospital" was d.edicated. It was the old Andy Ogle house converted, and it still stands today in the heart of our property. (Our maintenance man, Orlie Watson, who has served the Pi Phis faithfully for 34 years, lives there now with his wife. His son, Neal, assists his father and has now served .12.years himself.) To move quickly to the present, Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta-Delta) began her duties in the old building and moved to the new Health Center in 1948. She will start her 25th year as nurse on December 1, 1960. As usual she was nurse-on-call at "Pi Beta Phi" and Glades School, the only remaining rural school in the a.rea. Sh.e gave all kinds of health talks, inoculation, tests, inspections, check-ups and the annual student physical examinations. She continued to hold her Well Baby Clinics each week. She was resident nurse for staff and dormitory 43 students during the year, and for workshop students in the summer. Perhaps her chief joy this year came from the purchase of a needed auto clave (live steam sterilizer). The following statistics indicate how busy our Health Center's ".Miz Charmer" was this year: 517 Office calls .. . 3799 Service given ~- Small pox vaccinations 127 Total typhoid inoculations 338 Completed series and boosters Total triple vaccine 227 ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '' '' ' Completed series and boosters 134 Total Salk vaccine _1011 .

'. ' .. '. ' ' ' ' ' . ' ' ' . . ' ' '. 55 Chest X-Rays uz The Arrountraft Shop is a fourth integral part of the Settlement School's star of service. For 3 5 years (45 years, if we go back to the first basket sold, it has been making a unique contribution to American culture and heritage. By providing a market outlet through our loyal clubs and chapters, beautiful handweaving and other excellent crafts native to the southern highlands have gone into all parts of our country. The art forms and skills necessary for producing these handmade articles could have been lost easily unless preserved by special effort. Pi Beta Phi made that effort and successfully! Through the years, Arrowcraft weavers have been given encouragement and a livelihood. They, in turn, repaid in a loyalty to Arrowcraft which has continued from generation to generation. During this year a total of 77 women wove for Arrowcraft, with an aver-age of 63 working at one time all the year. At the same time 19 women asked for weaving which we were unable to provide. Good design, workmanship and service are well known standards at Arrowcraft. Gene Redding, our able Weaving Designer, will continue in that position, creating the new designs we all look forward to seeing each year. There are 5 local girls working regularly with sales and shipping. Eunice Cole returned July 1 as full-time Booklieeper following the resignation of Emily Cantwell. Elizabeth Waitt Rue, Iowa Gamma and former manager for 5 successful years, took over the nearby Mountain View Hotel shop last spring. The fraternity extends a very warm welcome to Nevada Semenza Christian (Mrs. Sutton), Nevada Alpha, who became Arrowcraft Manager on June 1. Many Pi Phis met and enjoyed her at Convention. She and her staff expect to serve i.A.rrowcraft to the best of their ability in 1960-61. The number of clubs remitting over $1000 to Arrow-craft increased from 17 to 29, indicating that those clubs had unusually large scales. Many other clubs held highly successful sales on a smaller scale and achieved equally well for their size. All deserve praise because such success does not just happen! It takes careful planning and hard work.

It, too, was a pioneer experiment. Sponsored jointly by the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School and the University of Tennessee, 16 years of increasing success have proven its worth on an adult educational level. It is puzzling that so few Pi Phis have attended a summer workshop right on their own Settlement School grounds while so many non-Pi Phis (including Kappas, Thetas, Chi Omegas, etc.) have come and returned again and again. Early each spring a Workshop brochure is sent to each chapter and club, and anyone can write for a personal copy. Perhaps a report of the 1960 Workshop is the place to explain various aspects of the Workshop through questions and answers. Who are the Workshop students? The 1960 students came from 22 sttaes plus 2 from the Philippines, 1 from Sarawak and 1 from Canada. The following list shows their various occupations: Craftsmen Secretary to Dean (law) Enamelist Psychologist, writer Farmer Teachers kgth. through Housewife college Sculpter Teacher city recreation Shopkeeper Teachers special subjects Physician Craft Director aged ladies Ticket Agent Matron Industrial home College students (women) Commercial artist Home Demonstration agents Medical technologists Food and Mkt. specialist Retired social worker What were their ages? Ages ranged from 18 to 80. The 80 year old lady is a Gatlinburg resident who has attended all 16 workshops. Do any men attend? Yes, several come each year, often husbands and wives together. Men are a minority but do not seem to mind! How long is a Work-shop? The full session is 5 weeks; each half-session is 12 class days. Where do students live? In 5 Pi Phi buildings Teachers, Stuart, Pollard, the Red Barn, and Staff House for faculty. There are very few rooms for 1 person, several rooms for 2, 3 and 4, and the Little Pigeon Loft (Red Barn) for 12 younger girls. Students with families some-times prefer to rent a cottage in town, boarding with the group, or not, as preferred. Are there modern baths? Yes, several in each building. What about meals? Meals are served in the large Staff House dining room which can seat up to 75 at one time. Who prepares the food? A trained dietician supervises 4 student cooks from the College of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. What are the costs? For a full session, rooms vary from $30 to $54 depending on arrangements. Board is $96 and tuition is $75. Materials are extra. For 1 session the rates are exactly half. What courses are offered? This year, classes were offered in Design, Survey of Crafts (lecture course), Recreational Crafts, plus Beginning and Advanced Enameling, Jewelery, Pottery and Weaving. How many courses may be taken? From 1 to 3, though 3 is usually too many. Each class is 2 hours daily and outside work is expected to equal classtime. Is college credit available? Yes, through the University of Tennessee. Maximum credit is 9 quarter hours undergraduate or 71/2 hours graduate credit. Where are classes held? In the Pi Beta Phi High School and the Arts and Crafts Building; both are in close walking distance from all dormitories. Are classes limited in size? Yes, first come, first served because of limited facilities. A $10 advance registration fee is required. Where do students work? They may work in their own rooms, at work tables in the lounges of all dormitories, or in the class-rooms at .night or when there are no daytime classes in session. Who directs the Workshop? Marian G. Heard, Professor of Related Arts and Crafts at the University of Tennessee and member of Tennessee Gamma, has been the very capable Director for 14 years. Marion Webb Mueller, our enthusiastic, hard-working Director of the Settlement School, Indiana Gamma, is in charge of finances and local arrangements. Who are the instructors? The 1960 faculty was composed of the following, all of whom have advanced degrees: Jane Glass Craft Designer-producer, Gatlinburg; former college teacher. Linn Phelan Instructor-Craftsman, Almond, New York. Lula Smith Associate Professor Emeritus, University of Iowa. Jean Stange Assistant Professor, Michigan State University. Helen Worrall Art and Crafts Instructor and Cincinnati Art Museum. Rikki Brockway, California Gamma, and Betty Pendergrass, Tennessee Gamma, were 2 of the 4 Graduate Assistants who gave good help to the faculty and students this year. These positions are open to 2 Pi Phi seniors each year, At a Pi Phi party held during Committee meeting, Rikki and Betty expressed the thought that it would be a wonderful experience if 16 Pi Phi actives could meet at the Workshop each summer as winners of club-sponsored province scholarships. For many years, the Southern California Area Council has sent a California Pi Phi active to the Workshop on a scholarship. This is the only club-sponsored Workshop scholarship existing at present. Are clubs in other provinces interested in thinking on this? A star shines brightly only when sufficient energy is available. The Settlement School's source of power has been the annual replenishment given by our clubs and chapters. The 100% provinces in contributions this year are: Clubs (10) Chapters (13) Alpha Iota Alpha Theta Beta Lambda Beta Iota Gamma Xi Gamma Kappa Epsilon Omicron EDveslitlaon Mu Zeta Pi Zeta Nu Xi Eta During the 48 years this Memorial to our Founders has grown and its areas of service' nurtured, it has been a source of pride to Pi Phis that it has been supported from voluntary contributions within our own membership. That principle has been our strength! Active chapters contributed a total of $2,870.60 this year, an increase of $121.44. Alumna clubs contributed a total of $10,998.55, a decrease of $82.36 compared to the previous year. The increased contributions from IS chapters and 83 clubs are greatly appreciated. The majority of clubs and chapters gave the same as last year, .some gifts being quite substantial. The decreases were a real loss to both budget and working morale, and we trust they will be absorbed into a much brighter picture for the next two years as the fraternity prepares for the Settlement School's golden anniversary. It is interesting to note that 5 years ago 9 clubs contributed $150 or more. Of that group 5 have been similarly named each succeeding year: Denver, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and St. Louis. Among chapters, Missouri Beta, Texas Alpha and Texas Gamma have maintained their gifts of $100 or more for 5 years too. This year Lambda province has the highest average per club, and Nu has the highest province average per chapter. Altogether a gratifying new high has been reached for both clubs and chapters.

They provided the "extras" which would be omitted otherwise. Three chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma sent funds to the Health Center for corrective purposes. The local Elks and Lions clubs contributed for children's glasses. Clubs, chapters and individuals sent many miscellaneous things including gifts for a special spot, clothing, baby things, and Christmas gifts for distribution to the children at Pi Phi and Glades Schools. Over 35 clubs and individuals sent TV or SH stamps and these were welcomed for needed furnishings and replacements. Please continue to send them to the Director. Through the personal efforts of club and chapter Magazine Chairmen, the year's commission check from the Magazine Agency was for a new high of $10,779.28, an increase of $718.87. This is an amazing example of what the combined efforts of clubs and chapters can accomplish at no cost to a treasury ! Many Pi Phis do not know that the idea of a magazine agency is older than the Settlement School itself. On December 10, 1910, a meeting of the sub-committee of the National Alumna Settlement School Committee was held at Lansdowne, Pa. The following sentence is found in the minutes of that meeting: "The committee approved also the establishment of a magazine subscription agency for the benefit of the Settlement Fund." Bit by bit the importance of magazine commissions in Settlement School support has increased. Among chapters these commissions already surpass contributions by a considerable margin, and among clubs they are approaching equal status. The clubs and chapters of Nu, Pi and Lambda provinces made outstanding commissions last year but it took the combined work of all our Magazine Chairmen, working quietly, carefully and tirelessly throughout the year, to attain this thought-provoking total. If every Pi Phi would remember our Magazine Agency for every home, office or gift subscription within her own orbit of influence, the opportunities for expanding this way of contributing to the Settlement School are almost limitless. The May L. Keller Award for 1959-60 was presented to Patricia Meyer, West Virginia Alpha. Due to their in-formative and skillfully presented skits for Convention this year, special honorable mention goes to Arkansas Alpha, Alabama Beta, Indiana Alpha and Missouri Beta. One suspects that the girls from those chapters will long re-member the "odd" hours of the day or night when they held their rehearsals! Those at Hot Springs were spell-bound as they listened to Dr. Keller tell of her first visit to Gatlinburg and to Miss Onken as she told of the fine local support given to the Settlement School by the Gatlin-burg people. Little Pigeon Awards, this year, were hand-carved wooden pins. The "quiet" pigeon is for 100% province contributions, to be worn by province officers for their clubs or chapters. The "pigeon-in-flight" is for the individual club and chapter that soars for the Settlement School in some special way. Similar awards will be presented in Gatlinburg next summer. A new Settlement School map, available in quantities as a paper placemat, was drawn by Evalyn Prouty Hickman, Colorado Alpha. She has done similar maps in the past and the new design is as gay and attractive as ever! It has a new look since the Red Barn was remodeled. The new placemats were introduced at the Settlement School dinner at convention. The Red Barn had a good first year toward fulfilling its purpose of usefulness. In addition to the Summer Craft Workshop, Tennessee, Alpha, Indiana Alpha and Alabama Beta came for weekend visits, and Tennessee Gamma brought their parents to visit on Parents Day. The South-ern Highland Guild held workshops in Mosaics, stitchery and jewelry. The Owl's Nest was used for meetings by the Little Pigeon Alumni Club, a group of Presbyterian ministers, Southern Highland Guild Board, Council of Mountain Workers Board, and an educational group from the University of Tennessee. It is hoped that more educational, nonprofit, and philanthropic groups will be usingour facility in the coming year. Several inquiries have al-ready been received. We hope many more chapters will plan overnight visits. A few additional furnishings were found necessary during the year and were purchased: folding work tables, a blackboard, more lights, portable cots, linens and towels, and blankets (from stamps). A major improvement this year was the building of a patio adjoining the Red Barn. This and its furniture were made possible by extra gifts. It was finished in time for Workshop, and for the Convention announcement that it is to be called the Virginia Brackett Green Patio, in appreciation of her great energy and selfless devotion to the Settlement School, as Chairman of the Committee. The Barn was remodeled during her last year as chairman, and it is a fitting tribute that we now have a Green Patio as an extension of her Red Barn! The patio is a lovely spot; it curves around the hillside and anchors the Barn to the ground. A simple dedication ceremony was held when Mrs. Green and her daughter visited the Settlement School in mid-summer. Replacements, repairs and maintenance are always a major problem, but by doing a little each year we try to keep up. This year at Arrowcraft, the outside trim was painted, floors were sanded and refinished, and a wrought-iron sign was placed on the stonework next to the front windows. At Health Center, a concrete walk laid from the sidewalk to the steps, its outside trim was painted, and the walls of 2 rooms were washed. The faithful furnace at Teachers, after 44 years of service, finally gave up and was replaced. At Stuart Dormitory, an unexpected gift that was like manna from heaven made it possible to replace some very shabby and worn furniShings. We had thought that renovation impossible this year and are most grateful that it could be done. After one very cold night without heat, the Staff House furnace was repaired; there was a roof repair, and the inside of the front porch was painted. At Pollard, there was some interior painting and all bath linoleums were replaced. The kitchen of our maintenance man's house was lined with wallboard to seal out the cold drafts that had come in between the board walls. A fire proof stone incinerator was built in a central place to serve all buildings. The chickens came along nicely and the 2 gardens produced abundantly due to the care and skill of Richard Watson, our farmer. The freezer is full for the coming year, thanks to Mrs. Adams and her helpers. It was a good season for gardens, but so much rain meant that grass-cutting became almost a daily chore! Back of any shining surface is a lot of hard unglamorous work. 'Countless Pi Phis and others have given unstintingly to make the Settlement School the impressive Memorial it is today. The present resident staff gave that kind of service this year. Sincere appreciation goes to Marion Mueller who keeps a hundred different aspects going smoothly at one time. She can attest that being Director of the total philanthropy is a 24-hour job! The committee in charge for the fraternity gave willingly and often, as well, and all but one member will continue. We shall miss Annie Laurie Keys Whipple who resigned last spring after serving capably as Secretary. Sound thinking and prompt letters will still come from our regular contacts with Olivia Smith Moore, Grand Treasurer. Lois Snyder Finger closed her second banner year as Publicity member and Editor of Little Pigeon News, and will assume the duties of Secretary. Zoe Saunders James will continue her efficient, exacting work as Treasurer, as will Lois Over-street Summers as she prepares and schedules the Settlement School sildes for club and chapter programs. We welcome as new member Helen Boucher Dix, recently Gamma Province Vice President, who will become Publicity member and Editor of Litte Pigeon News and al-ready a valued co-worker. The star that led the fraternity to establish a settlement school in 1912 shines brightly today. As a Memorial to our Founders, it is a vital force 48 years later because it has responded to the needs of each "today." Through corn46 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI bined purpose and combined power, the idea of service became a place of substance. The Settlement School is a treasured heritage with a potential yet undreamed and unknown for the future. HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR Settlement School Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow Yesterday "Here in the Southern Appalachians there are dexterous men and women who weave . . . as did their great grand-parents who pioneered the land. . . There was a period not long ago when mountain handicraft was about to disappear. But thanks to such stimula as the Pi Beta Phi Sorority and re-emergence of public appreciation for native skill, it has come back in giant strides." News-Sentinel, Knxoville, Tennessee, July 1959. Today Yes, in this area there still survives a manner of life which has disappeared almost everywhere else in the United States the pioneer way of life which has prevailed as a result of severe isolation years ago. In contrast there is much evidence of a new way of life thousands of tourists coming to share in the attractions of the area, the scenic beauty of these high horizons, the many crafts, and a growing number of amusements. With Gatlinburg adjacent to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the naturalist's programs featuring walks and informal illustrated talks are an attraction. There are short nature trails and guided hiking trips. The Settlement School with its seventy-eight acres of land and twelve buildings is in the heart of Gatlinburg, and, of course, we hope Settlement School is the attraction for all Pi Phis. The welcome mat is out to each of you. Gatlinburg is expanding and is quite a contrast to the few scattered houses in 1912 when Pi Phi first came! Driving south into this Burg of approximately two thou-sand inhabitants one soon sees a large expanse of green our Staff House lawn. Only a short distance further one sees the Jennie Nichol Health Center. Entering the Health Center one meets Nurse Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta-Delta) who has been here twenty-four years. Of course, there have been many changes through the years. Most of Marjorie's work is preventive with inoculations, vaccinations, and x-rays heading the list. The well-baby clinic is still quite popular and well attended. Here is also a First Aid station, and classrooms. The only one-room school within our twelve mile area is doomed to give way to progress. Each year the average daily attendance brings that school nearer oblivion. The next building west on Parkway is Arrowcraft, similar style to our Health Center. One could not miss seeing the new wrought iron Arrowcraft sign on the front of the building. The two front rooms are sales rooms, and there are offices for the manager, bookkeeper, and weaving designer. Five local girls serve as salesgirls, Nella both as salesgirl and assistant to our designer, Gene Redding. Since Elizabeth Rue's (Iowa Gamma) retirement in April she has served four hours a day as manager of our Arrowcraft Shop at the nearby Mountain View Hotel. Nevada Christian (Nevada Alpha) came all the way from California to serve as new manager as of June 1st. Weaving designer Gene Redding's mishap (broken hip) in February did not deter the production of new weaving items many of which will find their way to your local sales. The response of the Clubs during '59-'60 was excellent, twenty-nine on the honored list, paying to Arrow-craft over one thousand dollars. The support of smaller groups is not overlooked. Each payment helps some craftsman somewhere sell his products. Arrowcraft is admittedly the largest outlet for many, some of whom have brought their crafts to Settlement School before Arrow-craft received its trademark in 1925. Arrowcraft has truly a home industry program as well as an educational program. An average of more than sixty bring their weaving to be sold by Arrowcraft throughout the year. Were it not for the loyal support of our Clubs Arrowcraft would not be able to market the large percentage of crafts. With the supervision of our designer, Arrowcraft's weaving is evidence of "Mountain Know-how and Do-how." Leaving Arrowcraft on our tour one sees a remodelled cabin-type building where there are craft classes in winter and in summer workshop, jewelry and metalwork classes. Anna Belle Lee is contracted to teach crafts for the third year, Carl Huskey continues teaching woodcraft two periods. Mrs. Enloe is also hired by Pi Beta Phi to teach music. The rock building is known as our high school building in winter; in summer it houses our Craft Workshop and John Richard's Gateway Theatre in the auditorium. The summer of `60 completed the sixteenth year of Pi Phi Workshop with the University of Tennessee. Twenty-two states and three foreign countries were represented among our personnel. Each year it is amazing and inspiring to witness the spirit and results from five weeks of concentrated work all taught at college level. Marian Heard (Tennessee Gamma) again directed workshop most capably. Craftsmen are generally divided into two groups, those where economic returns are a primary incentive, or where cultural satisfaction predominates. Our workshop slogan for `60 was "Neither too young, nor too old." In our ex-tended ages categories (seventeen to eighty) one finds many teachers, home demonstration agents, occupational therapists and doctors in addition to other occupations. An eighty-year-old student has been here sixteen summers, a housewife with a masters degree in crafts has been here eight summers, and a psychologist three summers. Each year there are several Pi Phis, but we would like to have more come to this land of high horizons to share in this experience. Plan now for the not too distant future. The white building at the corner of the school lane is the director's office, also office for the assistant to the di-rector, and a boys' dormitory in winter. Incidentally, Sharon Dexter (Illinois Epsilon) was married in June, so now there is a vacancy for assistant to the director. Pollard, next door, is used for summer only not being weatherized. And next door to Pollard is Stuart Cottage which houses our dormitory girls and housemother (Ruth Spelman, Illinois Epsilon). Due to a thoughtful Pi Phi (Mildred Cochran) Stuart lounge has been renovated. Many other gifts are in evidence as we tour. With merchant stamps alone almost thirty blankets were purchased this last year. Unfortunately we cannot list all here, but whatever gift large or small we thank you again. It is through such loyalty that this memorial to our Founders continues. The dormitory program must be mentioned fifteen to twenty boys and girls "live in." To describe an intangible is difficult, to measure the results is an impossibility, yet we staff members can "see" growth mental and social as well as physical. Increasing numbers of dormitory children participate in school activities the result of broadened horizons for these boys and girls. The verbal and living testimonials are rewarding. Year-round staff lives at Staff House and teachers for both summer and winter school. The dining room will accommodate seventy-five in summer workshop. During winter school twenty-five to thirty indulge in our native THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 47 cook's (Mrs. Adams) cuisine. Staff house is also the scene of many groups meetings throughout the year. Staff has its usual posts in the community civic, school, and church. The Southern Highland Guild Fair which is to be in Gatlinburg October 18-22 will require much preparation. Experts in many crafts will bring their displays and sales during the five-day period. An additional attraction at this time will be the exhibit of the American Craftsmen's Council. This is indeed an excellent opportunity for shopping for something "special." As we leave Staff house one notes our garden tended by Richard Watson. Orlie and Neal Watson continue with maintenance an eternal problem with plumbing, electricity, weeds and grass, etc. Orlie is completing his thirty-fourth year at Settlement School. We value his service through the years very highly. Now I see the patio (Virginia Green Patio) for the Red Barn! Here special gifts (Champaign-Urbana and Miami) provided furniture for the patio. Entering the barn we find further details in furnishings which have been added during the year, among them Pittsburgh's two hundred dollars for record player. Thirty-one beds are set up to accommodate groups, and for overnight eight portable cots and four sofas accommodating eight may be used, thus a total of forty-seven may be housed. The Barn/ Dorm was planned as a multiple-purpose building, so various educational groups or Pi Phi groups can be there. At the final party of Workshop over one hundred congregated in the Owls' Nest. Yes, there are increasing activities in our Barn/Dorm, and we trust additional workshops and interest groups will learn of our accommodations. Tomorrow "Time is not measured by the passing of years but by what one does, and what one achieves. Let us think not so much of what we have done, but of what we have left undone." Problems are not solved by merely lookingin a different direction. Let us look to the future and work for it purposefully at the same time keeping our past inheritance. Today is a transition from Yesterday to Tomorrow. Tomorrow's Settlement School will be what we make it by Today's labors!

StandingCommittees COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION Extension continues to be a flourishing business for all men's and women's fraternities. For the 1957-59 NPC biennium there was reported the installation of 176 new chapters for the women's groups alone up to June 1, 1959. Added to that were over 80 new chapters last year. Aside from those groups where mergers took place there were some NPC groups which added as many as eleven and twelve new chapters in the two year period. Pi Beta Phi continues to have the largest number of initiated members, but shares with Delta Delta Delta the position of having the third largest chapter roll. Our own program has been one of conservatism, but one which has, we feel, been right for the fraternity and in conformance with the wishes of the membership. It is of interest to follow the trend of Pi Beta Phi extension through the 93 years following the establishment of our second chapter. The following figures give the picture of our growth. From 1867 to 1888 13 chapters installed 1889 to 1900 17 chapters installed 1901 to 1910 9 chapters installed 1911 to 1920 18 chapters installed 1921 to 1930 17 chapters installed 1931 to 1940 8 chapters installed 1941 to 1950 14 chapters installed 1951 to 1960 8 chapters installed While Pi Beta Phi has added only one new chapter to its roll during this just past interim of convention a number of inquiries have come to the fraternity. During the two year period there have been 69 inquiries concerning 32 different campuses. For the current year alone there were 40 inquiries about 21 campuses. They are as follows: East Carolina College, Greenville, North Carolina Mt. Saint Mary's College, Los Angeles, California University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky East Texas State College, Commerce, Texas Baylor University, Waco, Texas New York University, New York City, N.Y. Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, Indiana Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon Mississippi Southern College, Hattiesburg, Mississippi University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi College of The Pacific, Stockton, California Tennessee Wesleyan College, Athens, Tennessee University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin Portland State College, Portland, Oregon San Jose State College, San Jose, California La Crosse State Teachers' College, La Crosse, Wisconsin Wisconsin State College, Oshkosh, Wisconsin Murray State College, Murray, Kentucky Moravian College, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Longwood College, Farmville, Virginia Parsons College, Fairfield, Iowa. These various inquiries represent letters from Administrations, from local groups, from local individuals wanting to form a group to petition Pi Beta Phi, from official alumna club sources, and from individual members of the fraternity. Further, at the request of Pi Beta Phis the fraternity has placed on record a letter of interest should openings occur on the following campuses: University of Mississippi, Wake Forest, North Carolina, Memphis State, the University of Kentucky, and the University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida. When the expression of interest in having a chapter of Pi Beta Phi came from East Texas State College, Mississippi Southern College, Longwood College and Port-land State College the next step was taken in each case after the initial investigation seemed to show that this opportunity for extension held promise. Later when from a field of eight nationals Pi Beta Phi was chosen to be asked to colonize at Mississippi Southern the invitation was accepted. Mrs. Lewis, Director of Membership, and your NPC Delegate made a visit to the campus which resulted in the selection of six students on that campus and eight women in Hattiesburg who will form the nucleus of the group to be colonized during the formal rushing period next September. In regard to Portland State, the matter will be put before the convention. (N.B. This was done. Grand Council was authorized to proceed.) Opinions expressed concerning the other situations indicated that the membership did not wish to pursue further those opportunities. Our appreciation goes to those who have kept alert, and who have kept in touch with the Grand Council in order that Pi Beta Phi could be well advised in all matters of extension. MARIANNE REID WILD, NPC Delegate and Chairman of Extension HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE "So many smaller organizations, architects, and societies are recognizing that it is up to a comparatively small handful to preserve a past that is altogether too swiftly being eradicated by a `space age.' And we are so lucky to have the present Holt House as a nucleus with which to start." So wrote Eleanor Miller, a member of the Holt House committee, and an interior decorator with L. S. Ayers in Indianapolis, after she had seen Holt House for the first time. I think this sums up the feelings of the entire committee. Holt House is truly a lovely shrine to our founders, but not only is it a shrine, which is reason enough for its being, but it continues to fulfill an area need as a lovely, gracious setting for clubs, teas, showers, wedding receptions, and other social gatherings, to say nothing of the Pi Phi functions. It was used a total of 109 times from May '59 to April '60 with a total incomeof $510. 21 of the 109 were Pi Phi functions for which there is no charge. A special meeting of the committee was held in Mon-mouth March 29-30. Mrs. Johnson, our lovely hostess, had everything shining. While sipping coffee, and nibbling petit fours which Mrs. Johnson quietly served us so as not to disturb our busy discussions, one could almost feel the interest and enthusiasm being regenerated. We have plans for enlarging the kitchen, adding much needed storage and work space. We hope to have some of our lovely antiques refinished and re-upholstered. We need to replace some rugs and draperies. The outside needs some fill and landscaping. We've lost the use of the driveway next door, so need to construct one on Holt House property. These are our most immediate needs, and since they are mostly over and above the usual maintenance costs, 49

        44 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI brightly for that! It, too, was a pioneer experiment. Sponsored jointly by the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School and the University of Tennessee, 16 years of increasing success have proven its worth on an adult educational level. It is puzzling that so few Pi Phis have attended a summer workshop right on their own Settlement School grounds while so many non-Pi Phis (including Kappas, Thetas, Chi Omegas, etc.) have come and returned again and again. Early each spring a Workshop brochure is sent to each chapter and club, and anyone can write for a personal copy. Perhaps a report of the 1960 Workshop is the place to explain various aspects of the Workshop through questions and answers. Who are the Workshop students? The 1960 students came from 22 sttaes plus 2 from the Philippines, 1 from Sarawak and 1 from Canada. The following list shows their various occupations: Craftsmen Secretary to Dean (law) Enamelist Psychologist, writer Farmer Teachers kgth. through Housewife college Sculpter Teacher city recreation Shopkeeper Teachers special subjects Physician Craft Director aged ladies Ticket Agent Matron Industrial home College students (women) Commercial artist Home Demonstration agents Medical technologists Food and Mkt. specialist Retired social worker What were their ages? Ages ranged from 18 to 80. The 80 year old lady is a Gatlinburg resident who has attended all 16 workshops. Do any men attend? Yes, several come each year, often husbands and wives together. Men are a minority but do not seem to mind! How long is a Work-shop? The full session is 5 weeks; each half-session is 12 class days. Where do students live? In 5 Pi Phi buildings Teachers, Stuart, Pollard, the Red Barn, and Staff House for faculty. There are very few rooms for 1 person, several rooms for 2, 3 and 4, and the Little Pigeon Loft (Red Barn) for 12 younger girls. Students with families some-times prefer to rent a cottage in town, boarding with the group, or not, as preferred. Are there modern baths? Yes, several in each building. What about meals? Meals are served in the large Staff House dining room which can seat up to 75 at one time. Who prepares the food? A trained dietician supervises 4 student cooks from the College of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. What are the costs? For a full session, rooms vary from $30 to $54 depending on arrangements. Board is $96 and tuition is $75. Materials are extra. For 1 session the rates are exactly half. What courses are offered? This year, classes were offered in Design, Survey of Crafts (lecture course), Recreational Crafts, plus Beginning and Advanced Enameling, Jewelery, Pottery and Weaving. How many courses may be taken? From 1 to 3, though 3 is usually too many. Each class is 2 hours daily and outside work is expected to equal classtime. Is college credit available? Yes, through the University of Tennessee. Maximum credit is 9 quarter hours undergraduate or 71/2 hours graduate credit. Where are classes held? In the Pi Beta Phi High School and the Arts and Crafts Building; both are in close walking distance from all dormitories. Are classes limited in size? Yes, first come, first served because of limited facilities. A $10 advance registration fee is required. Where do students work? They may work in their own rooms, at work tables in the lounges of all dormitories, or in the class-rooms at .night or when there are no daytime classes in session. Who directs the Workshop? Marian G. Heard, Professor of Related Arts and Crafts at the University of Tennessee and member of Tennessee Gamma, has been the very capable Director for 14 years. Marion Webb Mueller, our enthusiastic, hard-working Director of the Settlement School, Indiana Gamma, is in charge of finances and local arrangements. Who are the instructors? The 1960 faculty was composed of the following, all of whom have advanced degrees: Jane Glass Craft Designer-producer, Gatlinburg; former college teacher. Linn Phelan Instructor-Craftsman, Almond, New York. Lula Smith Associate Professor Emeritus, University of Iowa. Jean Stange Assistant Professor, Michigan State University. Helen Worrall Art and Crafts Instructor and Cincinnati Art Museum. Rikki Brockway, California Gamma, and Betty Pendergrass, Tennessee Gamma, were 2 of the 4 Graduate Assistants who gave good help to the faculty and students this year. These positions are open to 2 Pi Phi seniors each year, At a Pi Phi party held during Committee meeting, Rikki and Betty expressed the thought that it would be a wonderful experience if 16 Pi Phi actives could meet at the Workshop each summer as winners of club-sponsored province scholarships. For many years, the Southern California Area Council has sent a California Pi Phi active to the Workshop on a scholarship. This is the only club-sponsored Workshop scholarship existing at present. Are clubs in other provinces interested in thinking on this? A star shines brightly only when sufficient energy is available. The Settlement School's source of power has been the annual replenishment given by our clubs and chapters. The 100% provinces in contributions this year are: Clubs (10) Chapters (13) Alpha Iota Alpha Theta Beta Lambda Beta Iota Gamma Xi Gamma Kappa Epsilon Omicron EDveslitlaon Mu Zeta Pi Zeta Nu Xi Eta During the 48 years this Memorial to our Founders has grown and its areas of service' nurtured, it has been a source of pride to Pi Phis that it has been supported from voluntary contributions within our own membership. That principle has been our strength! Active chapters contributed a total of $2,870.60 this year, an increase of $121.44. Alumna clubs contributed a total of $10,998.55, a decrease of $82.36 compared to the previous year. The increased contributions from IS chapters and 83 clubs are greatly appreciated. The majority of clubs and chapters gave the same as last year, .some gifts being quite substantial. The decreases were a real loss to both budget and working morale, and we trust they will be absorbed into a much brighter picture for the next two years as the fraternity prepares for the Settlement School's golden anniversary. It is interesting to note that 5 years ago 9 clubs contributed $150 or more. Of that group 5 have been similarly named each succeeding year: Denver, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and St. Louis. Among chapters, Missouri Beta, Texas Alpha and Texas Gamma have maintained their gifts of $100 or more for 5 years too. This year Lambda province has the highest average per club, and Nu has the highest province average per chapter. Altogether a gratifying new high has been reached for both clubs and chapters.

They provided the "extras" which would be omitted otherwise. Three chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma sent funds to the Health Center for corrective purposes. The local Elks and Lions clubs contributed for children's glasses. Clubs, chapters and individuals sent many miscellaneous things including gifts for a special spot, clothing, baby things, and Christmas gifts for distribution to the children at Pi Phi and Glades Schools. Over 35 clubs and individuals sent TV or SH stamps and these were welcomed for needed furnishings and replacements. Please continue to send them to the Director. Through the personal efforts of club and chapter Magazine Chairmen, the year's commission check from the Magazine Agency was for a new high of $10,779.28, an increase of $718.87. This is an amazing example of what the combined efforts of clubs and chapters can accomplish at no cost to a treasury ! Many Pi Phis do not know that the idea of a magazine agency is older than the Settlement School itself. On December 10, 1910, a meeting of the sub-committee of the National Alumna Settlement School Committee was held at Lansdowne, Pa. The following sentence is found in the minutes of that meeting: "The committee approved also the establishment of a magazine subscription agency for the benefit of the Settlement Fund." Bit by bit the importance of magazine commissions in Settlement School support has increased. Among chapters these commissions already surpass contributions by a considerable margin, and among clubs they are approaching equal status. The clubs and chapters of Nu, Pi and Lambda provinces made outstanding commissions last year but it took the combined work of all our Magazine Chairmen, working quietly, carefully and tirelessly throughout the year, to attain this thought-provoking total. If every Pi Phi would remember our Magazine Agency for every home, office or gift subscription within her own orbit of influence, the opportunities for expanding this way of contributing to the Settlement School are almost limitless. The May L. Keller Award for 1959-60 was presented to Patricia Meyer, West Virginia Alpha. Due to their in-formative and skillfully presented skits for Convention this year, special honorable mention goes to Arkansas Alpha, Alabama Beta, Indiana Alpha and Missouri Beta. One suspects that the girls from those chapters will long re-member the "odd" hours of the day or night when they held their rehearsals! Those at Hot Springs were spell-bound as they listened to Dr. Keller tell of her first visit to Gatlinburg and to Miss Onken as she told of the fine local support given to the Settlement School by the Gatlin-burg people. Little Pigeon Awards, this year, were hand-carved wooden pins. The "quiet" pigeon is for 100% province contributions, to be worn by province officers for their clubs or chapters. The "pigeon-in-flight" is for the individual club and chapter that soars for the Settlement School in some special way. Similar awards will be presented in Gatlinburg next summer. A new Settlement School map, available in quantities as a paper placemat, was drawn by Evalyn Prouty Hickman, Colorado Alpha. She has done similar maps in the past and the new design is as gay and attractive as ever! It has a new look since the Red Barn was remodeled. The new placemats were introduced at the Settlement School dinner at convention. The Red Barn had a good first year toward fulfilling its purpose of usefulness. In addition to the Summer Craft Workshop, Tennessee, Alpha, Indiana Alpha and Alabama Beta came for weekend visits, and Tennessee Gamma brought their parents to visit on Parents Day. The South-ern Highland Guild held workshops in Mosaics, stitchery and jewelry. The Owl's Nest was used for meetings by the Little Pigeon Alumni Club, a group of Presbyterian ministers, Southern Highland Guild Board, Council of Mountain Workers Board, and an educational group from the University of Tennessee. It is hoped that more educational, nonprofit, and philanthropic groups will be usingour facility in the coming year. Several inquiries have al-ready been received. We hope many more chapters will plan overnight visits. A few additional furnishings were found necessary during the year and were purchased: folding work tables, a blackboard, more lights, portable cots, linens and towels, and blankets (from stamps). A major improvement this year was the building of a patio adjoining the Red Barn. This and its furniture were made possible by extra gifts. It was finished in time for Workshop, and for the Convention announcement that it is to be called the Virginia Brackett Green Patio, in appreciation of her great energy and selfless devotion to the Settlement School, as Chairman of the Committee. The Barn was remodeled during her last year as chairman, and it is a fitting tribute that we now have a Green Patio as an extension of her Red Barn! The patio is a lovely spot; it curves around the hillside and anchors the Barn to the ground. A simple dedication ceremony was held when Mrs. Green and her daughter visited the Settlement School in mid-summer. Replacements, repairs and maintenance are always a major problem, but by doing a little each year we try to keep up. This year at Arrowcraft, the outside trim was painted, floors were sanded and refinished, and a wrought-iron sign was placed on the stonework next to the front windows. At Health Center, a concrete walk laid from the sidewalk to the steps, its outside trim was painted, and the walls of 2 rooms were washed. The faithful furnace at Teachers, after 44 years of service, finally gave up and was replaced. At Stuart Dormitory, an unexpected gift that was like manna from heaven made it possible to replace some very shabby and worn furniShings. We had thought that renovation impossible this year and are most grateful that it could be done. After one very cold night without heat, the Staff House furnace was repaired; there was a roof repair, and the inside of the front porch was painted. At Pollard, there was some interior painting and all bath linoleums were replaced. The kitchen of our maintenance man's house was lined with wallboard to seal out the cold drafts that had come in between the board walls. A fire proof stone incinerator was built in a central place to serve all buildings. The chickens came along nicely and the 2 gardens produced abundantly due to the care and skill of Richard Watson, our farmer. The freezer is full for the coming year, thanks to Mrs. Adams and her helpers. It was a good season for gardens, but so much rain meant that grass-cutting became almost a daily chore! Back of any shining surface is a lot of hard unglamorous work. 'Countless Pi Phis and others have given unstintingly to make the Settlement School the impressive Memorial it is today. The present resident staff gave that kind of service this year. Sincere appreciation goes to Marion Mueller who keeps a hundred different aspects going smoothly at one time. She can attest that being Director of the total philanthropy is a 24-hour job! The committee in charge for the fraternity gave willingly and often, as well, and all but one member will continue. We shall miss Annie Laurie Keys Whipple who resigned last spring after serving capably as Secretary. Sound thinking and prompt letters will still come from our regular contacts with Olivia Smith Moore, Grand Treasurer. Lois Snyder Finger closed her second banner year as Publicity member and Editor of Little Pigeon News, and will assume the duties of Secretary. Zoe Saunders James will continue her efficient, exacting work as Treasurer, as will Lois Over-street Summers as she prepares and schedules the Settlement School sildes for club and chapter programs. We welcome as new member Helen Boucher Dix, recently Gamma Province Vice President, who will become Publicity member and Editor of Litte Pigeon News and al-ready a valued co-worker. The star that led the fraternity to establish a settlement school in 1912 shines brightly today. As a Memorial to our Founders, it is a vital force 48 years later because it has responded to the needs of each "today." Through corn46 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI bined purpose and combined power, the idea of service became a place of substance. The Settlement School is a treasured heritage with a potential yet undreamed and unknown for the future. HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR Settlement School Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow Yesterday "Here in the Southern Appalachians there are dexterous men and women who weave . . . as did their great grand-parents who pioneered the land. . . There was a period not long ago when mountain handicraft was about to disappear. But thanks to such stimula as the Pi Beta Phi Sorority and re-emergence of public appreciation for native skill, it has come back in giant strides." News-Sentinel, Knxoville, Tennessee, July 1959. Today Yes, in this area there still survives a manner of life which has disappeared almost everywhere else in the United States the pioneer way of life which has prevailed as a result of severe isolation years ago. In contrast there is much evidence of a new way of life thousands of tourists coming to share in the attractions of the area, the scenic beauty of these high horizons, the many crafts, and a growing number of amusements. With Gatlinburg adjacent to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the naturalist's programs featuring walks and informal illustrated talks are an attraction. There are short nature trails and guided hiking trips. The Settlement School with its seventy-eight acres of land and twelve buildings is in the heart of Gatlinburg, and, of course, we hope Settlement School is the attraction for all Pi Phis. The welcome mat is out to each of you. Gatlinburg is expanding and is quite a contrast to the few scattered houses in 1912 when Pi Phi first came! Driving south into this Burg of approximately two thou-sand inhabitants one soon sees a large expanse of green our Staff House lawn. Only a short distance further one sees the Jennie Nichol Health Center. Entering the Health Center one meets Nurse Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta-Delta) who has been here twenty-four years. Of course, there have been many changes through the years. Most of Marjorie's work is preventive with inoculations, vaccinations, and x-rays heading the list. The well-baby clinic is still quite popular and well attended. Here is also a First Aid station, and classrooms. The only one-room school within our twelve mile area is doomed to give way to progress. Each year the average daily attendance brings that school nearer oblivion. The next building west on Parkway is Arrowcraft, similar style to our Health Center. One could not miss seeing the new wrought iron Arrowcraft sign on the front of the building. The two front rooms are sales rooms, and there are offices for the manager, bookkeeper, and weaving designer. Five local girls serve as salesgirls, Nella both as salesgirl and assistant to our designer, Gene Redding. Since Elizabeth Rue's (Iowa Gamma) retirement in April she has served four hours a day as manager of our Arrowcraft Shop at the nearby Mountain View Hotel. Nevada Christian (Nevada Alpha) came all the way from California to serve as new manager as of June 1st. Weaving designer Gene Redding's mishap (broken hip) in February did not deter the production of new weaving items many of which will find their way to your local sales. The response of the Clubs during '59-'60 was excellent, twenty-nine on the honored list, paying to Arrow-craft over one thousand dollars. The support of smaller groups is not overlooked. Each payment helps some craftsman somewhere sell his products. Arrowcraft is admittedly the largest outlet for many, some of whom have brought their crafts to Settlement School before Arrow-craft received its trademark in 1925. Arrowcraft has truly a home industry program as well as an educational program. An average of more than sixty bring their weaving to be sold by Arrowcraft throughout the year. Were it not for the loyal support of our Clubs Arrowcraft would not be able to market the large percentage of crafts. With the supervision of our designer, Arrowcraft's weaving is evidence of "Mountain Know-how and Do-how." Leaving Arrowcraft on our tour one sees a remodelled cabin-type building where there are craft classes in winter and in summer workshop, jewelry and metalwork classes. Anna Belle Lee is contracted to teach crafts for the third year, Carl Huskey continues teaching woodcraft two periods. Mrs. Enloe is also hired by Pi Beta Phi to teach music. The rock building is known as our high school building in winter; in summer it houses our Craft Workshop and John Richard's Gateway Theatre in the auditorium. The summer of `60 completed the sixteenth year of Pi Phi Workshop with the University of Tennessee. Twenty-two states and three foreign countries were represented among our personnel. Each year it is amazing and inspiring to witness the spirit and results from five weeks of concentrated work all taught at college level. Marian Heard (Tennessee Gamma) again directed workshop most capably. Craftsmen are generally divided into two groups, those where economic returns are a primary incentive, or where cultural satisfaction predominates. Our workshop slogan for `60 was "Neither too young, nor too old." In our ex-tended ages categories (seventeen to eighty) one finds many teachers, home demonstration agents, occupational therapists and doctors in addition to other occupations. An eighty-year-old student has been here sixteen summers, a housewife with a masters degree in crafts has been here eight summers, and a psychologist three summers. Each year there are several Pi Phis, but we would like to have more come to this land of high horizons to share in this experience. Plan now for the not too distant future. The white building at the corner of the school lane is the director's office, also office for the assistant to the di-rector, and a boys' dormitory in winter. Incidentally, Sharon Dexter (Illinois Epsilon) was married in June, so now there is a vacancy for assistant to the director. Pollard, next door, is used for summer only not being weatherized. And next door to Pollard is Stuart Cottage which houses our dormitory girls and housemother (Ruth Spelman, Illinois Epsilon). Due to a thoughtful Pi Phi (Mildred Cochran) Stuart lounge has been renovated. Many other gifts are in evidence as we tour. With merchant stamps alone almost thirty blankets were purchased this last year. Unfortunately we cannot list all here, but whatever gift large or small we thank you again. It is through such loyalty that this memorial to our Founders continues. The dormitory program must be mentioned fifteen to twenty boys and girls "live in." To describe an intangible is difficult, to measure the results is an impossibility, yet we staff members can "see" growth mental and social as well as physical. Increasing numbers of dormitory children participate in school activities the result of broadened horizons for these boys and girls. The verbal and living testimonials are rewarding. Year-round staff lives at Staff House and teachers for both summer and winter school. The dining room will accommodate seventy-five in summer workshop. During winter school twenty-five to thirty indulge in our native THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 47 cook's (Mrs. Adams) cuisine. Staff house is also the scene of many groups meetings throughout the year. Staff has its usual posts in the community civic, school, and church. The Southern Highland Guild Fair which is to be in Gatlinburg October 18-22 will require much preparation. Experts in many crafts will bring their displays and sales during the five-day period. An additional attraction at this time will be the exhibit of the American Craftsmen's Council. This is indeed an excellent opportunity for shopping for something "special." As we leave Staff house one notes our garden tended by Richard Watson. Orlie and Neal Watson continue with maintenance an eternal problem with plumbing, electricity, weeds and grass, etc. Orlie is completing his thirty-fourth year at Settlement School. We value his service through the years very highly. Now I see the patio (Virginia Green Patio) for the Red Barn! Here special gifts (Champaign-Urbana and Miami) provided furniture for the patio. Entering the barn we find further details in furnishings which have been added during the year, among them Pittsburgh's two hundred dollars for record player. Thirty-one beds are set up to accommodate groups, and for overnight eight portable cots and four sofas accommodating eight may be used, thus a total of forty-seven may be housed. The Barn/ Dorm was planned as a multiple-purpose building, so various educational groups or Pi Phi groups can be there. At the final party of Workshop over one hundred congregated in the Owls' Nest. Yes, there are increasing activities in our Barn/Dorm, and we trust additional workshops and interest groups will learn of our accommodations. Tomorrow "Time is not measured by the passing of years but by what one does, and what one achieves. Let us think not so much of what we have done, but of what we have left undone." Problems are not solved by merely lookingin a different direction. Let us look to the future and work for it purposefully at the same time keeping our past inheritance. Today is a transition from Yesterday to Tomorrow. Tomorrow's Settlement School will be what we make it by Today's labors!

StandingCommittees COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION Extension continues to be a flourishing business for all men's and women's fraternities. For the 1957-59 NPC biennium there was reported the installation of 176 new chapters for the women's groups alone up to June 1, 1959. Added to that were over 80 new chapters last year. Aside from those groups where mergers took place there were some NPC groups which added as many as eleven and twelve new chapters in the two year period. Pi Beta Phi continues to have the largest number of initiated members, but shares with Delta Delta Delta the position of having the third largest chapter roll. Our own program has been one of conservatism, but one which has, we feel, been right for the fraternity and in conformance with the wishes of the membership. It is of interest to follow the trend of Pi Beta Phi extension through the 93 years following the establishment of our second chapter. The following figures give the picture of our growth. From 1867 to 1888 13 chapters installed 1889 to 1900 17 chapters installed 1901 to 1910 9 chapters installed 1911 to 1920 18 chapters installed 1921 to 1930 17 chapters installed 1931 to 1940 8 chapters installed 1941 to 1950 14 chapters installed 1951 to 1960 8 chapters installed While Pi Beta Phi has added only one new chapter to its roll during this just past interim of convention a number of inquiries have come to the fraternity. During the two year period there have been 69 inquiries concerning 32 different campuses. For the current year alone there were 40 inquiries about 21 campuses. They are as follows: East Carolina College, Greenville, North Carolina Mt. Saint Mary's College, Los Angeles, California University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky East Texas State College, Commerce, Texas Baylor University, Waco, Texas New York University, New York City, N.Y. Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, Indiana Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon Mississippi Southern College, Hattiesburg, Mississippi University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi College of The Pacific, Stockton, California Tennessee Wesleyan College, Athens, Tennessee University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin Portland State College, Portland, Oregon San Jose State College, San Jose, California La Crosse State Teachers' College, La Crosse, Wisconsin Wisconsin State College, Oshkosh, Wisconsin Murray State College, Murray, Kentucky Moravian College, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Longwood College, Farmville, Virginia Parsons College, Fairfield, Iowa. These various inquiries represent letters from Administrations, from local groups, from local individuals wanting to form a group to petition Pi Beta Phi, from official alumna club sources, and from individual members of the fraternity. Further, at the request of Pi Beta Phis the fraternity has placed on record a letter of interest should openings occur on the following campuses: University of Mississippi, Wake Forest, North Carolina, Memphis State, the University of Kentucky, and the University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida. When the expression of interest in having a chapter of Pi Beta Phi came from East Texas State College, Mississippi Southern College, Longwood College and Port-land State College the next step was taken in each case after the initial investigation seemed to show that this opportunity for extension held promise. Later when from a field of eight nationals Pi Beta Phi was chosen to be asked to colonize at Mississippi Southern the invitation was accepted. Mrs. Lewis, Director of Membership, and your NPC Delegate made a visit to the campus which resulted in the selection of six students on that campus and eight women in Hattiesburg who will form the nucleus of the group to be colonized during the formal rushing period next September. In regard to Portland State, the matter will be put before the convention. (N.B. This was done. Grand Council was authorized to proceed.) Opinions expressed concerning the other situations indicated that the membership did not wish to pursue further those opportunities. Our appreciation goes to those who have kept alert, and who have kept in touch with the Grand Council in order that Pi Beta Phi could be well advised in all matters of extension. MARIANNE REID WILD, NPC Delegate and Chairman of Extension HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE "So many smaller organizations, architects, and societies are recognizing that it is up to a comparatively small handful to preserve a past that is altogether too swiftly being eradicated by a `space age.' And we are so lucky to have the present Holt House as a nucleus with which to start." So wrote Eleanor Miller, a member of the Holt House committee, and an interior decorator with L. S. Ayers in Indianapolis, after she had seen Holt House for the first time. I think this sums up the feelings of the entire committee. Holt House is truly a lovely shrine to our founders, but not only is it a shrine, which is reason enough for its being, but it continues to fulfill an area need as a lovely, gracious setting for clubs, teas, showers, wedding receptions, and other social gatherings, to say nothing of the Pi Phi functions. It was used a total of 109 times from May '59 to April '60 with a total incomeof $510. 21 of the 109 were Pi Phi functions for which there is no charge. A special meeting of the committee was held in Mon-mouth March 29-30. Mrs. Johnson, our lovely hostess, had everything shining. While sipping coffee, and nibbling petit fours which Mrs. Johnson quietly served us so as not to disturb our busy discussions, one could almost feel the interest and enthusiasm being regenerated. We have plans for enlarging the kitchen, adding much needed storage and work space. We hope to have some of our lovely antiques refinished and re-upholstered. We need to replace some rugs and draperies. The outside needs some fill and landscaping. We've lost the use of the driveway next door, so need to construct one on Holt House property. These are our most immediate needs, and since they are mostly over and above the usual maintenance costs, 49

StandingCommittees COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION Extension continues to be a flourishing business for all men's and women's fraternities. For the 1957-59 NPC biennium there was reported the installation of 176 new chapters for the women's groups alone up to June 1, 1959. Added to that were over 80 new chapters last year. Aside from those groups where mergers took place there were some NPC groups which added as many as eleven and twelve new chapters in the two year period. Pi Beta Phi continues to have the largest number of initiated members, but shares with Delta Delta Delta the position of having the third largest chapter roll. Our own program has been one of conservatism, but one which has, we feel, been right for the fraternity and in conformance with the wishes of the membership. It is of interest to follow the trend of Pi Beta Phi extension through the 93 years following the establishment of our second chapter. The following figures give the picture of our growth. From 1867 to 1888 13 chapters installed 1889 to 1900 17 chapters installed 1901 to 1910 9 chapters installed 1911 to 1920 18 chapters installed 1921 to 1930 17 chapters installed 1931 to 1940 8 chapters installed 1941 to 1950 14 chapters installed 1951 to 1960 8 chapters installed While Pi Beta Phi has added only one new chapter to its roll during this just past interim of convention a number of inquiries have come to the fraternity. During the two year period there have been 69 inquiries concerning 32 different campuses. For the current year alone there were 40 inquiries about 21 campuses. They are as follows: East Carolina College, Greenville, North Carolina Mt. Saint Mary's College, Los Angeles, California University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky East Texas State College, Commerce, Texas Baylor University, Waco, Texas New York University, New York City, N.Y.

These various inquiries represent letters from Administrations, from local groups, from local individuals wanting to form a group to petition Pi Beta Phi, from official alumna club sources, and from individual members of the fraternity. Further, at the request of Pi Beta Phis the fraternity has placed on record a letter of interest should openings occur on the following campuses: University of Mississippi, Wake Forest, North Carolina, Memphis State, the University of Kentucky, and the University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida. When the expression of interest in having a chapter of Pi Beta Phi came from East Texas State College, Mississippi Southern College, Longwood College and Port-land State College the next step was taken in each case after the initial investigation seemed to show that this opportunity for extension held promise. Later when from a field of eight nationals Pi Beta Phi was chosen to be asked to colonize at Mississippi Southern the invitation was accepted. Mrs. Lewis, Director of Membership, and your NPC Delegate made a visit to the campus which resulted in the selection of six students on that campus and eight women in Hattiesburg who will form the nucleus of the group to be colonized during the formal rushing period next September. In regard to Portland State, the matter will be put before the convention. (N.B. This was done. Grand Council was authorized to proceed.) Opinions expressed concerning the other situations indicated that the membership did not wish to pursue further those opportunities. Our appreciation goes to those who have kept alert, and who have kept in touch with the Grand Council in order that Pi Beta Phi could be well advised in all matters of extension. MARIANNE REID WILD, NPC Delegate and Chairman of Extension HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE "So many smaller organizations, architects, and societies are recognizing that it is up to a comparatively small handful to preserve a past that is altogether too swiftly being eradicated by a `space age.' And we are so lucky to have the present Holt House as a nucleus with which to start." So wrote Eleanor Miller, a member of the Holt House committee, and an interior decorator with L. S. Ayers in Indianapolis, after she had seen Holt House for the first time. I think this sums up the feelings of the entire committee. Holt House is truly a lovely shrine to our founders, but not only is it a shrine, which is reason enough for its being, but it continues to fulfill an area need as a lovely, gracious setting for clubs, teas, showers, wedding receptions, and other social gatherings, to say nothing of the Pi Phi functions. It was used a total of 109 times from May '59 to April '60 with a total incomeof $510. 21 of the 109 were Pi Phi functions for which there is no charge. A special meeting of the committee was held in Mon-mouth March 29-30. Mrs. Johnson, our lovely hostess, had everything shining. While sipping coffee, and nibbling petit fours which Mrs. Johnson quietly served us so as not to disturb our busy discussions, one could almost feel the interest and enthusiasm being regenerated. We have plans for enlarging the kitchen, adding much needed storage and work space. We hope to have some of our lovely antiques refinished and re-upholstered. We need to replace some rugs and draperies. The outside needs some fill and landscaping. We've lost the use of the driveway next door, so need to construct one on Holt House property. These are our most immediate needs, and since they are mostly over and above the usual maintenance costs, 49

It seems especially fitting that the idea, as presented by Emma Harper Turner, former Grand President, and club delegate, had originated within the Alumnae Club of Washington, D.C. More than any other single city, Washington is the one that symbolizes our faith, concern and affection for our country. So, too, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School has become the symbol of the national character, strength and unity of our fraternity. There is no other bond, excepting our ceremonies and the fact that all Pi Phis are college women, quite so common to all our members. It took two years of committee meetings, correspondence, conferences, study and several trips of investigation to secure just the right location. The general area selected was the most educationally needy in the country, and the specific county selected had the fewest schools, so basically the decision was one of eliminating other places. That was how the fraternity came to the community of Gatlinburg, a tiny hamlet, in a beautiful valley along the Little Pigeon River, and surrounded by the Great Smoky Mountains in southeast Tennessee, The fraternity's star of service to others settled itself in that vicinity, and early in 1912 it began to send out its first rays of light. It is well to remember that Education in the settlement began almost as much by neighborhood endeavor as by that of the fraternity. A brief review of the early days may clarify the unusual arrangement under which the school situation developed over the years. Before the site had been selected, the committee in charge had recommended that the fraternity cooperate with existing public schools, if possible, under arrangements satisfactory to Pi Beta Phi. In choosing a mountain locale, we were dealing with people as individual and rugged as their environment. Isolation had made them extremely reserved with outsiders and they needed to be shown and sold! They were intelligent but suspicious as to why "them wimmen" wanted to start a school, believing at first that we had a hidden religious purpose! After Sevier County had been selected, negotiations were opened with the school board and the people of the Gatlinburg community, but they become so delayed that the committee decided to enter the area independently and conduct all further arrangements from the spot. Thus our first school session was for 3 months following the 4-month school year which was all the county could provide. 14 pupils enrolled for that Pi Phi term and it closed with 33 enrolled. The following fall, the Pi Phi teacher worked jointly with the native teacher, and again the fraternity afterward provided an independent session which started with 40 pupils and ended with 75! All during the year negotiations had been going on, and after seeing the initial success, the school board offered to give a clear absolute deed to the county school property (a 1 room building atop an almost inaccessable hill) and turn over all teacher pay as long as Pi Beta Phi maintained a public and free school in the lower grades. Seeing ahead to more than minimum education and desiring a better location for the settlement, it seemed to the committee in charge that it was more desirable for the fraternity to erect its own more-adequate building and on its own land, thus assuring a freer hand in the thing we had come to do Astutely realiz-ing that if the local residents themselves contributed some-thing to the effort they would better support our efforts, there was much to be worked out mutually. These negotiations dangled along for over a year and were resolved only after the fraternity representatives set a deadline for local action, saying that unless it was forthcoming we would go to another community where inducements would be offered to build a school. Thus, through cooperation, it did come about that Pi Beta Phi was asked to stay, and the property desired for a school site was purchased for $600 from the fraternity and $1200 from the local residents. In return for the deed, Pi Beta Phi promised to maintain a school for at least 10 years, to build a new school house, and to provide good teachers. The promised school building was erected by the fraternity in 1913-14. It had 5 large classrooms, 3 of which could be made into one room for assemblies. After this evidence of good faith, the school board, beginning August 1914, voted to turn over to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the year's appropriation-$375. The 1915 school year closed with an enrollment of 158. This was the beginning; in time pupils were grouped according to grade, and little by little higher grades were added. In addition there was expansion of education to rural schools up the "hollers" and creeks. By 1928 the need for a separate high school was acute and that building was erected nearby. In 1943, the fraternity believed the proper time had come for the county to take back the major operation of the schools in the district, and since that time we have leased for $1 a year the play areas and two school buildings erected by the fraternity. In 1949, we deeded for $1 approximately 2 acres of land on which it built a new building for the primary grades, and later, a combination cafeteria-gymnasium. The grade school built in 1914 by the fraternity for about $3700 is still used for grades 4, 5, and 6. In time, that 46-year old building, as well as the 32-year old high school building, will have to give way to progress and more modern buildings. During 1959-60, 25 full-time and 3 part-time teachers instructed 607 students at "Pi Beta Phi School." The conventional state framework is followed in all grades, while the extra teachers supplied by the fraternity enable the school to receive an A rating. These teachers are in Music, Art and Crafts, and Woodworking. Sharon Dexter, Illinois Zeta, Assistant to the Director, taught two Journalism classes which published the weekly school paper, The Mountain Echo. Sharon resigned in June to be married, and these classes will not be continued in the coming year. Our Health Center is adjacent to the school grounds, and our nurse will continue looking after the students as before. The Grace Coolidge Library is located in the high school building and many books were added during the year by the county, PTA and Pi Beta Phi funds. The room is used regularly as a study hall and a library, enabling ready access to the books there. There is a bronze plaque honoring Mrs. Coolidge on the entrance door to the library, and an autographed picture hangs on one wall of the double room. The light of education has many facets, and for the purposes of this report we shall seek to identify the other individual points of our present-day Settlement School star. The Dormitory Program has an older sheen on its point of our star than is usually realized though the exact date it began to shine has proven illusive. There is evidence that it began gradually as certain needs arose and finally 42 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI these excerpts from the emerged into print full-grown, as February, 1936 History Issue of the ARROW indicate: "An experiment was tried at the School in the fall session of 1919 called the 'Country Home.' The girls brought their supplies from their home, did all their work during the week, and then on Friday afternoon packed up again and returned home. Abbey Runyan of the School staff lived in the home with the girls and supervised their work." "Projects under consideration during (1919) . were . . the making of some provision for older boys to earn their 'schooling' . . ." "In the fall of 1921, Anna Dowell, Iowa Beta , . supervised the work of six girls in the Mary Pollard cottage . . . teaching a course in practical housewifery." "The remodeling of the Stuart and Pollard cottages (1923-4) met the immediate needs, both being used as girls' dormitories. The Committee rented the Higinbotham-Bishop Cottage for a boys' dormitory which served adequately." From these references it seems logical to conclude that the Settlement School dormitories are at least approaching a 40-year background, and that the program has be.en concerned primarily with students of junior and senior high school age. This year 7 boys and 9 girls comp, leted the school term in the dormitories. Full capacity .is 20. Ruth Schantz Spelman, Illinois Epsilon, was again the genial housemother for girls at Stuart, while our Director, Marion Mueller, and Mrs. Adams, our cook at Staff, effectively shared supervision of the boys at Teachers. These girls and boys live too far from school for daily trips even by bus. They pay $5 per month, supplementing that token fee by doing extra chores, such as serving table, helping with meals and dishes, caring for their rooms, feeding chickens, painting, cutting grass, raking leaves, etc. They always have their meals with the resident personnel in the large dining room at staff house. The pro-gram enables the students to participate in after-school activities they otherwise would miss. There is no doubt that this kind of service keeps many boys and girls in school longer than they ever would stay without it. School officials continually praise the dormitory program as a most valuable contribution, and they wish more students could have the same kind of youth supervision. Health is a third point of service on our Settlement School star. The need for basic sanitation, nutrition and disease prevention became evident the first year the school was established, but it was 8 years before a full-time nurse was provided. In the meantime the plea had been heard. In 1914 three of our Founders started a fund with $150 for the establishment of a hospital "in loving memory of Jennie Nicol of Alpha." By 1917 the fund had grown to $900. Then World War I intervened and plans were delayed. Finally in 1920, Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario Alpha, came as the school's first nurse. (She re-visited Gatlinburg this spring and found it hard to recon.-cile the present town with the one she knew 40 years ago.) On May 8, 1922, the long-needed "hospital" was d.edicated. It was the old Andy Ogle house converted, and it still stands today in the heart of our property. (Our maintenance man, Orlie Watson, who has served the Pi Phis faithfully for 34 years, lives there now with his wife. His son, Neal, assists his father and has now served .12.years himself.) To move quickly to the present, Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta-Delta) began her duties in the old building and moved to the new Health Center in 1948. She will start her 25th year as nurse on December 1, 1960. As usual she was nurse-on-call at "Pi Beta Phi" and Glades School, the only remaining rural school in the a.rea. Sh.e gave all kinds of health talks, inoculation, tests, inspections, check-ups and the annual student physical examinations. She continued to hold her Well Baby Clinics each week. She was resident nurse for staff and dormitory 43 students during the year, and for workshop students in the summer. Perhaps her chief joy this year came from the purchase of a needed auto clave (live steam sterilizer).

For 3 5 years (45 years, if we go back to the first basket sold, it has been making a unique contribution to American culture and heritage. By providing a market outlet through our loyal clubs and chapters, beautiful handweaving and other excellent crafts native to the southern highlands have gone into all parts of our country. The art forms and skills necessary for producing these handmade articles could have been lost easily unless preserved by special effort. Pi Beta Phi made that effort and successfully! Through the years, Arrowcraft weavers have been given encouragement and a livelihood. They, in turn, repaid in a loyalty to Arrowcraft which has continued from generation to generation. During this year a total of 77 women wove for Arrowcraft, with an aver-age of 63 working at one time all the year. At the same time 19 women asked for weaving which we were unable to provide. Good design, workmanship and service are well known standards at Arrowcraft. Gene Redding, our able Weaving Designer, will continue in that position, creating the new designs we all look forward to seeing each year. There are 5 local girls working regularly with sales and shipping. Eunice Cole returned July 1 as full-time Booklieeper following the resignation of Emily Cantwell. Elizabeth Waitt Rue, Iowa Gamma and former manager for 5 successful years, took over the nearby Mountain View Hotel shop last spring. The fraternity extends a very warm welcome to Nevada Semenza Christian (Mrs. Sutton), Nevada Alpha, who became Arrowcraft Manager on June 1. Many Pi Phis met and enjoyed her at Convention. She and her staff expect to serve i.A.rrowcraft to the best of their ability in 1960-61. The number of clubs remitting over $1000 to Arrow-craft increased from 17 to 29, indicating that those clubs had unusually large scales. Many other clubs held highly successful sales on a smaller scale and achieved equally well for their size. All deserve praise because such success does not just happen! It takes careful planning and hard work.

It, too, was a pioneer experiment. Sponsored jointly by the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School and the University of Tennessee, 16 years of increasing success have proven its worth on an adult educational level. It is puzzling that so few Pi Phis have attended a summer workshop right on their own Settlement School grounds while so many non-Pi Phis (including Kappas, Thetas, Chi Omegas, etc.) have come and returned again and again. Early each spring a Workshop brochure is sent to each chapter and club, and anyone can write for a personal copy. Perhaps a report of the 1960 Workshop is the place to explain various aspects of the Workshop through questions and answers. Who are the Workshop students? The 1960 students came from 22 sttaes plus 2 from the Philippines, 1 from Sarawak and 1 from Canada. The following list shows their various occupations: Craftsmen Secretary to Dean (law) Enamelist Psychologist, writer Farmer Teachers kgth. through Housewife college Sculpter Teacher city recreation Shopkeeper Teachers special subjects Physician Craft Director aged ladies Ticket Agent Matron Industrial home College students (women) Commercial artist Home Demonstration agents Medical technologists Food and Mkt. specialist Retired social worker What were their ages? Ages ranged from 18 to 80. The 80 year old lady is a Gatlinburg resident who has attended all 16 workshops. Do any men attend? Yes, several come each year, often husbands and wives together. Men are a minority but do not seem to mind! How long is a Work-shop? The full session is 5 weeks; each half-session is 12 class days. Where do students live? In 5 Pi Phi buildings Teachers, Stuart, Pollard, the Red Barn, and Staff House for faculty. There are very few rooms for 1 person, several rooms for 2, 3 and 4, and the Little Pigeon Loft (Red Barn) for 12 younger girls. Students with families some-times prefer to rent a cottage in town, boarding with the group, or not, as preferred. Are there modern baths? Yes, several in each building. What about meals? Meals are served in the large Staff House dining room which can seat up to 75 at one time. Who prepares the food? A trained dietician supervises 4 student cooks from the College of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. What are the costs? For a full session, rooms vary from $30 to $54 depending on arrangements. Board is $96 and tuition is $75. Materials are extra. For 1 session the rates are exactly half. What courses are offered? This year, classes were offered in Design, Survey of Crafts (lecture course), Recreational Crafts, plus Beginning and Advanced Enameling, Jewelery, Pottery and Weaving. How many courses may be taken? From 1 to 3, though 3 is usually too many. Each class is 2 hours daily and outside work is expected to equal classtime. Is college credit available? Yes, through the University of Tennessee. Maximum credit is 9 quarter hours undergraduate or 71/2 hours graduate credit. Where are classes held? In the Pi Beta Phi High School and the Arts and Crafts Building; both are in close walking distance from all dormitories. Are classes limited in size? Yes, first come, first served because of limited facilities. A $10 advance registration fee is required. Where do students work? They may work in their own rooms, at work tables in the lounges of all dormitories, or in the class-rooms at .night or when there are no daytime classes in session. Who directs the Workshop? Marian G. Heard, Professor of Related Arts and Crafts at the University of Tennessee and member of Tennessee Gamma, has been the very capable Director for 14 years. Marion Webb Mueller, our enthusiastic, hard-working Director of the Settlement School, Indiana Gamma, is in charge of finances and local arrangements. Who are the instructors? The 1960 faculty was composed of the following, all of whom have advanced degrees: Jane Glass Craft Designer-producer, Gatlinburg; former college teacher. Linn Phelan Instructor-Craftsman, Almond, New York. Lula Smith Associate Professor Emeritus, University of Iowa. Jean Stange Assistant Professor, Michigan State University. Helen Worrall Art and Crafts Instructor and Cincinnati Art Museum. Rikki Brockway, California Gamma, and Betty Pendergrass, Tennessee Gamma, were 2 of the 4 Graduate Assistants who gave good help to the faculty and students this year. These positions are open to 2 Pi Phi seniors each year, At a Pi Phi party held during Committee meeting, Rikki and Betty expressed the thought that it would be a wonderful experience if 16 Pi Phi actives could meet at the Workshop each summer as winners of club-sponsored province scholarships. For many years, the Southern California Area Council has sent a California Pi Phi active to the Workshop on a scholarship. This is the only club-sponsored Workshop scholarship existing at present. Are clubs in other provinces interested in thinking on this? A star shines brightly only when sufficient energy is available. The Settlement School's source of power has been the annual replenishment given by our clubs and chapters. The 100% provinces in contributions this year are: Clubs (10) Chapters (13) Alpha Iota Alpha Theta Beta Lambda Beta Iota Gamma Xi Gamma Kappa Epsilon Omicron EDveslitlaon Mu Zeta Pi Zeta Nu Xi Eta During the 48 years this Memorial to our Founders has grown and its areas of service' nurtured, it has been a source of pride to Pi Phis that it has been supported from voluntary contributions within our own membership. That principle has been our strength! Active chapters contributed a total of $2,870.60 this year, an increase of $121.44. Alumna clubs contributed a total of $10,998.55, a decrease of $82.36 compared to the previous year. The increased contributions from IS chapters and 83 clubs are greatly appreciated. The majority of clubs and chapters gave the same as last year, .some gifts being quite substantial. The decreases were a real loss to both budget and working morale, and we trust they will be absorbed into a much brighter picture for the next two years as the fraternity prepares for the Settlement School's golden anniversary. It is interesting to note that 5 years ago 9 clubs contributed $150 or more. Of that group 5 have been similarly named each succeeding year: Denver, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and St. Louis. Among chapters, Missouri Beta, Texas Alpha and Texas Gamma have maintained their gifts of $100 or more for 5 years too. This year Lambda province has the highest average per club, and Nu has the highest province average per chapter. Altogether a gratifying new high has been reached for both clubs and chapters.

They provided the "extras" which would be omitted otherwise. Three chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma sent funds to the Health Center for corrective purposes. The local Elks and Lions clubs contributed for children's glasses. Clubs, chapters and individuals sent many miscellaneous things including gifts for a special spot, clothing, baby things, and Christmas gifts for distribution to the children at Pi Phi and Glades Schools. Over 35 clubs and individuals sent TV or SH stamps and these were welcomed for needed furnishings and replacements. Please continue to send them to the Director. Through the personal efforts of club and chapter Magazine Chairmen, the year's commission check from the Magazine Agency was for a new high of $10,779.28, an increase of $718.87. This is an amazing example of what the combined efforts of clubs and chapters can accomplish at no cost to a treasury ! Many Pi Phis do not know that the idea of a magazine agency is older than the Settlement School itself. On December 10, 1910, a meeting of the sub-committee of the National Alumna Settlement School Committee was held at Lansdowne, Pa. The following sentence is found in the minutes of that meeting: "The committee approved also the establishment of a magazine subscription agency for the benefit of the Settlement Fund." Bit by bit the importance of magazine commissions in Settlement School support has increased. Among chapters these commissions already surpass contributions by a considerable margin, and among clubs they are approaching equal status. The clubs and chapters of Nu, Pi and Lambda provinces made outstanding commissions last year but it took the combined work of all our Magazine Chairmen, working quietly, carefully and tirelessly throughout the year, to attain this thought-provoking total. If every Pi Phi would remember our Magazine Agency for every home, office or gift subscription within her own orbit of influence, the opportunities for expanding this way of contributing to the Settlement School are almost limitless. The May L. Keller Award for 1959-60 was presented to Patricia Meyer, West Virginia Alpha. Due to their in-formative and skillfully presented skits for Convention this year, special honorable mention goes to Arkansas Alpha, Alabama Beta, Indiana Alpha and Missouri Beta. One suspects that the girls from those chapters will long re-member the "odd" hours of the day or night when they held their rehearsals! Those at Hot Springs were spell-bound as they listened to Dr. Keller tell of her first visit to Gatlinburg and to Miss Onken as she told of the fine local support given to the Settlement School by the Gatlin-burg people. Little Pigeon Awards, this year, were hand-carved wooden pins. The "quiet" pigeon is for 100% province contributions, to be worn by province officers for their clubs or chapters. The "pigeon-in-flight" is for the individual club and chapter that soars for the Settlement School in some special way. Similar awards will be presented in Gatlinburg next summer. A new Settlement School map, available in quantities as a paper placemat, was drawn by Evalyn Prouty Hickman, Colorado Alpha. She has done similar maps in the past and the new design is as gay and attractive as ever! It has a new look since the Red Barn was remodeled. The new placemats were introduced at the Settlement School dinner at convention. The Red Barn had a good first year toward fulfilling its purpose of usefulness. In addition to the Summer Craft Workshop, Tennessee, Alpha, Indiana Alpha and Alabama Beta came for weekend visits, and Tennessee Gamma brought their parents to visit on Parents Day. The South-ern Highland Guild held workshops in Mosaics, stitchery and jewelry. The Owl's Nest was used for meetings by the Little Pigeon Alumni Club, a group of Presbyterian ministers, Southern Highland Guild Board, Council of Mountain Workers Board, and an educational group from the University of Tennessee. It is hoped that more educational, nonprofit, and philanthropic groups will be usingour facility in the coming year. Several inquiries have al-ready been received. We hope many more chapters will plan overnight visits. A few additional furnishings were found necessary during the year and were purchased: folding work tables, a blackboard, more lights, portable cots, linens and towels, and blankets (from stamps). A major improvement this year was the building of a patio adjoining the Red Barn. This and its furniture were made possible by extra gifts. It was finished in time for Workshop, and for the Convention announcement that it is to be called the Virginia Brackett Green Patio, in appreciation of her great energy and selfless devotion to the Settlement School, as Chairman of the Committee. The Barn was remodeled during her last year as chairman, and it is a fitting tribute that we now have a Green Patio as an extension of her Red Barn! The patio is a lovely spot; it curves around the hillside and anchors the Barn to the ground. A simple dedication ceremony was held when Mrs. Green and her daughter visited the Settlement School in mid-summer. Replacements, repairs and maintenance are always a major problem, but by doing a little each year we try to keep up. This year at Arrowcraft, the outside trim was painted, floors were sanded and refinished, and a wrought-iron sign was placed on the stonework next to the front windows. At Health Center, a concrete walk laid from the sidewalk to the steps, its outside trim was painted, and the walls of 2 rooms were washed. The faithful furnace at Teachers, after 44 years of service, finally gave up and was replaced. At Stuart Dormitory, an unexpected gift that was like manna from heaven made it possible to replace some very shabby and worn furniShings. We had thought that renovation impossible this year and are most grateful that it could be done. After one very cold night without heat, the Staff House furnace was repaired; there was a roof repair, and the inside of the front porch was painted. At Pollard, there was some interior painting and all bath linoleums were replaced. The kitchen of our maintenance man's house was lined with wallboard to seal out the cold drafts that had come in between the board walls. A fire proof stone incinerator was built in a central place to serve all buildings. The chickens came along nicely and the 2 gardens produced abundantly due to the care and skill of Richard Watson, our farmer. The freezer is full for the coming year, thanks to Mrs. Adams and her helpers. It was a good season for gardens, but so much rain meant that grass-cutting became almost a daily chore! Back of any shining surface is a lot of hard unglamorous work. 'Countless Pi Phis and others have given unstintingly to make the Settlement School the impressive Memorial it is today. The present resident staff gave that kind of service this year. Sincere appreciation goes to Marion Mueller who keeps a hundred different aspects going smoothly at one time. She can attest that being Director of the total philanthropy is a 24-hour job! The committee in charge for the fraternity gave willingly and often, as well, and all but one member will continue. We shall miss Annie Laurie Keys Whipple who resigned last spring after serving capably as Secretary. Sound thinking and prompt letters will still come from our regular contacts with Olivia Smith Moore, Grand Treasurer. Lois Snyder Finger closed her second banner year as Publicity member and Editor of Little Pigeon News, and will assume the duties of Secretary. Zoe Saunders James will continue her efficient, exacting work as Treasurer, as will Lois Over-street Summers as she prepares and schedules the Settlement School sildes for club and chapter programs. We welcome as new member Helen Boucher Dix, recently Gamma Province Vice President, who will become Publicity member and Editor of Litte Pigeon News and al-ready a valued co-worker. The star that led the fraternity to establish a settlement school in 1912 shines brightly today. As a Memorial to our Founders, it is a vital force 48 years later because it has responded to the needs of each "today." Through corn46 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI bined purpose and combined power, the idea of service became a place of substance. The Settlement School is a treasured heritage with a potential yet undreamed and unknown for the future. HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR Settlement School Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow Yesterday "Here in the Southern Appalachians there are dexterous men and women who weave . . . as did their great grand-parents who pioneered the land. . . There was a period not long ago when mountain handicraft was about to disappear. But thanks to such stimula as the Pi Beta Phi Sorority and re-emergence of public appreciation for native skill, it has come back in giant strides." News-Sentinel, Knxoville, Tennessee, July 1959. Today Yes, in this area there still survives a manner of life which has disappeared almost everywhere else in the United States the pioneer way of life which has prevailed as a result of severe isolation years ago. In contrast there is much evidence of a new way of life thousands of tourists coming to share in the attractions of the area, the scenic beauty of these high horizons, the many crafts, and a growing number of amusements. With Gatlinburg adjacent to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the naturalist's programs featuring walks and informal illustrated talks are an attraction. There are short nature trails and guided hiking trips. The Settlement School with its seventy-eight acres of land and twelve buildings is in the heart of Gatlinburg, and, of course, we hope Settlement School is the attraction for all Pi Phis. The welcome mat is out to each of you. Gatlinburg is expanding and is quite a contrast to the few scattered houses in 1912 when Pi Phi first came! Driving south into this Burg of approximately two thou-sand inhabitants one soon sees a large expanse of green our Staff House lawn. Only a short distance further one sees the Jennie Nichol Health Center. Entering the Health Center one meets Nurse Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta-Delta) who has been here twenty-four years. Of course, there have been many changes through the years. Most of Marjorie's work is preventive with inoculations, vaccinations, and x-rays heading the list. The well-baby clinic is still quite popular and well attended. Here is also a First Aid station, and classrooms. The only one-room school within our twelve mile area is doomed to give way to progress. Each year the average daily attendance brings that school nearer oblivion. The next building west on Parkway is Arrowcraft, similar style to our Health Center. One could not miss seeing the new wrought iron Arrowcraft sign on the front of the building. The two front rooms are sales rooms, and there are offices for the manager, bookkeeper, and weaving designer. Five local girls serve as salesgirls, Nella both as salesgirl and assistant to our designer, Gene Redding. Since Elizabeth Rue's (Iowa Gamma) retirement in April she has served four hours a day as manager of our Arrowcraft Shop at the nearby Mountain View Hotel. Nevada Christian (Nevada Alpha) came all the way from California to serve as new manager as of June 1st. Weaving designer Gene Redding's mishap (broken hip) in February did not deter the production of new weaving items many of which will find their way to your local sales. The response of the Clubs during '59-'60 was excellent, twenty-nine on the honored list, paying to Arrow-craft over one thousand dollars. The support of smaller groups is not overlooked. Each payment helps some craftsman somewhere sell his products. Arrowcraft is admittedly the largest outlet for many, some of whom have brought their crafts to Settlement School before Arrow-craft received its trademark in 1925. Arrowcraft has truly a home industry program as well as an educational program. An average of more than sixty bring their weaving to be sold by Arrowcraft throughout the year. Were it not for the loyal support of our Clubs Arrowcraft would not be able to market the large percentage of crafts. With the supervision of our designer, Arrowcraft's weaving is evidence of "Mountain Know-how and Do-how." Leaving Arrowcraft on our tour one sees a remodelled cabin-type building where there are craft classes in winter and in summer workshop, jewelry and metalwork classes. Anna Belle Lee is contracted to teach crafts for the third year, Carl Huskey continues teaching woodcraft two periods. Mrs. Enloe is also hired by Pi Beta Phi to teach music. The rock building is known as our high school building in winter; in summer it houses our Craft Workshop and John Richard's Gateway Theatre in the auditorium. The summer of `60 completed the sixteenth year of Pi Phi Workshop with the University of Tennessee. Twenty-two states and three foreign countries were represented among our personnel. Each year it is amazing and inspiring to witness the spirit and results from five weeks of concentrated work all taught at college level. Marian Heard (Tennessee Gamma) again directed workshop most capably. Craftsmen are generally divided into two groups, those where economic returns are a primary incentive, or where cultural satisfaction predominates. Our workshop slogan for `60 was "Neither too young, nor too old." In our ex-tended ages categories (seventeen to eighty) one finds many teachers, home demonstration agents, occupational therapists and doctors in addition to other occupations. An eighty-year-old student has been here sixteen summers, a housewife with a masters degree in crafts has been here eight summers, and a psychologist three summers. Each year there are several Pi Phis, but we would like to have more come to this land of high horizons to share in this experience. Plan now for the not too distant future. The white building at the corner of the school lane is the director's office, also office for the assistant to the di-rector, and a boys' dormitory in winter. Incidentally, Sharon Dexter (Illinois Epsilon) was married in June, so now there is a vacancy for assistant to the director. Pollard, next door, is used for summer only not being weatherized. And next door to Pollard is Stuart Cottage which houses our dormitory girls and housemother (Ruth Spelman, Illinois Epsilon). Due to a thoughtful Pi Phi (Mildred Cochran) Stuart lounge has been renovated. Many other gifts are in evidence as we tour. With merchant stamps alone almost thirty blankets were purchased this last year. Unfortunately we cannot list all here, but whatever gift large or small we thank you again. It is through such loyalty that this memorial to our Founders continues. The dormitory program must be mentioned fifteen to twenty boys and girls "live in." To describe an intangible is difficult, to measure the results is an impossibility, yet we staff members can "see" growth mental and social as well as physical. Increasing numbers of dormitory children participate in school activities the result of broadened horizons for these boys and girls. The verbal and living testimonials are rewarding. Year-round staff lives at Staff House and teachers for both summer and winter school. The dining room will accommodate seventy-five in summer workshop. During winter school twenty-five to thirty indulge in our native THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 47 cook's (Mrs. Adams) cuisine. Staff house is also the scene of many groups meetings throughout the year. Staff has its usual posts in the community civic, school, and church. The Southern Highland Guild Fair which is to be in Gatlinburg October 18-22 will require much preparation. Experts in many crafts will bring their displays and sales during the five-day period. An additional attraction at this time will be the exhibit of the American Craftsmen's Council. This is indeed an excellent opportunity for shopping for something "special." As we leave Staff house one notes our garden tended by Richard Watson. Orlie and Neal Watson continue with maintenance an eternal problem with plumbing, electricity, weeds and grass, etc. Orlie is completing his thirty-fourth year at Settlement School. We value his service through the years very highly. Now I see the patio (Virginia Green Patio) for the Red Barn! Here special gifts (Champaign-Urbana and Miami) provided furniture for the patio. Entering the barn we find further details in furnishings which have been added during the year, among them Pittsburgh's two hundred dollars for record player. Thirty-one beds are set up to accommodate groups, and for overnight eight portable cots and four sofas accommodating eight may be used, thus a total of forty-seven may be housed. The Barn/ Dorm was planned as a multiple-purpose building, so various educational groups or Pi Phi groups can be there. At the final party of Workshop over one hundred congregated in the Owls' Nest. Yes, there are increasing activities in our Barn/Dorm, and we trust additional workshops and interest groups will learn of our accommodations. Tomorrow "Time is not measured by the passing of years but by what one does, and what one achieves. Let us think not so much of what we have done, but of what we have left undone." Problems are not solved by merely lookingin a different direction. Let us look to the future and work for it purposefully at the same time keeping our past inheritance. Today is a transition from Yesterday to Tomorrow. Tomorrow's Settlement School will be what we make it by Today's labors! MARION WEBB MUELLER, Director Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Little Rock, Arkansas July 6, 1960 Members of The Committee Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Gatlinburg, Tennessee DEAR LADIES: We have audited the books, records, and supporting data of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee, May 31, 1960, and present for your use the following Exhibits prepared from our audit: Exhibit A Comparative Balance Sheet Exhibit B-1 Comparative Statement of Operations Our audit was made in conformity with generally accepted accounting standards ,and accordingly included such confirmations, tests, and analyses as were considered in this instance.

StandingCommittees COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION Extension continues to be a flourishing business for all men's and women's fraternities. For the 1957-59 NPC biennium there was reported the installation of 176 new chapters for the women's groups alone up to June 1, 1959. Added to that were over 80 new chapters last year. Aside from those groups where mergers took place there were some NPC groups which added as many as eleven and twelve new chapters in the two year period. Pi Beta Phi continues to have the largest number of initiated members, but shares with Delta Delta Delta the position of having the third largest chapter roll. Our own program has been one of conservatism, but one which has, we feel, been right for the fraternity and in conformance with the wishes of the membership. It is of interest to follow the trend of Pi Beta Phi extension through the 93 years following the establishment of our second chapter. The following figures give the picture of our growth. From 1867 to 1888 13 chapters installed 1889 to 1900 17 chapters installed 1901 to 1910 9 chapters installed 1911 to 1920 18 chapters installed 1921 to 1930 17 chapters installed 1931 to 1940 8 chapters installed 1941 to 1950 14 chapters installed 1951 to 1960 8 chapters installed While Pi Beta Phi has added only one new chapter to its roll during this just past interim of convention a number of inquiries have come to the fraternity. During the two year period there have been 69 inquiries concerning 32 different campuses. For the current year alone there were 40 inquiries about 21 campuses. They are as follows: East Carolina College, Greenville, North Carolina Mt. Saint Mary's College, Los Angeles, California University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky East Texas State College, Commerce, Texas Baylor University, Waco, Texas New York University, New York City, N.Y. Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, Indiana Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon Mississippi Southern College, Hattiesburg, Mississippi University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi College of The Pacific, Stockton, California Tennessee Wesleyan College, Athens, Tennessee University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin Portland State College, Portland, Oregon San Jose State College, San Jose, California La Crosse State Teachers' College, La Crosse, Wisconsin Wisconsin State College, Oshkosh, Wisconsin Murray State College, Murray, Kentucky Moravian College, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Longwood College, Farmville, Virginia Parsons College, Fairfield, Iowa. These various inquiries represent letters from Administrations, from local groups, from local individuals wanting to form a group to petition Pi Beta Phi, from official alumna club sources, and from individual members of the fraternity. Further, at the request of Pi Beta Phis the fraternity has placed on record a letter of interest should openings occur on the following campuses: University of Mississippi, Wake Forest, North Carolina, Memphis State, the University of Kentucky, and the University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida. When the expression of interest in having a chapter of Pi Beta Phi came from East Texas State College, Mississippi Southern College, Longwood College and Port-land State College the next step was taken in each case after the initial investigation seemed to show that this opportunity for extension held promise. Later when from a field of eight nationals Pi Beta Phi was chosen to be asked to colonize at Mississippi Southern the invitation was accepted. Mrs. Lewis, Director of Membership, and your NPC Delegate made a visit to the campus which resulted in the selection of six students on that campus and eight women in Hattiesburg who will form the nucleus of the group to be colonized during the formal rushing period next September. In regard to Portland State, the matter will be put before the convention. (N.B. This was done. Grand Council was authorized to proceed.) Opinions expressed concerning the other situations indicated that the membership did not wish to pursue further those opportunities. Our appreciation goes to those who have kept alert, and who have kept in touch with the Grand Council in order that Pi Beta Phi could be well advised in all matters of extension. MARIANNE REID WILD, NPC Delegate and Chairman of Extension HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE "So many smaller organizations, architects, and societies are recognizing that it is up to a comparatively small handful to preserve a past that is altogether too swiftly being eradicated by a `space age.' And we are so lucky to have the present Holt House as a nucleus with which to start." So wrote Eleanor Miller, a member of the Holt House committee, and an interior decorator with L. S. Ayers in Indianapolis, after she had seen Holt House for the first time. I think this sums up the feelings of the entire committee. Holt House is truly a lovely shrine to our founders, but not only is it a shrine, which is reason enough for its being, but it continues to fulfill an area need as a lovely, gracious setting for clubs, teas, showers, wedding receptions, and other social gatherings, to say nothing of the Pi Phi functions. It was used a total of 109 times from May '59 to April '60 with a total incomeof $510. 21 of the 109 were Pi Phi functions for which there is no charge. A special meeting of the committee was held in Mon-mouth March 29-30. Mrs. Johnson, our lovely hostess, had everything shining. While sipping coffee, and nibbling petit fours which Mrs. Johnson quietly served us so as not to disturb our busy discussions, one could almost feel the interest and enthusiasm being regenerated. We have plans for enlarging the kitchen, adding much needed storage and work space. We hope to have some of our lovely antiques refinished and re-upholstered. We need to replace some rugs and draperies. The outside needs some fill and landscaping. We've lost the use of the driveway next door, so need to construct one on Holt House property. These are our most immediate needs, and since they are mostly over and above the usual maintenance costs, 49
