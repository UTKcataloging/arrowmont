        News from Little P geon High Honor Accorded Jessie Harris by UT Jessie Wooten Harris, first Dean of the University of Tennessee College of Home Economics, was accorded a high honor by the University in October, 1964, when the new Jessie Harris Home Economics Building was dedicated. At the dedication program recognition was made of Dean Emeritus Harris's leadership in guiding the University of Tennessee Home Economics program to a position of national eminence in her 32 years of service. Dean Harris, 1936 Pi Beta Phi convention initiate, was honored by the faculty of the UT Home Economics Department and the Settlement School Staff with a tea at the Pi Beta Phi staff house. Miss Harris has seen the Pi Beta Phi Craft Workshop program develop to its present position of productivity and service, having been a founder of the project. She served as the University representative in the organization and was a faithful promoter of the project through the years until her retirement. Winning Program Presented Members of the North Shore Junior Alumnae Club met at the Northwestern University chapter house of Illinois Espilon last fall and expressed much interest in the award winning Settlement School program that was written by the chapter's Settlement School program chairman, Judy Weed. Illinois Epsilon's original program won the 1964 May L. Keller Settlement School Award. The pro-gram covers the many phases and accomplishments of the Settlement School and future developments at the School site in Gatlinburg, Tenn. This honor for Illinois Epsilon and the enjoyable evening it afforded for both chapter members and the North Shore Junior Alumnae serves as a re-minder that the time is near at hand for submission of Settlement School programs for consideration in the selection of a 1965 May L. Keller Award winner. The award carries a $25 cash gift and goes to the chapter which submits the most outstanding pro-gram given to inform members about the Settlement School philanthropy. Copies of programs to be considered for the awards should be sent by May 1st to: Mrs. Floyd H.

Last year it was won by Hellyn Moore, talented University of New Mexico craft major. Her enthusiastic letter of appreciation for the opportunity to study in the Craft Workshop will undoubtedly serve as an inspiration to others. She wrote in part .. . "I am a senior crafts major at the University of New Mexico. Last spring the Pi Beta Phi Scholar-ship was offered to all craft majors. After looking at the brochures about the Workshop, I became quite interested, so I submitted examples of my craft work and letters of recommendation to the Pi Phi jury. "I feel quite fortunate that I was chosen to at-tend the workshop. The experience was most beneficial and I was tremendously impressed with the excellent quality and amazing quantity of work done. "The skills learned have already been of great value to me and two articles I made there were exhibited in a Contemporary Craftsmen of New Mexico show last fall. I know that I will continue to benefit as I further my study of crafts in graduate school. "There is much more to be said about how really excellent I felt the instruction was. I have given two talks here concerning my summer, one to the Crafts Department and one to the Pi Phi chapter and I think the listeners were as impressed as I was with the Workshop and the work done there."
