        Innovative Rush Is Successful by CAROL WOODWARD Arizona Beta LAST spring the Panhellenic Council of Arizona State University elected a Pi Phi, Lynn Melczer, to serve as its rush chairman. Immediately after taking office, Lynn was faced with preparing the spring rush program. The bouncy five foot blonde, known for her liberal views and desire to try anything new (when the old proved outdated), proposed a new style of rush to the council. Among the changes she suggested were No rush outfits, No restrictions on the chapters as to what type of parties they were to have, and No decorations. The council readily approved her program and a much more relaxed and casual rush proved to be the result. The chapters, free to show themselves as they really were, came up with some unique parties. One sorority, chose to have a taffy pull, one played volleyball, and another went to the local pizza parlor for dinner. The rush proved to be so successful that plans for a similar program were started for the fall. This time Lynn decided to really let go of the old rush traditions. First, she decided to change the title of rush to Greek Orientation Week, and rushees were called prospective members, students, or women. Rush week, now orientation week, was cut from five to four days, pros-pective members were allowed to see boys during the day (a practice commonly prohibited), rush outfits weren't to be worn except the first day, there were to be no floor decorations except small door tags, and only limited refreshments could be served (usually coke or iced tea). The prospective members were told to bring only casual clothes, (pants, jeans, or shorts were worn by most). Party budgets were usually limited to about fifteen dollars. Many other changes were included all for the purpose of cutting out the falsity of rush. The student experienced a much more relaxing week and the sororities saved themselves much expense and precious time previously used in setting up elaborate decorations and making impractical dress outfits. Three results proved the effectiveness of the program. First, 14 per cent more girls were pledged. Second, there seemed to be a new air of freshness and intersorority friendliness prevailing. The felt pressure of competition as to whose decorations or outfits were best was gone. The sororities had worked together more as a system. Third, the new members really knew what a sorority had to offer. They saw exactly what they had joined and seemed much more excited about pledging than in the past. Lynn received many well deserved compliments on her new program, and the Phi Phis at A.S.U. really had a member to be proud of. Although fall rush is over, Lynn" still has many activities to keep herself busy. These include Arkesis and, of course, Panhellenic and I.F.C.-Panhellenic Executive councils. Named to Glamour Magazines' Top Ten List Anne Moller, California Beta, has been named one of Glamour Magazine's Ten Out-standing College Girls of 1971. Anne is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Halbert Moller of Phoenix, Ariz., and was graduated in the spring from the University of California at Berkeley. Glamour's Ten Outstanding College Girls contest is an annual search for college girls who represent the best of each year's changing cam-pus life. Every college that enrolls women was invited to select one girl on the basis of her leadership in some worthwhile activity either on campus or in the community politics, the arts, social services, the sciences, special honors, fellowship or field work programs and her commitment to doing something about her world. The winners were selected by a panel of Glamour editors. Anne, interested in student government and a leader at meetings, was a member of the University of California's chancellor's advisory group and was an executive student body officer during her junior year. She led in the struggle, for students rights in the California Higher education system. As a winner in the contest, Anne was Glamour's guest in New York City where she was photographed by a leading photographer. With the other nine winners, she was featured in the August College issue and received an all-expense-paid trip to a foreign country, along with a personal gift from the editors of Glamour. 32 News of THE PRIDE OF PI BETA PHI.

This was just one bit of enthusiasm ex-pressed by Mrs. Joseph Reyes of San Anselmo, Calif., when she returned from Arrowmont last summer. Mrs. Reyes was the recipient of the first scholarship offered by the Marin Alumni Club, who had raised enough money to pay Mrs. Reyes' full tuition, room, and board for a two week session. Carol Reyes has been a fourth grade teacher in Marin for the past five years. She is sharing the knowledge she gained at Arrowmont with her pupils this year. She concentrated on pottery, enameling, and making silver jewelry, and only the limitation of the time kept her from enrolling in textiles classes. Mrs. Reyes has great praise for the equipment available at Arrowmont. She described the saw with which she cut sheets of silver for a pen (Continued on page 36) Carol Reyes shares her Arrowmont experiences with her son, Rex, 11, who is holding a dulcimer from the Gatlinburg area.

The total enrollment in 1971 was 750, with the students coming from 38 states and 4 foreign countries the Bahamas, Canada, England, and the Virgin Islands. Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, says, "What a great summer we had 306 more students than last year. People were calling from all over the country to try to get into classes. Many had to be turned away because we did not have enough dormitory rooms or laboratory space. At one session we had 121 students be-cause some were financially able to live in motels.

The young are astonished to learn that someone over 25 can be part of a group. The older ones are delighted to learn that many of these seemingly far-out students are just great young people. As we are known as a conservative and structured school, not many of those who desire not to conform apply for admission.

What Apply NOW Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts, Gatlinburg, Tenn. 37738 35 Who Needs Arrowmont? by ELEANOR B. LEHNER PI BETA PHI needs Arrowmont. Gatlinburg needs Arrowmont. The fraternity system needs Arrowmont as an example to emulate. The U.S. needs Arrowmont as a "national cultural center." Most important, students need Arrowmont. Many young people today do not want a full college education. They prefer to learn to create with their hands. For lack of adequate facilities, many become drifters instead. In Arrowmont, Pi Beta Phis can fulfill a new philanthropic mission. The young people who need Arrowmont are not asking for welfare or charity. They wish only the opportunity to purchase something which they badly need and which we have the power to provide. What the Settlement School did for a single mountain area, Arrowmont can do for a wider hosizon. Arrowmont, however, is not only for the young. Students of all ages are welcome. Some of these students will follow in the footsteps of world-famous artist-teachers. Some will instruct the handicapped or make life brighter for senior citizens or stimulate other talented youngsters. Some will create for their own pleasure. Others will create for needed income. Many will discover that Arrowmont has changed their lives. During a three-week visit to Arrowmont this summer I met and observed the students. Among them was a surgeon, blinded by diabetes, who was studying macrame. Another was a therapist, handicapped herself, who teaches crafts to disabled hospital patients. At one typical two-week session there were 112 students from 27 states and one foreign country. There were professors, teachers, collegians, house-wives, war veterans, retirees, recreation supervisors, writers, librarians, professional craftsmen, home economists, artists, a dentist, a nurse, an anthropologist, a biologist, a pharmacist, an auditor, a real estate broker, a meditation instructor, a waitress, and a water condition treatment consultant. After a few days, age . differences were forgotten. In private conversations with teachers I was told repeatedly that students who wish to studycrafts seriously cannot find any other school that offers what Arrowmont offers. Students who wish to study throughout the year do not know where to go, and the teachers are hardpressed to offer advice. All classes at Arrowmont are conducted under the auspices of the University of Tennessee College of Home Economics through its Department of Crafts and Interior Design. Marian G. Heard, a distinguished professor award winner at UT, has directed the craft workshops since their inception. The students are devoted to her. She is a knowledgeable executive with a talent for obtaining cooperation by providing inspiration. To date, Arrowmont has been able to schedule only summer sessions. To expand its activities Arrowmont needs the help and enthusiasm of every chapter and club. The cost of paying for and maintaining the buildings goes on even when classes are not in session. This cost might be lessened by scheduling pay-as-they-go conferences and workshops. Conference centers are much in demand nowadays, and Arrowmont facilities can be converted to a variety of uses. The most pressing need is for additional dormitory space to accommodate those who would like to use the facilities. Arrowmont is a project every Pi Phi can be proud of a unique fraternity philanthropy. A recent comprehensive master plan requested by the Gatlinburg City Council noted "the opportunity afforded by the Arrowmont School: the opportunity for Gatlinburg to be known nation-ally as a cultural center as well as a resort." A Pi Beta Phi National Cultural Center! Our support and our donations can make this vision a reality.

This draws people into Arrowcraft more readily than the former steps with the long walk to the door. The City of Gatlinburg recently widened the street in front of Arrowcraft Shop, taking out the curve near Baskin's Creek Bridge. When the bridge was widened, a new railing had to be made. The Director of Arrowcraft Shop, Lucile Woodworth, was permitted to submit plans for the bridge rail in keeping with our frontage on the parkway. Our architect, Hubert Bebb, contributed the plans. It has improved the corner and set another example for the preservation of the rustic mountain appearance for the City of Gatlinburg. Daily appreciation is voiced by visitors for our setting, Arrowcraft, the Mall, and the Gates our face to the public.

She and her co-pilot are members of the Bakersfield chapter of 99s (International Ninety-Nines, Inc.), international organization of women pi-lots. Joan is also a member of junior League of Bakersfield. Joan flew her Beachcraft Bonanza on the nearly 2500 mile route, July 5 to 8, from Calgary to Baton Rouge, La. Enroute airports, either mandatory fly-bys or "must-stops," were Great Falls and Billings, Mont., Rapid City, S.D., Denver, Colo., McCook and Lincoln, Nebr., St. Louis, Mo., and Little Rock, Ark. She and co-pilot, Patty Piper, finished in the middle third,and received a money award for the second fastest leg between Denver and Lincoln. The Powder Puff Derby is open to all qualified women pilots flying eligible stock model aircraft, single or multi-engine of 145 to 600 horsepower, manufactured within the last ten years. Makes and models of aircraft are handicapped for their "Par Speed" according to best figures available from manufacturers' data. Contestants are scored according to their ground speed in relation to their handicaps. The race is flown in daylight hours and under Visual Flight Rules only. The Bakersfield entrants prepared for their first Derby attempt by pre-flying the race route with Joan's sister, Shirley Tanner Cote, California Gamma, of Newport Beach, Calif., also a Derby competitor. Shirley has already acquired racing trophies, having won or placed in several local speed races and finishing 4th in the Angel Derby flown from Columbus, Ohio, to Managua, Nicaragua. Shirley finished 15th in this year's Powder Puff Derby. The 1971 AWTAR awarded trophies plus cash prizes of nearly $25,000, with $10,000 going to the winner. Joan and her co-pilot also have been assisting the local Women's Medical Auxiliary by air lifting medical supplies to the Santa Barbara, Calif., headquarters of the Direct Relief Foundation for distribution to countries throughout the free world. The "99s" originated in 1929 and derived its name from the ninety-nine original founding members. Amelia Earhart was the organization's first chairman. Two Travel With Chorale Wyoming Alpha is especially proud of two of its talented members. Pi Phis Paula Baker and Lucy Johnston let their musical ability show through as they earned positions with the University of Wyoming Collegiate Chorale this year. The 70-member mixed group was selected early this fall in tryouts conducted by the choir's director. Because of the small size, it is considered an honor to be a member of the Chorale. The girls have even more reason to be excited as the choir is planning a concert tour of Europe during the summer of '72. 39

This draws people into Arrowcraft more readily than the former steps with the long walk to the door. The City of Gatlinburg recently widened the street in front of Arrowcraft Shop, taking out the curve near Baskin's Creek Bridge. When the bridge was widened, a new railing had to be made. The Director of Arrowcraft Shop, Lucile Woodworth, was permitted to submit plans for the bridge rail in keeping with our frontage on the parkway. Our architect, Hubert Bebb, contributed the plans. It has improved the corner and set another example for the preservation of the rustic mountain appearance for the City of Gatlinburg. Daily appreciation is voiced by visitors for our setting, Arrowcraft, the Mall, and the Gates our face to the public.

Immediately after taking office, Lynn was faced with preparing the spring rush program. The bouncy five foot blonde, known for her liberal views and desire to try anything new (when the old proved outdated), proposed a new style of rush to the council. Among the changes she suggested were No rush outfits, No restrictions on the chapters as to what type of parties they were to have, and No decorations. The council readily approved her program and a much more relaxed and casual rush proved to be the result. The chapters, free to show themselves as they really were, came up with some unique parties. One sorority, chose to have a taffy pull, one played volleyball, and another went to the local pizza parlor for dinner. The rush proved to be so successful that plans for a similar program were started for the fall. This time Lynn decided to really let go of the old rush traditions. First, she decided to change the title of rush to Greek Orientation Week, and rushees were called prospective members, students, or women. Rush week, now orientation week, was cut from five to four days, pros-pective members were allowed to see boys during the day (a practice commonly prohibited), rush outfits weren't to be worn except the first day, there were to be no floor decorations except small door tags, and only limited refreshments could be served (usually coke or iced tea). The prospective members were told to bring only casual clothes, (pants, jeans, or shorts were worn by most). Party budgets were usually limited to about fifteen dollars. Many other changes were included all for the purpose of cutting out the falsity of rush. The student experienced a much more relaxing week and the sororities saved themselves much expense and precious time previously used in setting up elaborate decorations and making impractical dress outfits. Three results proved the effectiveness of the program. First, 14 per cent more girls were pledged. Second, there seemed to be a new air of freshness and intersorority friendliness prevailing. The felt pressure of competition as to whose decorations or outfits were best was gone. The sororities had worked together more as a system. Third, the new members really knew what a sorority had to offer. They saw exactly what they had joined and seemed much more excited about pledging than in the past. Lynn received many well deserved compliments on her new program, and the Phi Phis at A.S.U. really had a member to be proud of. Although fall rush is over, Lynn" still has many activities to keep herself busy. These include Arkesis and, of course, Panhellenic and I.F.C.-Panhellenic Executive councils. Named to Glamour Magazines' Top Ten List Anne Moller, California Beta, has been named one of Glamour Magazine's Ten Out-standing College Girls of 1971. Anne is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Halbert Moller of Phoenix, Ariz., and was graduated in the spring from the University of California at Berkeley. Glamour's Ten Outstanding College Girls contest is an annual search for college girls who represent the best of each year's changing cam-pus life. Every college that enrolls women was invited to select one girl on the basis of her leadership in some worthwhile activity either on campus or in the community politics, the arts, social services, the sciences, special honors, fellowship or field work programs and her commitment to doing something about her world. The winners were selected by a panel of Glamour editors. Anne, interested in student government and a leader at meetings, was a member of the University of California's chancellor's advisory group and was an executive student body officer during her junior year. She led in the struggle, for students rights in the California Higher education system. As a winner in the contest, Anne was Glamour's guest in New York City where she was photographed by a leading photographer. With the other nine winners, she was featured in the August College issue and received an all-expense-paid trip to a foreign country, along with a personal gift from the editors of Glamour. 32 News of THE PRIDE OF PI BETA PHI. Nestled in the mountains of Gatlinburg, the Emma Harper Turner classroom building reflects its natural surroundings through its outstanding architecture.

This was just one bit of enthusiasm ex-pressed by Mrs. Joseph Reyes of San Anselmo, Calif., when she returned from Arrowmont last summer. Mrs. Reyes was the recipient of the first scholarship offered by the Marin Alumni Club, who had raised enough money to pay Mrs. Reyes' full tuition, room, and board for a two week session. Carol Reyes has been a fourth grade teacher in Marin for the past five years. She is sharing the knowledge she gained at Arrowmont with her pupils this year. She concentrated on pottery, enameling, and making silver jewelry, and only the limitation of the time kept her from enrolling in textiles classes. Mrs. Reyes has great praise for the equipment available at Arrowmont. She described the saw with which she cut sheets of silver for a pen (Continued on page 36) Carol Reyes shares her Arrowmont experiences with her son, Rex, 11, who is holding a dulcimer from the Gatlinburg area.

(Mountain Visitor photo.) 34 '71 Summer Session Is A Success THE largest and most successful summer workshop was held last summer in seven sessions from June 14 to August 20 in the beautiful Emma Harper Turner Classroom Building. The total enrollment in 1971 was 750, with the students coming from 38 states and 4 foreign countries the Bahamas, Canada, England, and the Virgin Islands. Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, says, "What a great summer we had 306 more students than last year. People were calling from all over the country to try to get into classes. Many had to be turned away because we did not have enough dormitory rooms or laboratory space. At one session we had 121 students be-cause some were financially able to live in motels. Our staff was excellent and most generous Rick Meisenback, at the potter's wheel, shapes and molds wet clay by hand. (Mountain Visitor photo.) with their time and talents. They were much impressed with Arrowmont the spirit, the high standards, the organization and the facilities. "The students were from all types of back-grounds, all ages and attending for all sorts of reasons. The young, as well as the older students, enjoy (after the first shock-wave) the intermingling of ages. This is an education for both. The young are astonished to learn that someone over 25 can be part of a group. The older ones are delighted to learn that many of these seemingly far-out students are just great young people. As we are known as a conservative and structured school, not many of those who desire not to conform apply for admission. "Arrowmont has a great potential and we are wealthy in that we have a product much in demand and increasing each year with a fine reputation behind us of excellence. There is a long and exciting road ahead for full realization of the Arrowmont dream."

What Apply NOW Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts, Gatlinburg, Tenn. 37738 35 Who Needs Arrowmont? by ELEANOR B. LEHNER PI BETA PHI needs Arrowmont. Gatlinburg needs Arrowmont. The fraternity system needs Arrowmont as an example to emulate. The U.S. needs Arrowmont as a "national cultural center." Most important, students need Arrowmont. Many young people today do not want a full college education. They prefer to learn to create with their hands. For lack of adequate facilities, many become drifters instead. In Arrowmont, Pi Beta Phis can fulfill a new philanthropic mission. The young people who need Arrowmont are not asking for welfare or charity. They wish only the opportunity to purchase something which they badly need and which we have the power to provide. What the Settlement School did for a single mountain area, Arrowmont can do for a wider hosizon. Arrowmont, however, is not only for the young. Students of all ages are welcome. Some of these students will follow in the footsteps of world-famous artist-teachers. Some will instruct the handicapped or make life brighter for senior citizens or stimulate other talented youngsters. Some will create for their own pleasure. Others will create for needed income. Many will discover that Arrowmont has changed their lives. During a three-week visit to Arrowmont this summer I met and observed the students. Among them was a surgeon, blinded by diabetes, who was studying macrame. Another was a therapist, handicapped herself, who teaches crafts to disabled hospital patients. At one typical two-week session there were 112 students from 27 states and one foreign country. There were professors, teachers, collegians, house-wives, war veterans, retirees, recreation supervisors, writers, librarians, professional craftsmen, home economists, artists, a dentist, a nurse, an anthropologist, a biologist, a pharmacist, an auditor, a real estate broker, a meditation instructor, a waitress, and a water condition treatment consultant. After a few days, age . differences were forgotten. In private conversations with teachers I was told repeatedly that students who wish to studycrafts seriously cannot find any other school that offers what Arrowmont offers. Students who wish to study throughout the year do not know where to go, and the teachers are hardpressed to offer advice. All classes at Arrowmont are conducted under the auspices of the University of Tennessee College of Home Economics through its Department of Crafts and Interior Design. Marian G. Heard, a distinguished professor award winner at UT, has directed the craft workshops since their inception. The students are devoted to her. She is a knowledgeable executive with a talent for obtaining cooperation by providing inspiration. To date, Arrowmont has been able to schedule only summer sessions. To expand its activities Arrowmont needs the help and enthusiasm of every chapter and club. The cost of paying for and maintaining the buildings goes on even when classes are not in session. This cost might be lessened by scheduling pay-as-they-go conferences and workshops. Conference centers are much in demand nowadays, and Arrowmont facilities can be converted to a variety of uses. The most pressing need is for additional dormitory space to accommodate those who would like to use the facilities. Arrowmont is a project every Pi Phi can be proud of a unique fraternity philanthropy. A recent comprehensive master plan requested by the Gatlinburg City Council noted "the opportunity afforded by the Arrowmont School: the opportunity for Gatlinburg to be known nation-ally as a cultural center as well as a resort."
