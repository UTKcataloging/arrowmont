A letter in athletics Because play is an essential part of life. Athletic contests some of them are play at its best for a normal, healthy man. 2. A grade average of "B" Grade "C" or "D" usually means shoddy work and that's bad habit. "A" for me would require a grind and neglect of life which I refuse. "B" is all that's left. 3. Time for some real friendships, both men and women Life's chief value finally is friends. These four years must not be friendless or hurriedly, superficially "friendly." 4. Some real piece of service on the campus or in the community A great growing selfish life "There ain't no such animal." 5. To do well what I do It's a slow college that has less than fifty extra-curricular activities on the campus. Well, about forty-six of these I would let the other fellow run and I would "saw wood" on the few that seemed to me of the most value. Would I date and "Say It With Flowers ?" Sure, but I wouldn't talk myseff hoarse saying it. Would I join a fraternity if I had a chance? By all means, for through the medium of the fraternity I would be able more easily to attain those other things for which I would aim. Fraternity Month, June 1950 . _Troe Settlement School eports 1t, CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE IN VIRGINIA lives a wood-carver whose output runs heavily to bears. He carves them swiftly and unerringly from almost any sort of wood. Each one has a remarkably individual bearishness. "I don't see how you can do it so easily," said one as she watched his quick knife. "Well, ma'am," explained the wood-carver, "I just look at a little block of wood 'til I see the b'ar; then I cut away the wood, and thar's the b'ar!" Perhaps that is what happened in Pi Beta Phi. They just kept lookin' and whittlin' and all at once, there was a pretty sizable b'ar, the Settlement School, carved out of the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee for all to see and admire. It is true that the original site-selection committee did not altogether have in mind a beautiful setting for our school, as that was not the primary purpose, but it would have had to seek far to find a lovelier one. It is colorful from early spring until the frosts bring the fall foliage into full colors. Last month the Committee received great inspiration for its meeting from the hills where the new young forest greens were combined with the iridescent whiteness of the dogwoods and here and there a wild flaming azalea for contrast. Because primarily the fraternity plan was for a project in Tennessee which embraced the three Rs, perhaps it is wise to start with a resume of our educational program. From our beginnings in 1912 with one teacher and one school room to benefit the thirteen pupils, the program expanded year by year with other grades being added as the enrollment increased. In the twenties not only was a grade school building erected but an 'extension plan had been inaugurated at Sugarlands, now a part of the Smoky Mountain National Park. With the start of the thirties the school had grown ' into ten grades with an enrollment of one hundred seventy. The county then paid the salary of four teachers. A new building was erected for the use of the high school grades and 1936 found us with a complete high school curriculum, thus offering our young people full 'educational opportunities through the twelfth year. In the late thirties and early forties, two surveys of our program were made. Both recommended that we turn over to the County the costs of maintaining the school as fast as the County could assume that burden and by 1943 the community and the fraternity convinced the County that it could assume the costs of basic education and offer to Gatlinburg as much as it gave the other schools of the County. A satisfactory Lease-Agreement was drawn up between the fraternity and the County to cover a period of twenty-five years. Since then, from time to time, we have added supplementary courses Physical Education, Music, and Arts and Crafts to increase the physical well-being of the young people and to expand their natural skills. In 1947 the State School 'Planning Commission recommended an immediate building program to care for the fast increasing enrollment. At that time the Grand Council and the Settlement School Committee unanimously agreed to deed 1.8 acres of our property to the County and to draw up a new Lease-Agreement for a longer period of time. However, the Planning Commission felt that the grade and high schoolsshould be kept together and be erected on County owned, not leased, property. For two years the County sought to purchase acreage in Gatlinburg, in order to satisfy the Commission but found only inflated purchase prices. Again the County Board of Education came to Pi Beta Phi. (For more complete details see Information Arrows: 1948, Page 94; 1949, Page 59.) After numerous conferences with the people of the Community and the County Board, ably handled by Miss Onken, and with legal advice, the Council and the Committee, for the second time, agreed to deed about two acres to the County and draw up a new Lease-Agreement on a fifty year basis instead of the original twenty-five year plan, but on the same general terms. This was done and at present writing the first unit of a new grade school plant is in process of construction. It will be ready for the opening of school. This unit accommodates six grades and later a second will be added, at which time our grade school building will revert to us. For the information of those who have visited the Settlement School, the new building stands between our grade school and Teachers' Cottage and the balance of deeded land lies behind Teachers' Cottage. It should not b'e our desire to relinquish entirely our supervision nor to remove our helping influence. Perhaps our guidance is needed as never before. The mountaineer of pioneer stock is now outnumbered by the outsiders who have come to 'Gatlinburg but his family still needs our aid in preserving this native heritage of staunch ideals, integrity and intelligence. This year Mr. Walter Ogle, once a pupil in our school, has served as Superintendent and High School principal and has won the respect of both students and community. He is eager to work with Pi Beta Phi and appreciates Miss Dyer's counsel. Physical Education was taught by William J. Miracle, University of Tennessee graduate. In addition to special emphasis on Basketball, he introduced other sports in season and completed each activity with a tournament among the classes. The intramural competition was new and increased general interest in sports for girls and boys. The inauguration of base-ball as a spring sport which could be supported by a small school such as Gatlinburg was well received. The cooperation of the American Legion in loaning uniforms and their playing field was a great help. In Music, Mrs. Althea Armstrong has continued working with all 'eight grades and the high school to broaden each pupil's musical appreciation. Major pro-grams were a Stephen Foster evening; the Christmas presentation of Satis Coleman's "Mystery of the Nativity" in pantomine and introducing rare carols of many countries; the pretentious musical, "The 'Snow Queen" by Cooke. This latter production at the close of the school year used almost one hundred children's voices and would do credit to a much larger school. The lead was sung by Barbara Steele who with Paul Clabo 'entertained us on the Settlement School pro-gram in 1948. Various smaller groups and the high school chorus gave programs before several local and county organizations. In Arts and 'Crafts, creative expression was stressed in the lower grades through the media of chalk, char-coal and paint. Poster making in all grades was re-warded by cash prizes from the American Legion 69 70 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Auxiliary for their poppy posters. The fifth grade produced three original plays for glove puppets all of which were made by the children themselves. Chalk murals, soap carving, metal repousee and making "tie dye" scarves were other activities. In the higher grades some outstanding results were evident in metal work, bowls, ash-trays, candle-holders, coasters. Weaving occupied the winter months for the girls, while stenciled luncheon sets and aprons were out-lets for basic designing. The boys found these subjects beneath them but painting had great appeal. Miss Van Roekel and Mr. Miracle were co-sponsors of the junior class and Miss Van, as the children call her, directed their class play. Her ability to make the backdrops put her in special demand on other occasions also. It is with extreme regret that we accept Miss Van Roekel's resignation in order for her to continue her education toward a Master's degree at Cranbrook. The Committee was greatly impressed with the progress of the Woodworking class under the super-vision of Mr. Carl Huskey, who had a part-time pro-gram for the high school boys. Each made some article for the home--a lamp, coffee table, book ends or magazine rack. For those boys not going on to college this course is a practical one toward seeking employment in one of the several furniture factories near-by. The Health Center is a true center for school, community and district or as our nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, describes it, "a cooperative, not exactly community cooperative, but nation-wide . . . composed of people from all walks of life, all parts of the country, all working for the service of mankind." Under the nurse's leadership, the days are filled with inoculations, first aid, talks on health, nutrition or safety. She has papers to be written and delivered be-fore Knoxville or other Tennessee organizations, writes a weekly "Health Shot" column for the local paper. Through the latter medium she is able to pre-scribe many sugared bits of health admonition. This year the County Health Department arranged for twenty clinics in which the first graders were given medical examination now required by Tennessee law. Two of the clinics were held at our Health Center, one for Gatlinburg and the other for the five nearby rural schools. The two local doctors officiated. Hereafter, the state-wide clinics will be held in the summer in order that remedial defects may be corrected and necessary inoculations given before the start of school. Our little babies continue to hold the spotlight and it is indeed a matter of pride that not one baby has been lost this past year; one premature was returned to the hospital incubator for a time. In our part of Sevier County there are but three children of school age as yet unable to attend. One is a spastic and the others, post polio cases. All receive regular instruction from the State Homebound teacher. A small six year old boy, totally deaf as the result of an attack of meningitis has been placed in the Tennessee School for the Deaf. Our constant efforts toward good health for the younger generation have borne fruit. Very successful was the day spent in assisting the technicians who brought their large mobile X-ray unit from the Division of Tuberculosis Control to the Health Center where more than seven hundred were processed. We are very grateful to Sigma Phi Gamma who through their welfare work for mountain children help to provide fitted glasses and dental care. This year nine children were cared for. There is a gradualawakening to the health needs of the community and there are encouraging signs which reflect our influence over the long period. Most recent is the cornpletion of a new system of pure water for the town and when its citizens finally sense the danger of only local sewage systems, one more of our great concerns will be at an end. There is always more to be accomplished at the Health Center than can be done, be it summer or winter, but the unselfish service contributed to school and community is felt throughout the countryside and Marjorie is loved by all the children. It may be that less need be written about Arrow Craft than any other department since all are so keenly cognizant of it through the beauty of its wares. Under Ethel Snow's capable management Arrow Craft has had an excellent year. We appreciate your sales because the school could not operate with-out them and we solicit the participation of even the smallest clubs for, in addition to the increased in-come, it gives us the subsequent fine publicity which the products indeed merit. Though they were by no means leading in membership, last year fourteen clubs each sold more than a thousand dollars worth of goods. This year there are nine with two of them exceeding the two thousand dollar mark. Here is the list: Houston, Texas, $2220.24; Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, $2120.98; Portland, Oregon, $1890.00; Albuquerque, New Mexico, $1596.39; Marin County, California, $1398.21; Denver, Colorado, $1339.15; Cleveland East, Ohio, $1326.73; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, $1278.63 ; Omaha, Nebraska, $1210.08. Those considered are only those whose money in these amounts had been received at Arrow Craft by the time of audit. To them and many others, a heartfelt "Thank your" It would give Arrow Craft fewer headaches and the Committee far less the appearance of ogres if every club or chapter would make complete payment in full or return the unsold goods for credit after the annual sale. No business, large or small, can operate without cash and no shop gives unlimited credit, does it? With an ever increasing number of enthusiastic alumnae clubs we ask for more sales but we also ask that each club give more thought to why Pi Beta Phi is conducting its Arrow Craft Shop and how much better use there is for the money there than lying idly in some local bank. The design and colors of Arrow Craft products continue to gladden the eye of all who see them. Tina McMorran has brought to her work a concept of the practical as well as the beautiful. At the suggestion of the Committee, she set to work to reduce the tremendous stock of raw materials on hand, necessarily purchased during wartime shortages, and ingeniously she has cut that inventory; at the same time, not knowing what economic turn might come, she has operated on a greatly reduced budget, dropping those items less in demand and reducing the quantity of others. Unfortunately this has meant a temporary reduction in the number of weavers but with the present furore of the chain stores for woven nylon bags, those released have found work elsewhere. This past year our insurance has been carried on a monthly inventory basis, a sound protection against loss. One interesting demand this spring is for the longer and brighter neck-tie. This has prompted the weaving of some tie material in Aunt Lizzie's old three harness twill pattern which throws more color to the top, with clearer stronger colors. Izora, long one of our good weavers, feels great pride in being chosen to carry on Aunt Lizzie's weave and she will demonstrate THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 71 its use at the Craftsman's Fair late this summer. Tina has worked toward a Master Craftsman award this year and received it from the Southern Highlands Handicrafts Guild at its spring meeting. This is only the third given by this Guild and there are but twelve in the country. She was asked by the University of Tennessee to be one of a very limited few to attend its two-week weaving short course this winter and was also honored in being asked to teach in the Guild Workshop at the Penland, N.C. School of Crafts last fall. We must not fail to mention the attractive little shop maintained by Arrow Craft in one corner of the Mountain View Hotel, now presided over by Mrs. McCutchean, mother and grandmother . of Pi Beta Phis. Her love of our products, combined with a wide acquaintance among the hotel guests, makes her a worthy proponent of sales. No hour is too early nor too late to accommodate the departing guest in her purchase of last minute carry-home gifts. This year our Grand Vice President offered a prize to the Pi Phi submitting a poster suitable for advertising sales of Arrow Craft products. The Committee appreciated Mrs. Wild's offer and regretted that none of the designs submitted seemed exactly to meet the needs at this time, according to the judges from the University of Tennessee Crafts faculty who considered them. One special item of interest ere we leave the Arrow Craft department: The Director of Cultural Affairs for the State Department in Washington D.C. has contacted Pi Beta Phi often in the last few years since foreign visitors and students wish to take back the profitable use of native materials to their own countries. The State Department has honored Pi Beta Phi in sending, when possible, both men and women from foreign countries to visit the Settlement School. The most recent occasion was the Prime-Minister and his wife, the Begum Ali-Kahn of Pakistan. She spoke fluent English and held two degrees from the University of her native land. The Begum was most anxious to learn of our industries in order to further assist the women of her country in the establishment of their Cottage Industries. It would seem, therefore, that our service to people has gone afar and we are honored that the State Department so highly classifies our Settlement School. Earlier in this report we mentioned the surveys which had been made of our project in Gatlinburg as they applied to the educational program. These surveys placed great emphasis on the opportunity Pi Beta Phi had in the Southern Highlands for the furthering of the native crafts and since that time an effort has been made to that end. This summer is the sixth for our Summer Workshop. It has passed its "trial and error" period and in the opinion of the present staff, the 1950 organization is running more smoothly than any year. It has been a matter of mutual satisfaction to the University of Tennessee and to Pi Beta Phi to work together for the success of this annual six week project. Miss Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design at the University, again serves as Director but the whole staff of the Applied Arts Department unites in lending its own or helping to find the best possible instruction. We are eternally grateful to Miss Jessie W. Harris, Pi Beta Phi Convention initiate in 1938, head of the Home Economics Department at the University, for her constant inspiration, wise help in planning, and her expert belief in the Settlement School program. For the first three weeks of the six weeks' Workshop there are twenty-one states represented by fifty-four students. Thirty-one are graduatestudents, seven are undergraduates and sixteen are enrolled as non-credit pupils. Twenty-nine of these will remain for the full six-week period. Until such time as larger housing facilities are available, further expansion is impossible. Miss Dyer and her corps of workers completely transform our grade school building into a dormitory. It is an herculean task with less than two weeks between the closing of school and the opening of the Workshop. Every vacant cranny is made available to those in attendance. The Gateway Players, a stock company of New York, will again transform our gymnasium-auditorium into a theater for six weeks, paying rent to us and providing excellent casts in good plays as entertainment for summer visitors. Pi Beta Phi reserves Friday night for the P.T.A. for a money-making plan. The P.T.A. has done a magnificent piece of work in raising money for its school cafeteria where all the school year, two paid cooks, the assisting mothers in turn, with the aid of government surpluses provide hot, well-balanced school lunches. It provided new basket-ball uniforms for the girls' team and in various other ways has assisted the school program. The Craftsman's Fair will make its third appearance on the Pi Beta Phi campus in late July and again Governor Browning will officiate at the opening. Here will be demonstrated the makings of many handicrafts of that area and the native folk dances. Also there will be a great exhibit and sale of the best under each classification. Pi Beta Phi through its membership in the Southern Highlands Handicrafts Guild shares the responsibility in staging this under-taking. One's pride increases, knowing the part the fraternity has played in the renaissance of these native crafts. At this Convention we hope to bring a widened vision of what the Crafts are in the Southern Appalachians and what the preservation of this early Americana means to that area. Last but by no means least in the year round picture is the regular staff which keeps the Committee policies in operation. Miss Ruth Dyer in her six years as Director has found no consistent pattern for each day brings new activities and new problems. There have been seven dormitory students this year, five of whom have just graduated, so we shall have room for new material in September. Each boy or girl enters the dormitory only after a clear under-standing with the parents that their boy or girl is to work a certain number of hours in part payment for room and board. This, together with our financial assistance in running a bus to distant Elkmont for students, is important Extension service. A number of years ago the auditors for the Settlement School advised, as for any good business, that certain amounts be set aside each year for depreciation. Since then all committees have budgeted toward a Sinking Fund to cover this. The present committee at its recent meeting came to an important decision after studying the contents of this Sinking Fund, taking into account the $17,000, final generous bequest from the Garshwiler estate, and the prospects in contributions and continued Arrow Craft sales, that now is the time to erect a new Staff House. Several reasons controlled the decision to proceed. 'Part of our staff has been domiciled in Pollard Hall which was originally the old Ogle family farmhouse. It also houses the dormitory boys and the dining rooms and kitchen for all. If Pollard is much longer used, extensive repairs will be necessary, for termites and old age take their toll; should more boys come to school and need housing, space must be found. If the Summer Workshop is ever to expand, additional hous72 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW ing must be provided. That is the big bottle-neck to progress since all applicants prefer to live right at the School. Last year the University of Tennessee could have secured us government barracks for transportation costs but the Committee considered this poor economy as it would have been only a temporary arrangement. In addition, the problem of feeding the staffs and students of the Workshop is most difficult in our kitchen for it is not properly arranged for Institution Management. We also feel that more comfortable surroundings for our regular staff will mean greater efficiency and strengthened morale. So with courage and faith that the best interests of the School will be served, we plan to start a new building this coming year. It is our hope that alumne clubs and chapters will be interested in contributing direct to the cost of a room or its furnishings, thus to honor an outstanding member. We solicit your interest and aid, as always. The fraternity is grateful for the way in which contributions have come in. Three-fourths of the ac-. Live chapter contributions, going as they do into the Endowment Fund each year, help to spell security against unforeseen emergencies. The balance, together with all other contributions, governs the amount which the Committee can budget annually for the maintenance of the School. Top-most honors go to the St. Louis Alumnze Club with its one thousand dollar donation: it has maintained this record, or better, for a number of years; Philadelphia has sent $500 ; Cleve-land East and Kansas City, Mo., $300 each; Milwaukee, Wis., $225; Lafayette, Indiana, $203.51; Indianapolis and Denver, $200 each. The chapters leading in contributions were Missouri B ; Nebraska B; in third position, Ohio A and Texas A; while Florida B, Illinois B-L , Illinois 0, Colorado A, Kansas B, and Louisiana A tied for fourth place. Twenty nine clubs gave one hundred dollars or more. It was interesting to discover that twenty chapters and forty-three clubs increased the amount of their donations over 1948-49 and the contributions of fifty-four chapters and one hundred twenty-five clubs equalled those of last year. The chapters of Beta, Delta, Eta, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda provinces were one hundred percent as were the clubs of Alpha East, Beta, Delta, Zeta, Iota, Lambda, and Mu. Right here let us say that it is only ethical and right that money raised through a benefit in the name of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School should all go to that project. Thank you all! The gifts received from clubs, chapters and individuals brought both joy and comfort to the School. The many boxes of toys, books, fruit and candy at Christmas time made possible individual gifts to each child in our grade school and for those of the three out-lying rural schools as well; a special room gift of lovely book or game for each grade room; special athletic equipment; clothing for many of the needy. At the hospital layettes made so thoughtfully by some clubs had special use as do the additions to the loaning closet. This latter always has need for more cot-ton blankets, sheets, bed jackets or night-gowns, which our nurse is thankful to loan in case of sickness or emergencies. Sigma Phi Gamma, national business organization, through its Southern Mountain Workers division contributed $'50 this year toward eye and dental care, and three of their chapters became so interested they too sent their separate donations toward our health pro-gram. Many Pi Beta Phis and others, too, have found expression of a loving thought through our Memorial Fund. This was particularly true this year when out Grand Vice 'President and her husband suffered the tragic loss of their son Leonard. The Memorial Fund contributions are being used at the Health Center this year but the donor may specify a particular use, if she desires. A gift to this fund direct, or the gift of a particular book to the School Library are two lovely ways for an expression of sympathy. The final settlement of the estate left in part to the Settlement School by Dr. William P. Garshwiler in memory of his wife, an Indiana B, has been completed and we are indeed appreciative of this loving generosity. We are very pleased to have the amount of $8,943.41 which the Magazine Agency has sent us. Mrs. Alford says, "Pi Phis can't read !" but how we do like for them to keep on trying! We also have done many things with the returns from the Pi Phi best-seller, the Cook Book, first produced by the Los Angeles club some fifteen years ago. The Pi Phi girl graduating into a career or to become a summer bride continues to offer a fine field for their continued sales. One hears a remark now and then that we are finished in Gatlinburg. For the fraternity to be with-out the Settlement School would be like Arrow Craft existing without its trademark. Do we wish to abandon an undertaking dedicated long ago as a living memorial to our Founders, which has paid through honor to them but not alone to them? Every men's and women's fraternity gives us tremendous acclaim for our foresight in establishing a philanthropy dedicated to unselfish service. We pioneered in this now almost complete trend among National Panhellenic groups. The president of a large alumna club said on a recent visit to Gatlinburg that we should not talk of giving prestige to Gatlinburg because of having a school there but instead that every club and chapter receives tremendous publicity and prestige by virtue of the establishment and continued operation of the Settlement School. What would happen if we withdrew our Health program ? There would be only the local doctors, with days already crowded, to care for the school inspections, inoculations and to give advice to the mothers of young babies and the pre-schoolers or the parents of the school children. The advice given so frequently in the community, the tremendous program of disease prevention and sanitation, all these would go with the loss of the Health Center and our nurse. What would happen to the School if we withdrew, and to the Community which has depended upon Pi Beta Phi for so long? The school would not yet be accredited without our supplementary help in Music, Crafts, Woodworking and Physical Education. The community groups, P.T.A., election boards, churches, all make use of the school buildings as centers of ac tivity while Stuart Cottage and Helmick House are open on many occasions for teas or gathering places, for various town groups and school clubs. Old Timers' Day is still held upon our grounds and we wonder where some of the people who lean upon us would be, should we depart. An insurance man not long ago walked down the village street and as he passed first one hotel or another tourist court and then another remarked to his companion, "We own this one, we own that," on down the street. And still the local people, intrigued by what appear to be quick money-making schemes continue to build for the tourist trade. There will come a saturation point, one day, and we trust these businesses may be paid off ere that time. Get 'off Highway 71 and there are THE. SEPTEMBER ARROW 73 more tangible evidences of need for our help nor do the people hesitate to ask of Pi Beta Phi. We hope to help them bridge other adjustments if they come. An excerpt from a note received by Miss Onken from Miss Anne Guthrie, Pi Beta Phi, world lecturer and traveler, whose delightful program pleased so many at the last Convention, is worth quoting here. It was written this spring after a week's vacation stay in Gatlinburg. "What an interesting piece of work we have been responsible for! And to realize its effect on the community makes one very proud." Just one last whispered word on this subject! When one hears that we are finished in Gatlinburg, think again! In addition to believing that there are still things to be done there, bear in mind that Pi Beta Phi is a "Not for Profit" organization and that an educational puipose in Gatlinburg has merit. We should not lose our classification. Arrow Craft alone cannot be relied upon to sup-port the needs of the School because economic conditions are too uncertain and the demand for hand-woven articles, beautiful and inexpensive as they are, may not continue at the present high level. Time was when the contributions to the School were taking care of the development of Arrow Craft. The load of the chairman has been greatly lightened by the happy associations and complete cooperation of the Committee members this past year. Each has had her particular assignment and each has followed through with whole-hearted endeavor. At the beginning of the year, Grace Granger, Indiana A, of Indianapolis found it necessary to resign and her place was taken by Ethel Gillespie Smith, Indiana A, of Atlanta, Ga. At the time of the Chairman's fall visit to Gatlinburg, Mrs. Smith came to the Settlement School for a few days and also was able to at-tend the conferences on the 1950 Summer Workshop held at the University, excellent means of orientation for the year's work. Her assignment has been the County School and Library and this year she will have the Secretaryship added to her duties. You have known our Publicity member, Harriet Goodsell Rauch, through the fine -News of Little Pigeon" in the AR-ROW and here at Convention as the New York City Club delegate. Her responsibility is to give a true picture of the School to the readers of the ARROW and to lend all possible assistance to chapters and clubs with their publicity about the Settlement School. Only words of praise, well deserved, should be given the Treasurer of the Committee; Olivia Smith Moore, Missouri A, of Texarkana, Texas has clarified the budget making for the committee and has kept track of the rise or decline in funds receivable in meticulous fashion. This month we lose by tenure, Eugenia Brooks Smith, Indiana r, Salem, Oregon, who has handled the routing of the Settlement School film, kept an over-all eye on the Crafts, and this past year served as Secretary. Her latest contribution was the planning of the new film which you shall see here and which will be available for distribution in the fall. No assignment was ever too difficult and the Fraternity loses a valuable person from the Committee. We welcome Nellis Hempel Gibson, Pennsylvania A, of Baltimore, Maryland, who will take over the responsibility of the film and the supervision of the department of Arts and Crafts, The Settlement School Committee is deeply grateful for the assistance of Grand Council, especially Amy B. Onken who was chosen the contact member from the Council, and for all the diligent efforts of the alumnm clubs and chapters whose benefits and Arrow Craft sales made possible a practical working budget and future planning in Gatlinburg. We feel richly rewarded by serving Pi Beta Phi through the Settlement School and humbly ask that all of you share this privilege with us. Respectfully submitted, RUTH BARRETT SMITH REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1950 ALkING, or writing to Pi Phis is one of the most Timportant phases of the job that I have for the Fraternity. As Director of the Settlement School project it is my privilege to review with you, in this report, the main events of the past year. Life in the Smokies is a busy one as the various seasons follow each other. The pattern of our days is more or less a repeat design with ever changing variations, due to new personalities and interests. Community In this rapidly growing area, each year brings changes and improvements. Some of the most far reaching ones of the past year are the completion of a city water system, the installation of traffic lights at two busy intersections and the work done on two roads leading into the village. A second power line is being constructed which should provide the town with adequate electric service when it is completed. Building went on all winter so that spring found many new tourist courts and motels ready for business. A new picture theater was opened in May. The Methodist Church was completed and work started on a small Episcopal Church. The Riverside Hotel was enlarged and on the Greystone Hotel grounds a special building, called the Gatlinburg Playhouse, was constructed. This has filled a long felt need by providing a placefor lectures, Convention gatherings and Community affairs. Of most interest to Pi Phis, is the new grade school building that Sevier County is constructing on the plot of ground deeded to them by the Fraternity. This will have six class rooms, two toilet rooms, a small storage room, and a boiler room with a heating plant sufficiently large to take care of this building and future units as they can be built. The Contract was for $79,000.00 and it is hoped to have the building ready for use this coming fall. Each year the village Library Board sponsors a community party in February, to raise funds for the library which is entirely dependent upon donations for its operation. This event netted $615.00. The books have been moved from a room above the bus station to a small cottage on the River Road. The Garden Club has undertaken the landscaping of the grounds around the building and the Girl Scouts are mowing the lawn. Community Union church services were held at Thanksgiving time in the Baptist church and an Easter sunrise service was held on the Greystone lawn. The Garden Club again sponsored the Community Christmas tree, a pine that grows in our little park across from the Arrow Craft Shop. Other annual events of the holiday season were the beautiful candle 74 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW lighting service held in the Methodist Church on Christmas Eve and a party for all of the community children given by the American Legion Auxiliary. An awakened interest in the welfare of our young people has been evidenced. Scouting for both boys and girls has been actively revived under adequate leadership. Thirteen boys attended the International Jamboree at Valley Forge under the leadership of Mr. William Cron, Head of the Bureau of Roads. The churches sponsored an Easter egg hunt on the Whittle lawn that was enjoyed by many small children. Ever increasing numbers of tourists, coming to the Smokies, have caused the town to maintain a Tourist Bureau and to reorganize the Chamber of Commerce with a full time secretary in charge. During the win-ter a caravan of cars from Gatlinburg toured Florida advertising the tourist attractions and handicrafts of the region. Last summer for six weeks the Fraternity again rented the High School Auditorium to the Gate-way Stock Company of New York City. They presented a number of Broadway plays in a very credit-able manner. The second Craftsman's Fair, held on our green, was a great success. Pi Beta Phi and the village lost a valuable friend in the death of Mr. Andy Huff, owner of the Mountain View Hotel. O i ce When Esther Mines married last July, we were fortunate in having another Pi Phi, Nancy Holmes, Illinois Zeta, Class of 1949, join the staff as Assistant Director. She has been a great help, especially in taking care of the Workshop correspondence and reports. In addition to her work at the school she has served as the Chairman of the Advisory Board for Tennessee Gamma. School A backward look over the past school year brings a feeling of satisfaction. Sevier County, Pi Beta Phi and the P.T.A. combined to provide a well rounded program for over five hundred children attending the school. Nineteen full time and one part time teacher carried on the educational program. In high school we had four new teachers. These were, Mr. Walter Ogle, Principal ; Mr. Granville Shields, Science ; Dorothy Arnold who had attended our Summer Workshop, Home Economics, and Mr. W. J. Miracle who was hired by the Fraternity to supervise the work in Physical Education. In the Elementary School we had no changes in the teaching staff. It was necessary to have two rooms in which there were two grades each. One was a first and second combination and the other a third and fourth grouping. The faculty worked together very harmoniously. In October the school family, the faculty and their families enjoyed a picnic in the mountains. In January we had a faculty party in the nature of an old fashioned "pounding" for the coach and his bride at Stuart Cottage. The usual plays were given. The Juniors presented a melodrama, "Only an Orphan Girl," the Senior play was "Brother Goose" and the eighth grade finished their year by giving "Billie's Aunt Jane." The annual Halloween Carnival was enjoyed by the entire school as was the lovely Christmas program. Room parties were held in the different grade school rooms to observe special days. Films were used more frequently than in the past years, as a part of the School pro-gram. Twenty-one members of the Senior Class with faculty chaperones went to Washington, D.C. for their trip. This class sponsored a small school annual called "The Mountaineer," which was dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Johnson, former Pi Phi employees of the staff. The parting gift from the class to the school was two typewriters which they hope will form the nucleus of a Commercial Department for the school. Nancy Holmes, Assistant Director, was sponsor for the Beta Club. She accompanied several of the club members to the state convention in Nashville. The American Legion Auxiliary entertained the high school basketball teams at a very lovely formal banquet at the New Gatlinburg Inn. The same hotel was the setting for th'e annual Junior Senior banquet. After the Christmas holidays, the County operated a second bus for Gatlinburg. This helped very much in shortening the day for numbers of bus riding pupils. Pi Phi Contributions A backward look brings out the many extras enjoyed by the children attending our school which they could not have were it not for Fraternity help. Mrs. Althea Armstrong for Music, Mr. Miracle for Physical Education, Miss Van Roekel and Mr. Huskey for Arts and Crafts and Wood-work, added much to the program. Several years of training in part singing is showing up when public appearances of the students are made. The carols, making up most of the Christmas program, the Stephen Foster songs and Glee Club numbers given at Community and Commencement events were all very well done. The annual Operetta, "The Snow Queen," was one of the most tuneful and colorful that I have seen. The Arts and Crafts teacher, Fay Van Roekel, contributed much to the program. The beautiful back drops, done mostly on her knees, on strips of brown paper, for the Junior play were used again at the Christmas program and for the Operetta. Her fifth grade class designed and made puppets and wrote the script for an original show, as one of their art projects. The seventh grade made murals for the background of the Stephen Foster pro-gram. Fay gave a talk on Art at a County Teachers meeting and another one to a Y.W.C.A. Youth group at Alcoa. She served as a Graduate Assistant at the Summer Workshop and in August studied weaving at the Guild Workshop at Penland. Her high school girls produced some very nice weaving in their class work. Mr. Carl Huskey directed the boys in the wood shop. Some very creditable pieces of furniture were turned out by the class. While our boys and girls did not do as well as usual in basketball competitions with outside schools, our coach started a very valuable program of intramural sports within the high school classes that provided entertainment and interest most of the year. These contests were played off during the noon hour and in bad weather were most useful in helping provide an outlet for energies that are sometimes hard to control. The sports which were used in this program were basketball, softball, volleyball, pingpong, and ,shuffle board. In the spring a baseball team was organized for the first time. The American Legion allowed the use of their athletic field and they also loaned uniforms for the players. On a beautiful spring day, the whole school held a Field Day which resulted in a victory for the Freshman Class. P. T. A. We were fortunate in having a very active and enthusiastic group of parents who also provided "extras" for the school program. Money for this work comes chiefly from the weekly Bingo games operated during the tourist season in the high school gymnasium and from rummage sales. The school lunch room was again operated by this group, providing hot lunches THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 75 for the children in the Elementary school. Free lunches are provided for needy children. We share in the Government program and receive many supplies from that source. In the fall a book store was set up for the first week of school. This was a great convenience since there is not a store in town that handles school supplies or books. From their funds, the organization voted to give each teacher a sum of $50.00 to be used for supplies. In the high school the teachers pooled their money in order to undertake larger projects. One of these was the sanding and refinishing of the gymnasium floor. An additional gift of one hundred dollars was given for new basketball uniforms, one half to the high school and the other half to the grade school teams, ably coached by Mr. Kelly Huskey, the eighth grade teacher. A class in Parliamentary Law, an old-fashioned Spelling Bee and the sponsoring of a delightful concert by a high school chorus from Knoxville, were other activities of this group. Dormitory Miss Lena Hodgen, our efficient housekeeper, was again in charge of our living arrangements. We had the usual household emergencies to meet but were always provided with good meals. Nancy Holmes was in charge of the six high school girls who lived in Stuart College. Five of them graduated, having been with us most of their school days. In their honor we entertained the senior class and high school faculty following Class Night program. The piano at Stuart was used two days a week when a music teacher from, Pigeon Forge gave private lessons to a number of school children. It was necessary to replace some curtains this year. Now ruffled ones were placed in Nancy's suite and at Teachers Cottage we have some beautiful new -hand woven draperies in the living room and hall. Tina designed them and Lura wove them at the Shop at times when she was not busy with her regular work. It is interesting to note that she has been with the School long enough to weave three sets of draperies for these same rooms. The second set, taken from Teachers Cottage, are in use at Pollard where shiny yellow paint now makes a more cheerful interior. Three sturdy new card tables were purchased and have been in almost constant use at three houses. Health Center The health work done by the Fraternity, under the able direction of our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, is indeed a "repeat Design." Year after year, the inspections, inoculations, health talks with accompanying films, classes in First Aid and home visits for the almost 700 children in the district we serve, add up to an astounding total. Emergencies from school and community, clinics for well babies and expectant mothers, fill many busy days. Our Health Center was used several times for Clinics during the year. Twice the Mobile T.B. Unit was in town and used the building as headquarters. The first day 718 chest x-rays were given and the second time 497. A new law in Tennessee states that every child must be examined by a doctor before he can enter school and that a record of this examination must become a part of his school record. Two such clinics were held in December when 65 children were examined. Children from the rural area were brought to the Health Center. Twenty mothers came with the rural children. The State Department supplies serums but aside from that most of the health work done in town and in three rural schools is taken care of by Pi Beta Phi. That people of the area still look to us for aid was evidenced last winter. A little girl who had never had preventive vaccinations died suddenly of diphtheria. The next day people brought children from town and country to the health center. By night the weary nurse had given 154 preventive shots. Farm Two new laying houses for our Pi Phi hens were built this year to replace some unfit for use. We followed plans furnished by the Poultry Division of the University of Tennessee and are proud of the results. These modern houses will make it possible to have a larger poultry flock to supply the kitchen with eggs and chickens. Any surplus can be very advantageously sold to the Mountain View Hotel. Through the year, several litters of small pigs were raised and sold when they were old enough to make it worth while. The garden produced vegetables for our school family and supplied the University staff during the Workshop. Arrow Craft Shop The year has gone smoothly, following the usual pattern ; busy days for Mrs. Snow-filling and ship-ping Club orders-months like April and October when, as always, the "buying tourists" visit the shop and other days when the tables in the stock room are piled high with weaving, waiting to be tagged and put on the shelves. An effort has been made to reduce inventories, use up old stocks of threads and to concentrate on patterns that can make use of these materials. However, there will be some new accents in the next price list. We have added yellow and green, in pastel shades, to the baby woolen articles we have always carried. To fill a demand for a heavy textured mat, Mrs. McMorran has designed two sets. The less expensive one is in cotton and is called the Periwinkle, the other one is a very handsome linen set made in a diamond weave on double goose eye threading. Neckties and scarfs in bright stripes are other new items. Our designer, Mrs. McMorran, has been active in weaving circles in the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild. She instructed in weaving at the Guild Workshop, held in Penland, North Carolina, last fall and at the Spring Meeting of the Guild was granted a Master Craftsman's Certificate in Weaving. Upon invitation of the officials an exhibit of Arrow Craft products was placed in the side window of the Hamilton National Bank in Knoxville for a week. A new hand made cabinet for displaying jewelry is a useful as well as ornamental addition to the shop. The Hotel Shop has been operated by Mrs. Mc-Cutchean. Mrs. Snow reports that business has been good and that accounts receivable are better than ever before. Each year brings more craft shops to the village but we feel that the quality of our products, sold in their artistic setting, makes Arrow Craft Shop the best one of all. This report would be incomplete without the mention of the many wonderful gifts that individual Pi Phis, Active Chapters, Alumnm Clubs and friends make towards the success of our program. Two gifts of money, one spent for records and the other for library books, were given in memory of Leonard Wild. The staff enjoyed a new waffle iron which I purchased with gift funds. A surprise gift came from the Franklin Square Magazine Agency. The check sent for magazine subscriptions for the high school library was returned with a letter saying that the Fraternity business was so much that they wished to give us the magazines as an expression of their appreciation. The 76 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nurse is always delighted with the boxes of clothing that come to us and especially so with the layettes and baby things. The many boxes of toys and other Christmas gifts help to make Christmas memorable for many children. This year we remembered the 148 children in three rural schools with gifts in addition to 157 gifts to pupils in the three lower grades. Where there is greater need we try to place the really nice toys and clothing. Sigma Phi Gamma, International Sorority, continues to support our health program with gifts of money from their central office and boxes from individual chapters, to whom we are assigned by their welfare secretary. Their gifts are used for eye correc tions and new glasses in most cases. It has been impossible to give you a complete picture of our days at the School. The six weeks Work-shop in Crafts, The Craftsman's Fair and the appearances of the Gateway Stock Company in our Auditorium, make the summers most busy and interesting. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to our fine Settlement School Committee, the loyal local staff and employees and the thousands of Pi Phis over the country who yearly remember the school with kind and loving thoughts as well as concrete gifts.

The increase in the number of active chapters and alum= clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund this year is evidence of the pride Pi Phis have in Holt House. From these contributions minor repairs have been made, and necessary new furnishings have been purchased. We purchased a new refrigerator and two electrical units for the stove and are in the process of having the parlor curtains duplicated, as the old ones were beyond repair. As soon as the material can be matched we hope to have the occasional chairs in the Pine Room recovered. Many necessary repairs have been made; such as painting of the shutters, storm windows, screens, and gutters. The foundation has been re-pointed both inside and out and the floors and basement walls have been repaired and painted. The inside of the house has been painted. Climbing roses have been planted at the base of the trellises which were given to Holt House last year by Paul B. Wallace, in honor of his mother, one of our Founders, Nancy 'Black Wallace. Mr. Wallace, in writing of his mother's college life has mentioned her speaking of the beauty of the entrance to the Holt home with its trellises and climbing roses. This he restored in her memory. The kitchen, the hostess' bathroom, the lavatory off the powder room, and the porch floors have been painted and minor repairs were made to the roof. The number of alumnae clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund increased from 179 last year to 217 this year. The highest contributing clubs were Iowa City, Iowa $50, Kansas City, Missouri, $50, ' and Everett, Washington, $30. Many other clubs sent generous checks. The active chapters increased their contributions, with 87 chapters contributing as compared with 83 for last year. The highest contributing chapters were Louisiana A $100, Illinois A $50, and Oklahoma A $35. The following chapters each gave $25: Missouri B, Iowa r, Kansas B, and Texas A. The highest contributing provinces (alumnm) were: Mu, Lambda, and Kappa. Every club in the following provinces contributed; Mu, Lambda, Theta, and Iota. The highest contributing provinces (active) were: Kappa, Eta and 'Iota. Every chapter in the following provinces contributed: Kappa, Eta, Iota, Delta, Beta and Lambda. Besides active chapters and alumnae clubs in and near Monmouth using the house this past year, the following organizations have held meetings or parties there: Woman's Club, D.A.R., P.E.O., Women's Missionary Group, 'Book Club, Home Bureau, and the Alumna Sewing Circle. Several showers, luncheons, weddings, and receptions have been accommodated. Mrs. Carey, known far and wide in Monmouth for her gracious hospitality, continues to, manage the house very efficiently. The chairman is grateful to Mrs. John Trost our most able treasurer, and to the other committee mem COMMITTEE bers: particularly Mrs. R. M. Jensen, Monmouth, who has scheduled the film and done innumerable other things to facilitate the work of this committee. The chairman gratefully acknowledges the encouragement and guidance given by Miss Onken during the past year. She is grateful also for the many duties performed for the committee by the Director of Central Office, Gladys Hayes Scivally, and by each member of Grand Council. The assistance and cooperation of the province officers has greatly facilitated the work of the committee and of the chairman. Again, this chairman and committee is grateful to Gladys Stump Nall, the preceding chairman, for her advice and help during the past year. We are drawing to the close of a successful year for Holt House, and already planning for an even more successful year in 1950-1951.

        70 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Auxiliary for their poppy posters. The fifth grade produced three original plays for glove puppets all of which were made by the children themselves. Chalk murals, soap carving, metal repousee and making "tie dye" scarves were other activities. In the higher grades some outstanding results were evident in metal work, bowls, ash-trays, candle-holders, coasters. Weaving occupied the winter months for the girls, while stenciled luncheon sets and aprons were out-lets for basic designing. The boys found these subjects beneath them but painting had great appeal. Miss Van Roekel and Mr. Miracle were co-sponsors of the junior class and Miss Van, as the children call her, directed their class play. Her ability to make the backdrops put her in special demand on other occasions also. It is with extreme regret that we accept Miss Van Roekel's resignation in order for her to continue her education toward a Master's degree at Cranbrook. The Committee was greatly impressed with the progress of the Woodworking class under the super-vision of Mr. Carl Huskey, who had a part-time pro-gram for the high school boys. Each made some article for the home--a lamp, coffee table, book ends or magazine rack. For those boys not going on to college this course is a practical one toward seeking employment in one of the several furniture factories near-by. The Health Center is a true center for school, community and district or as our nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, describes it, "a cooperative, not exactly community cooperative, but nation-wide . . . composed of people from all walks of life, all parts of the country, all working for the service of mankind." Under the nurse's leadership, the days are filled with inoculations, first aid, talks on health, nutrition or safety. She has papers to be written and delivered be-fore Knoxville or other Tennessee organizations, writes a weekly "Health Shot" column for the local paper. Through the latter medium she is able to pre-scribe many sugared bits of health admonition. This year the County Health Department arranged for twenty clinics in which the first graders were given medical examination now required by Tennessee law. Two of the clinics were held at our Health Center, one for Gatlinburg and the other for the five nearby rural schools. The two local doctors officiated. Hereafter, the state-wide clinics will be held in the summer in order that remedial defects may be corrected and necessary inoculations given before the start of school. Our little babies continue to hold the spotlight and it is indeed a matter of pride that not one baby has been lost this past year; one premature was returned to the hospital incubator for a time. In our part of Sevier County there are but three children of school age as yet unable to attend. One is a spastic and the others, post polio cases. All receive regular instruction from the State Homebound teacher. A small six year old boy, totally deaf as the result of an attack of meningitis has been placed in the Tennessee School for the Deaf. Our constant efforts toward good health for the younger generation have borne fruit. Very successful was the day spent in assisting the technicians who brought their large mobile X-ray unit from the Division of Tuberculosis Control to the Health Center where more than seven hundred were processed. We are very grateful to Sigma Phi Gamma who through their welfare work for mountain children help to provide fitted glasses and dental care. This year nine children were cared for. There is a gradualawakening to the health needs of the community and there are encouraging signs which reflect our influence over the long period. Most recent is the cornpletion of a new system of pure water for the town and when its citizens finally sense the danger of only local sewage systems, one more of our great concerns will be at an end. There is always more to be accomplished at the Health Center than can be done, be it summer or winter, but the unselfish service contributed to school and community is felt throughout the countryside and Marjorie is loved by all the children. It may be that less need be written about Arrow Craft than any other department since all are so keenly cognizant of it through the beauty of its wares. Under Ethel Snow's capable management Arrow Craft has had an excellent year. We appreciate your sales because the school could not operate with-out them and we solicit the participation of even the smallest clubs for, in addition to the increased in-come, it gives us the subsequent fine publicity which the products indeed merit. Though they were by no means leading in membership, last year fourteen clubs each sold more than a thousand dollars worth of goods. This year there are nine with two of them exceeding the two thousand dollar mark. Here is the list: Houston, Texas, $2220.24; Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, $2120.98; Portland, Oregon, $1890.00; Albuquerque, New Mexico, $1596.39; Marin County, California, $1398.21; Denver, Colorado, $1339.15; Cleveland East, Ohio, $1326.73; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, $1278.63 ; Omaha, Nebraska, $1210.08. Those considered are only those whose money in these amounts had been received at Arrow Craft by the time of audit. To them and many others, a heartfelt "Thank your" It would give Arrow Craft fewer headaches and the Committee far less the appearance of ogres if every club or chapter would make complete payment in full or return the unsold goods for credit after the annual sale. No business, large or small, can operate without cash and no shop gives unlimited credit, does it? With an ever increasing number of enthusiastic alumnae clubs we ask for more sales but we also ask that each club give more thought to why Pi Beta Phi is conducting its Arrow Craft Shop and how much better use there is for the money there than lying idly in some local bank. The design and colors of Arrow Craft products continue to gladden the eye of all who see them. Tina McMorran has brought to her work a concept of the practical as well as the beautiful. At the suggestion of the Committee, she set to work to reduce the tremendous stock of raw materials on hand, necessarily purchased during wartime shortages, and ingeniously she has cut that inventory; at the same time, not knowing what economic turn might come, she has operated on a greatly reduced budget, dropping those items less in demand and reducing the quantity of others. Unfortunately this has meant a temporary reduction in the number of weavers but with the present furore of the chain stores for woven nylon bags, those released have found work elsewhere. This past year our insurance has been carried on a monthly inventory basis, a sound protection against loss. One interesting demand this spring is for the longer and brighter neck-tie. This has prompted the weaving of some tie material in Aunt Lizzie's old three harness twill pattern which throws more color to the top, with clearer stronger colors. Izora, long one of our good weavers, feels great pride in being chosen to carry on Aunt Lizzie's weave and she will demonstrate THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 71 its use at the Craftsman's Fair late this summer. Tina has worked toward a Master Craftsman award this year and received it from the Southern Highlands Handicrafts Guild at its spring meeting. This is only the third given by this Guild and there are but twelve in the country. She was asked by the University of Tennessee to be one of a very limited few to attend its two-week weaving short course this winter and was also honored in being asked to teach in the Guild Workshop at the Penland, N.C. School of Crafts last fall. We must not fail to mention the attractive little shop maintained by Arrow Craft in one corner of the Mountain View Hotel, now presided over by Mrs. McCutchean, mother and grandmother . of Pi Beta Phis. Her love of our products, combined with a wide acquaintance among the hotel guests, makes her a worthy proponent of sales. No hour is too early nor too late to accommodate the departing guest in her purchase of last minute carry-home gifts. This year our Grand Vice President offered a prize to the Pi Phi submitting a poster suitable for advertising sales of Arrow Craft products. The Committee appreciated Mrs. Wild's offer and regretted that none of the designs submitted seemed exactly to meet the needs at this time, according to the judges from the University of Tennessee Crafts faculty who considered them. One special item of interest ere we leave the Arrow Craft department: The Director of Cultural Affairs for the State Department in Washington D.C. has contacted Pi Beta Phi often in the last few years since foreign visitors and students wish to take back the profitable use of native materials to their own countries. The State Department has honored Pi Beta Phi in sending, when possible, both men and women from foreign countries to visit the Settlement School. The most recent occasion was the Prime-Minister and his wife, the Begum Ali-Kahn of Pakistan. She spoke fluent English and held two degrees from the University of her native land. The Begum was most anxious to learn of our industries in order to further assist the women of her country in the establishment of their Cottage Industries. It would seem, therefore, that our service to people has gone afar and we are honored that the State Department so highly classifies our Settlement School. Earlier in this report we mentioned the surveys which had been made of our project in Gatlinburg as they applied to the educational program. These surveys placed great emphasis on the opportunity Pi Beta Phi had in the Southern Highlands for the furthering of the native crafts and since that time an effort has been made to that end. This summer is the sixth for our Summer Workshop. It has passed its "trial and error" period and in the opinion of the present staff, the 1950 organization is running more smoothly than any year. It has been a matter of mutual satisfaction to the University of Tennessee and to Pi Beta Phi to work together for the success of this annual six week project. Miss Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design at the University, again serves as Director but the whole staff of the Applied Arts Department unites in lending its own or helping to find the best possible instruction. We are eternally grateful to Miss Jessie W. Harris, Pi Beta Phi Convention initiate in 1938, head of the Home Economics Department at the University, for her constant inspiration, wise help in planning, and her expert belief in the Settlement School program. For the first three weeks of the six weeks' Workshop there are twenty-one states represented by fifty-four students. Thirty-one are graduatestudents, seven are undergraduates and sixteen are enrolled as non-credit pupils. Twenty-nine of these will remain for the full six-week period. Until such time as larger housing facilities are available, further expansion is impossible. Miss Dyer and her corps of workers completely transform our grade school building into a dormitory. It is an herculean task with less than two weeks between the closing of school and the opening of the Workshop. Every vacant cranny is made available to those in attendance. The Gateway Players, a stock company of New York, will again transform our gymnasium-auditorium into a theater for six weeks, paying rent to us and providing excellent casts in good plays as entertainment for summer visitors. Pi Beta Phi reserves Friday night for the P.T.A. for a money-making plan. The P.T.A. has done a magnificent piece of work in raising money for its school cafeteria where all the school year, two paid cooks, the assisting mothers in turn, with the aid of government surpluses provide hot, well-balanced school lunches. It provided new basket-ball uniforms for the girls' team and in various other ways has assisted the school program. The Craftsman's Fair will make its third appearance on the Pi Beta Phi campus in late July and again Governor Browning will officiate at the opening. Here will be demonstrated the makings of many handicrafts of that area and the native folk dances. Also there will be a great exhibit and sale of the best under each classification. Pi Beta Phi through its membership in the Southern Highlands Handicrafts Guild shares the responsibility in staging this under-taking. One's pride increases, knowing the part the fraternity has played in the renaissance of these native crafts. At this Convention we hope to bring a widened vision of what the Crafts are in the Southern Appalachians and what the preservation of this early Americana means to that area. Last but by no means least in the year round picture is the regular staff which keeps the Committee policies in operation. Miss Ruth Dyer in her six years as Director has found no consistent pattern for each day brings new activities and new problems. There have been seven dormitory students this year, five of whom have just graduated, so we shall have room for new material in September. Each boy or girl enters the dormitory only after a clear under-standing with the parents that their boy or girl is to work a certain number of hours in part payment for room and board. This, together with our financial assistance in running a bus to distant Elkmont for students, is important Extension service. A number of years ago the auditors for the Settlement School advised, as for any good business, that certain amounts be set aside each year for depreciation. Since then all committees have budgeted toward a Sinking Fund to cover this. The present committee at its recent meeting came to an important decision after studying the contents of this Sinking Fund, taking into account the $17,000, final generous bequest from the Garshwiler estate, and the prospects in contributions and continued Arrow Craft sales, that now is the time to erect a new Staff House. Several reasons controlled the decision to proceed. 'Part of our staff has been domiciled in Pollard Hall which was originally the old Ogle family farmhouse. It also houses the dormitory boys and the dining rooms and kitchen for all. If Pollard is much longer used, extensive repairs will be necessary, for termites and old age take their toll; should more boys come to school and need housing, space must be found. If the Summer Workshop is ever to expand, additional hous72 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW ing must be provided. That is the big bottle-neck to progress since all applicants prefer to live right at the School. Last year the University of Tennessee could have secured us government barracks for transportation costs but the Committee considered this poor economy as it would have been only a temporary arrangement. In addition, the problem of feeding the staffs and students of the Workshop is most difficult in our kitchen for it is not properly arranged for Institution Management. We also feel that more comfortable surroundings for our regular staff will mean greater efficiency and strengthened morale. So with courage and faith that the best interests of the School will be served, we plan to start a new building this coming year. It is our hope that alumne clubs and chapters will be interested in contributing direct to the cost of a room or its furnishings, thus to honor an outstanding member. We solicit your interest and aid, as always. The fraternity is grateful for the way in which contributions have come in. Three-fourths of the ac-. Live chapter contributions, going as they do into the Endowment Fund each year, help to spell security against unforeseen emergencies. The balance, together with all other contributions, governs the amount which the Committee can budget annually for the maintenance of the School. Top-most honors go to the St. Louis Alumnze Club with its one thousand dollar donation: it has maintained this record, or better, for a number of years; Philadelphia has sent $500 ; Cleve-land East and Kansas City, Mo., $300 each; Milwaukee, Wis., $225; Lafayette, Indiana, $203.51; Indianapolis and Denver, $200 each. The chapters leading in contributions were Missouri B ; Nebraska B; in third position, Ohio A and Texas A; while Florida B, Illinois B-L , Illinois 0, Colorado A, Kansas B, and Louisiana A tied for fourth place. Twenty nine clubs gave one hundred dollars or more. It was interesting to discover that twenty chapters and forty-three clubs increased the amount of their donations over 1948-49 and the contributions of fifty-four chapters and one hundred twenty-five clubs equalled those of last year. The chapters of Beta, Delta, Eta, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda provinces were one hundred percent as were the clubs of Alpha East, Beta, Delta, Zeta, Iota, Lambda, and Mu. Right here let us say that it is only ethical and right that money raised through a benefit in the name of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School should all go to that project. Thank you all! The gifts received from clubs, chapters and individuals brought both joy and comfort to the School. The many boxes of toys, books, fruit and candy at Christmas time made possible individual gifts to each child in our grade school and for those of the three out-lying rural schools as well; a special room gift of lovely book or game for each grade room; special athletic equipment; clothing for many of the needy. At the hospital layettes made so thoughtfully by some clubs had special use as do the additions to the loaning closet. This latter always has need for more cot-ton blankets, sheets, bed jackets or night-gowns, which our nurse is thankful to loan in case of sickness or emergencies. Sigma Phi Gamma, national business organization, through its Southern Mountain Workers division contributed $'50 this year toward eye and dental care, and three of their chapters became so interested they too sent their separate donations toward our health pro-gram. Many Pi Beta Phis and others, too, have found expression of a loving thought through our Memorial Fund. This was particularly true this year when out Grand Vice 'President and her husband suffered the tragic loss of their son Leonard. The Memorial Fund contributions are being used at the Health Center this year but the donor may specify a particular use, if she desires. A gift to this fund direct, or the gift of a particular book to the School Library are two lovely ways for an expression of sympathy. The final settlement of the estate left in part to the Settlement School by Dr. William P. Garshwiler in memory of his wife, an Indiana B, has been completed and we are indeed appreciative of this loving generosity. We are very pleased to have the amount of $8,943.41 which the Magazine Agency has sent us. Mrs. Alford says, "Pi Phis can't read !" but how we do like for them to keep on trying! We also have done many things with the returns from the Pi Phi best-seller, the Cook Book, first produced by the Los Angeles club some fifteen years ago. The Pi Phi girl graduating into a career or to become a summer bride continues to offer a fine field for their continued sales. One hears a remark now and then that we are finished in Gatlinburg. For the fraternity to be with-out the Settlement School would be like Arrow Craft existing without its trademark. Do we wish to abandon an undertaking dedicated long ago as a living memorial to our Founders, which has paid through honor to them but not alone to them? Every men's and women's fraternity gives us tremendous acclaim for our foresight in establishing a philanthropy dedicated to unselfish service. We pioneered in this now almost complete trend among National Panhellenic groups. The president of a large alumna club said on a recent visit to Gatlinburg that we should not talk of giving prestige to Gatlinburg because of having a school there but instead that every club and chapter receives tremendous publicity and prestige by virtue of the establishment and continued operation of the Settlement School. What would happen if we withdrew our Health program ? There would be only the local doctors, with days already crowded, to care for the school inspections, inoculations and to give advice to the mothers of young babies and the pre-schoolers or the parents of the school children. The advice given so frequently in the community, the tremendous program of disease prevention and sanitation, all these would go with the loss of the Health Center and our nurse. What would happen to the School if we withdrew, and to the Community which has depended upon Pi Beta Phi for so long? The school would not yet be accredited without our supplementary help in Music, Crafts, Woodworking and Physical Education. The community groups, P.T.A., election boards, churches, all make use of the school buildings as centers of ac tivity while Stuart Cottage and Helmick House are open on many occasions for teas or gathering places, for various town groups and school clubs. Old Timers' Day is still held upon our grounds and we wonder where some of the people who lean upon us would be, should we depart. An insurance man not long ago walked down the village street and as he passed first one hotel or another tourist court and then another remarked to his companion, "We own this one, we own that," on down the street. And still the local people, intrigued by what appear to be quick money-making schemes continue to build for the tourist trade. There will come a saturation point, one day, and we trust these businesses may be paid off ere that time. Get 'off Highway 71 and there are THE. SEPTEMBER ARROW 73 more tangible evidences of need for our help nor do the people hesitate to ask of Pi Beta Phi. We hope to help them bridge other adjustments if they come. An excerpt from a note received by Miss Onken from Miss Anne Guthrie, Pi Beta Phi, world lecturer and traveler, whose delightful program pleased so many at the last Convention, is worth quoting here. It was written this spring after a week's vacation stay in Gatlinburg. "What an interesting piece of work we have been responsible for! And to realize its effect on the community makes one very proud." Just one last whispered word on this subject! When one hears that we are finished in Gatlinburg, think again! In addition to believing that there are still things to be done there, bear in mind that Pi Beta Phi is a "Not for Profit" organization and that an educational puipose in Gatlinburg has merit. We should not lose our classification. Arrow Craft alone cannot be relied upon to sup-port the needs of the School because economic conditions are too uncertain and the demand for hand-woven articles, beautiful and inexpensive as they are, may not continue at the present high level. Time was when the contributions to the School were taking care of the development of Arrow Craft. The load of the chairman has been greatly lightened by the happy associations and complete cooperation of the Committee members this past year. Each has had her particular assignment and each has followed through with whole-hearted endeavor. At the beginning of the year, Grace Granger, Indiana A, of Indianapolis found it necessary to resign and her place was taken by Ethel Gillespie Smith, Indiana A, of Atlanta, Ga. At the time of the Chairman's fall visit to Gatlinburg, Mrs. Smith came to the Settlement School for a few days and also was able to at-tend the conferences on the 1950 Summer Workshop held at the University, excellent means of orientation for the year's work. Her assignment has been the County School and Library and this year she will have the Secretaryship added to her duties. You have known our Publicity member, Harriet Goodsell Rauch, through the fine -News of Little Pigeon" in the AR-ROW and here at Convention as the New York City Club delegate. Her responsibility is to give a true picture of the School to the readers of the ARROW and to lend all possible assistance to chapters and clubs with their publicity about the Settlement School. Only words of praise, well deserved, should be given the Treasurer of the Committee; Olivia Smith Moore, Missouri A, of Texarkana, Texas has clarified the budget making for the committee and has kept track of the rise or decline in funds receivable in meticulous fashion. This month we lose by tenure, Eugenia Brooks Smith, Indiana r, Salem, Oregon, who has handled the routing of the Settlement School film, kept an over-all eye on the Crafts, and this past year served as Secretary. Her latest contribution was the planning of the new film which you shall see here and which will be available for distribution in the fall. No assignment was ever too difficult and the Fraternity loses a valuable person from the Committee. We welcome Nellis Hempel Gibson, Pennsylvania A, of Baltimore, Maryland, who will take over the responsibility of the film and the supervision of the department of Arts and Crafts, The Settlement School Committee is deeply grateful for the assistance of Grand Council, especially Amy B. Onken who was chosen the contact member from the Council, and for all the diligent efforts of the alumnm clubs and chapters whose benefits and Arrow Craft sales made possible a practical working budget and future planning in Gatlinburg. We feel richly rewarded by serving Pi Beta Phi through the Settlement School and humbly ask that all of you share this privilege with us. Respectfully submitted, RUTH BARRETT SMITH REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1950 ALkING, or writing to Pi Phis is one of the most Timportant phases of the job that I have for the Fraternity. As Director of the Settlement School project it is my privilege to review with you, in this report, the main events of the past year. Life in the Smokies is a busy one as the various seasons follow each other. The pattern of our days is more or less a repeat design with ever changing variations, due to new personalities and interests. Community In this rapidly growing area, each year brings changes and improvements. Some of the most far reaching ones of the past year are the completion of a city water system, the installation of traffic lights at two busy intersections and the work done on two roads leading into the village. A second power line is being constructed which should provide the town with adequate electric service when it is completed. Building went on all winter so that spring found many new tourist courts and motels ready for business. A new picture theater was opened in May. The Methodist Church was completed and work started on a small Episcopal Church. The Riverside Hotel was enlarged and on the Greystone Hotel grounds a special building, called the Gatlinburg Playhouse, was constructed. This has filled a long felt need by providing a placefor lectures, Convention gatherings and Community affairs. Of most interest to Pi Phis, is the new grade school building that Sevier County is constructing on the plot of ground deeded to them by the Fraternity. This will have six class rooms, two toilet rooms, a small storage room, and a boiler room with a heating plant sufficiently large to take care of this building and future units as they can be built. The Contract was for $79,000.00 and it is hoped to have the building ready for use this coming fall. Each year the village Library Board sponsors a community party in February, to raise funds for the library which is entirely dependent upon donations for its operation. This event netted $615.00. The books have been moved from a room above the bus station to a small cottage on the River Road. The Garden Club has undertaken the landscaping of the grounds around the building and the Girl Scouts are mowing the lawn. Community Union church services were held at Thanksgiving time in the Baptist church and an Easter sunrise service was held on the Greystone lawn. The Garden Club again sponsored the Community Christmas tree, a pine that grows in our little park across from the Arrow Craft Shop. Other annual events of the holiday season were the beautiful candle 74 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW lighting service held in the Methodist Church on Christmas Eve and a party for all of the community children given by the American Legion Auxiliary. An awakened interest in the welfare of our young people has been evidenced. Scouting for both boys and girls has been actively revived under adequate leadership. Thirteen boys attended the International Jamboree at Valley Forge under the leadership of Mr. William Cron, Head of the Bureau of Roads. The churches sponsored an Easter egg hunt on the Whittle lawn that was enjoyed by many small children. Ever increasing numbers of tourists, coming to the Smokies, have caused the town to maintain a Tourist Bureau and to reorganize the Chamber of Commerce with a full time secretary in charge. During the win-ter a caravan of cars from Gatlinburg toured Florida advertising the tourist attractions and handicrafts of the region. Last summer for six weeks the Fraternity again rented the High School Auditorium to the Gate-way Stock Company of New York City. They presented a number of Broadway plays in a very credit-able manner. The second Craftsman's Fair, held on our green, was a great success. Pi Beta Phi and the village lost a valuable friend in the death of Mr. Andy Huff, owner of the Mountain View Hotel. O i ce When Esther Mines married last July, we were fortunate in having another Pi Phi, Nancy Holmes, Illinois Zeta, Class of 1949, join the staff as Assistant Director. She has been a great help, especially in taking care of the Workshop correspondence and reports. In addition to her work at the school she has served as the Chairman of the Advisory Board for Tennessee Gamma. School A backward look over the past school year brings a feeling of satisfaction. Sevier County, Pi Beta Phi and the P.T.A. combined to provide a well rounded program for over five hundred children attending the school. Nineteen full time and one part time teacher carried on the educational program. In high school we had four new teachers. These were, Mr. Walter Ogle, Principal ; Mr. Granville Shields, Science ; Dorothy Arnold who had attended our Summer Workshop, Home Economics, and Mr. W. J. Miracle who was hired by the Fraternity to supervise the work in Physical Education. In the Elementary School we had no changes in the teaching staff. It was necessary to have two rooms in which there were two grades each. One was a first and second combination and the other a third and fourth grouping. The faculty worked together very harmoniously. In October the school family, the faculty and their families enjoyed a picnic in the mountains. In January we had a faculty party in the nature of an old fashioned "pounding" for the coach and his bride at Stuart Cottage. The usual plays were given. The Juniors presented a melodrama, "Only an Orphan Girl," the Senior play was "Brother Goose" and the eighth grade finished their year by giving "Billie's Aunt Jane." The annual Halloween Carnival was enjoyed by the entire school as was the lovely Christmas program. Room parties were held in the different grade school rooms to observe special days. Films were used more frequently than in the past years, as a part of the School pro-gram. Twenty-one members of the Senior Class with faculty chaperones went to Washington, D.C. for their trip. This class sponsored a small school annual called "The Mountaineer," which was dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Johnson, former Pi Phi employees of the staff. The parting gift from the class to the school was two typewriters which they hope will form the nucleus of a Commercial Department for the school. Nancy Holmes, Assistant Director, was sponsor for the Beta Club. She accompanied several of the club members to the state convention in Nashville. The American Legion Auxiliary entertained the high school basketball teams at a very lovely formal banquet at the New Gatlinburg Inn. The same hotel was the setting for th'e annual Junior Senior banquet. After the Christmas holidays, the County operated a second bus for Gatlinburg. This helped very much in shortening the day for numbers of bus riding pupils. Pi Phi Contributions A backward look brings out the many extras enjoyed by the children attending our school which they could not have were it not for Fraternity help. Mrs. Althea Armstrong for Music, Mr. Miracle for Physical Education, Miss Van Roekel and Mr. Huskey for Arts and Crafts and Wood-work, added much to the program. Several years of training in part singing is showing up when public appearances of the students are made. The carols, making up most of the Christmas program, the Stephen Foster songs and Glee Club numbers given at Community and Commencement events were all very well done. The annual Operetta, "The Snow Queen," was one of the most tuneful and colorful that I have seen. The Arts and Crafts teacher, Fay Van Roekel, contributed much to the program. The beautiful back drops, done mostly on her knees, on strips of brown paper, for the Junior play were used again at the Christmas program and for the Operetta. Her fifth grade class designed and made puppets and wrote the script for an original show, as one of their art projects. The seventh grade made murals for the background of the Stephen Foster pro-gram. Fay gave a talk on Art at a County Teachers meeting and another one to a Y.W.C.A. Youth group at Alcoa. She served as a Graduate Assistant at the Summer Workshop and in August studied weaving at the Guild Workshop at Penland. Her high school girls produced some very nice weaving in their class work. Mr. Carl Huskey directed the boys in the wood shop. Some very creditable pieces of furniture were turned out by the class. While our boys and girls did not do as well as usual in basketball competitions with outside schools, our coach started a very valuable program of intramural sports within the high school classes that provided entertainment and interest most of the year. These contests were played off during the noon hour and in bad weather were most useful in helping provide an outlet for energies that are sometimes hard to control. The sports which were used in this program were basketball, softball, volleyball, pingpong, and ,shuffle board. In the spring a baseball team was organized for the first time. The American Legion allowed the use of their athletic field and they also loaned uniforms for the players. On a beautiful spring day, the whole school held a Field Day which resulted in a victory for the Freshman Class. P. T. A. We were fortunate in having a very active and enthusiastic group of parents who also provided "extras" for the school program. Money for this work comes chiefly from the weekly Bingo games operated during the tourist season in the high school gymnasium and from rummage sales. The school lunch room was again operated by this group, providing hot lunches THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 75 for the children in the Elementary school. Free lunches are provided for needy children. We share in the Government program and receive many supplies from that source. In the fall a book store was set up for the first week of school. This was a great convenience since there is not a store in town that handles school supplies or books. From their funds, the organization voted to give each teacher a sum of $50.00 to be used for supplies. In the high school the teachers pooled their money in order to undertake larger projects. One of these was the sanding and refinishing of the gymnasium floor. An additional gift of one hundred dollars was given for new basketball uniforms, one half to the high school and the other half to the grade school teams, ably coached by Mr. Kelly Huskey, the eighth grade teacher. A class in Parliamentary Law, an old-fashioned Spelling Bee and the sponsoring of a delightful concert by a high school chorus from Knoxville, were other activities of this group. Dormitory Miss Lena Hodgen, our efficient housekeeper, was again in charge of our living arrangements. We had the usual household emergencies to meet but were always provided with good meals. Nancy Holmes was in charge of the six high school girls who lived in Stuart College. Five of them graduated, having been with us most of their school days. In their honor we entertained the senior class and high school faculty following Class Night program. The piano at Stuart was used two days a week when a music teacher from, Pigeon Forge gave private lessons to a number of school children. It was necessary to replace some curtains this year. Now ruffled ones were placed in Nancy's suite and at Teachers Cottage we have some beautiful new -hand woven draperies in the living room and hall. Tina designed them and Lura wove them at the Shop at times when she was not busy with her regular work. It is interesting to note that she has been with the School long enough to weave three sets of draperies for these same rooms. The second set, taken from Teachers Cottage, are in use at Pollard where shiny yellow paint now makes a more cheerful interior. Three sturdy new card tables were purchased and have been in almost constant use at three houses. Health Center The health work done by the Fraternity, under the able direction of our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, is indeed a "repeat Design." Year after year, the inspections, inoculations, health talks with accompanying films, classes in First Aid and home visits for the almost 700 children in the district we serve, add up to an astounding total. Emergencies from school and community, clinics for well babies and expectant mothers, fill many busy days. Our Health Center was used several times for Clinics during the year. Twice the Mobile T.B. Unit was in town and used the building as headquarters. The first day 718 chest x-rays were given and the second time 497. A new law in Tennessee states that every child must be examined by a doctor before he can enter school and that a record of this examination must become a part of his school record. Two such clinics were held in December when 65 children were examined. Children from the rural area were brought to the Health Center. Twenty mothers came with the rural children. The State Department supplies serums but aside from that most of the health work done in town and in three rural schools is taken care of by Pi Beta Phi. That people of the area still look to us for aid was evidenced last winter. A little girl who had never had preventive vaccinations died suddenly of diphtheria. The next day people brought children from town and country to the health center. By night the weary nurse had given 154 preventive shots. Farm Two new laying houses for our Pi Phi hens were built this year to replace some unfit for use. We followed plans furnished by the Poultry Division of the University of Tennessee and are proud of the results. These modern houses will make it possible to have a larger poultry flock to supply the kitchen with eggs and chickens. Any surplus can be very advantageously sold to the Mountain View Hotel. Through the year, several litters of small pigs were raised and sold when they were old enough to make it worth while. The garden produced vegetables for our school family and supplied the University staff during the Workshop. Arrow Craft Shop The year has gone smoothly, following the usual pattern ; busy days for Mrs. Snow-filling and ship-ping Club orders-months like April and October when, as always, the "buying tourists" visit the shop and other days when the tables in the stock room are piled high with weaving, waiting to be tagged and put on the shelves. An effort has been made to reduce inventories, use up old stocks of threads and to concentrate on patterns that can make use of these materials. However, there will be some new accents in the next price list. We have added yellow and green, in pastel shades, to the baby woolen articles we have always carried. To fill a demand for a heavy textured mat, Mrs. McMorran has designed two sets. The less expensive one is in cotton and is called the Periwinkle, the other one is a very handsome linen set made in a diamond weave on double goose eye threading. Neckties and scarfs in bright stripes are other new items. Our designer, Mrs. McMorran, has been active in weaving circles in the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild. She instructed in weaving at the Guild Workshop, held in Penland, North Carolina, last fall and at the Spring Meeting of the Guild was granted a Master Craftsman's Certificate in Weaving. Upon invitation of the officials an exhibit of Arrow Craft products was placed in the side window of the Hamilton National Bank in Knoxville for a week. A new hand made cabinet for displaying jewelry is a useful as well as ornamental addition to the shop. The Hotel Shop has been operated by Mrs. Mc-Cutchean. Mrs. Snow reports that business has been good and that accounts receivable are better than ever before. Each year brings more craft shops to the village but we feel that the quality of our products, sold in their artistic setting, makes Arrow Craft Shop the best one of all. This report would be incomplete without the mention of the many wonderful gifts that individual Pi Phis, Active Chapters, Alumnm Clubs and friends make towards the success of our program. Two gifts of money, one spent for records and the other for library books, were given in memory of Leonard Wild. The staff enjoyed a new waffle iron which I purchased with gift funds. A surprise gift came from the Franklin Square Magazine Agency. The check sent for magazine subscriptions for the high school library was returned with a letter saying that the Fraternity business was so much that they wished to give us the magazines as an expression of their appreciation. The 76 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nurse is always delighted with the boxes of clothing that come to us and especially so with the layettes and baby things. The many boxes of toys and other Christmas gifts help to make Christmas memorable for many children. This year we remembered the 148 children in three rural schools with gifts in addition to 157 gifts to pupils in the three lower grades. Where there is greater need we try to place the really nice toys and clothing. Sigma Phi Gamma, International Sorority, continues to support our health program with gifts of money from their central office and boxes from individual chapters, to whom we are assigned by their welfare secretary. Their gifts are used for eye correc tions and new glasses in most cases. It has been impossible to give you a complete picture of our days at the School. The six weeks Work-shop in Crafts, The Craftsman's Fair and the appearances of the Gateway Stock Company in our Auditorium, make the summers most busy and interesting. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to our fine Settlement School Committee, the loyal local staff and employees and the thousands of Pi Phis over the country who yearly remember the school with kind and loving thoughts as well as concrete gifts.

The increase in the number of active chapters and alum= clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund this year is evidence of the pride Pi Phis have in Holt House. From these contributions minor repairs have been made, and necessary new furnishings have been purchased. We purchased a new refrigerator and two electrical units for the stove and are in the process of having the parlor curtains duplicated, as the old ones were beyond repair. As soon as the material can be matched we hope to have the occasional chairs in the Pine Room recovered. Many necessary repairs have been made; such as painting of the shutters, storm windows, screens, and gutters. The foundation has been re-pointed both inside and out and the floors and basement walls have been repaired and painted. The inside of the house has been painted. Climbing roses have been planted at the base of the trellises which were given to Holt House last year by Paul B. Wallace, in honor of his mother, one of our Founders, Nancy 'Black Wallace. Mr. Wallace, in writing of his mother's college life has mentioned her speaking of the beauty of the entrance to the Holt home with its trellises and climbing roses. This he restored in her memory. The kitchen, the hostess' bathroom, the lavatory off the powder room, and the porch floors have been painted and minor repairs were made to the roof. The number of alumnae clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund increased from 179 last year to 217 this year. The highest contributing clubs were Iowa City, Iowa $50, Kansas City, Missouri, $50, ' and Everett, Washington, $30. Many other clubs sent generous checks. The active chapters increased their contributions, with 87 chapters contributing as compared with 83 for last year. The highest contributing chapters were Louisiana A $100, Illinois A $50, and Oklahoma A $35. The following chapters each gave $25: Missouri B, Iowa r, Kansas B, and Texas A. The highest contributing provinces (alumnm) were: Mu, Lambda, and Kappa. Every club in the following provinces contributed; Mu, Lambda, Theta, and Iota. The highest contributing provinces (active) were: Kappa, Eta and 'Iota. Every chapter in the following provinces contributed: Kappa, Eta, Iota, Delta, Beta and Lambda. Besides active chapters and alumnae clubs in and near Monmouth using the house this past year, the following organizations have held meetings or parties there: Woman's Club, D.A.R., P.E.O., Women's Missionary Group, 'Book Club, Home Bureau, and the Alumna Sewing Circle. Several showers, luncheons, weddings, and receptions have been accommodated. Mrs. Carey, known far and wide in Monmouth for her gracious hospitality, continues to, manage the house very efficiently. The chairman is grateful to Mrs. John Trost our most able treasurer, and to the other committee mem COMMITTEE bers: particularly Mrs. R. M. Jensen, Monmouth, who has scheduled the film and done innumerable other things to facilitate the work of this committee. The chairman gratefully acknowledges the encouragement and guidance given by Miss Onken during the past year. She is grateful also for the many duties performed for the committee by the Director of Central Office, Gladys Hayes Scivally, and by each member of Grand Council. The assistance and cooperation of the province officers has greatly facilitated the work of the committee and of the chairman. Again, this chairman and committee is grateful to Gladys Stump Nall, the preceding chairman, for her advice and help during the past year. We are drawing to the close of a successful year for Holt House, and already planning for an even more successful year in 1950-1951.

        72 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW ing must be provided. That is the big bottle-neck to progress since all applicants prefer to live right at the School. Last year the University of Tennessee could have secured us government barracks for transportation costs but the Committee considered this poor economy as it would have been only a temporary arrangement. In addition, the problem of feeding the staffs and students of the Workshop is most difficult in our kitchen for it is not properly arranged for Institution Management. We also feel that more comfortable surroundings for our regular staff will mean greater efficiency and strengthened morale. So with courage and faith that the best interests of the School will be served, we plan to start a new building this coming year. It is our hope that alumne clubs and chapters will be interested in contributing direct to the cost of a room or its furnishings, thus to honor an outstanding member. We solicit your interest and aid, as always. The fraternity is grateful for the way in which contributions have come in. Three-fourths of the ac-. Live chapter contributions, going as they do into the Endowment Fund each year, help to spell security against unforeseen emergencies. The balance, together with all other contributions, governs the amount which the Committee can budget annually for the maintenance of the School. Top-most honors go to the St. Louis Alumnze Club with its one thousand dollar donation: it has maintained this record, or better, for a number of years; Philadelphia has sent $500 ; Cleve-land East and Kansas City, Mo., $300 each; Milwaukee, Wis., $225; Lafayette, Indiana, $203.51; Indianapolis and Denver, $200 each. The chapters leading in contributions were Missouri B ; Nebraska B; in third position, Ohio A and Texas A; while Florida B, Illinois B-L , Illinois 0, Colorado A, Kansas B, and Louisiana A tied for fourth place. Twenty nine clubs gave one hundred dollars or more. It was interesting to discover that twenty chapters and forty-three clubs increased the amount of their donations over 1948-49 and the contributions of fifty-four chapters and one hundred twenty-five clubs equalled those of last year. The chapters of Beta, Delta, Eta, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda provinces were one hundred percent as were the clubs of Alpha East, Beta, Delta, Zeta, Iota, Lambda, and Mu. Right here let us say that it is only ethical and right that money raised through a benefit in the name of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School should all go to that project. Thank you all! The gifts received from clubs, chapters and individuals brought both joy and comfort to the School. The many boxes of toys, books, fruit and candy at Christmas time made possible individual gifts to each child in our grade school and for those of the three out-lying rural schools as well; a special room gift of lovely book or game for each grade room; special athletic equipment; clothing for many of the needy. At the hospital layettes made so thoughtfully by some clubs had special use as do the additions to the loaning closet. This latter always has need for more cot-ton blankets, sheets, bed jackets or night-gowns, which our nurse is thankful to loan in case of sickness or emergencies. Sigma Phi Gamma, national business organization, through its Southern Mountain Workers division contributed $'50 this year toward eye and dental care, and three of their chapters became so interested they too sent their separate donations toward our health pro-gram. Many Pi Beta Phis and others, too, have found expression of a loving thought through our Memorial Fund. This was particularly true this year when out Grand Vice 'President and her husband suffered the tragic loss of their son Leonard. The Memorial Fund contributions are being used at the Health Center this year but the donor may specify a particular use, if she desires. A gift to this fund direct, or the gift of a particular book to the School Library are two lovely ways for an expression of sympathy. The final settlement of the estate left in part to the Settlement School by Dr. William P. Garshwiler in memory of his wife, an Indiana B, has been completed and we are indeed appreciative of this loving generosity. We are very pleased to have the amount of $8,943.41 which the Magazine Agency has sent us. Mrs. Alford says, "Pi Phis can't read !" but how we do like for them to keep on trying! We also have done many things with the returns from the Pi Phi best-seller, the Cook Book, first produced by the Los Angeles club some fifteen years ago. The Pi Phi girl graduating into a career or to become a summer bride continues to offer a fine field for their continued sales. One hears a remark now and then that we are finished in Gatlinburg. For the fraternity to be with-out the Settlement School would be like Arrow Craft existing without its trademark. Do we wish to abandon an undertaking dedicated long ago as a living memorial to our Founders, which has paid through honor to them but not alone to them? Every men's and women's fraternity gives us tremendous acclaim for our foresight in establishing a philanthropy dedicated to unselfish service. We pioneered in this now almost complete trend among National Panhellenic groups. The president of a large alumna club said on a recent visit to Gatlinburg that we should not talk of giving prestige to Gatlinburg because of having a school there but instead that every club and chapter receives tremendous publicity and prestige by virtue of the establishment and continued operation of the Settlement School. What would happen if we withdrew our Health program ? There would be only the local doctors, with days already crowded, to care for the school inspections, inoculations and to give advice to the mothers of young babies and the pre-schoolers or the parents of the school children. The advice given so frequently in the community, the tremendous program of disease prevention and sanitation, all these would go with the loss of the Health Center and our nurse. What would happen to the School if we withdrew, and to the Community which has depended upon Pi Beta Phi for so long? The school would not yet be accredited without our supplementary help in Music, Crafts, Woodworking and Physical Education. The community groups, P.T.A., election boards, churches, all make use of the school buildings as centers of ac tivity while Stuart Cottage and Helmick House are open on many occasions for teas or gathering places, for various town groups and school clubs. Old Timers' Day is still held upon our grounds and we wonder where some of the people who lean upon us would be, should we depart. An insurance man not long ago walked down the village street and as he passed first one hotel or another tourist court and then another remarked to his companion, "We own this one, we own that," on down the street. And still the local people, intrigued by what appear to be quick money-making schemes continue to build for the tourist trade. There will come a saturation point, one day, and we trust these businesses may be paid off ere that time. Get 'off Highway 71 and there are THE. SEPTEMBER ARROW 73 more tangible evidences of need for our help nor do the people hesitate to ask of Pi Beta Phi. We hope to help them bridge other adjustments if they come. An excerpt from a note received by Miss Onken from Miss Anne Guthrie, Pi Beta Phi, world lecturer and traveler, whose delightful program pleased so many at the last Convention, is worth quoting here. It was written this spring after a week's vacation stay in Gatlinburg. "What an interesting piece of work we have been responsible for! And to realize its effect on the community makes one very proud." Just one last whispered word on this subject! When one hears that we are finished in Gatlinburg, think again! In addition to believing that there are still things to be done there, bear in mind that Pi Beta Phi is a "Not for Profit" organization and that an educational puipose in Gatlinburg has merit. We should not lose our classification. Arrow Craft alone cannot be relied upon to sup-port the needs of the School because economic conditions are too uncertain and the demand for hand-woven articles, beautiful and inexpensive as they are, may not continue at the present high level. Time was when the contributions to the School were taking care of the development of Arrow Craft. The load of the chairman has been greatly lightened by the happy associations and complete cooperation of the Committee members this past year. Each has had her particular assignment and each has followed through with whole-hearted endeavor. At the beginning of the year, Grace Granger, Indiana A, of Indianapolis found it necessary to resign and her place was taken by Ethel Gillespie Smith, Indiana A, of Atlanta, Ga. At the time of the Chairman's fall visit to Gatlinburg, Mrs. Smith came to the Settlement School for a few days and also was able to at-tend the conferences on the 1950 Summer Workshop held at the University, excellent means of orientation for the year's work. Her assignment has been the County School and Library and this year she will have the Secretaryship added to her duties. You have known our Publicity member, Harriet Goodsell Rauch, through the fine -News of Little Pigeon" in the AR-ROW and here at Convention as the New York City Club delegate. Her responsibility is to give a true picture of the School to the readers of the ARROW and to lend all possible assistance to chapters and clubs with their publicity about the Settlement School. Only words of praise, well deserved, should be given the Treasurer of the Committee; Olivia Smith Moore, Missouri A, of Texarkana, Texas has clarified the budget making for the committee and has kept track of the rise or decline in funds receivable in meticulous fashion. This month we lose by tenure, Eugenia Brooks Smith, Indiana r, Salem, Oregon, who has handled the routing of the Settlement School film, kept an over-all eye on the Crafts, and this past year served as Secretary. Her latest contribution was the planning of the new film which you shall see here and which will be available for distribution in the fall. No assignment was ever too difficult and the Fraternity loses a valuable person from the Committee. We welcome Nellis Hempel Gibson, Pennsylvania A, of Baltimore, Maryland, who will take over the responsibility of the film and the supervision of the department of Arts and Crafts, The Settlement School Committee is deeply grateful for the assistance of Grand Council, especially Amy B. Onken who was chosen the contact member from the Council, and for all the diligent efforts of the alumnm clubs and chapters whose benefits and Arrow Craft sales made possible a practical working budget and future planning in Gatlinburg. We feel richly rewarded by serving Pi Beta Phi through the Settlement School and humbly ask that all of you share this privilege with us. Respectfully submitted, RUTH BARRETT SMITH REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1950 ALkING, or writing to Pi Phis is one of the most Timportant phases of the job that I have for the Fraternity. As Director of the Settlement School project it is my privilege to review with you, in this report, the main events of the past year. Life in the Smokies is a busy one as the various seasons follow each other. The pattern of our days is more or less a repeat design with ever changing variations, due to new personalities and interests. Community In this rapidly growing area, each year brings changes and improvements. Some of the most far reaching ones of the past year are the completion of a city water system, the installation of traffic lights at two busy intersections and the work done on two roads leading into the village. A second power line is being constructed which should provide the town with adequate electric service when it is completed. Building went on all winter so that spring found many new tourist courts and motels ready for business. A new picture theater was opened in May. The Methodist Church was completed and work started on a small Episcopal Church. The Riverside Hotel was enlarged and on the Greystone Hotel grounds a special building, called the Gatlinburg Playhouse, was constructed. This has filled a long felt need by providing a placefor lectures, Convention gatherings and Community affairs. Of most interest to Pi Phis, is the new grade school building that Sevier County is constructing on the plot of ground deeded to them by the Fraternity. This will have six class rooms, two toilet rooms, a small storage room, and a boiler room with a heating plant sufficiently large to take care of this building and future units as they can be built. The Contract was for $79,000.00 and it is hoped to have the building ready for use this coming fall. Each year the village Library Board sponsors a community party in February, to raise funds for the library which is entirely dependent upon donations for its operation. This event netted $615.00. The books have been moved from a room above the bus station to a small cottage on the River Road. The Garden Club has undertaken the landscaping of the grounds around the building and the Girl Scouts are mowing the lawn. Community Union church services were held at Thanksgiving time in the Baptist church and an Easter sunrise service was held on the Greystone lawn. The Garden Club again sponsored the Community Christmas tree, a pine that grows in our little park across from the Arrow Craft Shop. Other annual events of the holiday season were the beautiful candle 74 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW lighting service held in the Methodist Church on Christmas Eve and a party for all of the community children given by the American Legion Auxiliary. An awakened interest in the welfare of our young people has been evidenced. Scouting for both boys and girls has been actively revived under adequate leadership. Thirteen boys attended the International Jamboree at Valley Forge under the leadership of Mr. William Cron, Head of the Bureau of Roads. The churches sponsored an Easter egg hunt on the Whittle lawn that was enjoyed by many small children. Ever increasing numbers of tourists, coming to the Smokies, have caused the town to maintain a Tourist Bureau and to reorganize the Chamber of Commerce with a full time secretary in charge. During the win-ter a caravan of cars from Gatlinburg toured Florida advertising the tourist attractions and handicrafts of the region. Last summer for six weeks the Fraternity again rented the High School Auditorium to the Gate-way Stock Company of New York City. They presented a number of Broadway plays in a very credit-able manner. The second Craftsman's Fair, held on our green, was a great success. Pi Beta Phi and the village lost a valuable friend in the death of Mr. Andy Huff, owner of the Mountain View Hotel. O i ce When Esther Mines married last July, we were fortunate in having another Pi Phi, Nancy Holmes, Illinois Zeta, Class of 1949, join the staff as Assistant Director. She has been a great help, especially in taking care of the Workshop correspondence and reports. In addition to her work at the school she has served as the Chairman of the Advisory Board for Tennessee Gamma. School A backward look over the past school year brings a feeling of satisfaction. Sevier County, Pi Beta Phi and the P.T.A. combined to provide a well rounded program for over five hundred children attending the school. Nineteen full time and one part time teacher carried on the educational program. In high school we had four new teachers. These were, Mr. Walter Ogle, Principal ; Mr. Granville Shields, Science ; Dorothy Arnold who had attended our Summer Workshop, Home Economics, and Mr. W. J. Miracle who was hired by the Fraternity to supervise the work in Physical Education. In the Elementary School we had no changes in the teaching staff. It was necessary to have two rooms in which there were two grades each. One was a first and second combination and the other a third and fourth grouping. The faculty worked together very harmoniously. In October the school family, the faculty and their families enjoyed a picnic in the mountains. In January we had a faculty party in the nature of an old fashioned "pounding" for the coach and his bride at Stuart Cottage. The usual plays were given. The Juniors presented a melodrama, "Only an Orphan Girl," the Senior play was "Brother Goose" and the eighth grade finished their year by giving "Billie's Aunt Jane." The annual Halloween Carnival was enjoyed by the entire school as was the lovely Christmas program. Room parties were held in the different grade school rooms to observe special days. Films were used more frequently than in the past years, as a part of the School pro-gram. Twenty-one members of the Senior Class with faculty chaperones went to Washington, D.C. for their trip. This class sponsored a small school annual called "The Mountaineer," which was dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Johnson, former Pi Phi employees of the staff. The parting gift from the class to the school was two typewriters which they hope will form the nucleus of a Commercial Department for the school. Nancy Holmes, Assistant Director, was sponsor for the Beta Club. She accompanied several of the club members to the state convention in Nashville. The American Legion Auxiliary entertained the high school basketball teams at a very lovely formal banquet at the New Gatlinburg Inn. The same hotel was the setting for th'e annual Junior Senior banquet. After the Christmas holidays, the County operated a second bus for Gatlinburg. This helped very much in shortening the day for numbers of bus riding pupils. Pi Phi Contributions A backward look brings out the many extras enjoyed by the children attending our school which they could not have were it not for Fraternity help. Mrs. Althea Armstrong for Music, Mr. Miracle for Physical Education, Miss Van Roekel and Mr. Huskey for Arts and Crafts and Wood-work, added much to the program. Several years of training in part singing is showing up when public appearances of the students are made. The carols, making up most of the Christmas program, the Stephen Foster songs and Glee Club numbers given at Community and Commencement events were all very well done. The annual Operetta, "The Snow Queen," was one of the most tuneful and colorful that I have seen. The Arts and Crafts teacher, Fay Van Roekel, contributed much to the program. The beautiful back drops, done mostly on her knees, on strips of brown paper, for the Junior play were used again at the Christmas program and for the Operetta. Her fifth grade class designed and made puppets and wrote the script for an original show, as one of their art projects. The seventh grade made murals for the background of the Stephen Foster pro-gram. Fay gave a talk on Art at a County Teachers meeting and another one to a Y.W.C.A. Youth group at Alcoa. She served as a Graduate Assistant at the Summer Workshop and in August studied weaving at the Guild Workshop at Penland. Her high school girls produced some very nice weaving in their class work. Mr. Carl Huskey directed the boys in the wood shop. Some very creditable pieces of furniture were turned out by the class. While our boys and girls did not do as well as usual in basketball competitions with outside schools, our coach started a very valuable program of intramural sports within the high school classes that provided entertainment and interest most of the year. These contests were played off during the noon hour and in bad weather were most useful in helping provide an outlet for energies that are sometimes hard to control. The sports which were used in this program were basketball, softball, volleyball, pingpong, and ,shuffle board. In the spring a baseball team was organized for the first time. The American Legion allowed the use of their athletic field and they also loaned uniforms for the players. On a beautiful spring day, the whole school held a Field Day which resulted in a victory for the Freshman Class. P. T. A. We were fortunate in having a very active and enthusiastic group of parents who also provided "extras" for the school program. Money for this work comes chiefly from the weekly Bingo games operated during the tourist season in the high school gymnasium and from rummage sales. The school lunch room was again operated by this group, providing hot lunches THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 75 for the children in the Elementary school. Free lunches are provided for needy children. We share in the Government program and receive many supplies from that source. In the fall a book store was set up for the first week of school. This was a great convenience since there is not a store in town that handles school supplies or books. From their funds, the organization voted to give each teacher a sum of $50.00 to be used for supplies. In the high school the teachers pooled their money in order to undertake larger projects. One of these was the sanding and refinishing of the gymnasium floor. An additional gift of one hundred dollars was given for new basketball uniforms, one half to the high school and the other half to the grade school teams, ably coached by Mr. Kelly Huskey, the eighth grade teacher. A class in Parliamentary Law, an old-fashioned Spelling Bee and the sponsoring of a delightful concert by a high school chorus from Knoxville, were other activities of this group. Dormitory Miss Lena Hodgen, our efficient housekeeper, was again in charge of our living arrangements. We had the usual household emergencies to meet but were always provided with good meals. Nancy Holmes was in charge of the six high school girls who lived in Stuart College. Five of them graduated, having been with us most of their school days. In their honor we entertained the senior class and high school faculty following Class Night program. The piano at Stuart was used two days a week when a music teacher from, Pigeon Forge gave private lessons to a number of school children. It was necessary to replace some curtains this year. Now ruffled ones were placed in Nancy's suite and at Teachers Cottage we have some beautiful new -hand woven draperies in the living room and hall. Tina designed them and Lura wove them at the Shop at times when she was not busy with her regular work. It is interesting to note that she has been with the School long enough to weave three sets of draperies for these same rooms. The second set, taken from Teachers Cottage, are in use at Pollard where shiny yellow paint now makes a more cheerful interior. Three sturdy new card tables were purchased and have been in almost constant use at three houses. Health Center The health work done by the Fraternity, under the able direction of our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, is indeed a "repeat Design." Year after year, the inspections, inoculations, health talks with accompanying films, classes in First Aid and home visits for the almost 700 children in the district we serve, add up to an astounding total. Emergencies from school and community, clinics for well babies and expectant mothers, fill many busy days. Our Health Center was used several times for Clinics during the year. Twice the Mobile T.B. Unit was in town and used the building as headquarters. The first day 718 chest x-rays were given and the second time 497. A new law in Tennessee states that every child must be examined by a doctor before he can enter school and that a record of this examination must become a part of his school record. Two such clinics were held in December when 65 children were examined. Children from the rural area were brought to the Health Center. Twenty mothers came with the rural children. The State Department supplies serums but aside from that most of the health work done in town and in three rural schools is taken care of by Pi Beta Phi. That people of the area still look to us for aid was evidenced last winter. A little girl who had never had preventive vaccinations died suddenly of diphtheria. The next day people brought children from town and country to the health center. By night the weary nurse had given 154 preventive shots. Farm Two new laying houses for our Pi Phi hens were built this year to replace some unfit for use. We followed plans furnished by the Poultry Division of the University of Tennessee and are proud of the results. These modern houses will make it possible to have a larger poultry flock to supply the kitchen with eggs and chickens. Any surplus can be very advantageously sold to the Mountain View Hotel. Through the year, several litters of small pigs were raised and sold when they were old enough to make it worth while. The garden produced vegetables for our school family and supplied the University staff during the Workshop. Arrow Craft Shop The year has gone smoothly, following the usual pattern ; busy days for Mrs. Snow-filling and ship-ping Club orders-months like April and October when, as always, the "buying tourists" visit the shop and other days when the tables in the stock room are piled high with weaving, waiting to be tagged and put on the shelves. An effort has been made to reduce inventories, use up old stocks of threads and to concentrate on patterns that can make use of these materials. However, there will be some new accents in the next price list. We have added yellow and green, in pastel shades, to the baby woolen articles we have always carried. To fill a demand for a heavy textured mat, Mrs. McMorran has designed two sets. The less expensive one is in cotton and is called the Periwinkle, the other one is a very handsome linen set made in a diamond weave on double goose eye threading. Neckties and scarfs in bright stripes are other new items. Our designer, Mrs. McMorran, has been active in weaving circles in the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild. She instructed in weaving at the Guild Workshop, held in Penland, North Carolina, last fall and at the Spring Meeting of the Guild was granted a Master Craftsman's Certificate in Weaving. Upon invitation of the officials an exhibit of Arrow Craft products was placed in the side window of the Hamilton National Bank in Knoxville for a week. A new hand made cabinet for displaying jewelry is a useful as well as ornamental addition to the shop. The Hotel Shop has been operated by Mrs. Mc-Cutchean. Mrs. Snow reports that business has been good and that accounts receivable are better than ever before. Each year brings more craft shops to the village but we feel that the quality of our products, sold in their artistic setting, makes Arrow Craft Shop the best one of all. This report would be incomplete without the mention of the many wonderful gifts that individual Pi Phis, Active Chapters, Alumnm Clubs and friends make towards the success of our program. Two gifts of money, one spent for records and the other for library books, were given in memory of Leonard Wild. The staff enjoyed a new waffle iron which I purchased with gift funds. A surprise gift came from the Franklin Square Magazine Agency. The check sent for magazine subscriptions for the high school library was returned with a letter saying that the Fraternity business was so much that they wished to give us the magazines as an expression of their appreciation. The 76 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nurse is always delighted with the boxes of clothing that come to us and especially so with the layettes and baby things. The many boxes of toys and other Christmas gifts help to make Christmas memorable for many children. This year we remembered the 148 children in three rural schools with gifts in addition to 157 gifts to pupils in the three lower grades. Where there is greater need we try to place the really nice toys and clothing. Sigma Phi Gamma, International Sorority, continues to support our health program with gifts of money from their central office and boxes from individual chapters, to whom we are assigned by their welfare secretary. Their gifts are used for eye correc tions and new glasses in most cases. It has been impossible to give you a complete picture of our days at the School. The six weeks Work-shop in Crafts, The Craftsman's Fair and the appearances of the Gateway Stock Company in our Auditorium, make the summers most busy and interesting. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to our fine Settlement School Committee, the loyal local staff and employees and the thousands of Pi Phis over the country who yearly remember the school with kind and loving thoughts as well as concrete gifts.

The increase in the number of active chapters and alum= clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund this year is evidence of the pride Pi Phis have in Holt House. From these contributions minor repairs have been made, and necessary new furnishings have been purchased. We purchased a new refrigerator and two electrical units for the stove and are in the process of having the parlor curtains duplicated, as the old ones were beyond repair. As soon as the material can be matched we hope to have the occasional chairs in the Pine Room recovered. Many necessary repairs have been made; such as painting of the shutters, storm windows, screens, and gutters. The foundation has been re-pointed both inside and out and the floors and basement walls have been repaired and painted. The inside of the house has been painted. Climbing roses have been planted at the base of the trellises which were given to Holt House last year by Paul B. Wallace, in honor of his mother, one of our Founders, Nancy 'Black Wallace. Mr. Wallace, in writing of his mother's college life has mentioned her speaking of the beauty of the entrance to the Holt home with its trellises and climbing roses. This he restored in her memory. The kitchen, the hostess' bathroom, the lavatory off the powder room, and the porch floors have been painted and minor repairs were made to the roof. The number of alumnae clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund increased from 179 last year to 217 this year. The highest contributing clubs were Iowa City, Iowa $50, Kansas City, Missouri, $50, ' and Everett, Washington, $30. Many other clubs sent generous checks. The active chapters increased their contributions, with 87 chapters contributing as compared with 83 for last year. The highest contributing chapters were Louisiana A $100, Illinois A $50, and Oklahoma A $35. The following chapters each gave $25: Missouri B, Iowa r, Kansas B, and Texas A. The highest contributing provinces (alumnm) were: Mu, Lambda, and Kappa. Every club in the following provinces contributed; Mu, Lambda, Theta, and Iota. The highest contributing provinces (active) were: Kappa, Eta and 'Iota. Every chapter in the following provinces contributed: Kappa, Eta, Iota, Delta, Beta and Lambda. Besides active chapters and alumnae clubs in and near Monmouth using the house this past year, the following organizations have held meetings or parties there: Woman's Club, D.A.R., P.E.O., Women's Missionary Group, 'Book Club, Home Bureau, and the Alumna Sewing Circle. Several showers, luncheons, weddings, and receptions have been accommodated. Mrs. Carey, known far and wide in Monmouth for her gracious hospitality, continues to, manage the house very efficiently. The chairman is grateful to Mrs. John Trost our most able treasurer, and to the other committee mem COMMITTEE bers: particularly Mrs. R. M. Jensen, Monmouth, who has scheduled the film and done innumerable other things to facilitate the work of this committee. The chairman gratefully acknowledges the encouragement and guidance given by Miss Onken during the past year. She is grateful also for the many duties performed for the committee by the Director of Central Office, Gladys Hayes Scivally, and by each member of Grand Council. The assistance and cooperation of the province officers has greatly facilitated the work of the committee and of the chairman. Again, this chairman and committee is grateful to Gladys Stump Nall, the preceding chairman, for her advice and help during the past year. We are drawing to the close of a successful year for Holt House, and already planning for an even more successful year in 1950-1951.

        74 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW lighting service held in the Methodist Church on Christmas Eve and a party for all of the community children given by the American Legion Auxiliary. An awakened interest in the welfare of our young people has been evidenced. Scouting for both boys and girls has been actively revived under adequate leadership. Thirteen boys attended the International Jamboree at Valley Forge under the leadership of Mr. William Cron, Head of the Bureau of Roads. The churches sponsored an Easter egg hunt on the Whittle lawn that was enjoyed by many small children. Ever increasing numbers of tourists, coming to the Smokies, have caused the town to maintain a Tourist Bureau and to reorganize the Chamber of Commerce with a full time secretary in charge. During the win-ter a caravan of cars from Gatlinburg toured Florida advertising the tourist attractions and handicrafts of the region. Last summer for six weeks the Fraternity again rented the High School Auditorium to the Gate-way Stock Company of New York City. They presented a number of Broadway plays in a very credit-able manner. The second Craftsman's Fair, held on our green, was a great success. Pi Beta Phi and the village lost a valuable friend in the death of Mr. Andy Huff, owner of the Mountain View Hotel. O i ce When Esther Mines married last July, we were fortunate in having another Pi Phi, Nancy Holmes, Illinois Zeta, Class of 1949, join the staff as Assistant Director. She has been a great help, especially in taking care of the Workshop correspondence and reports. In addition to her work at the school she has served as the Chairman of the Advisory Board for Tennessee Gamma. School A backward look over the past school year brings a feeling of satisfaction. Sevier County, Pi Beta Phi and the P.T.A. combined to provide a well rounded program for over five hundred children attending the school. Nineteen full time and one part time teacher carried on the educational program. In high school we had four new teachers. These were, Mr. Walter Ogle, Principal ; Mr. Granville Shields, Science ; Dorothy Arnold who had attended our Summer Workshop, Home Economics, and Mr. W. J. Miracle who was hired by the Fraternity to supervise the work in Physical Education. In the Elementary School we had no changes in the teaching staff. It was necessary to have two rooms in which there were two grades each. One was a first and second combination and the other a third and fourth grouping. The faculty worked together very harmoniously. In October the school family, the faculty and their families enjoyed a picnic in the mountains. In January we had a faculty party in the nature of an old fashioned "pounding" for the coach and his bride at Stuart Cottage. The usual plays were given. The Juniors presented a melodrama, "Only an Orphan Girl," the Senior play was "Brother Goose" and the eighth grade finished their year by giving "Billie's Aunt Jane." The annual Halloween Carnival was enjoyed by the entire school as was the lovely Christmas program. Room parties were held in the different grade school rooms to observe special days. Films were used more frequently than in the past years, as a part of the School pro-gram. Twenty-one members of the Senior Class with faculty chaperones went to Washington, D.C. for their trip. This class sponsored a small school annual called "The Mountaineer," which was dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Johnson, former Pi Phi employees of the staff. The parting gift from the class to the school was two typewriters which they hope will form the nucleus of a Commercial Department for the school. Nancy Holmes, Assistant Director, was sponsor for the Beta Club. She accompanied several of the club members to the state convention in Nashville. The American Legion Auxiliary entertained the high school basketball teams at a very lovely formal banquet at the New Gatlinburg Inn. The same hotel was the setting for th'e annual Junior Senior banquet. After the Christmas holidays, the County operated a second bus for Gatlinburg. This helped very much in shortening the day for numbers of bus riding pupils. Pi Phi Contributions A backward look brings out the many extras enjoyed by the children attending our school which they could not have were it not for Fraternity help. Mrs. Althea Armstrong for Music, Mr. Miracle for Physical Education, Miss Van Roekel and Mr. Huskey for Arts and Crafts and Wood-work, added much to the program. Several years of training in part singing is showing up when public appearances of the students are made. The carols, making up most of the Christmas program, the Stephen Foster songs and Glee Club numbers given at Community and Commencement events were all very well done. The annual Operetta, "The Snow Queen," was one of the most tuneful and colorful that I have seen. The Arts and Crafts teacher, Fay Van Roekel, contributed much to the program. The beautiful back drops, done mostly on her knees, on strips of brown paper, for the Junior play were used again at the Christmas program and for the Operetta. Her fifth grade class designed and made puppets and wrote the script for an original show, as one of their art projects. The seventh grade made murals for the background of the Stephen Foster pro-gram. Fay gave a talk on Art at a County Teachers meeting and another one to a Y.W.C.A. Youth group at Alcoa. She served as a Graduate Assistant at the Summer Workshop and in August studied weaving at the Guild Workshop at Penland. Her high school girls produced some very nice weaving in their class work. Mr. Carl Huskey directed the boys in the wood shop. Some very creditable pieces of furniture were turned out by the class. While our boys and girls did not do as well as usual in basketball competitions with outside schools, our coach started a very valuable program of intramural sports within the high school classes that provided entertainment and interest most of the year. These contests were played off during the noon hour and in bad weather were most useful in helping provide an outlet for energies that are sometimes hard to control. The sports which were used in this program were basketball, softball, volleyball, pingpong, and ,shuffle board. In the spring a baseball team was organized for the first time. The American Legion allowed the use of their athletic field and they also loaned uniforms for the players. On a beautiful spring day, the whole school held a Field Day which resulted in a victory for the Freshman Class. P. T. A. We were fortunate in having a very active and enthusiastic group of parents who also provided "extras" for the school program. Money for this work comes chiefly from the weekly Bingo games operated during the tourist season in the high school gymnasium and from rummage sales. The school lunch room was again operated by this group, providing hot lunches THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 75 for the children in the Elementary school. Free lunches are provided for needy children. We share in the Government program and receive many supplies from that source. In the fall a book store was set up for the first week of school. This was a great convenience since there is not a store in town that handles school supplies or books. From their funds, the organization voted to give each teacher a sum of $50.00 to be used for supplies. In the high school the teachers pooled their money in order to undertake larger projects. One of these was the sanding and refinishing of the gymnasium floor. An additional gift of one hundred dollars was given for new basketball uniforms, one half to the high school and the other half to the grade school teams, ably coached by Mr. Kelly Huskey, the eighth grade teacher. A class in Parliamentary Law, an old-fashioned Spelling Bee and the sponsoring of a delightful concert by a high school chorus from Knoxville, were other activities of this group. Dormitory Miss Lena Hodgen, our efficient housekeeper, was again in charge of our living arrangements. We had the usual household emergencies to meet but were always provided with good meals. Nancy Holmes was in charge of the six high school girls who lived in Stuart College. Five of them graduated, having been with us most of their school days. In their honor we entertained the senior class and high school faculty following Class Night program. The piano at Stuart was used two days a week when a music teacher from, Pigeon Forge gave private lessons to a number of school children. It was necessary to replace some curtains this year. Now ruffled ones were placed in Nancy's suite and at Teachers Cottage we have some beautiful new -hand woven draperies in the living room and hall. Tina designed them and Lura wove them at the Shop at times when she was not busy with her regular work. It is interesting to note that she has been with the School long enough to weave three sets of draperies for these same rooms. The second set, taken from Teachers Cottage, are in use at Pollard where shiny yellow paint now makes a more cheerful interior. Three sturdy new card tables were purchased and have been in almost constant use at three houses. Health Center The health work done by the Fraternity, under the able direction of our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, is indeed a "repeat Design." Year after year, the inspections, inoculations, health talks with accompanying films, classes in First Aid and home visits for the almost 700 children in the district we serve, add up to an astounding total. Emergencies from school and community, clinics for well babies and expectant mothers, fill many busy days. Our Health Center was used several times for Clinics during the year. Twice the Mobile T.B. Unit was in town and used the building as headquarters. The first day 718 chest x-rays were given and the second time 497. A new law in Tennessee states that every child must be examined by a doctor before he can enter school and that a record of this examination must become a part of his school record. Two such clinics were held in December when 65 children were examined. Children from the rural area were brought to the Health Center. Twenty mothers came with the rural children. The State Department supplies serums but aside from that most of the health work done in town and in three rural schools is taken care of by Pi Beta Phi. That people of the area still look to us for aid was evidenced last winter. A little girl who had never had preventive vaccinations died suddenly of diphtheria. The next day people brought children from town and country to the health center. By night the weary nurse had given 154 preventive shots. Farm Two new laying houses for our Pi Phi hens were built this year to replace some unfit for use. We followed plans furnished by the Poultry Division of the University of Tennessee and are proud of the results. These modern houses will make it possible to have a larger poultry flock to supply the kitchen with eggs and chickens. Any surplus can be very advantageously sold to the Mountain View Hotel. Through the year, several litters of small pigs were raised and sold when they were old enough to make it worth while. The garden produced vegetables for our school family and supplied the University staff during the Workshop. Arrow Craft Shop The year has gone smoothly, following the usual pattern ; busy days for Mrs. Snow-filling and ship-ping Club orders-months like April and October when, as always, the "buying tourists" visit the shop and other days when the tables in the stock room are piled high with weaving, waiting to be tagged and put on the shelves. An effort has been made to reduce inventories, use up old stocks of threads and to concentrate on patterns that can make use of these materials. However, there will be some new accents in the next price list. We have added yellow and green, in pastel shades, to the baby woolen articles we have always carried. To fill a demand for a heavy textured mat, Mrs. McMorran has designed two sets. The less expensive one is in cotton and is called the Periwinkle, the other one is a very handsome linen set made in a diamond weave on double goose eye threading. Neckties and scarfs in bright stripes are other new items. Our designer, Mrs. McMorran, has been active in weaving circles in the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild. She instructed in weaving at the Guild Workshop, held in Penland, North Carolina, last fall and at the Spring Meeting of the Guild was granted a Master Craftsman's Certificate in Weaving. Upon invitation of the officials an exhibit of Arrow Craft products was placed in the side window of the Hamilton National Bank in Knoxville for a week. A new hand made cabinet for displaying jewelry is a useful as well as ornamental addition to the shop. The Hotel Shop has been operated by Mrs. Mc-Cutchean. Mrs. Snow reports that business has been good and that accounts receivable are better than ever before. Each year brings more craft shops to the village but we feel that the quality of our products, sold in their artistic setting, makes Arrow Craft Shop the best one of all. This report would be incomplete without the mention of the many wonderful gifts that individual Pi Phis, Active Chapters, Alumnm Clubs and friends make towards the success of our program. Two gifts of money, one spent for records and the other for library books, were given in memory of Leonard Wild. The staff enjoyed a new waffle iron which I purchased with gift funds. A surprise gift came from the Franklin Square Magazine Agency. The check sent for magazine subscriptions for the high school library was returned with a letter saying that the Fraternity business was so much that they wished to give us the magazines as an expression of their appreciation. The 76 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nurse is always delighted with the boxes of clothing that come to us and especially so with the layettes and baby things. The many boxes of toys and other Christmas gifts help to make Christmas memorable for many children. This year we remembered the 148 children in three rural schools with gifts in addition to 157 gifts to pupils in the three lower grades. Where there is greater need we try to place the really nice toys and clothing. Sigma Phi Gamma, International Sorority, continues to support our health program with gifts of money from their central office and boxes from individual chapters, to whom we are assigned by their welfare secretary. Their gifts are used for eye correc tions and new glasses in most cases. It has been impossible to give you a complete picture of our days at the School. The six weeks Work-shop in Crafts, The Craftsman's Fair and the appearances of the Gateway Stock Company in our Auditorium, make the summers most busy and interesting. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to our fine Settlement School Committee, the loyal local staff and employees and the thousands of Pi Phis over the country who yearly remember the school with kind and loving thoughts as well as concrete gifts.

The increase in the number of active chapters and alum= clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund this year is evidence of the pride Pi Phis have in Holt House. From these contributions minor repairs have been made, and necessary new furnishings have been purchased. We purchased a new refrigerator and two electrical units for the stove and are in the process of having the parlor curtains duplicated, as the old ones were beyond repair. As soon as the material can be matched we hope to have the occasional chairs in the Pine Room recovered. Many necessary repairs have been made; such as painting of the shutters, storm windows, screens, and gutters. The foundation has been re-pointed both inside and out and the floors and basement walls have been repaired and painted. The inside of the house has been painted. Climbing roses have been planted at the base of the trellises which were given to Holt House last year by Paul B. Wallace, in honor of his mother, one of our Founders, Nancy 'Black Wallace. Mr. Wallace, in writing of his mother's college life has mentioned her speaking of the beauty of the entrance to the Holt home with its trellises and climbing roses. This he restored in her memory. The kitchen, the hostess' bathroom, the lavatory off the powder room, and the porch floors have been painted and minor repairs were made to the roof. The number of alumnae clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund increased from 179 last year to 217 this year. The highest contributing clubs were Iowa City, Iowa $50, Kansas City, Missouri, $50, ' and Everett, Washington, $30. Many other clubs sent generous checks. The active chapters increased their contributions, with 87 chapters contributing as compared with 83 for last year. The highest contributing chapters were Louisiana A $100, Illinois A $50, and Oklahoma A $35. The following chapters each gave $25: Missouri B, Iowa r, Kansas B, and Texas A. The highest contributing provinces (alumnm) were: Mu, Lambda, and Kappa. Every club in the following provinces contributed; Mu, Lambda, Theta, and Iota. The highest contributing provinces (active) were: Kappa, Eta and 'Iota. Every chapter in the following provinces contributed: Kappa, Eta, Iota, Delta, Beta and Lambda. Besides active chapters and alumnae clubs in and near Monmouth using the house this past year, the following organizations have held meetings or parties there: Woman's Club, D.A.R., P.E.O., Women's Missionary Group, 'Book Club, Home Bureau, and the Alumna Sewing Circle. Several showers, luncheons, weddings, and receptions have been accommodated. Mrs. Carey, known far and wide in Monmouth for her gracious hospitality, continues to, manage the house very efficiently. The chairman is grateful to Mrs. John Trost our most able treasurer, and to the other committee mem COMMITTEE bers: particularly Mrs. R. M. Jensen, Monmouth, who has scheduled the film and done innumerable other things to facilitate the work of this committee. The chairman gratefully acknowledges the encouragement and guidance given by Miss Onken during the past year. She is grateful also for the many duties performed for the committee by the Director of Central Office, Gladys Hayes Scivally, and by each member of Grand Council. The assistance and cooperation of the province officers has greatly facilitated the work of the committee and of the chairman. Again, this chairman and committee is grateful to Gladys Stump Nall, the preceding chairman, for her advice and help during the past year. We are drawing to the close of a successful year for Holt House, and already planning for an even more successful year in 1950-1951.

        76 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nurse is always delighted with the boxes of clothing that come to us and especially so with the layettes and baby things. The many boxes of toys and other Christmas gifts help to make Christmas memorable for many children. This year we remembered the 148 children in three rural schools with gifts in addition to 157 gifts to pupils in the three lower grades. Where there is greater need we try to place the really nice toys and clothing. Sigma Phi Gamma, International Sorority, continues to support our health program with gifts of money from their central office and boxes from individual chapters, to whom we are assigned by their welfare secretary. Their gifts are used for eye correc tions and new glasses in most cases. It has been impossible to give you a complete picture of our days at the School. The six weeks Work-shop in Crafts, The Craftsman's Fair and the appearances of the Gateway Stock Company in our Auditorium, make the summers most busy and interesting. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to our fine Settlement School Committee, the loyal local staff and employees and the thousands of Pi Phis over the country who yearly remember the school with kind and loving thoughts as well as concrete gifts.

The increase in the number of active chapters and alum= clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund this year is evidence of the pride Pi Phis have in Holt House. From these contributions minor repairs have been made, and necessary new furnishings have been purchased. We purchased a new refrigerator and two electrical units for the stove and are in the process of having the parlor curtains duplicated, as the old ones were beyond repair. As soon as the material can be matched we hope to have the occasional chairs in the Pine Room recovered. Many necessary repairs have been made; such as painting of the shutters, storm windows, screens, and gutters. The foundation has been re-pointed both inside and out and the floors and basement walls have been repaired and painted. The inside of the house has been painted. Climbing roses have been planted at the base of the trellises which were given to Holt House last year by Paul B. Wallace, in honor of his mother, one of our Founders, Nancy 'Black Wallace. Mr. Wallace, in writing of his mother's college life has mentioned her speaking of the beauty of the entrance to the Holt home with its trellises and climbing roses. This he restored in her memory. The kitchen, the hostess' bathroom, the lavatory off the powder room, and the porch floors have been painted and minor repairs were made to the roof. The number of alumnae clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund increased from 179 last year to 217 this year. The highest contributing clubs were Iowa City, Iowa $50, Kansas City, Missouri, $50, ' and Everett, Washington, $30. Many other clubs sent generous checks. The active chapters increased their contributions, with 87 chapters contributing as compared with 83 for last year. The highest contributing chapters were Louisiana A $100, Illinois A $50, and Oklahoma A $35. The following chapters each gave $25: Missouri B, Iowa r, Kansas B, and Texas A. The highest contributing provinces (alumnm) were: Mu, Lambda, and Kappa. Every club in the following provinces contributed; Mu, Lambda, Theta, and Iota. The highest contributing provinces (active) were: Kappa, Eta and 'Iota. Every chapter in the following provinces contributed: Kappa, Eta, Iota, Delta, Beta and Lambda. Besides active chapters and alumnae clubs in and near Monmouth using the house this past year, the following organizations have held meetings or parties there: Woman's Club, D.A.R., P.E.O., Women's Missionary Group, 'Book Club, Home Bureau, and the Alumna Sewing Circle. Several showers, luncheons, weddings, and receptions have been accommodated. Mrs. Carey, known far and wide in Monmouth for her gracious hospitality, continues to, manage the house very efficiently. The chairman is grateful to Mrs. John Trost our most able treasurer, and to the other committee mem COMMITTEE bers: particularly Mrs. R. M. Jensen, Monmouth, who has scheduled the film and done innumerable other things to facilitate the work of this committee. The chairman gratefully acknowledges the encouragement and guidance given by Miss Onken during the past year. She is grateful also for the many duties performed for the committee by the Director of Central Office, Gladys Hayes Scivally, and by each member of Grand Council. The assistance and cooperation of the province officers has greatly facilitated the work of the committee and of the chairman. Again, this chairman and committee is grateful to Gladys Stump Nall, the preceding chairman, for her advice and help during the past year. We are drawing to the close of a successful year for Holt House, and already planning for an even more successful year in 1950-1951.

The increase in the number of active chapters and alum= clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund this year is evidence of the pride Pi Phis have in Holt House. From these contributions minor repairs have been made, and necessary new furnishings have been purchased. We purchased a new refrigerator and two electrical units for the stove and are in the process of having the parlor curtains duplicated, as the old ones were beyond repair. As soon as the material can be matched we hope to have the occasional chairs in the Pine Room recovered. Many necessary repairs have been made; such as painting of the shutters, storm windows, screens, and gutters. The foundation has been re-pointed both inside and out and the floors and basement walls have been repaired and painted. The inside of the house has been painted. Climbing roses have been planted at the base of the trellises which were given to Holt House last year by Paul B. Wallace, in honor of his mother, one of our Founders, Nancy 'Black Wallace. Mr. Wallace, in writing of his mother's college life has mentioned her speaking of the beauty of the entrance to the Holt home with its trellises and climbing roses. This he restored in her memory. The kitchen, the hostess' bathroom, the lavatory off the powder room, and the porch floors have been painted and minor repairs were made to the roof. The number of alumnae clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund increased from 179 last year to 217 this year. The highest contributing clubs were Iowa City, Iowa $50, Kansas City, Missouri, $50, ' and Everett, Washington, $30. Many other clubs sent generous checks. The active chapters increased their contributions, with 87 chapters contributing as compared with 83 for last year. The highest contributing chapters were Louisiana A $100, Illinois A $50, and Oklahoma A $35. The following chapters each gave $25: Missouri B, Iowa r, Kansas B, and Texas A. The highest contributing provinces (alumnm) were: Mu, Lambda, and Kappa. Every club in the following provinces contributed; Mu, Lambda, Theta, and Iota. The highest contributing provinces (active) were: Kappa, Eta and 'Iota. Every chapter in the following provinces contributed: Kappa, Eta, Iota, Delta, Beta and Lambda. Besides active chapters and alumnae clubs in and near Monmouth using the house this past year, the following organizations have held meetings or parties there: Woman's Club, D.A.R., P.E.O., Women's Missionary Group, 'Book Club, Home Bureau, and the Alumna Sewing Circle. Several showers, luncheons, weddings, and receptions have been accommodated. Mrs. Carey, known far and wide in Monmouth for her gracious hospitality, continues to, manage the house very efficiently. The chairman is grateful to Mrs. John Trost our most able treasurer, and to the other committee mem COMMITTEE bers: particularly Mrs. R. M. Jensen, Monmouth, who has scheduled the film and done innumerable other things to facilitate the work of this committee. The chairman gratefully acknowledges the encouragement and guidance given by Miss Onken during the past year. She is grateful also for the many duties performed for the committee by the Director of Central Office, Gladys Hayes Scivally, and by each member of Grand Council. The assistance and cooperation of the province officers has greatly facilitated the work of the committee and of the chairman. Again, this chairman and committee is grateful to Gladys Stump Nall, the preceding chairman, for her advice and help during the past year. We are drawing to the close of a successful year for Holt House, and already planning for an even more successful year in 1950-1951.

The increase in the number of active chapters and alum= clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund this year is evidence of the pride Pi Phis have in Holt House. From these contributions minor repairs have been made, and necessary new furnishings have been purchased. We purchased a new refrigerator and two electrical units for the stove and are in the process of having the parlor curtains duplicated, as the old ones were beyond repair. As soon as the material can be matched we hope to have the occasional chairs in the Pine Room recovered. Many necessary repairs have been made; such as painting of the shutters, storm windows, screens, and gutters. The foundation has been re-pointed both inside and out and the floors and basement walls have been repaired and painted. The inside of the house has been painted. Climbing roses have been planted at the base of the trellises which were given to Holt House last year by Paul B. Wallace, in honor of his mother, one of our Founders, Nancy 'Black Wallace. Mr. Wallace, in writing of his mother's college life has mentioned her speaking of the beauty of the entrance to the Holt home with its trellises and climbing roses. This he restored in her memory. The kitchen, the hostess' bathroom, the lavatory off the powder room, and the porch floors have been painted and minor repairs were made to the roof. The number of alumnae clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund increased from 179 last year to 217 this year. The highest contributing clubs were Iowa City, Iowa $50, Kansas City, Missouri, $50, ' and Everett, Washington, $30. Many other clubs sent generous checks. The active chapters increased their contributions, with 87 chapters contributing as compared with 83 for last year. The highest contributing chapters were Louisiana A $100, Illinois A $50, and Oklahoma A $35. The following chapters each gave $25: Missouri B, Iowa r, Kansas B, and Texas A. The highest contributing provinces (alumnm) were: Mu, Lambda, and Kappa. Every club in the following provinces contributed; Mu, Lambda, Theta, and Iota. The highest contributing provinces (active) were: Kappa, Eta and 'Iota. Every chapter in the following provinces contributed: Kappa, Eta, Iota, Delta, Beta and Lambda. Besides active chapters and alumnae clubs in and near Monmouth using the house this past year, the following organizations have held meetings or parties there: Woman's Club, D.A.R., P.E.O., Women's Missionary Group, 'Book Club, Home Bureau, and the Alumna Sewing Circle. Several showers, luncheons, weddings, and receptions have been accommodated. Mrs. Carey, known far and wide in Monmouth for her gracious hospitality, continues to, manage the house very efficiently. The chairman is grateful to Mrs. John Trost our most able treasurer, and to the other committee mem COMMITTEE bers: particularly Mrs. R. M. Jensen, Monmouth, who has scheduled the film and done innumerable other things to facilitate the work of this committee. The chairman gratefully acknowledges the encouragement and guidance given by Miss Onken during the past year. She is grateful also for the many duties performed for the committee by the Director of Central Office, Gladys Hayes Scivally, and by each member of Grand Council. The assistance and cooperation of the province officers has greatly facilitated the work of the committee and of the chairman. Again, this chairman and committee is grateful to Gladys Stump Nall, the preceding chairman, for her advice and help during the past year. We are drawing to the close of a successful year for Holt House, and already planning for an even more successful year in 1950-1951.

We purchased a new refrigerator and two electrical units for the stove and are in the process of having the parlor curtains duplicated, as the old ones were beyond repair. As soon as the material can be matched we hope to have the occasional chairs in the Pine Room recovered. Many necessary repairs have been made; such as painting of the shutters, storm windows, screens, and gutters. The foundation has been re-pointed both inside and out and the floors and basement walls have been repaired and painted. The inside of the house has been painted. Climbing roses have been planted at the base of the trellises which were given to Holt House last year by Paul B. Wallace, in honor of his mother, one of our Founders, Nancy 'Black Wallace. Mr. Wallace, in writing of his mother's college life has mentioned her speaking of the beauty of the entrance to the Holt home with its trellises and climbing roses. This he restored in her memory. The kitchen, the hostess' bathroom, the lavatory off the powder room, and the porch floors have been painted and minor repairs were made to the roof. The number of alumnae clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund increased from 179 last year to 217 this year. The highest contributing clubs were Iowa City, Iowa $50, Kansas City, Missouri, $50, ' and Everett, Washington, $30. Many other clubs sent generous checks. The active chapters increased their contributions, with 87 chapters contributing as compared with 83 for last year. The highest contributing chapters were Louisiana A $100, Illinois A $50, and Oklahoma A $35. The following chapters each gave $25: Missouri B, Iowa r, Kansas B, and Texas A. The highest contributing provinces (alumnm) were: Mu, Lambda, and Kappa. Every club in the following provinces contributed; Mu, Lambda, Theta, and Iota. The highest contributing provinces (active) were: Kappa, Eta and 'Iota. Every chapter in the following provinces contributed: Kappa, Eta, Iota, Delta, Beta and Lambda. Besides active chapters and alumnae clubs in and near Monmouth using the house this past year, the following organizations have held meetings or parties there: Woman's Club, D.A.R., P.E.O., Women's Missionary Group, 'Book Club, Home Bureau, and the Alumna Sewing Circle. Several showers, luncheons, weddings, and receptions have been accommodated. Mrs. Carey, known far and wide in Monmouth for her gracious hospitality, continues to, manage the house very efficiently. The chairman is grateful to Mrs. John Trost our most able treasurer, and to the other committee mem COMMITTEE bers: particularly Mrs. R. M. Jensen, Monmouth, who has scheduled the film and done innumerable other things to facilitate the work of this committee. The chairman gratefully acknowledges the encouragement and guidance given by Miss Onken during the past year. She is grateful also for the many duties performed for the committee by the Director of Central Office, Gladys Hayes Scivally, and by each member of Grand Council. The assistance and cooperation of the province officers has greatly facilitated the work of the committee and of the chairman. Again, this chairman and committee is grateful to Gladys Stump Nall, the preceding chairman, for her advice and help during the past year. We are drawing to the close of a successful year for Holt House, and already planning for an even more successful year in 1950-1951.

A letter in athletics Because play is an essential part of life. Athletic contests some of them are play at its best for a normal, healthy man. 2. A grade average of "B" Grade "C" or "D" usually means shoddy work and that's bad habit. "A" for me would require a grind and neglect of life which I refuse. "B" is all that's left. 3. Time for some real friendships, both men and women Life's chief value finally is friends. These four years must not be friendless or hurriedly, superficially "friendly." 4. Some real piece of service on the campus or in the community A great growing selfish life "There ain't no such animal." 5. To do well what I do It's a slow college that has less than fifty extra-curricular activities on the campus. Well, about forty-six of these I would let the other fellow run and I would "saw wood" on the few that seemed to me of the most value. Would I date and "Say It With Flowers ?" Sure, but I wouldn't talk myseff hoarse saying it. Would I join a fraternity if I had a chance? By all means, for through the medium of the fraternity I would be able more easily to attain those other things for which I would aim. Fraternity Month, June 1950 . _Troe Settlement School eports 1t, CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE IN VIRGINIA lives a wood-carver whose output runs heavily to bears. He carves them swiftly and unerringly from almost any sort of wood. Each one has a remarkably individual bearishness. "I don't see how you can do it so easily," said one as she watched his quick knife. "Well, ma'am," explained the wood-carver, "I just look at a little block of wood 'til I see the b'ar; then I cut away the wood, and thar's the b'ar!" Perhaps that is what happened in Pi Beta Phi. They just kept lookin' and whittlin' and all at once, there was a pretty sizable b'ar, the Settlement School, carved out of the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee for all to see and admire. It is true that the original site-selection committee did not altogether have in mind a beautiful setting for our school, as that was not the primary purpose, but it would have had to seek far to find a lovelier one. It is colorful from early spring until the frosts bring the fall foliage into full colors. Last month the Committee received great inspiration for its meeting from the hills where the new young forest greens were combined with the iridescent whiteness of the dogwoods and here and there a wild flaming azalea for contrast. Because primarily the fraternity plan was for a project in Tennessee which embraced the three Rs, perhaps it is wise to start with a resume of our educational program. From our beginnings in 1912 with one teacher and one school room to benefit the thirteen pupils, the program expanded year by year with other grades being added as the enrollment increased. In the twenties not only was a grade school building erected but an 'extension plan had been inaugurated at Sugarlands, now a part of the Smoky Mountain National Park. With the start of the thirties the school had grown ' into ten grades with an enrollment of one hundred seventy. The county then paid the salary of four teachers. A new building was erected for the use of the high school grades and 1936 found us with a complete high school curriculum, thus offering our young people full 'educational opportunities through the twelfth year. In the late thirties and early forties, two surveys of our program were made. Both recommended that we turn over to the County the costs of maintaining the school as fast as the County could assume that burden and by 1943 the community and the fraternity convinced the County that it could assume the costs of basic education and offer to Gatlinburg as much as it gave the other schools of the County. A satisfactory Lease-Agreement was drawn up between the fraternity and the County to cover a period of twenty-five years. Since then, from time to time, we have added supplementary courses Physical Education, Music, and Arts and Crafts to increase the physical well-being of the young people and to expand their natural skills. In 1947 the State School 'Planning Commission recommended an immediate building program to care for the fast increasing enrollment. At that time the Grand Council and the Settlement School Committee unanimously agreed to deed 1.8 acres of our property to the County and to draw up a new Lease-Agreement for a longer period of time. However, the Planning Commission felt that the grade and high schoolsshould be kept together and be erected on County owned, not leased, property. For two years the County sought to purchase acreage in Gatlinburg, in order to satisfy the Commission but found only inflated purchase prices. Again the County Board of Education came to Pi Beta Phi. (For more complete details see Information Arrows: 1948, Page 94; 1949, Page 59.) After numerous conferences with the people of the Community and the County Board, ably handled by Miss Onken, and with legal advice, the Council and the Committee, for the second time, agreed to deed about two acres to the County and draw up a new Lease-Agreement on a fifty year basis instead of the original twenty-five year plan, but on the same general terms. This was done and at present writing the first unit of a new grade school plant is in process of construction. It will be ready for the opening of school. This unit accommodates six grades and later a second will be added, at which time our grade school building will revert to us. For the information of those who have visited the Settlement School, the new building stands between our grade school and Teachers' Cottage and the balance of deeded land lies behind Teachers' Cottage. It should not b'e our desire to relinquish entirely our supervision nor to remove our helping influence. Perhaps our guidance is needed as never before. The mountaineer of pioneer stock is now outnumbered by the outsiders who have come to 'Gatlinburg but his family still needs our aid in preserving this native heritage of staunch ideals, integrity and intelligence. This year Mr. Walter Ogle, once a pupil in our school, has served as Superintendent and High School principal and has won the respect of both students and community. He is eager to work with Pi Beta Phi and appreciates Miss Dyer's counsel. Physical Education was taught by William J. Miracle, University of Tennessee graduate. In addition to special emphasis on Basketball, he introduced other sports in season and completed each activity with a tournament among the classes. The intramural competition was new and increased general interest in sports for girls and boys. The inauguration of base-ball as a spring sport which could be supported by a small school such as Gatlinburg was well received. The cooperation of the American Legion in loaning uniforms and their playing field was a great help. In Music, Mrs. Althea Armstrong has continued working with all 'eight grades and the high school to broaden each pupil's musical appreciation. Major pro-grams were a Stephen Foster evening; the Christmas presentation of Satis Coleman's "Mystery of the Nativity" in pantomine and introducing rare carols of many countries; the pretentious musical, "The 'Snow Queen" by Cooke. This latter production at the close of the school year used almost one hundred children's voices and would do credit to a much larger school. The lead was sung by Barbara Steele who with Paul Clabo 'entertained us on the Settlement School pro-gram in 1948. Various smaller groups and the high school chorus gave programs before several local and county organizations. In Arts and 'Crafts, creative expression was stressed in the lower grades through the media of chalk, char-coal and paint. Poster making in all grades was re-warded by cash prizes from the American Legion 69 70 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Auxiliary for their poppy posters. The fifth grade produced three original plays for glove puppets all of which were made by the children themselves. Chalk murals, soap carving, metal repousee and making "tie dye" scarves were other activities. In the higher grades some outstanding results were evident in metal work, bowls, ash-trays, candle-holders, coasters. Weaving occupied the winter months for the girls, while stenciled luncheon sets and aprons were out-lets for basic designing. The boys found these subjects beneath them but painting had great appeal. Miss Van Roekel and Mr. Miracle were co-sponsors of the junior class and Miss Van, as the children call her, directed their class play. Her ability to make the backdrops put her in special demand on other occasions also. It is with extreme regret that we accept Miss Van Roekel's resignation in order for her to continue her education toward a Master's degree at Cranbrook. The Committee was greatly impressed with the progress of the Woodworking class under the super-vision of Mr. Carl Huskey, who had a part-time pro-gram for the high school boys. Each made some article for the home--a lamp, coffee table, book ends or magazine rack. For those boys not going on to college this course is a practical one toward seeking employment in one of the several furniture factories near-by. The Health Center is a true center for school, community and district or as our nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, describes it, "a cooperative, not exactly community cooperative, but nation-wide . . . composed of people from all walks of life, all parts of the country, all working for the service of mankind." Under the nurse's leadership, the days are filled with inoculations, first aid, talks on health, nutrition or safety. She has papers to be written and delivered be-fore Knoxville or other Tennessee organizations, writes a weekly "Health Shot" column for the local paper. Through the latter medium she is able to pre-scribe many sugared bits of health admonition. This year the County Health Department arranged for twenty clinics in which the first graders were given medical examination now required by Tennessee law. Two of the clinics were held at our Health Center, one for Gatlinburg and the other for the five nearby rural schools. The two local doctors officiated. Hereafter, the state-wide clinics will be held in the summer in order that remedial defects may be corrected and necessary inoculations given before the start of school. Our little babies continue to hold the spotlight and it is indeed a matter of pride that not one baby has been lost this past year; one premature was returned to the hospital incubator for a time. In our part of Sevier County there are but three children of school age as yet unable to attend. One is a spastic and the others, post polio cases. All receive regular instruction from the State Homebound teacher. A small six year old boy, totally deaf as the result of an attack of meningitis has been placed in the Tennessee School for the Deaf. Our constant efforts toward good health for the younger generation have borne fruit. Very successful was the day spent in assisting the technicians who brought their large mobile X-ray unit from the Division of Tuberculosis Control to the Health Center where more than seven hundred were processed. We are very grateful to Sigma Phi Gamma who through their welfare work for mountain children help to provide fitted glasses and dental care. This year nine children were cared for. There is a gradualawakening to the health needs of the community and there are encouraging signs which reflect our influence over the long period. Most recent is the cornpletion of a new system of pure water for the town and when its citizens finally sense the danger of only local sewage systems, one more of our great concerns will be at an end. There is always more to be accomplished at the Health Center than can be done, be it summer or winter, but the unselfish service contributed to school and community is felt throughout the countryside and Marjorie is loved by all the children. It may be that less need be written about Arrow Craft than any other department since all are so keenly cognizant of it through the beauty of its wares. Under Ethel Snow's capable management Arrow Craft has had an excellent year. We appreciate your sales because the school could not operate with-out them and we solicit the participation of even the smallest clubs for, in addition to the increased in-come, it gives us the subsequent fine publicity which the products indeed merit. Though they were by no means leading in membership, last year fourteen clubs each sold more than a thousand dollars worth of goods. This year there are nine with two of them exceeding the two thousand dollar mark. Here is the list: Houston, Texas, $2220.24; Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, $2120.98; Portland, Oregon, $1890.00; Albuquerque, New Mexico, $1596.39; Marin County, California, $1398.21; Denver, Colorado, $1339.15; Cleveland East, Ohio, $1326.73; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, $1278.63 ; Omaha, Nebraska, $1210.08. Those considered are only those whose money in these amounts had been received at Arrow Craft by the time of audit. To them and many others, a heartfelt "Thank your" It would give Arrow Craft fewer headaches and the Committee far less the appearance of ogres if every club or chapter would make complete payment in full or return the unsold goods for credit after the annual sale. No business, large or small, can operate without cash and no shop gives unlimited credit, does it? With an ever increasing number of enthusiastic alumnae clubs we ask for more sales but we also ask that each club give more thought to why Pi Beta Phi is conducting its Arrow Craft Shop and how much better use there is for the money there than lying idly in some local bank. The design and colors of Arrow Craft products continue to gladden the eye of all who see them. Tina McMorran has brought to her work a concept of the practical as well as the beautiful. At the suggestion of the Committee, she set to work to reduce the tremendous stock of raw materials on hand, necessarily purchased during wartime shortages, and ingeniously she has cut that inventory; at the same time, not knowing what economic turn might come, she has operated on a greatly reduced budget, dropping those items less in demand and reducing the quantity of others. Unfortunately this has meant a temporary reduction in the number of weavers but with the present furore of the chain stores for woven nylon bags, those released have found work elsewhere. This past year our insurance has been carried on a monthly inventory basis, a sound protection against loss. One interesting demand this spring is for the longer and brighter neck-tie. This has prompted the weaving of some tie material in Aunt Lizzie's old three harness twill pattern which throws more color to the top, with clearer stronger colors. Izora, long one of our good weavers, feels great pride in being chosen to carry on Aunt Lizzie's weave and she will demonstrate THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 71 its use at the Craftsman's Fair late this summer. Tina has worked toward a Master Craftsman award this year and received it from the Southern Highlands Handicrafts Guild at its spring meeting. This is only the third given by this Guild and there are but twelve in the country. She was asked by the University of Tennessee to be one of a very limited few to attend its two-week weaving short course this winter and was also honored in being asked to teach in the Guild Workshop at the Penland, N.C. School of Crafts last fall. We must not fail to mention the attractive little shop maintained by Arrow Craft in one corner of the Mountain View Hotel, now presided over by Mrs. McCutchean, mother and grandmother . of Pi Beta Phis. Her love of our products, combined with a wide acquaintance among the hotel guests, makes her a worthy proponent of sales. No hour is too early nor too late to accommodate the departing guest in her purchase of last minute carry-home gifts. This year our Grand Vice President offered a prize to the Pi Phi submitting a poster suitable for advertising sales of Arrow Craft products. The Committee appreciated Mrs. Wild's offer and regretted that none of the designs submitted seemed exactly to meet the needs at this time, according to the judges from the University of Tennessee Crafts faculty who considered them. One special item of interest ere we leave the Arrow Craft department: The Director of Cultural Affairs for the State Department in Washington D.C. has contacted Pi Beta Phi often in the last few years since foreign visitors and students wish to take back the profitable use of native materials to their own countries. The State Department has honored Pi Beta Phi in sending, when possible, both men and women from foreign countries to visit the Settlement School. The most recent occasion was the Prime-Minister and his wife, the Begum Ali-Kahn of Pakistan. She spoke fluent English and held two degrees from the University of her native land. The Begum was most anxious to learn of our industries in order to further assist the women of her country in the establishment of their Cottage Industries. It would seem, therefore, that our service to people has gone afar and we are honored that the State Department so highly classifies our Settlement School. Earlier in this report we mentioned the surveys which had been made of our project in Gatlinburg as they applied to the educational program. These surveys placed great emphasis on the opportunity Pi Beta Phi had in the Southern Highlands for the furthering of the native crafts and since that time an effort has been made to that end. This summer is the sixth for our Summer Workshop. It has passed its "trial and error" period and in the opinion of the present staff, the 1950 organization is running more smoothly than any year. It has been a matter of mutual satisfaction to the University of Tennessee and to Pi Beta Phi to work together for the success of this annual six week project. Miss Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design at the University, again serves as Director but the whole staff of the Applied Arts Department unites in lending its own or helping to find the best possible instruction. We are eternally grateful to Miss Jessie W. Harris, Pi Beta Phi Convention initiate in 1938, head of the Home Economics Department at the University, for her constant inspiration, wise help in planning, and her expert belief in the Settlement School program. For the first three weeks of the six weeks' Workshop there are twenty-one states represented by fifty-four students. Thirty-one are graduatestudents, seven are undergraduates and sixteen are enrolled as non-credit pupils. Twenty-nine of these will remain for the full six-week period. Until such time as larger housing facilities are available, further expansion is impossible. Miss Dyer and her corps of workers completely transform our grade school building into a dormitory. It is an herculean task with less than two weeks between the closing of school and the opening of the Workshop. Every vacant cranny is made available to those in attendance. The Gateway Players, a stock company of New York, will again transform our gymnasium-auditorium into a theater for six weeks, paying rent to us and providing excellent casts in good plays as entertainment for summer visitors. Pi Beta Phi reserves Friday night for the P.T.A. for a money-making plan. The P.T.A. has done a magnificent piece of work in raising money for its school cafeteria where all the school year, two paid cooks, the assisting mothers in turn, with the aid of government surpluses provide hot, well-balanced school lunches. It provided new basket-ball uniforms for the girls' team and in various other ways has assisted the school program. The Craftsman's Fair will make its third appearance on the Pi Beta Phi campus in late July and again Governor Browning will officiate at the opening. Here will be demonstrated the makings of many handicrafts of that area and the native folk dances. Also there will be a great exhibit and sale of the best under each classification. Pi Beta Phi through its membership in the Southern Highlands Handicrafts Guild shares the responsibility in staging this under-taking. One's pride increases, knowing the part the fraternity has played in the renaissance of these native crafts. At this Convention we hope to bring a widened vision of what the Crafts are in the Southern Appalachians and what the preservation of this early Americana means to that area. Last but by no means least in the year round picture is the regular staff which keeps the Committee policies in operation. Miss Ruth Dyer in her six years as Director has found no consistent pattern for each day brings new activities and new problems. There have been seven dormitory students this year, five of whom have just graduated, so we shall have room for new material in September. Each boy or girl enters the dormitory only after a clear under-standing with the parents that their boy or girl is to work a certain number of hours in part payment for room and board. This, together with our financial assistance in running a bus to distant Elkmont for students, is important Extension service. A number of years ago the auditors for the Settlement School advised, as for any good business, that certain amounts be set aside each year for depreciation. Since then all committees have budgeted toward a Sinking Fund to cover this. The present committee at its recent meeting came to an important decision after studying the contents of this Sinking Fund, taking into account the $17,000, final generous bequest from the Garshwiler estate, and the prospects in contributions and continued Arrow Craft sales, that now is the time to erect a new Staff House. Several reasons controlled the decision to proceed. 'Part of our staff has been domiciled in Pollard Hall which was originally the old Ogle family farmhouse. It also houses the dormitory boys and the dining rooms and kitchen for all. If Pollard is much longer used, extensive repairs will be necessary, for termites and old age take their toll; should more boys come to school and need housing, space must be found. If the Summer Workshop is ever to expand, additional hous72 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW ing must be provided. That is the big bottle-neck to progress since all applicants prefer to live right at the School. Last year the University of Tennessee could have secured us government barracks for transportation costs but the Committee considered this poor economy as it would have been only a temporary arrangement. In addition, the problem of feeding the staffs and students of the Workshop is most difficult in our kitchen for it is not properly arranged for Institution Management. We also feel that more comfortable surroundings for our regular staff will mean greater efficiency and strengthened morale. So with courage and faith that the best interests of the School will be served, we plan to start a new building this coming year. It is our hope that alumne clubs and chapters will be interested in contributing direct to the cost of a room or its furnishings, thus to honor an outstanding member. We solicit your interest and aid, as always. The fraternity is grateful for the way in which contributions have come in. Three-fourths of the ac-. Live chapter contributions, going as they do into the Endowment Fund each year, help to spell security against unforeseen emergencies. The balance, together with all other contributions, governs the amount which the Committee can budget annually for the maintenance of the School. Top-most honors go to the St. Louis Alumnze Club with its one thousand dollar donation: it has maintained this record, or better, for a number of years; Philadelphia has sent $500 ; Cleve-land East and Kansas City, Mo., $300 each; Milwaukee, Wis., $225; Lafayette, Indiana, $203.51; Indianapolis and Denver, $200 each. The chapters leading in contributions were Missouri B ; Nebraska B; in third position, Ohio A and Texas A; while Florida B, Illinois B-L , Illinois 0, Colorado A, Kansas B, and Louisiana A tied for fourth place. Twenty nine clubs gave one hundred dollars or more. It was interesting to discover that twenty chapters and forty-three clubs increased the amount of their donations over 1948-49 and the contributions of fifty-four chapters and one hundred twenty-five clubs equalled those of last year. The chapters of Beta, Delta, Eta, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda provinces were one hundred percent as were the clubs of Alpha East, Beta, Delta, Zeta, Iota, Lambda, and Mu. Right here let us say that it is only ethical and right that money raised through a benefit in the name of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School should all go to that project. Thank you all! The gifts received from clubs, chapters and individuals brought both joy and comfort to the School. The many boxes of toys, books, fruit and candy at Christmas time made possible individual gifts to each child in our grade school and for those of the three out-lying rural schools as well; a special room gift of lovely book or game for each grade room; special athletic equipment; clothing for many of the needy. At the hospital layettes made so thoughtfully by some clubs had special use as do the additions to the loaning closet. This latter always has need for more cot-ton blankets, sheets, bed jackets or night-gowns, which our nurse is thankful to loan in case of sickness or emergencies. Sigma Phi Gamma, national business organization, through its Southern Mountain Workers division contributed $'50 this year toward eye and dental care, and three of their chapters became so interested they too sent their separate donations toward our health pro-gram. Many Pi Beta Phis and others, too, have found expression of a loving thought through our Memorial Fund. This was particularly true this year when out Grand Vice 'President and her husband suffered the tragic loss of their son Leonard. The Memorial Fund contributions are being used at the Health Center this year but the donor may specify a particular use, if she desires. A gift to this fund direct, or the gift of a particular book to the School Library are two lovely ways for an expression of sympathy. The final settlement of the estate left in part to the Settlement School by Dr. William P. Garshwiler in memory of his wife, an Indiana B, has been completed and we are indeed appreciative of this loving generosity. We are very pleased to have the amount of $8,943.41 which the Magazine Agency has sent us. Mrs. Alford says, "Pi Phis can't read !" but how we do like for them to keep on trying! We also have done many things with the returns from the Pi Phi best-seller, the Cook Book, first produced by the Los Angeles club some fifteen years ago. The Pi Phi girl graduating into a career or to become a summer bride continues to offer a fine field for their continued sales. One hears a remark now and then that we are finished in Gatlinburg. For the fraternity to be with-out the Settlement School would be like Arrow Craft existing without its trademark. Do we wish to abandon an undertaking dedicated long ago as a living memorial to our Founders, which has paid through honor to them but not alone to them? Every men's and women's fraternity gives us tremendous acclaim for our foresight in establishing a philanthropy dedicated to unselfish service. We pioneered in this now almost complete trend among National Panhellenic groups. The president of a large alumna club said on a recent visit to Gatlinburg that we should not talk of giving prestige to Gatlinburg because of having a school there but instead that every club and chapter receives tremendous publicity and prestige by virtue of the establishment and continued operation of the Settlement School. What would happen if we withdrew our Health program ? There would be only the local doctors, with days already crowded, to care for the school inspections, inoculations and to give advice to the mothers of young babies and the pre-schoolers or the parents of the school children. The advice given so frequently in the community, the tremendous program of disease prevention and sanitation, all these would go with the loss of the Health Center and our nurse. What would happen to the School if we withdrew, and to the Community which has depended upon Pi Beta Phi for so long? The school would not yet be accredited without our supplementary help in Music, Crafts, Woodworking and Physical Education. The community groups, P.T.A., election boards, churches, all make use of the school buildings as centers of ac tivity while Stuart Cottage and Helmick House are open on many occasions for teas or gathering places, for various town groups and school clubs. Old Timers' Day is still held upon our grounds and we wonder where some of the people who lean upon us would be, should we depart. An insurance man not long ago walked down the village street and as he passed first one hotel or another tourist court and then another remarked to his companion, "We own this one, we own that," on down the street. And still the local people, intrigued by what appear to be quick money-making schemes continue to build for the tourist trade. There will come a saturation point, one day, and we trust these businesses may be paid off ere that time. Get 'off Highway 71 and there are THE. SEPTEMBER ARROW 73 more tangible evidences of need for our help nor do the people hesitate to ask of Pi Beta Phi. We hope to help them bridge other adjustments if they come. An excerpt from a note received by Miss Onken from Miss Anne Guthrie, Pi Beta Phi, world lecturer and traveler, whose delightful program pleased so many at the last Convention, is worth quoting here. It was written this spring after a week's vacation stay in Gatlinburg. "What an interesting piece of work we have been responsible for! And to realize its effect on the community makes one very proud." Just one last whispered word on this subject! When one hears that we are finished in Gatlinburg, think again! In addition to believing that there are still things to be done there, bear in mind that Pi Beta Phi is a "Not for Profit" organization and that an educational puipose in Gatlinburg has merit. We should not lose our classification. Arrow Craft alone cannot be relied upon to sup-port the needs of the School because economic conditions are too uncertain and the demand for hand-woven articles, beautiful and inexpensive as they are, may not continue at the present high level. Time was when the contributions to the School were taking care of the development of Arrow Craft. The load of the chairman has been greatly lightened by the happy associations and complete cooperation of the Committee members this past year. Each has had her particular assignment and each has followed through with whole-hearted endeavor. At the beginning of the year, Grace Granger, Indiana A, of Indianapolis found it necessary to resign and her place was taken by Ethel Gillespie Smith, Indiana A, of Atlanta, Ga. At the time of the Chairman's fall visit to Gatlinburg, Mrs. Smith came to the Settlement School for a few days and also was able to at-tend the conferences on the 1950 Summer Workshop held at the University, excellent means of orientation for the year's work. Her assignment has been the County School and Library and this year she will have the Secretaryship added to her duties. You have known our Publicity member, Harriet Goodsell Rauch, through the fine -News of Little Pigeon" in the AR-ROW and here at Convention as the New York City Club delegate. Her responsibility is to give a true picture of the School to the readers of the ARROW and to lend all possible assistance to chapters and clubs with their publicity about the Settlement School. Only words of praise, well deserved, should be given the Treasurer of the Committee; Olivia Smith Moore, Missouri A, of Texarkana, Texas has clarified the budget making for the committee and has kept track of the rise or decline in funds receivable in meticulous fashion. This month we lose by tenure, Eugenia Brooks Smith, Indiana r, Salem, Oregon, who has handled the routing of the Settlement School film, kept an over-all eye on the Crafts, and this past year served as Secretary. Her latest contribution was the planning of the new film which you shall see here and which will be available for distribution in the fall. No assignment was ever too difficult and the Fraternity loses a valuable person from the Committee. We welcome Nellis Hempel Gibson, Pennsylvania A, of Baltimore, Maryland, who will take over the responsibility of the film and the supervision of the department of Arts and Crafts, The Settlement School Committee is deeply grateful for the assistance of Grand Council, especially Amy B. Onken who was chosen the contact member from the Council, and for all the diligent efforts of the alumnm clubs and chapters whose benefits and Arrow Craft sales made possible a practical working budget and future planning in Gatlinburg. We feel richly rewarded by serving Pi Beta Phi through the Settlement School and humbly ask that all of you share this privilege with us. Respectfully submitted, RUTH BARRETT SMITH REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1950 ALkING, or writing to Pi Phis is one of the most Timportant phases of the job that I have for the Fraternity. As Director of the Settlement School project it is my privilege to review with you, in this report, the main events of the past year. Life in the Smokies is a busy one as the various seasons follow each other. The pattern of our days is more or less a repeat design with ever changing variations, due to new personalities and interests. Community In this rapidly growing area, each year brings changes and improvements. Some of the most far reaching ones of the past year are the completion of a city water system, the installation of traffic lights at two busy intersections and the work done on two roads leading into the village. A second power line is being constructed which should provide the town with adequate electric service when it is completed. Building went on all winter so that spring found many new tourist courts and motels ready for business. A new picture theater was opened in May. The Methodist Church was completed and work started on a small Episcopal Church. The Riverside Hotel was enlarged and on the Greystone Hotel grounds a special building, called the Gatlinburg Playhouse, was constructed. This has filled a long felt need by providing a placefor lectures, Convention gatherings and Community affairs. Of most interest to Pi Phis, is the new grade school building that Sevier County is constructing on the plot of ground deeded to them by the Fraternity. This will have six class rooms, two toilet rooms, a small storage room, and a boiler room with a heating plant sufficiently large to take care of this building and future units as they can be built. The Contract was for $79,000.00 and it is hoped to have the building ready for use this coming fall. Each year the village Library Board sponsors a community party in February, to raise funds for the library which is entirely dependent upon donations for its operation. This event netted $615.00. The books have been moved from a room above the bus station to a small cottage on the River Road. The Garden Club has undertaken the landscaping of the grounds around the building and the Girl Scouts are mowing the lawn. Community Union church services were held at Thanksgiving time in the Baptist church and an Easter sunrise service was held on the Greystone lawn. The Garden Club again sponsored the Community Christmas tree, a pine that grows in our little park across from the Arrow Craft Shop. Other annual events of the holiday season were the beautiful candle 74 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW lighting service held in the Methodist Church on Christmas Eve and a party for all of the community children given by the American Legion Auxiliary. An awakened interest in the welfare of our young people has been evidenced. Scouting for both boys and girls has been actively revived under adequate leadership. Thirteen boys attended the International Jamboree at Valley Forge under the leadership of Mr. William Cron, Head of the Bureau of Roads. The churches sponsored an Easter egg hunt on the Whittle lawn that was enjoyed by many small children. Ever increasing numbers of tourists, coming to the Smokies, have caused the town to maintain a Tourist Bureau and to reorganize the Chamber of Commerce with a full time secretary in charge. During the win-ter a caravan of cars from Gatlinburg toured Florida advertising the tourist attractions and handicrafts of the region. Last summer for six weeks the Fraternity again rented the High School Auditorium to the Gate-way Stock Company of New York City. They presented a number of Broadway plays in a very credit-able manner. The second Craftsman's Fair, held on our green, was a great success. Pi Beta Phi and the village lost a valuable friend in the death of Mr. Andy Huff, owner of the Mountain View Hotel. O i ce When Esther Mines married last July, we were fortunate in having another Pi Phi, Nancy Holmes, Illinois Zeta, Class of 1949, join the staff as Assistant Director. She has been a great help, especially in taking care of the Workshop correspondence and reports. In addition to her work at the school she has served as the Chairman of the Advisory Board for Tennessee Gamma. School A backward look over the past school year brings a feeling of satisfaction. Sevier County, Pi Beta Phi and the P.T.A. combined to provide a well rounded program for over five hundred children attending the school. Nineteen full time and one part time teacher carried on the educational program. In high school we had four new teachers. These were, Mr. Walter Ogle, Principal ; Mr. Granville Shields, Science ; Dorothy Arnold who had attended our Summer Workshop, Home Economics, and Mr. W. J. Miracle who was hired by the Fraternity to supervise the work in Physical Education. In the Elementary School we had no changes in the teaching staff. It was necessary to have two rooms in which there were two grades each. One was a first and second combination and the other a third and fourth grouping. The faculty worked together very harmoniously. In October the school family, the faculty and their families enjoyed a picnic in the mountains. In January we had a faculty party in the nature of an old fashioned "pounding" for the coach and his bride at Stuart Cottage. The usual plays were given. The Juniors presented a melodrama, "Only an Orphan Girl," the Senior play was "Brother Goose" and the eighth grade finished their year by giving "Billie's Aunt Jane." The annual Halloween Carnival was enjoyed by the entire school as was the lovely Christmas program. Room parties were held in the different grade school rooms to observe special days. Films were used more frequently than in the past years, as a part of the School pro-gram. Twenty-one members of the Senior Class with faculty chaperones went to Washington, D.C. for their trip. This class sponsored a small school annual called "The Mountaineer," which was dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Johnson, former Pi Phi employees of the staff. The parting gift from the class to the school was two typewriters which they hope will form the nucleus of a Commercial Department for the school. Nancy Holmes, Assistant Director, was sponsor for the Beta Club. She accompanied several of the club members to the state convention in Nashville. The American Legion Auxiliary entertained the high school basketball teams at a very lovely formal banquet at the New Gatlinburg Inn. The same hotel was the setting for th'e annual Junior Senior banquet. After the Christmas holidays, the County operated a second bus for Gatlinburg. This helped very much in shortening the day for numbers of bus riding pupils. Pi Phi Contributions A backward look brings out the many extras enjoyed by the children attending our school which they could not have were it not for Fraternity help. Mrs. Althea Armstrong for Music, Mr. Miracle for Physical Education, Miss Van Roekel and Mr. Huskey for Arts and Crafts and Wood-work, added much to the program. Several years of training in part singing is showing up when public appearances of the students are made. The carols, making up most of the Christmas program, the Stephen Foster songs and Glee Club numbers given at Community and Commencement events were all very well done. The annual Operetta, "The Snow Queen," was one of the most tuneful and colorful that I have seen. The Arts and Crafts teacher, Fay Van Roekel, contributed much to the program. The beautiful back drops, done mostly on her knees, on strips of brown paper, for the Junior play were used again at the Christmas program and for the Operetta. Her fifth grade class designed and made puppets and wrote the script for an original show, as one of their art projects. The seventh grade made murals for the background of the Stephen Foster pro-gram. Fay gave a talk on Art at a County Teachers meeting and another one to a Y.W.C.A. Youth group at Alcoa. She served as a Graduate Assistant at the Summer Workshop and in August studied weaving at the Guild Workshop at Penland. Her high school girls produced some very nice weaving in their class work. Mr. Carl Huskey directed the boys in the wood shop. Some very creditable pieces of furniture were turned out by the class. While our boys and girls did not do as well as usual in basketball competitions with outside schools, our coach started a very valuable program of intramural sports within the high school classes that provided entertainment and interest most of the year. These contests were played off during the noon hour and in bad weather were most useful in helping provide an outlet for energies that are sometimes hard to control. The sports which were used in this program were basketball, softball, volleyball, pingpong, and ,shuffle board. In the spring a baseball team was organized for the first time. The American Legion allowed the use of their athletic field and they also loaned uniforms for the players. On a beautiful spring day, the whole school held a Field Day which resulted in a victory for the Freshman Class. P. T. A. We were fortunate in having a very active and enthusiastic group of parents who also provided "extras" for the school program. Money for this work comes chiefly from the weekly Bingo games operated during the tourist season in the high school gymnasium and from rummage sales. The school lunch room was again operated by this group, providing hot lunches THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 75 for the children in the Elementary school. Free lunches are provided for needy children. We share in the Government program and receive many supplies from that source. In the fall a book store was set up for the first week of school. This was a great convenience since there is not a store in town that handles school supplies or books. From their funds, the organization voted to give each teacher a sum of $50.00 to be used for supplies. In the high school the teachers pooled their money in order to undertake larger projects. One of these was the sanding and refinishing of the gymnasium floor. An additional gift of one hundred dollars was given for new basketball uniforms, one half to the high school and the other half to the grade school teams, ably coached by Mr. Kelly Huskey, the eighth grade teacher. A class in Parliamentary Law, an old-fashioned Spelling Bee and the sponsoring of a delightful concert by a high school chorus from Knoxville, were other activities of this group. Dormitory Miss Lena Hodgen, our efficient housekeeper, was again in charge of our living arrangements. We had the usual household emergencies to meet but were always provided with good meals. Nancy Holmes was in charge of the six high school girls who lived in Stuart College. Five of them graduated, having been with us most of their school days. In their honor we entertained the senior class and high school faculty following Class Night program. The piano at Stuart was used two days a week when a music teacher from, Pigeon Forge gave private lessons to a number of school children. It was necessary to replace some curtains this year. Now ruffled ones were placed in Nancy's suite and at Teachers Cottage we have some beautiful new -hand woven draperies in the living room and hall. Tina designed them and Lura wove them at the Shop at times when she was not busy with her regular work. It is interesting to note that she has been with the School long enough to weave three sets of draperies for these same rooms. The second set, taken from Teachers Cottage, are in use at Pollard where shiny yellow paint now makes a more cheerful interior. Three sturdy new card tables were purchased and have been in almost constant use at three houses. Health Center The health work done by the Fraternity, under the able direction of our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, is indeed a "repeat Design." Year after year, the inspections, inoculations, health talks with accompanying films, classes in First Aid and home visits for the almost 700 children in the district we serve, add up to an astounding total. Emergencies from school and community, clinics for well babies and expectant mothers, fill many busy days. Our Health Center was used several times for Clinics during the year. Twice the Mobile T.B. Unit was in town and used the building as headquarters. The first day 718 chest x-rays were given and the second time 497. A new law in Tennessee states that every child must be examined by a doctor before he can enter school and that a record of this examination must become a part of his school record. Two such clinics were held in December when 65 children were examined. Children from the rural area were brought to the Health Center. Twenty mothers came with the rural children. The State Department supplies serums but aside from that most of the health work done in town and in three rural schools is taken care of by Pi Beta Phi. That people of the area still look to us for aid was evidenced last winter. A little girl who had never had preventive vaccinations died suddenly of diphtheria. The next day people brought children from town and country to the health center. By night the weary nurse had given 154 preventive shots. Farm Two new laying houses for our Pi Phi hens were built this year to replace some unfit for use. We followed plans furnished by the Poultry Division of the University of Tennessee and are proud of the results. These modern houses will make it possible to have a larger poultry flock to supply the kitchen with eggs and chickens. Any surplus can be very advantageously sold to the Mountain View Hotel. Through the year, several litters of small pigs were raised and sold when they were old enough to make it worth while. The garden produced vegetables for our school family and supplied the University staff during the Workshop. Arrow Craft Shop The year has gone smoothly, following the usual pattern ; busy days for Mrs. Snow-filling and ship-ping Club orders-months like April and October when, as always, the "buying tourists" visit the shop and other days when the tables in the stock room are piled high with weaving, waiting to be tagged and put on the shelves. An effort has been made to reduce inventories, use up old stocks of threads and to concentrate on patterns that can make use of these materials. However, there will be some new accents in the next price list. We have added yellow and green, in pastel shades, to the baby woolen articles we have always carried. To fill a demand for a heavy textured mat, Mrs. McMorran has designed two sets. The less expensive one is in cotton and is called the Periwinkle, the other one is a very handsome linen set made in a diamond weave on double goose eye threading. Neckties and scarfs in bright stripes are other new items. Our designer, Mrs. McMorran, has been active in weaving circles in the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild. She instructed in weaving at the Guild Workshop, held in Penland, North Carolina, last fall and at the Spring Meeting of the Guild was granted a Master Craftsman's Certificate in Weaving. Upon invitation of the officials an exhibit of Arrow Craft products was placed in the side window of the Hamilton National Bank in Knoxville for a week. A new hand made cabinet for displaying jewelry is a useful as well as ornamental addition to the shop. The Hotel Shop has been operated by Mrs. Mc-Cutchean. Mrs. Snow reports that business has been good and that accounts receivable are better than ever before. Each year brings more craft shops to the village but we feel that the quality of our products, sold in their artistic setting, makes Arrow Craft Shop the best one of all. This report would be incomplete without the mention of the many wonderful gifts that individual Pi Phis, Active Chapters, Alumnm Clubs and friends make towards the success of our program. Two gifts of money, one spent for records and the other for library books, were given in memory of Leonard Wild. The staff enjoyed a new waffle iron which I purchased with gift funds. A surprise gift came from the Franklin Square Magazine Agency. The check sent for magazine subscriptions for the high school library was returned with a letter saying that the Fraternity business was so much that they wished to give us the magazines as an expression of their appreciation. The 76 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nurse is always delighted with the boxes of clothing that come to us and especially so with the layettes and baby things. The many boxes of toys and other Christmas gifts help to make Christmas memorable for many children. This year we remembered the 148 children in three rural schools with gifts in addition to 157 gifts to pupils in the three lower grades. Where there is greater need we try to place the really nice toys and clothing. Sigma Phi Gamma, International Sorority, continues to support our health program with gifts of money from their central office and boxes from individual chapters, to whom we are assigned by their welfare secretary. Their gifts are used for eye correc tions and new glasses in most cases. It has been impossible to give you a complete picture of our days at the School. The six weeks Work-shop in Crafts, The Craftsman's Fair and the appearances of the Gateway Stock Company in our Auditorium, make the summers most busy and interesting. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to our fine Settlement School Committee, the loyal local staff and employees and the thousands of Pi Phis over the country who yearly remember the school with kind and loving thoughts as well as concrete gifts.

The increase in the number of active chapters and alum= clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund this year is evidence of the pride Pi Phis have in Holt House. From these contributions minor repairs have been made, and necessary new furnishings have been purchased. We purchased a new refrigerator and two electrical units for the stove and are in the process of having the parlor curtains duplicated, as the old ones were beyond repair. As soon as the material can be matched we hope to have the occasional chairs in the Pine Room recovered. Many necessary repairs have been made; such as painting of the shutters, storm windows, screens, and gutters. The foundation has been re-pointed both inside and out and the floors and basement walls have been repaired and painted. The inside of the house has been painted. Climbing roses have been planted at the base of the trellises which were given to Holt House last year by Paul B. Wallace, in honor of his mother, one of our Founders, Nancy 'Black Wallace. Mr. Wallace, in writing of his mother's college life has mentioned her speaking of the beauty of the entrance to the Holt home with its trellises and climbing roses. This he restored in her memory. The kitchen, the hostess' bathroom, the lavatory off the powder room, and the porch floors have been painted and minor repairs were made to the roof. The number of alumnae clubs contributing to the Holt House Fund increased from 179 last year to 217 this year. The highest contributing clubs were Iowa City, Iowa $50, Kansas City, Missouri, $50, ' and Everett, Washington, $30. Many other clubs sent generous checks. The active chapters increased their contributions, with 87 chapters contributing as compared with 83 for last year. The highest contributing chapters were Louisiana A $100, Illinois A $50, and Oklahoma A $35. The following chapters each gave $25: Missouri B, Iowa r, Kansas B, and Texas A. The highest contributing provinces (alumnm) were: Mu, Lambda, and Kappa. Every club in the following provinces contributed; Mu, Lambda, Theta, and Iota. The highest contributing provinces (active) were: Kappa, Eta and 'Iota. Every chapter in the following provinces contributed: Kappa, Eta, Iota, Delta, Beta and Lambda. Besides active chapters and alumnae clubs in and near Monmouth using the house this past year, the following organizations have held meetings or parties there: Woman's Club, D.A.R., P.E.O., Women's Missionary Group, 'Book Club, Home Bureau, and the Alumna Sewing Circle. Several showers, luncheons, weddings, and receptions have been accommodated. Mrs. Carey, known far and wide in Monmouth for her gracious hospitality, continues to, manage the house very efficiently. The chairman is grateful to Mrs. John Trost our most able treasurer, and to the other committee mem COMMITTEE bers: particularly Mrs. R. M. Jensen, Monmouth, who has scheduled the film and done innumerable other things to facilitate the work of this committee. The chairman gratefully acknowledges the encouragement and guidance given by Miss Onken during the past year. She is grateful also for the many duties performed for the committee by the Director of Central Office, Gladys Hayes Scivally, and by each member of Grand Council. The assistance and cooperation of the province officers has greatly facilitated the work of the committee and of the chairman. Again, this chairman and committee is grateful to Gladys Stump Nall, the preceding chairman, for her advice and help during the past year. We are drawing to the close of a successful year for Holt House, and already planning for an even more successful year in 1950-1951.
