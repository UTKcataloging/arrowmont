        332 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHl come of our seven years' struggle was to mean to us. We knew that the friendship of every Pi Beta Phi was pledged to us and we, as Missouri r chapter, who have so gladly entered the ranks and taken upon ourselves that same pledge, stand ready to uphold Pi Beta Phi standards as our own. Missouri r wishes to thank her sister chapters for their messages of greeting as they enter the land of their hearts' desire. LILIAN BOYD. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON KATE B. MILLER T. HE Settlement School is just completing its second school year of eight months, with four teachers. Four years ago the school existed only in the devoted imagination of Miss Turner and a few other Pi Beta Phis. For two years they worked to secure funds. In the winter of 1912, they felt justified in sending in to Gatlinburg, on the Little Pigeon in Tennessee, the first teacher, Miss Hill. They and she opened the way into the land and into the hearts of the pec;ple. When the Chicago Alumnae Club, in June 1912, became the successors of these devoted pioneers, and placed the work in charge of the present committee, the committee felt especially keenly the honor and the responsibility of putting into concrete form the hopes of the founders of the school in particular and of the fraternity in general. It is not the purpose of this article to set forth an historical or a financial statement. But I should like the fraternity to look back over these two years and to realize what its support has enabled this committee to do in order to realize the value of the work done and also to realize how much more there is to be crone. In the autumn of 1912 the first school was held in the abandoned Methodist Church. Miss Hill taught there for four months with the one native teacher, the latter paid from the public school funds. Miss Dell Gillette, Illinois Z, '08, (now Mrs. Theron B. Morgan) of Traverse City, Michigan, went down in November, and was ready to begin the winter term with Miss Hill in the new public school building on the hill above the old church. The school now was solely under 11 B c control and support. Miss Hill and Miss Gil NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 333 lette were both paid small salaries, and lived in the II B cl) cottage, which was rented and maintained by the fraternity. The Christmas season that year was celebrated as it had never been before. Miss Gillette told the Christ Child stories to many who heard them for the first time. The Stars and stripes were that winter flying in Gatlinburg, for the first time within the memory of the oldest in-habitant. The school for the first year closed on the last of March. For the first time in the history of the community, the children had gone to school for eight months in one year. When Miss Hill and THE OLD SCHOOL HOUSE Miss Gillette left, the II (I) household goods stored in the cottage were the only visible possessions of the fraternity on Little Pigeon. The love and the confidence of the mountaineers, however, were the real possessions which were prized, and which represented the labor and love of all who had in any way contributed towards the school. This year has seen not only the deepening of the love and confidence, the invisible possessions, but it has also seen the increase of our visible ones. The story of the land has been too recently told in these pages to be repeated here in detail. In August last the fraternity acquired title to thirty-five acres of farming and mountain 334 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI timber land, on which were situated the II 4) cottage, a few old barnyard buildings, an old store, and an older school building. As soon as we had possession of the land, we began negotiations for the erection of the badly needed school house, for the public school house on the hill had been given over to a native teacher, local politics having been played to that end. The plans made by Mr. von Hoist were modified by Mr. Waters, a Knoxville architect to suit the climate, the site, and the treasury of the committee. The correspondence concerning the necessary changes in the plans, concerning bids, and concerning the innumerable other matters incident to building, dragged along with provoking slowness. Finally Mrs. Helmick went down in November to close up a contract. She stayed three weeks, and returned in December, having signed a contract with a Sevierville builder for $3,500. This building is now in process of construction. The lumber is being furnished by Mr. Andrew J. Huff, and the work is being done mainly by the men of the locality under the direct supervision of the contractor. The whole community is therefore doubly interested in the progress of the building: it is interested in the school to be held in it, and the men are glad of the employment given them during the usually idle winter months. The school work goes on with a success that makes the hearts of all those who are in close relation with it grow warm. Miss Pollard has organized and conducted the school in a way that seems marvelous to those who know the conditions under which she has worked. Mrs. Helmick says that the county superintendent praised her teaching and that of her assistants very highly. The children learn from their books in school and they learn much more from their teachers outside of school. There is discipline, there is interest, and there is education in the II B cD school. Think of this as you read what I quote from a letter from Miss Pollard a little later on. During the autumn term, Miss Pollard and Miss Bryan taught forty or more pupils in the old school house. Both inside and out, it was then in a dilapidated condition, such as the picture of it can only suggest. Just before the close of the term, Miss Bryan came North to attend the wedding of her brother and Ida Marie Wilson, (Indiana A and F) . She was taken very ill while in Franklin, Indiana, and was forced to go on to her home in Hamilton, New York. She re-turned to the school on February first. During her absence Miss NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 335 Pollard continued the work alone, except for the assistance Mrs. Helmick was able to give her, until the close of the term. In time for the opening of the winter term, two more Pi Beta Phis went down to Miss Pollard's assistance. Leah Louise Stock, Michigan A, '12, and Edith Wilson, Indiana A, '13, volunteered for three months' service. Miss Pollard writes that the cottage is a jolly, lively place with the three girls and her, and that "laughter reigns". Miss Pollard further writes : "In the little old building we now have sixty, with more coming. We sit at tables and at the old desks which have done duty for many years, and which are liable to fall over whenever any one gets up too quickly. Just picture the scene to yourself, and think how we shall 'appreciate the new building. Imagine twelve wriggling boys and girls, from eight to twelve years old, all sitting at one small table about the size .of an ordinary kitchen table. There is not a table that has less than eight at it, and if there were a chair for me to sit on, there is no place to put it. Miss Stock at her end of the room sits on the organ stool, and during the one period of the day when I can sit down, I use the edge of the platform or the back of a bench. I happen to teach the arithmetic classes, and so I occupy the front of the room where the blackboard is. We have about thirty 'feet of blackboard' space, and with thirty in one class, it is sometimes rather crowded. 'But the children do not mind it, and so far as I can see, are learning their multiplication tables almost as rapidly as though they had all the room in the world to scribble on. "Perhaps it seems to you that it would be confusing to have two teachers using the same room. But you would get used to it if you were here. Perhaps we shall be lonely when we get to a room alone. As it is, there is little confusion. Miss Stock takes her classes to the back of the room, and they recite quietly; I take mine to the front, and they attend to their own affairs without a thought to the class behind them. Miss Wilson has the small children through the second grade, in the old store building, which Mr. Ogle vacated the first of December. During the Christmas holidays the old school house was thoroughly repaired and made tight and warm, and the old store was thoroughly cleaned and windows put in. In that building we have an enrollment of about thirty, making a total enrollment of one hundred. Among the pupils are several working to pass the examination for teachers. GATLIN13URG, LOOKING SOUTHEAST NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 337 "We are busy, of course. , That is what we are here for. We are organizing Corn Clubs among the boys and Tomato Clubs among the girls. Miss Wilson is teaching the girls cooking one afternoon a week, and Miss Stock is teaching them sewing, while I am giving instruction in agriculture to the 'older boys. Miss Bryan has charge of the manual work among the little folks. We have classes in writing and music every day, and find the pupils really interested in them. "We certainly need larger quarters and better facilities, but the work this year has not been in vain, for it has borne fruit in new ideals and enlarged horizons for nearly all the pupils. Several are reading the books that have been sent, and all who have contributed to our supply of literature may rest assured that ,the children are making good use of it. "The Christmas tree was a wonderful success. It was loaded, so much loaded that I was ashamed to put on all the things sent. The children enjoyed the whole, the toys, the games, the dolls, the knives, and the eatables, and took. their parts in the Christmas exercises well. We thank all who sent and contributed to the Christmas joy." Miss Pollard does not here mention the especially interesting and pleasant feature of this year's Christmas season, the .children's singing of Christmas carols from house to house early Christmas morning. It seems very appropriate that these descendants of Englishmen should revert to an old time English custom, and usher in the holy Christmas day with carols. I cannot close this article without making a direct appeal to all readers of THE ARROW for funds to enable the committee to make this work of the greatest possible help to these our "contemporary ancestors", as the President of Berea College has called the southern mountaineers. There are many, very many Pi Beta Phis who are giving in small sums. Their interest and their contributions are sincerely valued, and they enable the committee to make the budget for the actual running expenses. But they especially need now larger sums from alum.nx who can give from $100 to $10,000. Will not someone put the Settlement School in her will as a beneficiary? Will not someone make a thank-offering? Will not some-one make a memorial gift?
