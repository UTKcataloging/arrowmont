        71 U THE ARROTT.'' OF Fl BETA PHI active and alumnre members. At our cooky-shine held at the chapter house in January, Mrs. C. F. Curtiss, one of our alumnce, gave a very interesting talk on the School. and read to us parts of a letter which she had received from there, telling of the very happy Christmas they had ha.d and of the great improvement in the place and of the wonderful way in which it is expanding. Last fall and winter. we made up' a, box of clothing to send to members of the School. In our (.chapter we have a system of reporting activities for the past week at each. fraternity meeting. A record is kept of these and the penalty for not performing the activities is twenty-five cents each. This money we are collecting and at the end of the year will send it to the Settlement School. This course of procedure was decided upon early. in the fall and all the money since that time has been kept for that. purpose. Also nil money collected for non-attendance at fraternity meetings, except of course in the case of an excuse, is used for the same end. At Christmas time, we always endeavor to buy as many baskets from our alumniv as we possibly can and strive tO create a sale for them. It is our fervent wish and desire that, any institution which is answering so noble a cause as the Settlement School will meet with every success possible, and Iowa IT will cooperate with and do every-thing for it that we possibly can. CLARA JORDAN, Iowa A WAFFLE BREAKFAST HELPS For several years it has been customary for the girls of Nevada A to hold a waffle breakfast in the basement of the girls' dormitory, Manzanita Hall. Posters are put up on the campus and in each fraternity house to advertise it and often breakfast is not served at the houses at all. The proceeds go to the Settlement School, but we usually clear only about fifteen dollars. It has always been our aim to increase the amount; this year we did. Our most talented members put on several musical numbers at a local motion-picture theater. By doing this we received a per cent of that evening's proceeds, which amounted to a little more than fifty dollars. Twenty dollars of this money we sent to the Fellowship Fund and thirty was added to our Settlement School Fund. ...YE PUS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 711 We also encourage all of our members to order their magazines through Miss Reisinger and try to get outside subscriptions. MARjORIE TA UFF ER, Nevada A. NEWS FRGAI LITTLE PIGEON BY SARAH POMEROY RU(4.11, Massachusetts A GATLINBURG, 1922 BY ANNA W. DOWEL hq.,:,d B "Beautiful for situation" is the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School on the Little Pigeon River. After riding in a Ford from Sevierville over seven miles of well-worn pike and eight miles of well-worn mountain road, up and down, in and out and all round about every side of the steep cliffs that overhang the raging river hundreds of PART OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL STAFF, 1922 feet below, thinking many times that "Henry" might not turn in time to keep from going over, you experience great relief when you round the last big cliff and get the full view of the School property. It is a, great surprise to see everything in such fine condition ; the buildings set back on the hillside with a. background of evergreens 712 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and the mountains covered with the most gorgeous foliage imaginable. It is a wonderful picture and we can not help being glad to have had a part in building this School in the mountains of Eastern Tennessee. The mountaineers of this section are descendents of the very early settlers, many living on the same small farms and in the same way as was common more than a century ago. They farm with the most primitive implements, and one who is used to the broad prairies of the middle west cannot see how they could use anything else on the steep hillsides. The houses are mostly built of logs or very rough boards and the furniture is of the simplest; there are no conveniences of any kind and the sanitary conditions well there are none. The food consists of corn bread, soda biscuit, buttermilk, fried eggs 'and potatoes, supplemented by mustard greens and in the summer, cabbage, tomatoes and wild fruit. A few have small apple orchards but sell most of the apples for there is good sale for them. The people of the immediate community having been in touch with the teachers for the past ten years and the young people being in school have made rapid strides and will compare favorably with the young persons in any rural community in dress and manners. Many of the former pupils, after finishing at the Settlement School, have gone to other schools and are making successful teachers. The people like to have visitors and are very cordial always inviting you to stay for a meal or over night. They may not always mean it but the invitation is given just the same. Those living "back up over the hollers" have few visitors and they never fail to insist that you stay over with them and you really feel that they do want you. Pi Beta Phi has completed the tenth year of "keepin' school" on the Little Pigeon. From a very few pupils in an old, one-room building and much o:pposition ten years ago we have this year 126 pupils enrolled, a splendid school building with five rooms and a large square entrance hall and no opposition. When you come to study these people and find them so slow to take up with anything new and slower still to do things in a different way from the way they have always been used to and which their parents have taught them, you will really see that we have done a wonderful work. One of the most noticeable things accomplished is that this year most of the children have been very regular in attendance and have stayed in school until the close, while in other years they have come when they felt like it and stayed at home when they felt like it as NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 713 the parents were not interested enough to make them come, This condition was very trying for the teachers as these pupils could not keep up with their classes and the work was very unsatisfactory. Neither did the teachers have any spare time to devote to those who were behind. Tennessee has a compulsory school law and that helped very much as long as, the free school lasted and perhaps they acquired the habit of going, for the last three months of pay school the attendance has been unusually good, especially in the higher grades and the high school. The children, even the younger ones, are frequently kept at home to grub briars and to help put in the crop. 1:n fact, it seems some-times as if the children had the burden of the work on their shoulders while the fathers visited the small stores to learn what was "goin' on," depending upon the women and children to get in the crop. The children who are kept out do not finish the year's work and have to remain in the same class, another year which is very discouraging after two or three years. Since the first of the year we have been serving lunch for the children in the first three grades. We serve one hot dish and give them milk to drink and every child has gained in weight and is doing better work in school. Many of the children are under-nourished on account of their limited diet and bring very little lunch to school and many bring none at all. The mothers never prepare anything for them to bring, so if there is a piece of corn bread or a biscuit left from breakfast it is wrapped up in a newspaper, always a newspaper, and brought for lunch. A few will bring a meat sandwich and two little girls brought boiled eggs one day. The children do not take readily to anything new so we have to be careful what we prepare for lunch although we do give them something new once in a while and they will soon learn to eat new things. just before Christmas vacation, the pupils .gave The Birds' Christmas Carol, the first thing of the kind ever attempted. All parts were taken, but the "Ruggles family," made the hit of the evening. This spring they gave the operetta Boy Blue, and it proved as great a success. This training has given confidence to the pupils in their ability to do things and has been a very helpful part of the year's work. Agricultural work is much needed in the community. There is no stock raising nor rotation of crops. Corn is king in Eastern 714 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Tennessee. There is practically no hay: clover, wheat or oats raised in the mountains. This past winter we have paid $1.00 a bushel for corn and from $20.00 to $46.00 a ton for hay to feed bur horses and cows. We have been trying to buy some pigs since the first of the year but have not succeeded in getting any so far. "Thar seems to be no sick animals" at least for sale and no one ever has more than two or three. We hope to remedy this condition and have a better grade of both cattle and hogs. One reason the people do not raise more than they need is because they are fifteen miles from any market and over a road that is so bad most of the time that teamsters cannot haul more than half a load so it is not worth while to raise much of a crop. Our School has been invited to take part in the Field Meet in Sevierville, April 7. Mr. Stuart and Miss Chew, our high school teachers, are staying over and will take the students down who are to take part. The boys have been busy practicing their athletic events for the past three weeks, and these events will take place in the morning. The afternoon is to be devoted to declamatory and oratorical con-tests. One of our freshman girls is entered in the latter. In the evening each school taking part is expected to put on a "stunt," Miss Chew will take the entire "Ruggles family" and they will give the second act of The Birds' Christmas Carol. Whether we win any, prize, it will be a great experience for the pupils and will give them a chance to see what other schools are doing and I feel sure our work here will compare very favorably with that of any other school. JENNIE NICOL Jennie Nicol, M.D., one of our Founders, was a pioneer in the field of medicine as a profession for women, and it is most fitting that our health centre at Gatlinburg should bear the name of this splendid woman who was preparing herself to devote her life to humanity. While an active member of Illinois A, Jennie Nicol was a constant visitor at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Kilgore and spent innumerable profitable hours discussing medicine with the doctor. After graduating from Monmouth College in 1868, she attended the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania from which she received the degree of doctor of medicine. Upon completing a year NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 715 as interne in the New England Hospital, she went to Switzerland to take advanced work in the University of Zurich. In an article which appeared in THE ARROW for November, 1909, and in June, 1917, we find that Dr. Nicol intended "to return to Illinois to practice, but on March 28, 1881, after an illness of a few days she died of meningitis. Her body was brought back to America and lies among the friends of her youth in Cedar Creek churchyard, near Little Rock, Ill. Mrs. Kilgore writes of her: " JENNIE NICOL "I knew Rachel all my life. I have called her Rachel. That was the name by which she was known. I do not know when she took the name of Jennie but I think in college days. Her home was just two miles from my own. She was born in 1845 at Edgington, Ill., and brought up on a farm near Little York, Warren County, Ill. (Monmouth is the county seat.) She died March 28, 1881. "From her letters you can see how devoted she was to her profession. She loved it she loved work. She was very thorough in 716 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI district school and in college. She wanted to know no guess work. She despised a sham had little use for a poor student. No woman ever entered the profession with a nobler purpose. In that day you know it was not popular for a woman to enter professional life. She was determined to be the equal of her brothers in the profession. She used to say, `I think we should have women physicians and I have an ambition to show the men what a woman can do.' She came to Dr. Kilgore, borrowed some books, and told him her desire to enter the profession. He was helpful, encouraged her to commence the study, and then to go to Philadelphia which she did. When she went to Philadelphia, she and Dr. Kilgore wanted me to study medicine with her. And in after years when I went into doctor's office how I wished I had we had many a long talk about it. "To strangers she was cold, dignified, almost exacting, but that was not her real character. She was kind and loving and helpful to others and went about doing good. When my father died of cholera in 1873 she came to us when everybody considered our home a pest-house. When I was stricken with the disease and no one, but Dr. Kilgore thought I could live, she came and helped him. In fact she acted as my nurse for we could get no one. Where duty called her she was faithful even at the risk of her life. So you understand I write all this to show you she succeeded where weak women would have failed. She was strong and large physically, she was strong and large intellectually, she was strong and large spiritually. "She was a very earnest church worker, teaching in Sabbath School a class of young ladies and gentlemen. Her pastor thought her an excellent teacher. He laughingly said, `She makes them dig up Bible truth.' "She was not in town at our first I. C. meeting. She was very proud of her arrow and was a faithful member. I think it meant much to her she had no real sister. She wore her I. C. pin the night she started for Philadelphia. Laughingly she said, `I wonder if they will know in the East what I. C. means.' "Though she was disappointed in her realization of her life service for which she had prepared herself, yet she lives today in our hearts, an inspiration to efficient work unto us of this generation. Strength continually has gone forth from her." NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON ' 717 NURSE HIGINBOTHAM Helen Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario A, B.A. (Toronto), M.A. (Columbia), the only trained nurse in Sevier County, presides over the Jennie Nicol Memorial. She was a member of the class of 1912, University of Toronto, where she specialized in modern languages and obtained her A.B. with honors on graduation. During her course she was prominent in all college organizations, was on her class executive, was woman editor of Torontonensis,, the college yearbook, and was Head Girl of Queen's Hall, the women's residence.

Upon her graduation from Hopkins in 1918 she went immediately overseas with the American Army, and was at Brest and other points in France for a year. When she returned she received a Red Cross scholarship at Columbia University in New York, and was in the first class of its kind established. At the same time she obtained her M.A. from Columbia. After completing her settlement work in New York she went to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinbur where she is absorbed in her work. 718 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI THE JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL BY PHYLLIS HIGINBOTTIAM, Ontario A It seems scarcely more than a month since Sunday, January 1, when Marie, just arrived from Christmas vacation, went upstairs singing "Hail; hail, the gang's all here." Now Miss Evelyn is downstairs with a group of girls practising some of the choruses of Little Boy Blue for the close of school, the end of this week; and it will not be long before our household is again reduced in numbers. (A peep into school discipline!) Emily Burton, who teaches the three primary grades, has just come in at recess. She gave MEDICINE CABINET, DRESSING CARRIAGE, ETC. her third grade paints to work with, and two little girls painted bright red designs on their legs above their stockings. They are being kept in, but Emily's sense of humor comes to the fore when out of the classroom. Yesterday, just a minute or two before the noon recess bell rang, one of the boys in practising jumping for the Stunt day in Sevierville, fell and broke his "collar-bone." Mr. Stuart and the boys carried him over to the Jennie Nicol cottage, and he was put to bed till the doctor succeeded in getting here about dark. This boy is an orphan who is being kept in school, and is boarding with a family in the Burg. The doctor wants him to sleep over at the cottage for A CORNER IN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL SHOWING NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 719 a few nights in case his arm should need any adjusting, so the room at the back which has been arranged for an emergency operating room, or bedroom, is proving useful. It has a hospital bed, a long narrow table and several extra electric light sockets which were used the day after they were installed, when a Knoxville nose and throat specialist did several tonsil operations there. He used one socket for his head-light, one for general light, and the other for his suction apparatus. One of the windows is still without a screen where he removed it in order to get into the cottage about three A. M. to get JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPITAL Ground ploughed up for corn. Small tree in foreground planted by children in Miss Ditmar's room last fall. his instruments when he was called out to see. one of the patients of the previous afternoon. The bathroom is finally being used. The apparatus for heating the water was changed from a sort of blow-torch arrangement that terrified us all to a Holyoke coal-oil heater. The girls staying in the Little Girls' Cottage use it one afternoon a week, and several boys boarding around have it another day. When we first put in the heater for four successive afternoons, it seemed as though every day were a "Saturday bath night." One small boy "cried his eyes out" at the thought of having to go over there; he preferred the more familiar wash-tub, but when he saw the lock on the bathroom door, the stopper, taps, etc., he-was so, thrilled his mother could scarcely 720 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI get him out. At every attempt he would say, "I'm aimin' to soak." When the little girls were through, they got their mop and washed the floor. They said they thought they could do that much in re-turn. One of them invariably scours the sinks while waiting her turn. Opposite the bathroom are cupboards and drawers, already well stocked. Ames, Des Moines, Indianola, and Manhattan have furnished the supplies, sheets, pillow-cases, bath-towels, hand-towels, etc. When Dr. Christenbery, a Knoxville nose and throat specialist, held a clinic in the school-house more than a year ago, we had to depend entirely on the then scanty linen supply of the Teachers' cottage, the poor teachers couldn't change their beds for several weeks, and nearly had to let their faces dry with the wind. Now, the separate supply for the office takes care of all the needs there. The work-room, which has a porcelain sink and slop sink, a long work table with cupboards above, and a three-burner oil-stove, is helping to solve the problem of a laboratory for the four or five high school students taking science. Each afternoon, except Wednesday, Mr. Stuart holds his class over there the last period in the afternoon. The simple apparatus, acids, etc., that he uses are also useful to me, so we find it works very well to have the laboratory equipment in common. The furniture in the front (office) room was almost all given by the Boston club; a white enamel medicine cabinet already full an irrigation stand, a dressing carriage with glass top, and an office desk and chair. The doors and windows proved to be too small for the desk when it arrived, so the screen-door, door, and door-jamb were removed and help obtained from the store to get it over the porch-railing to a corner inside. The curtains throughout were sent by the Houston club, and are very pretty: coffee-colored scrim, with old rose in the waiting-room, and light blue in the others. It is hard to realize what a difference they make till they are taken down for the rooms to be cleaned. The other front room we planned to have as a waiting-room, but so far, owing to the necessity of using the fireplace for heating, in the winter-time anyone who comes to see the doctor just waits and "warms" by the fireplace in the office, but it will be used oftener now in the warmer weather. The baby doll (part of the Baby Demonstration outfit sent by the New York club) sleeps in her basket in there, NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 721 beside a tiny grown-up's bed with its sheets, spread, and pillows. The grown people are as interested in it as are the children and babies. The baby scales are at present in the office where it is warmer but they occasionally weigh wool, medicines and parcels as well as small babies. The doll shared one of her petticoats with' a wee baby, . and a blanket with a sick one, and her diapers are useful for little visitors. A telephone connects the cottage with Miss Evelyn's office, and saves a good deal of time, and many steps, even if it doesn't connect with the outside world. FRONT PORCH. REAL BABY IN SCALES We are both planning to have an "open house" to. everyone around on the eighth of May, when both the Grand Council and the Settlement School Committee will be here, so the people may meet them, and also become familiar with the cottage itself. Several of the doctors take turns in coming up here one Wednesday afternoon a month. And our thanks are certainly due them, for the difficulties in the way of keeping their days are almost insurmount able, sometimes. But the people are beginning to depend on a doctor's being here Wednesdays. Though this is just the beginning we hope that eventually those not critically ill will see a' doctor in time, 722 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and also that a definite center like this will save the doctors many a trip up the creeks. "Prince," a horse that has replaced Dan seems to have a particular fondness for his new home, a discovery made one night about three A. M. Though he had been tied to the porch, he was nowhere to be seen when wanted; we scoured the fields in the moonlight, then one of the men discovered fresh prints on the road leading to the Burg, and half a mile down the road we caught up to him, cropping the early spring plants as he walked homeward. EAST VIEW OF HOSPITAL Climbing rose given by Miss Burton, on left of step. Plum trees in blossom Sometimes even our tragedies have funny endings. A box of drugs for which I impatiently waited two weeks and had made inquiries in all directions finally came to light down at "Charlie's" store. One of the mail carriers was using it to sit on while he sorted mail. Last spring a survey was begun of the district which for the most part extends in all directions from the Burg for a radius of about four miles. Each creek is separated from the other by mountain ridges. I am hoping to complete it this spring when there is less sickness. Roughly speaking, there must be about two hundred families in this district. Usually it is easier to come back to the PANHELLENIC 723 ' Burg and start up the next creek than try to cross the ridges, except on foot. This is one of the reasons why the people are so isolated. Those who already know me would feel it was hardly fitting for me to stop without. asking for something! Several bath-robes and slippers, large enough for grown-ups, or children in their 'teens would be very useful a blue corduroy which came in a box and a pair of pussycat slippers, both about the size of a child from eight of ten, have been used on several occasions, once, when a cute little girl sat out under a tree during a pouring rain until her clothes were thoroughly soaked because her classmates had been teasing her. Any blankets not wanted elsewhere can always be utilized here ! PANHELLENIC BOSTON PANHELLENIC The Boston Panhellenic Association, which was recently organized, held a delightful luncheon on December 3, at the Copley Plaza Hotel which was attended by 328 Greek women. The president of the Boston Panhellenic is Mrs. Francis Rugg, Pi Beta Phi; secretary, Mrs. Charles H. Taft, Kappa Alpha Theta; and treasurer, Mrs. Albert Schofield, Kappa Kappa Gamma. As is customary, the positions will be rotated according to the date of founding. Delta Zeta is represented by Mrs. Alpha Lloyd Hayes, one of our founders and past grand president, and Mrs. Marguerite Hanna Pote, Theta. Mrs. Pote has been appointed on the committee to draw up by-laws and also on the Publicity Committee. At the luncheon, Mrs. Norman McCausland of Alpha Omicron Pi and Mrs. Ethel Weston of Sigma Kappa spoke interestingly while a splendid musical program was rendered by talented members of Alpha Chi Omega. The different groups, whose places at the tables were marked by pennants and banners, showed great enthusiasm in their impromptu singing of fraternity songs. The roll was called by fraternities and also by universities and colleges. The membership of the different fraternities present ran from 2 to 44 from 110 colleges. Altogether the initial year has been most successful. The Lamp of Delta Zeta.

When we first put in the heater for four successive afternoons, it seemed as though every day were a "Saturday bath night."

        714 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Tennessee. There is practically no hay: clover, wheat or oats raised in the mountains. This past winter we have paid $1.00 a bushel for corn and from $20.00 to $46.00 a ton for hay to feed bur horses and cows. We have been trying to buy some pigs since the first of the year but have not succeeded in getting any so far. "Thar seems to be no sick animals" at least for sale and no one ever has more than two or three. We hope to remedy this condition and have a better grade of both cattle and hogs. One reason the people do not raise more than they need is because they are fifteen miles from any market and over a road that is so bad most of the time that teamsters cannot haul more than half a load so it is not worth while to raise much of a crop. Our School has been invited to take part in the Field Meet in Sevierville, April 7. Mr. Stuart and Miss Chew, our high school teachers, are staying over and will take the students down who are to take part. The boys have been busy practicing their athletic events for the past three weeks, and these events will take place in the morning. The afternoon is to be devoted to declamatory and oratorical con-tests. One of our freshman girls is entered in the latter. In the evening each school taking part is expected to put on a "stunt," Miss Chew will take the entire "Ruggles family" and they will give the second act of The Birds' Christmas Carol. Whether we win any, prize, it will be a great experience for the pupils and will give them a chance to see what other schools are doing and I feel sure our work here will compare very favorably with that of any other school. JENNIE NICOL Jennie Nicol, M.D., one of our Founders, was a pioneer in the field of medicine as a profession for women, and it is most fitting that our health centre at Gatlinburg should bear the name of this splendid woman who was preparing herself to devote her life to humanity. While an active member of Illinois A, Jennie Nicol was a constant visitor at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Kilgore and spent innumerable profitable hours discussing medicine with the doctor. After graduating from Monmouth College in 1868, she attended the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania from which she received the degree of doctor of medicine. Upon completing a year NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 715 as interne in the New England Hospital, she went to Switzerland to take advanced work in the University of Zurich. In an article which appeared in THE ARROW for November, 1909, and in June, 1917, we find that Dr. Nicol intended "to return to Illinois to practice, but on March 28, 1881, after an illness of a few days she died of meningitis. Her body was brought back to America and lies among the friends of her youth in Cedar Creek churchyard, near Little Rock, Ill. Mrs. Kilgore writes of her: " JENNIE NICOL "I knew Rachel all my life. I have called her Rachel. That was the name by which she was known. I do not know when she took the name of Jennie but I think in college days. Her home was just two miles from my own. She was born in 1845 at Edgington, Ill., and brought up on a farm near Little York, Warren County, Ill. (Monmouth is the county seat.) She died March 28, 1881. "From her letters you can see how devoted she was to her profession. She loved it she loved work. She was very thorough in 716 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI district school and in college. She wanted to know no guess work. She despised a sham had little use for a poor student. No woman ever entered the profession with a nobler purpose. In that day you know it was not popular for a woman to enter professional life. She was determined to be the equal of her brothers in the profession. She used to say, `I think we should have women physicians and I have an ambition to show the men what a woman can do.' She came to Dr. Kilgore, borrowed some books, and told him her desire to enter the profession. He was helpful, encouraged her to commence the study, and then to go to Philadelphia which she did. When she went to Philadelphia, she and Dr. Kilgore wanted me to study medicine with her. And in after years when I went into doctor's office how I wished I had we had many a long talk about it.

She gave MEDICINE CABINET, DRESSING CARRIAGE, ETC. her third grade paints to work with, and two little girls painted bright red designs on their legs above their stockings. They are being kept in, but Emily's sense of humor comes to the fore when out of the classroom. Yesterday, just a minute or two before the noon recess bell rang, one of the boys in practising jumping for the Stunt day in Sevierville, fell and broke his "collar-bone." Mr. Stuart and the boys carried him over to the Jennie Nicol cottage, and he was put to bed till the doctor succeeded in getting here about dark. This boy is an orphan who is being kept in school, and is boarding with a family in the Burg. The doctor wants him to sleep over at the cottage for A CORNER IN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL SHOWING NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 719 a few nights in case his arm should need any adjusting, so the room at the back which has been arranged for an emergency operating room, or bedroom, is proving useful. It has a hospital bed, a long narrow table and several extra electric light sockets which were used the day after they were installed, when a Knoxville nose and throat specialist did several tonsil operations there. He used one socket for his head-light, one for general light, and the other for his suction apparatus. One of the windows is still without a screen where he removed it in order to get into the cottage about three A. M. to get JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPITAL Ground ploughed up for corn. Small tree in foreground planted by children in Miss Ditmar's room last fall. his instruments when he was called out to see. one of the patients of the previous afternoon. The bathroom is finally being used. The apparatus for heating the water was changed from a sort of blow-torch arrangement that terrified us all to a Holyoke coal-oil heater. The girls staying in the Little Girls' Cottage use it one afternoon a week, and several boys boarding around have it another day. When we first put in the heater for four successive afternoons, it seemed as though every day were a "Saturday bath night." One small boy "cried his eyes out" at the thought of having to go over there; he preferred the more familiar wash-tub, but when he saw the lock on the bathroom door, the stopper, taps, etc., he-was so, thrilled his mother could scarcely 720 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI get him out. At every attempt he would say, "I'm aimin' to soak." When the little girls were through, they got their mop and washed the floor. They said they thought they could do that much in re-turn. One of them invariably scours the sinks while waiting her turn. Opposite the bathroom are cupboards and drawers, already well stocked. Ames, Des Moines, Indianola, and Manhattan have furnished the supplies, sheets, pillow-cases, bath-towels, hand-towels, etc. When Dr. Christenbery, a Knoxville nose and throat specialist, held a clinic in the school-house more than a year ago, we had to depend entirely on the then scanty linen supply of the Teachers' cottage, the poor teachers couldn't change their beds for several weeks, and nearly had to let their faces dry with the wind. Now, the separate supply for the office takes care of all the needs there. The work-room, which has a porcelain sink and slop sink, a long work table with cupboards above, and a three-burner oil-stove, is helping to solve the problem of a laboratory for the four or five high school students taking science. Each afternoon, except Wednesday, Mr. Stuart holds his class over there the last period in the afternoon. The simple apparatus, acids, etc., that he uses are also useful to me, so we find it works very well to have the laboratory equipment in common. The furniture in the front (office) room was almost all given by the Boston club; a white enamel medicine cabinet already full an irrigation stand, a dressing carriage with glass top, and an office desk and chair. The doors and windows proved to be too small for the desk when it arrived, so the screen-door, door, and door-jamb were removed and help obtained from the store to get it over the porch-railing to a corner inside. The curtains throughout were sent by the Houston club, and are very pretty: coffee-colored scrim, with old rose in the waiting-room, and light blue in the others. It is hard to realize what a difference they make till they are taken down for the rooms to be cleaned. The other front room we planned to have as a waiting-room, but so far, owing to the necessity of using the fireplace for heating, in the winter-time anyone who comes to see the doctor just waits and "warms" by the fireplace in the office, but it will be used oftener now in the warmer weather. The baby doll (part of the Baby Demonstration outfit sent by the New York club) sleeps in her basket in there, NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 721 beside a tiny grown-up's bed with its sheets, spread, and pillows. The grown people are as interested in it as are the children and babies.

The doll shared one of her petticoats with' a wee baby, . and a blanket with a sick one, and her diapers are useful for little visitors.

At our cooky-shine held at the chapter house in January, Mrs. C. F. Curtiss, one of our alumnce, gave a very interesting talk on the School. and read to us parts of a letter which she had received from there, telling of the very happy Christmas they had ha.d and of the great improvement in the place and of the wonderful way in which it is expanding. Last fall and winter. we made up' a, box of clothing to send to members of the School. In our (.chapter we have a system of reporting activities for the past week at each. fraternity meeting. A record is kept of these and the penalty for not performing the activities is twenty-five cents each. This money we are collecting and at the end of the year will send it to the Settlement School. This course of procedure was decided upon early. in the fall and all the money since that time has been kept for that. purpose. Also nil money collected for non-attendance at fraternity meetings, except of course in the case of an excuse, is used for the same end. At Christmas time, we always endeavor to buy as many baskets from our alumniv as we possibly can and strive tO create a sale for them. It is our fervent wish and desire that, any institution which is answering so noble a cause as the Settlement School will meet with every success possible, and Iowa IT will cooperate with and do every-thing for it that we possibly can. CLARA JORDAN, Iowa A WAFFLE BREAKFAST HELPS For several years it has been customary for the girls of Nevada A to hold a waffle breakfast in the basement of the girls' dormitory, Manzanita Hall. Posters are put up on the campus and in each fraternity house to advertise it and often breakfast is not served at the houses at all. The proceeds go to the Settlement School, but we usually clear only about fifteen dollars. It has always been our aim to increase the amount; this year we did. Our most talented members put on several musical numbers at a local motion-picture theater. By doing this we received a per cent of that evening's proceeds, which amounted to a little more than fifty dollars. Twenty dollars of this money we sent to the Fellowship Fund and thirty was added to our Settlement School Fund. ...YE PUS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 711 We also encourage all of our members to order their magazines through Miss Reisinger and try to get outside subscriptions. MARjORIE TA UFF ER, Nevada A. NEWS FRGAI LITTLE PIGEON BY SARAH POMEROY RU(4.11, Massachusetts A GATLINBURG, 1922 BY ANNA W. DOWEL hq.,:,d B "Beautiful for situation" is the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School on the Little Pigeon River. After riding in a Ford from Sevierville over seven miles of well-worn pike and eight miles of well-worn mountain road, up and down, in and out and all round about every side of the steep cliffs that overhang the raging river hundreds of PART OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL STAFF, 1922 feet below, thinking many times that "Henry" might not turn in time to keep from going over, you experience great relief when you round the last big cliff and get the full view of the School property. It is a, great surprise to see everything in such fine condition ; the buildings set back on the hillside with a. background of evergreens 712 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and the mountains covered with the most gorgeous foliage imaginable. It is a wonderful picture and we can not help being glad to have had a part in building this School in the mountains of Eastern Tennessee. The mountaineers of this section are descendents of the very early settlers, many living on the same small farms and in the same way as was common more than a century ago. They farm with the most primitive implements, and one who is used to the broad prairies of the middle west cannot see how they could use anything else on the steep hillsides. The houses are mostly built of logs or very rough boards and the furniture is of the simplest; there are no conveniences of any kind and the sanitary conditions well there are none. The food consists of corn bread, soda biscuit, buttermilk, fried eggs 'and potatoes, supplemented by mustard greens and in the summer, cabbage, tomatoes and wild fruit. A few have small apple orchards but sell most of the apples for there is good sale for them. The people of the immediate community having been in touch with the teachers for the past ten years and the young people being in school have made rapid strides and will compare favorably with the young persons in any rural community in dress and manners. Many of the former pupils, after finishing at the Settlement School, have gone to other schools and are making successful teachers. The people like to have visitors and are very cordial always inviting you to stay for a meal or over night. They may not always mean it but the invitation is given just the same. Those living "back up over the hollers" have few visitors and they never fail to insist that you stay over with them and you really feel that they do want you. Pi Beta Phi has completed the tenth year of "keepin' school" on the Little Pigeon. From a very few pupils in an old, one-room building and much o:pposition ten years ago we have this year 126 pupils enrolled, a splendid school building with five rooms and a large square entrance hall and no opposition. When you come to study these people and find them so slow to take up with anything new and slower still to do things in a different way from the way they have always been used to and which their parents have taught them, you will really see that we have done a wonderful work. One of the most noticeable things accomplished is that this year most of the children have been very regular in attendance and have stayed in school until the close, while in other years they have come when they felt like it and stayed at home when they felt like it as NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 713 the parents were not interested enough to make them come, This condition was very trying for the teachers as these pupils could not keep up with their classes and the work was very unsatisfactory. Neither did the teachers have any spare time to devote to those who were behind. Tennessee has a compulsory school law and that helped very much as long as, the free school lasted and perhaps they acquired the habit of going, for the last three months of pay school the attendance has been unusually good, especially in the higher grades and the high school. The children, even the younger ones, are frequently kept at home to grub briars and to help put in the crop. 1:n fact, it seems some-times as if the children had the burden of the work on their shoulders while the fathers visited the small stores to learn what was "goin' on," depending upon the women and children to get in the crop. The children who are kept out do not finish the year's work and have to remain in the same class, another year which is very discouraging after two or three years. Since the first of the year we have been serving lunch for the children in the first three grades. We serve one hot dish and give them milk to drink and every child has gained in weight and is doing better work in school. Many of the children are under-nourished on account of their limited diet and bring very little lunch to school and many bring none at all. The mothers never prepare anything for them to bring, so if there is a piece of corn bread or a biscuit left from breakfast it is wrapped up in a newspaper, always a newspaper, and brought for lunch. A few will bring a meat sandwich and two little girls brought boiled eggs one day. The children do not take readily to anything new so we have to be careful what we prepare for lunch although we do give them something new once in a while and they will soon learn to eat new things. just before Christmas vacation, the pupils .gave The Birds' Christmas Carol, the first thing of the kind ever attempted. All parts were taken, but the "Ruggles family," made the hit of the evening. This spring they gave the operetta Boy Blue, and it proved as great a success. This training has given confidence to the pupils in their ability to do things and has been a very helpful part of the year's work. Agricultural work is much needed in the community. There is no stock raising nor rotation of crops. Corn is king in Eastern 714 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Tennessee. There is practically no hay: clover, wheat or oats raised in the mountains. This past winter we have paid $1.00 a bushel for corn and from $20.00 to $46.00 a ton for hay to feed bur horses and cows. We have been trying to buy some pigs since the first of the year but have not succeeded in getting any so far. "Thar seems to be no sick animals" at least for sale and no one ever has more than two or three. We hope to remedy this condition and have a better grade of both cattle and hogs. One reason the people do not raise more than they need is because they are fifteen miles from any market and over a road that is so bad most of the time that teamsters cannot haul more than half a load so it is not worth while to raise much of a crop. Our School has been invited to take part in the Field Meet in Sevierville, April 7. Mr. Stuart and Miss Chew, our high school teachers, are staying over and will take the students down who are to take part. The boys have been busy practicing their athletic events for the past three weeks, and these events will take place in the morning. The afternoon is to be devoted to declamatory and oratorical con-tests. One of our freshman girls is entered in the latter. In the evening each school taking part is expected to put on a "stunt," Miss Chew will take the entire "Ruggles family" and they will give the second act of The Birds' Christmas Carol. Whether we win any, prize, it will be a great experience for the pupils and will give them a chance to see what other schools are doing and I feel sure our work here will compare very favorably with that of any other school. JENNIE NICOL Jennie Nicol, M.D., one of our Founders, was a pioneer in the field of medicine as a profession for women, and it is most fitting that our health centre at Gatlinburg should bear the name of this splendid woman who was preparing herself to devote her life to humanity. While an active member of Illinois A, Jennie Nicol was a constant visitor at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Kilgore and spent innumerable profitable hours discussing medicine with the doctor. After graduating from Monmouth College in 1868, she attended the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania from which she received the degree of doctor of medicine. Upon completing a year NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 715 as interne in the New England Hospital, she went to Switzerland to take advanced work in the University of Zurich. In an article which appeared in THE ARROW for November, 1909, and in June, 1917, we find that Dr. Nicol intended "to return to Illinois to practice, but on March 28, 1881, after an illness of a few days she died of meningitis. Her body was brought back to America and lies among the friends of her youth in Cedar Creek churchyard, near Little Rock, Ill. Mrs. Kilgore writes of her: " JENNIE NICOL "I knew Rachel all my life. I have called her Rachel. That was the name by which she was known. I do not know when she took the name of Jennie but I think in college days. Her home was just two miles from my own. She was born in 1845 at Edgington, Ill., and brought up on a farm near Little York, Warren County, Ill. (Monmouth is the county seat.) She died March 28, 1881. "From her letters you can see how devoted she was to her profession. She loved it she loved work. She was very thorough in 716 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI district school and in college. She wanted to know no guess work. She despised a sham had little use for a poor student. No woman ever entered the profession with a nobler purpose. In that day you know it was not popular for a woman to enter professional life. She was determined to be the equal of her brothers in the profession. She used to say, `I think we should have women physicians and I have an ambition to show the men what a woman can do.' She came to Dr. Kilgore, borrowed some books, and told him her desire to enter the profession. He was helpful, encouraged her to commence the study, and then to go to Philadelphia which she did. When she went to Philadelphia, she and Dr. Kilgore wanted me to study medicine with her. And in after years when I went into doctor's office how I wished I had we had many a long talk about it. "To strangers she was cold, dignified, almost exacting, but that was not her real character. She was kind and loving and helpful to others and went about doing good. When my father died of cholera in 1873 she came to us when everybody considered our home a pest-house. When I was stricken with the disease and no one, but Dr. Kilgore thought I could live, she came and helped him. In fact she acted as my nurse for we could get no one. Where duty called her she was faithful even at the risk of her life. So you understand I write all this to show you she succeeded where weak women would have failed. She was strong and large physically, she was strong and large intellectually, she was strong and large spiritually. "She was a very earnest church worker, teaching in Sabbath School a class of young ladies and gentlemen. Her pastor thought her an excellent teacher. He laughingly said, `She makes them dig up Bible truth.' "She was not in town at our first I. C. meeting. She was very proud of her arrow and was a faithful member. I think it meant much to her she had no real sister. She wore her I. C. pin the night she started for Philadelphia. Laughingly she said, `I wonder if they will know in the East what I. C. means.' "Though she was disappointed in her realization of her life service for which she had prepared herself, yet she lives today in our hearts, an inspiration to efficient work unto us of this generation. Strength continually has gone forth from her." NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON ' 717 NURSE HIGINBOTHAM Helen Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario A, B.A. (Toronto), M.A. (Columbia), the only trained nurse in Sevier County, presides over the Jennie Nicol Memorial. She was a member of the class of 1912, University of Toronto, where she specialized in modern languages and obtained her A.B. with honors on graduation.

Upon her graduation from Hopkins in 1918 she went immediately overseas with the American Army, and was at Brest and other points in France for a year. When she returned she received a Red Cross scholarship at Columbia University in New York, and was in the first class of its kind established. At the same time she obtained her M.A. from Columbia. After completing her settlement work in New York she went to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinbur where she is absorbed in her work. 718 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI THE JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL BY PHYLLIS HIGINBOTTIAM, Ontario A It seems scarcely more than a month since Sunday, January 1, when Marie, just arrived from Christmas vacation, went upstairs singing "Hail; hail, the gang's all here." Now Miss Evelyn is downstairs with a group of girls practising some of the choruses of Little Boy Blue for the close of school, the end of this week; and it will not be long before our household is again reduced in numbers. (A peep into school discipline!) Emily Burton, who teaches the three primary grades, has just come in at recess. She gave MEDICINE CABINET, DRESSING CARRIAGE, ETC. her third grade paints to work with, and two little girls painted bright red designs on their legs above their stockings. They are being kept in, but Emily's sense of humor comes to the fore when out of the classroom. Yesterday, just a minute or two before the noon recess bell rang, one of the boys in practising jumping for the Stunt day in Sevierville, fell and broke his "collar-bone." Mr. Stuart and the boys carried him over to the Jennie Nicol cottage, and he was put to bed till the doctor succeeded in getting here about dark. This boy is an orphan who is being kept in school, and is boarding with a family in the Burg. The doctor wants him to sleep over at the cottage for A CORNER IN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL SHOWING NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 719 a few nights in case his arm should need any adjusting, so the room at the back which has been arranged for an emergency operating room, or bedroom, is proving useful. It has a hospital bed, a long narrow table and several extra electric light sockets which were used the day after they were installed, when a Knoxville nose and throat specialist did several tonsil operations there. He used one socket for his head-light, one for general light, and the other for his suction apparatus. One of the windows is still without a screen where he removed it in order to get into the cottage about three A. M. to get JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPITAL Ground ploughed up for corn. Small tree in foreground planted by children in Miss Ditmar's room last fall. his instruments when he was called out to see. one of the patients of the previous afternoon. The bathroom is finally being used. The apparatus for heating the water was changed from a sort of blow-torch arrangement that terrified us all to a Holyoke coal-oil heater. The girls staying in the Little Girls' Cottage use it one afternoon a week, and several boys boarding around have it another day. When we first put in the heater for four successive afternoons, it seemed as though every day were a "Saturday bath night." One small boy "cried his eyes out" at the thought of having to go over there; he preferred the more familiar wash-tub, but when he saw the lock on the bathroom door, the stopper, taps, etc., he-was so, thrilled his mother could scarcely 720 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI get him out. At every attempt he would say, "I'm aimin' to soak." When the little girls were through, they got their mop and washed the floor. They said they thought they could do that much in re-turn. One of them invariably scours the sinks while waiting her turn. Opposite the bathroom are cupboards and drawers, already well stocked. Ames, Des Moines, Indianola, and Manhattan have furnished the supplies, sheets, pillow-cases, bath-towels, hand-towels, etc. When Dr. Christenbery, a Knoxville nose and throat specialist, held a clinic in the school-house more than a year ago, we had to depend entirely on the then scanty linen supply of the Teachers' cottage, the poor teachers couldn't change their beds for several weeks, and nearly had to let their faces dry with the wind. Now, the separate supply for the office takes care of all the needs there. The work-room, which has a porcelain sink and slop sink, a long work table with cupboards above, and a three-burner oil-stove, is helping to solve the problem of a laboratory for the four or five high school students taking science. Each afternoon, except Wednesday, Mr. Stuart holds his class over there the last period in the afternoon. The simple apparatus, acids, etc., that he uses are also useful to me, so we find it works very well to have the laboratory equipment in common. The furniture in the front (office) room was almost all given by the Boston club; a white enamel medicine cabinet already full an irrigation stand, a dressing carriage with glass top, and an office desk and chair. The doors and windows proved to be too small for the desk when it arrived, so the screen-door, door, and door-jamb were removed and help obtained from the store to get it over the porch-railing to a corner inside. The curtains throughout were sent by the Houston club, and are very pretty: coffee-colored scrim, with old rose in the waiting-room, and light blue in the others. It is hard to realize what a difference they make till they are taken down for the rooms to be cleaned. The other front room we planned to have as a waiting-room, but so far, owing to the necessity of using the fireplace for heating, in the winter-time anyone who comes to see the doctor just waits and "warms" by the fireplace in the office, but it will be used oftener now in the warmer weather. The baby doll (part of the Baby Demonstration outfit sent by the New York club) sleeps in her basket in there, NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 721 beside a tiny grown-up's bed with its sheets, spread, and pillows. The grown people are as interested in it as are the children and babies. The baby scales are at present in the office where it is warmer but they occasionally weigh wool, medicines and parcels as well as small babies. The doll shared one of her petticoats with' a wee baby, . and a blanket with a sick one, and her diapers are useful for little visitors. A telephone connects the cottage with Miss Evelyn's office, and saves a good deal of time, and many steps, even if it doesn't connect with the outside world. FRONT PORCH. REAL BABY IN SCALES We are both planning to have an "open house" to. everyone around on the eighth of May, when both the Grand Council and the Settlement School Committee will be here, so the people may meet them, and also become familiar with the cottage itself. Several of the doctors take turns in coming up here one Wednesday afternoon a month. And our thanks are certainly due them, for the difficulties in the way of keeping their days are almost insurmount able, sometimes. But the people are beginning to depend on a doctor's being here Wednesdays. Though this is just the beginning we hope that eventually those not critically ill will see a' doctor in time, 722 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and also that a definite center like this will save the doctors many a trip up the creeks. "Prince," a horse that has replaced Dan seems to have a particular fondness for his new home, a discovery made one night about three A. M. Though he had been tied to the porch, he was nowhere to be seen when wanted; we scoured the fields in the moonlight, then one of the men discovered fresh prints on the road leading to the Burg, and half a mile down the road we caught up to him, cropping the early spring plants as he walked homeward. EAST VIEW OF HOSPITAL Climbing rose given by Miss Burton, on left of step. Plum trees in blossom Sometimes even our tragedies have funny endings. A box of drugs for which I impatiently waited two weeks and had made inquiries in all directions finally came to light down at "Charlie's" store. One of the mail carriers was using it to sit on while he sorted mail. Last spring a survey was begun of the district which for the most part extends in all directions from the Burg for a radius of about four miles. Each creek is separated from the other by mountain ridges. I am hoping to complete it this spring when there is less sickness. Roughly speaking, there must be about two hundred families in this district. Usually it is easier to come back to the PANHELLENIC 723 ' Burg and start up the next creek than try to cross the ridges, except on foot. This is one of the reasons why the people are so isolated. Those who already know me would feel it was hardly fitting for me to stop without. asking for something! Several bath-robes and slippers, large enough for grown-ups, or children in their 'teens would be very useful a blue corduroy which came in a box and a pair of pussycat slippers, both about the size of a child from eight of ten, have been used on several occasions, once, when a cute little girl sat out under a tree during a pouring rain until her clothes were thoroughly soaked because her classmates had been teasing her. Any blankets not wanted elsewhere can always be utilized here ! PANHELLENIC BOSTON PANHELLENIC The Boston Panhellenic Association, which was recently organized, held a delightful luncheon on December 3, at the Copley Plaza Hotel which was attended by 328 Greek women.
