Many of were unknown to them; our ex-were bewildering; our habits of life Ld artificial. Because they could not d, we sometimes attributed to them nterest or an open suspicion. A particularly interesting experience I had at Gatlinburg was the first mass meeting I held with the people there. After the Chicago Alumne Club in 1912 accepted the responsibility of managing the proposed mountain school, Mrs. Lardner and I, being members of the committee, planned going to Gatlin-burg to investigate and make recommendations for the future. Miss Martha Hill, a mountain worker (not a Pi Phi), had been hired by the committee of the 1910 Convention, under Miss Turner's leadership, to try out the experiment, and her term was drawing to a close. The new committee had no money provided for its expenses. In fact, the school project .was in debt for money borrowed and already spent. At the last minute, after all arrangements had been made for transportation and meeting desirable men at the other end, Mrs. Lardner was unavoidably prevented from going and it was decided that it would be necessary for me to go alone. Army life on the frontier, among Indians, in isolated Army posts, and actual war experiences should have prepared me and made me more enduring for that awful first trip from Knoxville to Gatlinburg. However, even after these twenty-four years which have elapsed, that ride through swollen rivers, over miles of uncharted stony trails, up precipitous mountain sides and down into cavernous ravines, over roads overhanging the mountain sides or temporarily widened by anchored logs where we looked over the tree tops into the rushing waters of the Little Pigeon River two hundred feet below, comes afresh to my mind as one of the unforgettable experiences of my life. I recall thinking, as we bounced over boulder after boulder in an old dry river bed, "no wonder these people never travel." And then, when we rounded the curve in the road that brought to view the magnificent grandeur of the Gatlinburg scenery, like a THE FEBRUARY ARROW SCHOOL BUILDING USED BY PI BETA PHI: AUGUST 1912, 1913, 1914 woman upon being delivered of her first child, the previous tortuous four hours were entirely forgotten for the moment, and my soul was spurred to ecstatic adoration and sympathy for the place. On my third day, after visiting from house to house, that first mass meeting in the old abandoned church-house was called. The stores were closed for the meeting. From far and near, the people plodded along the rough country road. The church-house was packed with men tall, gaunt, serious, and silent and women with snuff sticks in the corners of their mouths and children in arms or around their skirts. With all the earnestness and simplicity I could command, the plan for an education for their children was outlined and explained. And then the question was put to them, "Do you want it ?" There came no answer; no one seemed to care; no one deigned to express an opinion. The atmosphere seemed charged with suspicion, antagonism, and unfriendliness. I imagined my mission a complete failure. For an instant, I was stampeded as I had been once before in the presence of hostile fanatic Maros in the Philippines. Then, Mr. Calvin Ogle, the school teacher, stirred, threw his head back, and burst out that never-to-be-forgotten exclamation, "What we folks want to know is what religion you folks want to bring here." Overjoyed at the breaking of the silence, and happy that it was a no more serious question, I replied, "We are not bringing any religionbut the teachings of our Christian ri love and trying to do unto others as have them do unto us." I explainec organization was a Christian org and repeated to them our creed, them the Bible reference. They sees fled and somewhat relieved. "Book was secondary to the cravings of the these isolated people, and in those the foundation of our usefulness upon the faith the people had ligious attributes and the faithful service our pioneer Pi Phis rendere, Several days after this mass rI was on my way down the tortuous side, again holding onto the sides ( buckboard with an iron grip to ke the seat as we bobbed up and over 11 and down cavernous ruts and gull there came into sight a man pacin down, with his horse hitched to beside the road.

This we I, and each succeeding year until the rar overshadowed our work, Pi Beta d to her school property with the :ic cooperation and personal support of her members and the village people. The Chicago Alumnre Club made the situations at Gatlinburg a profound study. Other similar schools were visited and we profited by their experiences and advice. Volunteer Pi Phis of the finest types of our membership offered their services. The teachers were true missionaries and pioneers, living a consecrated life to Pi Phi ideals and teachings. The simple, outspoken people strengthened within us the best traits of our character and inspired us to greater compassion and better under-standing. The creed of Pi Beta Phi was actually lived during those first years of our altruistic work at Gatlinburg. The name Pi Beta Phi was a synonym for service, friend-ship, and sincerity. Pi Phis of today, or the present-day generation of children at Gatlin-burg, can never know of the discipline, the hard labor, or the anxious problems of those first few years. At this time twenty-four years later it gives me a great thrill to make comparisons and to visualize the improvements, the life, the happiness, the great good, our work has brought to these worthwhile people in the Big Smokies.

This is not all the Good Samaritan has done. They have given a lot of boys and girls work to do, also work for men and women. The women are now making more money weaving in one month, than all the men put together made a few years ago in a whole year. May the Good Samaritan Pi Beta Phi live on and on. And now, Gatlinburg, join with me all together, a thousand cheers! THE FEBRUARY ARROW GATLINBURG GROWS IN PI PHI HANDS By MR. STEVE WHALEY, Proprietor, Riverside Hotel, Gatlinburg Permit me to say to anyone concerned, that in the year 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity established a school here beginning with the primary grades. From that date to the present time it has become a four year high school. The growth of the school has been wonderful. It has made better progress than any school I know of. This school is highly appreciated by every thinking man and woman. It has prepared many boys and girls so that they can go out and make their way in life. The work of the school is still in its infancy. I cannot see the end of the good it will do. The community has grown with th The people have built better ha beautified their lawns with shrubl flowers. We caught this spirit of grog the school. The location of the school is w( right in the shade and shadow of t Smoky Mountains National Park, su: by the most beautiful mountain seen the world. May the sunshine of light and that twinkle by night forever shine i school and in the pathway of all responsible for its making. THE PI PHIS PROVE WORTH COPYING By MRS. ELDER OGLE (Lula May), Active Worker, Gatlinburg Weavers' Guild What we've been trying to do the last quarter of a century is to copy the Pi Phis, and we've found them a fit example. They have done more for us by just living the better life among us than they could have if they had gone about teaching us in any other way. Mountain folks as a rule don't take dictation readily. The Pi Phis led us to better ways of living better homes (cleaner and prettier), new ways to prepare foods, ways to care for the sick, and best of all, maybe, proper baby foods and care. They also taught us to dress ourselves so that we would look better. They taught us to weave pretty things that would sell, and they marketed our articles through the Pi Phi clubs, thus giving the woman of a family a wage to add to the living expenses. After we were sitting on top of the world with Pi Phi, came the Park to knock us temporarily of our pinnacle. We found our-selves huddled into cramped quarters at Pi Phi's feet. Without thinking of all the.privileges we were sacrificing, tempted by what looked like big prices, the mountain folks had surrendered their acres of mountain land; the money paid for the land went toward buying new homes. We look Pi Phis. They never have failed managed to sell enough weaving an to give us work enough "to keep fires burning" and to keep the ch school. And do you reckon we appi Mountain folks do not have an elabc of complimentary language, but you would see all of us lined up ii of Pi Phi. What would we do if Pi Phi left they never cause us the worry and rr of finding out! We cannot ever re for what they have meant to us, } God will. Pi Phi blends perfectly 'c%, alike. It seems to me that at no tir other place, among no other pear Pi Phi find such a field of labor 1 future ahead. It seems a long time ago that Pi here, with the changes that have tal At the end of another quarter cent: to still be living to see even moi plished by the Pi Phis.

After eighteen years, the details of my first visit have )m my memory. I visited the School, ning with 1923 I have not missed a year at Gatlinburg, and still the region intrigues me. My first impression of the mountains was that they were bewilderingly beautiful and fascinating. The mountain people were at first reserved, but when you were once accepted as being friendly, they gave their confidence freely and asked many novel and shrewd questions. In later visits, I have found that the children are lovable, very intelligent, , PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL acquaintance of most of the people ,urg, attended Sunday School, and he little valleys.

Begin and absorbing with avidity the education that the Pi Phi School provides them. I never visit the School without being impressed by the fine faces, quick understanding, and ready wit of these mountain children. I always talk to them and also draw pictures on the black-board for them. One time I was drawing a picture of a pig, and before I had finished the last leg I always make them run a little girl said, "Mr. Schantz, if you don't hurry and get that other leg on, the pig is going to get away." The capable generalship of Miss Mary O. Pollard in breaking down the prejudices and conquering the obstacles with which the School had to cope in the early days, and the wise and understanding supervision of Miss Evelyn Bishop, may in the years to come be THE FEBRUARY ARROW forgotten, but the work done by them added much to the foundation of the school. A wise addition to the work of the School was the founding of the little Memorial Hospital. It is very ,evident that aid to better living and care of children has done more to endear Pi Phis and the School to the mountain people than strictly book "larnin." I understand that the School mar has at different times discussed the that has developed with the comin, National Park, wondering whetl should not go to some less favored and begin another pioneering adve seems to me that there is still a large portant opportunity for developmen linburg. A PI PHI IN GATLINBURG By JEFFRIES GREEN PACE, Virginia A, Newly appointed member of Settlement School Committee Today in Gatlinburg we are greeted by Little Pigeon with the same burbling liquid charm as of yore. The little town nestles just as confidingly in the cup formed by over-hanging slopes and precipices; but our Pi Phi acres present quite a different picture than in the early days of the Settlement School's existence. Seven substantial frame buildings and two sturdy stone ones have filled their portion of the landscape. Leaving Miss Georgie to make her especially potent appeal to the tourist crowds in the attractive Arrow Craft Shop in the Hotel, we cross a rustic bridge to the Hospital and its health clinic. Here Marjorie Chalmers maintains efficient supervision of school children, serves the community far afield with regular preventive inoculation for prevalent and seasonal ailments, and proves a friend in need in case of a family emergency. Her roadster gets many a knockout blow on the rocky stream beds which still serve in lieu of roads in a few neighborhoods, but it never fails. A long walk through the pasture with the huge modern Pi Phi barn on our left, leads us to the boys' dormitory; here as master of the house, about the place as Agri-culture adviser, and at the High School as principal, Mr. William King holds sway. Next door to Stuart Cottage, which the boys use, is Pollard Cottage, the girls' dormitory, which also serves as dininghall. Here Mrs. McDonald sees that much of what is served is raised on the place plenty of vegetables and fruit being canned each year, and our own cows providing an abundance of nour-ishing milk. Our next stop is the 7 Cottage, which has ten rooms, inch: fices and a general sitting-room. H Weaver deals patiently with her da lems and serves as a gracious ha night the whole staff gathers here the dinner call and later to listen to or do handiwork together. Farther a still facing the road is the frame school building. Here the children Phi songs with great enthusiasm, arl choir of small children adds colo chapel services on special occasions. the two stone buildings.

After the Chicago Alumne Club in 1912 accepted the responsibility of managing the proposed mountain school, Mrs. Lardner and I, being members of the committee, planned going to Gatlin-burg to investigate and make recommendations for the future. Miss Martha Hill, a mountain worker (not a Pi Phi), had been hired by the committee of the 1910 Convention, under Miss Turner's leadership, to try out the experiment, and her term was drawing to a close. The new committee had no money provided for its expenses. In fact, the school project .was in debt for money borrowed and already spent. At the last minute, after all arrangements had been made for transportation and meeting desirable men at the other end, Mrs. Lardner was unavoidably prevented from going and it was decided that it would be necessary for me to go alone. Army life on the frontier, among Indians, in isolated Army posts, and actual war experiences should have prepared me and made me more enduring for that awful first trip from Knoxville to Gatlinburg. However, even after these twenty-four years which have elapsed, that ride through swollen rivers, over miles of uncharted stony trails, up precipitous mountain sides and down into cavernous ravines, over roads overhanging the mountain sides or temporarily widened by anchored logs where we looked over the tree tops into the rushing waters of the Little Pigeon River two hundred feet below, comes afresh to my mind as one of the unforgettable experiences of my life. I recall thinking, as we bounced over boulder after boulder in an old dry river bed, "no wonder these people never travel." And then, when we rounded the curve in the road that brought to view the magnificent grandeur of the Gatlinburg scenery, like a THE FEBRUARY ARROW SCHOOL BUILDING USED BY PI BETA PHI: AUGUST 1912, 1913, 1914 woman upon being delivered of her first child, the previous tortuous four hours were entirely forgotten for the moment, and my soul was spurred to ecstatic adoration and sympathy for the place. On my third day, after visiting from house to house, that first mass meeting in the old abandoned church-house was called. The stores were closed for the meeting. From far and near, the people plodded along the rough country road. The church-house was packed with men tall, gaunt, serious, and silent and women with snuff sticks in the corners of their mouths and children in arms or around their skirts. With all the earnestness and simplicity I could command, the plan for an education for their children was outlined and explained. And then the question was put to them, "Do you want it ?" There came no answer; no one seemed to care; no one deigned to express an opinion. The atmosphere seemed charged with suspicion, antagonism, and unfriendliness. I imagined my mission a complete failure. For an instant, I was stampeded as I had been once before in the presence of hostile fanatic Maros in the Philippines. Then, Mr. Calvin Ogle, the school teacher, stirred, threw his head back, and burst out that never-to-be-forgotten exclamation, "What we folks want to know is what religion you folks want to bring here." Overjoyed at the breaking of the silence, and happy that it was a no more serious question, I replied, "We are not bringing any religionbut the teachings of our Christian ri love and trying to do unto others as have them do unto us."

The simple, outspoken people strengthened within us the best traits of our character and inspired us to greater compassion and better under-standing. The creed of Pi Beta Phi was actually lived during those first years of our altruistic work at Gatlinburg. The name Pi Beta Phi was a synonym for service, friend-ship, and sincerity. Pi Phis of today, or the present-day generation of children at Gatlin-burg, can never know of the discipline, the hard labor, or the anxious problems of those first few years. At this time twenty-four years later it gives me a great thrill to make comparisons and to visualize the improvements, the life, the happiness, the great good, our work has brought to these worthwhile people in the Big Smokies.

This is not all the Good Samaritan has done. They have given a lot of boys and girls work to do, also work for men and women. The women are now making more money weaving in one month, than all the men put together made a few years ago in a whole year. May the Good Samaritan Pi Beta Phi live on and on. And now, Gatlinburg, join with me all together, a thousand cheers! THE FEBRUARY ARROW GATLINBURG GROWS IN PI PHI HANDS By MR. STEVE WHALEY, Proprietor, Riverside Hotel, Gatlinburg Permit me to say to anyone concerned, that in the year 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity established a school here beginning with the primary grades. From that date to the present time it has become a four year high school. The growth of the school has been wonderful. It has made better progress than any school I know of. This school is highly appreciated by every thinking man and woman. It has prepared many boys and girls so that they can go out and make their way in life. The work of the school is still in its infancy. I cannot see the end of the good it will do. The community has grown with th The people have built better ha beautified their lawns with shrubl flowers. We caught this spirit of grog the school.

ELDER OGLE (Lula May), Active Worker, Gatlinburg Weavers' Guild What we've been trying to do the last quarter of a century is to copy the Pi Phis, and we've found them a fit example. They have done more for us by just living the better life among us than they could have if they had gone about teaching us in any other way. Mountain folks as a rule don't take dictation readily. The Pi Phis led us to better ways of living better homes (cleaner and prettier), new ways to prepare foods, ways to care for the sick, and best of all, maybe, proper baby foods and care. They also taught us to dress ourselves so that we would look better. They taught us to weave pretty things that would sell, and they marketed our articles through the Pi Phi clubs, thus giving the woman of a family a wage to add to the living expenses. After we were sitting on top of the world with Pi Phi, came the Park to knock us temporarily of our pinnacle. We found our-selves huddled into cramped quarters at Pi Phi's feet. Without thinking of all the.privileges we were sacrificing, tempted by what looked like big prices, the mountain folks had surrendered their acres of mountain land; the money paid for the land went toward buying new homes. We look Pi Phis. They never have failed managed to sell enough weaving an to give us work enough "to keep fires burning" and to keep the ch school. And do you reckon we appi Mountain folks do not have an elabc of complimentary language, but you would see all of us lined up ii of Pi Phi. What would we do if Pi Phi left they never cause us the worry and rr of finding out! We cannot ever re for what they have meant to us, } God will. Pi Phi blends perfectly 'c%, alike.

A PI PHI IN GATLINBURG By JEFFRIES GREEN PACE, Virginia A, Newly appointed member of Settlement School Committee Today in Gatlinburg we are greeted by Little Pigeon with the same burbling liquid charm as of yore. The little town nestles just as confidingly in the cup formed by over-hanging slopes and precipices; but our Pi Phi acres present quite a different picture than in the early days of the Settlement School's existence. Seven substantial frame buildings and two sturdy stone ones have filled their portion of the landscape. Leaving Miss Georgie to make her especially potent appeal to the tourist crowds in the attractive Arrow Craft Shop in the Hotel, we cross a rustic bridge to the Hospital and its health clinic. Here Marjorie Chalmers maintains efficient supervision of school children, serves the community far afield with regular preventive inoculation for prevalent and seasonal ailments, and proves a friend in need in case of a family emergency. Her roadster gets many a knockout blow on the rocky stream beds which still serve in lieu of roads in a few neighborhoods, but it never fails. A long walk through the pasture with the huge modern Pi Phi barn on our left, leads us to the boys' dormitory; here as master of the house, about the place as Agri-culture adviser, and at the High School as principal, Mr. William King holds sway. Next door to Stuart Cottage, which the boys use, is Pollard Cottage, the girls' dormitory, which also serves as dininghall.

I believe that each Phi worker in this Fraternity enterived from her experience in Gatlin-ft in life that led to better under-and a greater appreciation of her )pportunities. early days were anxious days, uncerdays of hardship, sacrifices, and Pi Phis' words and acts were disi weighed freely, and were not alptable or held desirable.

The Chicago Alumnre Club made the situations at Gatlinburg a profound study. Other similar schools were visited and we profited by their experiences and advice. Volunteer Pi Phis of the finest types of our membership offered their services. The teachers were true missionaries and pioneers, living a consecrated life to Pi Phi ideals and teachings. The simple, outspoken people strengthened within us the best traits of our character and inspired us to greater compassion and better under-standing. The creed of Pi Beta Phi was actually lived during those first years of our altruistic work at Gatlinburg. The name Pi Beta Phi was a synonym for service, friend-ship, and sincerity. Pi Phis of today, or the present-day generation of children at Gatlin-burg, can never know of the discipline, the hard labor, or the anxious problems of those first few years. At this time twenty-four years later it gives me a great thrill to make comparisons and to visualize the improvements, the life, the happiness, the great good, our work has brought to these worthwhile people in the Big Smokies. LIVING IN GATLIN U G THE GOOD SAMARITAN COMES TO GATLINBURG By REV. ELI MCCARTER Long-time resident of Gatlinburg the first flyingup of snow in 1912 Good Samaritan appeared.

Maples and wife, Mr. . I. L.

This is not all the Good Samaritan has done. They have given a lot of boys and girls work to do, also work for men and women. The women are now making more money weaving in one month, than all the men put together made a few years ago in a whole year. May the Good Samaritan Pi Beta Phi live on and on. And now, Gatlinburg, join with me all together, a thousand cheers! THE FEBRUARY ARROW GATLINBURG GROWS IN PI PHI HANDS By MR. STEVE WHALEY, Proprietor, Riverside Hotel, Gatlinburg Permit me to say to anyone concerned, that in the year 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity established a school here beginning with the primary grades. From that date to the present time it has become a four year high school. The growth of the school has been wonderful. It has made better progress than any school I know of. This school is highly appreciated by every thinking man and woman. It has prepared many boys and girls so that they can go out and make their way in life. The work of the school is still in its infancy. I cannot see the end of the good it will do. The community has grown with th The people have built better ha beautified their lawns with shrubl flowers. We caught this spirit of grog the school. The location of the school is w( right in the shade and shadow of t Smoky Mountains National Park, su: by the most beautiful mountain seen the world. May the sunshine of light and that twinkle by night forever shine i school and in the pathway of all responsible for its making. THE PI PHIS PROVE WORTH COPYING By MRS. ELDER OGLE (Lula May), Active Worker, Gatlinburg Weavers' Guild What we've been trying to do the last quarter of a century is to copy the Pi Phis, and we've found them a fit example. They have done more for us by just living the better life among us than they could have if they had gone about teaching us in any other way. Mountain folks as a rule don't take dictation readily. The Pi Phis led us to better ways of living better homes (cleaner and prettier), new ways to prepare foods, ways to care for the sick, and best of all, maybe, proper baby foods and care. They also taught us to dress ourselves so that we would look better. They taught us to weave pretty things that would sell, and they marketed our articles through the Pi Phi clubs, thus giving the woman of a family a wage to add to the living expenses. After we were sitting on top of the world with Pi Phi, came the Park to knock us temporarily of our pinnacle. We found our-selves huddled into cramped quarters at Pi Phi's feet. Without thinking of all the.privileges we were sacrificing, tempted by what looked like big prices, the mountain folks had surrendered their acres of mountain land; the money paid for the land went toward buying new homes. We look Pi Phis. They never have failed managed to sell enough weaving an to give us work enough "to keep fires burning" and to keep the ch school. And do you reckon we appi Mountain folks do not have an elabc of complimentary language, but you would see all of us lined up ii of Pi Phi. What would we do if Pi Phi left they never cause us the worry and rr of finding out! We cannot ever re for what they have meant to us, } God will. Pi Phi blends perfectly 'c%, alike. It seems to me that at no tir other place, among no other pear Pi Phi find such a field of labor 1 future ahead. It seems a long time ago that Pi here, with the changes that have tal At the end of another quarter cent: to still be living to see even moi plished by the Pi Phis.

Like sign )n the highways, these experiences 3 mark the turning points in one's hrough life and lead to a definite estination. Such experiences came Ives of those earliest Pi Phi workers )urg. 2 Gatlinburg was a settlement of a ared houses, spread out along the )f the Great Smokies and hemmed isely wooded mountain walls. The approach were nearly impassable. Le entrapped within these walls were vn to us and the outer world as we aem.

They not alone heir best but they constantly strove :hemselves to the best to be gained se of the mountains, for, indeed, Intain people taught us many valu-)ns in living. I believe that each Phi worker in this Fraternity enterived from her experience in Gatlin-ft in life that led to better under-and a greater appreciation of her )pportunities. early days were anxious days, uncerdays of hardship, sacrifices, and Pi Phis' words and acts were disi weighed freely, and were not alptable or held desirable. Many of were unknown to them; our ex-were bewildering; our habits of life Ld artificial. Because they could not d, we sometimes attributed to them nterest or an open suspicion. A particularly interesting experience I had at Gatlinburg was the first mass meeting I held with the people there. After the Chicago Alumne Club in 1912 accepted the responsibility of managing the proposed mountain school, Mrs. Lardner and I, being members of the committee, planned going to Gatlin-burg to investigate and make recommendations for the future. Miss Martha Hill, a mountain worker (not a Pi Phi), had been hired by the committee of the 1910 Convention, under Miss Turner's leadership, to try out the experiment, and her term was drawing to a close. The new committee had no money provided for its expenses. In fact, the school project .was in debt for money borrowed and already spent. At the last minute, after all arrangements had been made for transportation and meeting desirable men at the other end, Mrs. Lardner was unavoidably prevented from going and it was decided that it would be necessary for me to go alone. Army life on the frontier, among Indians, in isolated Army posts, and actual war experiences should have prepared me and made me more enduring for that awful first trip from Knoxville to Gatlinburg. However, even after these twenty-four years which have elapsed, that ride through swollen rivers, over miles of uncharted stony trails, up precipitous mountain sides and down into cavernous ravines, over roads overhanging the mountain sides or temporarily widened by anchored logs where we looked over the tree tops into the rushing waters of the Little Pigeon River two hundred feet below, comes afresh to my mind as one of the unforgettable experiences of my life. I recall thinking, as we bounced over boulder after boulder in an old dry river bed, "no wonder these people never travel." And then, when we rounded the curve in the road that brought to view the magnificent grandeur of the Gatlinburg scenery, like a THE FEBRUARY ARROW SCHOOL BUILDING USED BY PI BETA PHI: AUGUST 1912, 1913, 1914 woman upon being delivered of her first child, the previous tortuous four hours were entirely forgotten for the moment, and my soul was spurred to ecstatic adoration and sympathy for the place. On my third day, after visiting from house to house, that first mass meeting in the old abandoned church-house was called. The stores were closed for the meeting. From far and near, the people plodded along the rough country road. The church-house was packed with men tall, gaunt, serious, and silent and women with snuff sticks in the corners of their mouths and children in arms or around their skirts. With all the earnestness and simplicity I could command, the plan for an education for their children was outlined and explained. And then the question was put to them, "Do you want it ?" There came no answer; no one seemed to care; no one deigned to express an opinion. The atmosphere seemed charged with suspicion, antagonism, and unfriendliness. I imagined my mission a complete failure. For an instant, I was stampeded as I had been once before in the presence of hostile fanatic Maros in the Philippines. Then, Mr. Calvin Ogle, the school teacher, stirred, threw his head back, and burst out that never-to-be-forgotten exclamation, "What we folks want to know is what religion you folks want to bring here." Overjoyed at the breaking of the silence, and happy that it was a no more serious question, I replied, "We are not bringing any religionbut the teachings of our Christian ri love and trying to do unto others as have them do unto us." I explainec organization was a Christian org and repeated to them our creed, them the Bible reference. They sees fled and somewhat relieved.

The simple, outspoken people strengthened within us the best traits of our character and inspired us to greater compassion and better under-standing. The creed of Pi Beta Phi was actually lived during those first years of our altruistic work at Gatlinburg. The name Pi Beta Phi was a synonym for service, friend-ship, and sincerity. Pi Phis of today, or the present-day generation of children at Gatlin-burg, can never know of the discipline, the hard labor, or the anxious problems of those first few years. At this time twenty-four years later it gives me a great thrill to make comparisons and to visualize the improvements, the life, the happiness, the great good, our work has brought to these worthwhile people in the Big Smokies. LIVING IN GATLIN U G THE GOOD SAMARITAN COMES TO GATLINBURG By REV. ELI MCCARTER Long-time resident of Gatlinburg the first flyingup of snow in 1912 Good Samaritan appeared. Let us )ur hats and hold them high to Mr. A. J. Huff for what they did for rg when they took the Good Samariheir home and gave him shelter and and not only to Mr. and Mrs. Huff, :o Mr. D. C. Maples and wife, Mr. . I. L. Maples, and also Mr. and Ogle and others, for their cooperathis trying hour these men and howed their love to God and man :ng firmly by this Good Samaritan, me is Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. all the good deeds the Good Samari tan has done for Gatlinburg and the surrounding communities would fill a volume of books ; they have helped the poor and needy, cared for the sick and suffering, and visited the people with the blessings they stood so much in need of. This is not all the Good Samaritan has done. They have given a lot of boys and girls work to do, also work for men and women. The women are now making more money weaving in one month, than all the men put together made a few years ago in a whole year. May the Good Samaritan Pi Beta Phi live on and on. And now, Gatlinburg, join with me all together, a thousand cheers! THE FEBRUARY ARROW GATLINBURG GROWS IN PI PHI HANDS By MR. STEVE WHALEY, Proprietor, Riverside Hotel, Gatlinburg Permit me to say to anyone concerned, that in the year 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity established a school here beginning with the primary grades. From that date to the present time it has become a four year high school. The growth of the school has been wonderful. It has made better progress than any school I know of. This school is highly appreciated by every thinking man and woman. It has prepared many boys and girls so that they can go out and make their way in life. The work of the school is still in its infancy. I cannot see the end of the good it will do. The community has grown with th The people have built better ha beautified their lawns with shrubl flowers. We caught this spirit of grog the school. The location of the school is w( right in the shade and shadow of t Smoky Mountains National Park, su: by the most beautiful mountain seen the world. May the sunshine of light and that twinkle by night forever shine i school and in the pathway of all responsible for its making. THE PI PHIS PROVE WORTH COPYING By MRS. ELDER OGLE (Lula May), Active Worker, Gatlinburg Weavers' Guild What we've been trying to do the last quarter of a century is to copy the Pi Phis, and we've found them a fit example. They have done more for us by just living the better life among us than they could have if they had gone about teaching us in any other way. Mountain folks as a rule don't take dictation readily. The Pi Phis led us to better ways of living better homes (cleaner and prettier), new ways to prepare foods, ways to care for the sick, and best of all, maybe, proper baby foods and care. They also taught us to dress ourselves so that we would look better. They taught us to weave pretty things that would sell, and they marketed our articles through the Pi Phi clubs, thus giving the woman of a family a wage to add to the living expenses. After we were sitting on top of the world with Pi Phi, came the Park to knock us temporarily of our pinnacle. We found our-selves huddled into cramped quarters at Pi Phi's feet. Without thinking of all the.privileges we were sacrificing, tempted by what looked like big prices, the mountain folks had surrendered their acres of mountain land; the money paid for the land went toward buying new homes. We look Pi Phis. They never have failed managed to sell enough weaving an to give us work enough "to keep fires burning" and to keep the ch school. And do you reckon we appi Mountain folks do not have an elabc of complimentary language, but you would see all of us lined up ii of Pi Phi. What would we do if Pi Phi left they never cause us the worry and rr of finding out! We cannot ever re for what they have meant to us, } God will. Pi Phi blends perfectly 'c%, alike. It seems to me that at no tir other place, among no other pear Pi Phi find such a field of labor 1 future ahead. It seems a long time ago that Pi here, with the changes that have tal At the end of another quarter cent: to still be living to see even moi plished by the Pi Phis. May God b: THE FEBRUARY ARROW VISITING IN GATLINBURG A PI PHI MAN IN GATLINBURG By ORPHEUS MOYER SCHANTZ, Illinois naturalist and lecturer, Pi Phi husband and father ORK done by the Pi Beta Phi School e of the most outstanding examples .d understanding effort for the edu-:he mountain people in the state of definite impressions of the School early May, 1918, which was the 1y first visit. After eighteen years, the details of my first visit have )m my memory. I visited the School, ning with 1923 I have not missed a year at Gatlinburg, and still the region intrigues me. My first impression of the mountains was that they were bewilderingly beautiful and fascinating. The mountain people were at first reserved, but when you were once accepted as being friendly, they gave their confidence freely and asked many novel and shrewd questions. In later visits, I have found that the children are lovable, very intelligent, , PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL acquaintance of most of the people ,urg, attended Sunday School, and he little valleys. At a Red Cross uring that first visit, I was asked For a few minutes ; the chairman sting had difficulty in pronouncing and finally I was introduced as a n from Chicago.

Begin and absorbing with avidity the education that the Pi Phi School provides them. I never visit the School without being impressed by the fine faces, quick understanding, and ready wit of these mountain children. I always talk to them and also draw pictures on the black-board for them. One time I was drawing a picture of a pig, and before I had finished the last leg I always make them run a little girl said, "Mr. Schantz, if you don't hurry and get that other leg on, the pig is going to get away." The capable generalship of Miss Mary O. Pollard in breaking down the prejudices and conquering the obstacles with which the School had to cope in the early days, and the wise and understanding supervision of Miss Evelyn Bishop, may in the years to come be THE FEBRUARY ARROW forgotten, but the work done by them added much to the foundation of the school. A wise addition to the work of the School was the founding of the little Memorial Hospital. It is very ,evident that aid to better living and care of children has done more to endear Pi Phis and the School to the mountain people than strictly book "larnin." I understand that the School mar has at different times discussed the that has developed with the comin, National Park, wondering whetl should not go to some less favored and begin another pioneering adve seems to me that there is still a large portant opportunity for developmen linburg. A PI PHI IN GATLINBURG By JEFFRIES GREEN PACE, Virginia A, Newly appointed member of Settlement School Committee Today in Gatlinburg we are greeted by Little Pigeon with the same burbling liquid charm as of yore. The little town nestles just as confidingly in the cup formed by over-hanging slopes and precipices; but our Pi Phi acres present quite a different picture than in the early days of the Settlement School's existence. Seven substantial frame buildings and two sturdy stone ones have filled their portion of the landscape. Leaving Miss Georgie to make her especially potent appeal to the tourist crowds in the attractive Arrow Craft Shop in the Hotel, we cross a rustic bridge to the Hospital and its health clinic. Here Marjorie Chalmers maintains efficient supervision of school children, serves the community far afield with regular preventive inoculation for prevalent and seasonal ailments, and proves a friend in need in case of a family emergency. Her roadster gets many a knockout blow on the rocky stream beds which still serve in lieu of roads in a few neighborhoods, but it never fails. A long walk through the pasture with the huge modern Pi Phi barn on our left, leads us to the boys' dormitory; here as master of the house, about the place as Agri-culture adviser, and at the High School as principal, Mr. William King holds sway. Next door to Stuart Cottage, which the boys use, is Pollard Cottage, the girls' dormitory, which also serves as dininghall. Here Mrs. McDonald sees that much of what is served is raised on the place plenty of vegetables and fruit being canned each year, and our own cows providing an abundance of nour-ishing milk. Our next stop is the 7 Cottage, which has ten rooms, inch: fices and a general sitting-room. H Weaver deals patiently with her da lems and serves as a gracious ha night the whole staff gathers here the dinner call and later to listen to or do handiwork together. Farther a still facing the road is the frame school building. Here the children Phi songs with great enthusiasm, arl choir of small children adds colo chapel services on special occasions. the two stone buildings.
