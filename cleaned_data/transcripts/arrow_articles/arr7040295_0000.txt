From Bulletin of International Council of Women. ews FROM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by Louise Wheelock Dobler, Washington Beta THE OCCASIONAL, and even the frequent, visitor to the Pi Phi School and the town of Gatlinburg realizes the truth of the old saying about nothing being so permanent as "change'' for that is what is constantly happening there. Last year the lovely new Staff House, dedicated to Ruth Barrett Smith, became a Pi Phi reality, and today commands a sweeping view of the town from atop a grassy knoll between the Mountain View Hotel and the other Pi Phi property. This year another addition has been made by the owners of the Mountain View in a very attractive Recreation Center which they have named the "Andy Huff House" in memory of a long-time friend of Pi Phi, a Gatlinburg Pio-neer, and the builder of the Mountain View Hotel. Made of native stone and split shakes, the two-story building includes a main hall with a large fireplace, porches along two sides, and a well-equipped kitchen. In the basement there are rooms for committee meetings which means that the building increases the potential of Gatlinburg as a convention site. Each such improvement increases the value of our Pi Phi property there, for it means more and more visitors. Our high school students and teachers have a special interest in the Andy Huff House, for his family have made a rule that each class may use the building one night a year free of charge. Seven of Mr. Huff's grandchildren are now students in our schools.

Ann Smith, the arts and crafts teacher, supervised the decorations for the party and included mobiles with red hearts of varying sizes, two harlequin figures on either side of the stage, poster-size "love letters," and many cupids. In keeping with other property improvements, it is hoped the coming of spring and good weather will find the replacement of the roof of the log cabin, a landmark on our Pi Phi grounds, an accomplished fact. Since only hand-hewn "boards" would be suitable, and the art of making them is rapidly disappearing, it has been a problem as to where they might be found. Last fall our faithful Arlie Watson who over-sees our holdings in Gatlinburg, contacted a man in the Glades who promised to supply the shakes. Word that he had cut his hand was soon followed by weather too cold to work, so Arlie decided that he and his son Neal, and Richard, who oversees the farm, would do the job. First it was necessary to spot the right kind of oak tree in our woods ; then after it was felled it had to be cut into blocks. These blocks wererolled down into the hollow from where they were hauled to the barn lot with the aid of our mule and sled. In doing this they discovered that the oak was a "bee tree," so they cut off the limb with the hive and brought it down by the brooder houses without disturbing the insects. There they fastened it to a small tree and on warm days the bees go in and out of the knot-holes giving promise of home-grown honey for the table in the.Staff House ! After Arlie and Neal split the blocks and peeled the bark from them, they turned the center pieces over to Richard who split each "board" into four thinner ones for he did not have a "f roe" to do the job. Lacking modern equipment, the men made their own mallet and rigged up a forked tree trunk to hold the boards. Now there are 3,850 "shingles," or shakes, ricked up in the shed where they will season and dry for 5 or 6 weeks before Arlie gets them on the cabin.

The increases range from 3.8 per cent for universities to 13.1 per cent for teachers colleges. The trend toward an increased proportion of women students in college continues, but the percentage of women is still below the 40 per cent ratio which prevailed in the years immediately preceding World War II.
