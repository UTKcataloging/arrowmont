        44 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI other annual reports of the fraternity, insure convenience, reduce expense and remove the chief cause of the inevitable delay in the appearance of the June ARROW. Our advertising rates have been doubled to meet the rising costs of production but no new advertising has been solicited. In October 1918 it was decided that the inclusion of the October Bulletin in the October number of THE ARROW was no longer practical so a regular number was issued and four regular numbers a year have since appeared. With the difficulties involved in belated issues of THE ARROW, the Bulletin has become more valuable than ever for the organization of the fraternity. The duties performed by THE ARRO\V Editor in her capacity as a member of Grand Council have been as usual many and varied. She has visited six-teen chapters officially, two others unofficially, inspected three petitioning groups, presided at the installation of New York A, assisted at the installation of Wisconsin B, attended the Editors' Conference of National Panhellenic Conference, made one visit to the Settlement School and has brought Grand Council message to the meetings of fourteen different alumna clubs. Since this report closes a period of service covering nearly a decade in the editorship, a personal word may be in order. During the past ten years your editor has watched with keenest interest the development of fraternity journal-ism as she has studied appreciatively the forty odd exchanges which came to her desk. Almost without exception they have grown in strength and increased in interest, keeping pace with the varied activities of the organizations they represent and indicating their characteristics. One of our contemporaries records the story of a wise father appealed to by a distraught daughter in the midst of a membership campaign who replied "Show me their magazines and I will make my decision as to the fraternity I would have you join." This is only one illustration of the emphasis laid upon fraternity journalism by the general reader. To him the publication represents the fraternity. Is it too much to expect that THE ARROW shall always be a translation of those ideals which are fundamental in our organization. No editor can realize this ambition alone and for her successor in office the retiring editor be-speaks the whole-hearted interest and support of the entire fraternity to the end that our magazine may always be a leader among fraternity journals. Respectfully submitted, SARAH POMEROY-RUGG. REPORT OF THE ALUMNrE EDITOR To 11 B (I) Fraternity, the Alumnae Editor submits the following report: The editorial work of the office of Alumnae Editor consists of collecting, editing and arranging alumna personals for every issue of THE ARROW, items for the department "Club Interests and Events," and the annual club reports which have been published in the June issue of THE ARROW. The alumnae club directory in the front of THE ARROW has been corrected for each issue and notices have been prepared for the Bulle in. The Alumnm Editor has also collected and edited various kinds of material for THE ARROW at the direction of THE ARROW Editor. Efforts are constantly being made to simplify, shorten and standardize the alumni personals, to give the most news in the smallest amount of space. If everyone sending in personals would be very exact and give full information it would save many unnecessary mistakes. It is very difficult to know which is correct when the same notice comes in from several different sources with no two exactly alike. The essential things in all personals are the full maiden name and husband's initials. Each year it has become more and more difficult to collect the annual club reports in time for the June ARROW. Founders' Day celebrations and the annual REPORTS OF OFFICERS 45 meetings of the clubs usually come about the time that all material must be in the hands of the printer if THE ARROW is to be issued on time. In past years printing conditions were such that it was possible to send in the club reports after Founders' Day and have them published in the June ARROW. This can no longer be done and with eighty clubs it is now impracticable to add paragraphs on Founders' Day happenings to proof, as has formerly been done. The Alumna Editor therefore recommends that after this year, the annual club reports be published in the October issue of THE ARROW. The Alumna Editor also recommends, in order to save time, space and additional cost of printing, that the class numerals following names be omitted in alumna personals and club reports. At the request of THE ARROW Editor, the Alumna! Editor has made two trips to Menasha, Wis., to confer with our publishers. As the personal representative of the Grand President two chapters were visited officially the past year. The Alumnae Editor assisted at the installation of Wisconsin B and Indiana A and visited a number of chapters and clubs since last convention. Talks on the Settlement School, illustrated with the steriopticon slides, have been given at various times and places. The slides have been in the care of the Alumnae Editor and it has been no light task to keep them making dates from coast to coast. In bringing to a close three years of work in this office, the Alumna Editor is deeply appreciative of the great privilege accorded her in the years of work and association with the retiring ARROW Editor. The work has at times been strenuous. All press work is pressure work when it must be done in a short space of time. The opportunity of keeping in personal touch with chapters, clubs and individual members more than compensates for the routine work involved in the regular duties of Alumnae Editor. Respectfully submitted, NINA H. ALLEN. REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Evelyn Bishop is completing her third year as head resident of the II B Settlement School. By her skill and knowledge of the community, its needs and limitations, she has avoided some and lightened other difficult situations. Through a sympathetic understanding of people generally she has quietly gained and held splendid cooperation from all the residents. The importance and value of this cannot be over estimated. There was added to our staff last year Lucy Nicholson, Berea, for the weaving, and Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario A, community and school nurse. Our school enrollment reached 127. High wages kept many older boys working who perhaps otherwise would have been in school. The percentage of attendance has risen steadily during the last three years. For advanced work, one of our Toys went to Athens University, preparatory department, the past year; another boy and a girl went to a North Carolina school; some to Murphy, and several to Carson Newman; one, who was persuaded to go to our school last winter after several years at "public works," went to Berea this summer. Reports come to us that these boys and girls( rank with the best in scholarship. The weaving did much towards meeting community needs. Already two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," have had their own looms made, patterned after our three of last year, and are working at home. Mrs. Anderson has sold many rugs and table scarfs to the hotel and its guests. Baskets have come in as never before. The attic was "running over" with them when I visited Gatlinburg in May. Workmanship has improved due to standards set by Miss Evelyn. Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors of Gatlinburg, Sevierville and Pigeon Forge. One large clinic, 46 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nose and throat, Was held in the fall resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma have been treated and cured. The childrens' teeth have improved. When necessary Miss Higinbotham, has "pulled" some. The efficiency of her committee of local women shows, as they themselves recognize, the benefit of the settlement work in the community. It is partly through the influence of the local advisory board appointed in 1919 that the men and women, quite generally, are feeling the responsibility of the school as never before. Sixty-seven acres of land, "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that we could hope to acquire for the school, 1vere purchased in the fall of 1920. A Delco plant large enough not only for the school but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel and the church, was installed. All are pleased to report ours "better than the Sevierville or Pigeon Forge lights." The second story of the Stuart cottage was floored and stairs put in to make it usable for a few boys. The old school house with a few repairs made housing for the manual training, while the former manual training quarters were transformed by means of a partition into two much-needed recitation rooms. Funds have come in well, taking into account financial conditions every-where. They have increased to meet increased needs. The land cost us $6,7oo, $1,700 of which is paid; the lighting plant, installation and housing costing near $3,000, has been entirely paid for. Several scholarships have been furnished. In many instances this last year clubs gave four times any previous year's contribution. One club, not by any means our largest, contributed more than $r,Soo. The committee has been a working committee. Melinda Stuart has given a vast amount of time to the finances ; May Keller has filed applications for teaching; Kate Miller has worked for an Endowment fund, while Mrs. Richardson has helped whenever possible in Miss Stuart's branch of work. I have made five visits to Gatlinburg since my appointment, spending eight or ten weeks there each year. Conferences on rural mountain work have been attended when possible by MiSs Bishop or myself representing the school. Melinda Stuart recently visited Gatlinburg and Kate Miller was there a year ago. I am glad to report visits from two of our national officers: Mrs. Rugg and Mrs. Nicker-son. Many other Pi Phis including Professor and Mrs. A. E. Jenks of Minnesota and Dr. and Mrs. Gault, Northwestern, have been down. Hotel guests always spend some time at the school or residents' cottage. Next year will be Emily Burton's fifth in Gatlinburg. Everyone appreciates the value of her long service. Marie Ditmars, Helen Chew, Lucy Nicholson and Phyllis Higinbotham, all, plan to carry on their splendid work of the past year. Mr. Creswell found his factory work and his classes in the school too heavy so he will be replaced by someone who can give all his time to school work. First yea* high school work has been offered the past two years, but next year we must add a second year of high school if we are to safeguard the young boys and girls who are ready for that grade of school work, becatise the children of high school age now are products of our school alone and so are ready for the advanced work at an earlier age than heretofore. One teacher will have to be added to our force for this increased high school work. Also, Mr. Creswell's place must be filled by a man giving full time with consequent increase in salary. A minimum of $6,000 should be allowed for teachers' salaries each of the two coming years. Miss Nicholson thinks she can make her weaving self-supporting during this year. She plans to make counterpanes or "kivers" popular among the weavers. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers and Ogle all have agreed to have office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office in the Ogle cottage is in readiness. Several clinics are planned when the cottage has been remodeled and equipped. REPORTS OF, OFFICERS 47 Two dormitories are needed, one for boys, the other for girls, housing fifteen or twenty each. The girls' building ought to be in readiness for this year's use, at least after Christmas. Cost of these would be approximately $15,000 each. A general water supply must come soon and a problem of sewage disposal must he met. Mr. Bliss, State Rural Engineer in Tennessee and a loyal endorser of the school, may be able to help us to a satisfactory solution of these two problems. An auditorium is desired by the community and the school needs one. This could be a building of two floors, thus furnishing more classrooms costing $5,000 to $10,000, according to its several uses. An outdoor gymnasium, practically only a floor and roof (costing perhaps $500 for material) was requested by the boys last winter, they proposing to do the work if the lumber could be furnished them. A heating plant and basement for the nurse's cottage ought to be put in next year; the basement in the school house excavated, concreted, and equipped for serving school lunches. Here, also, should be installed showers, for the boys and for the girls, which could be used also by the community. Two thousand dollars would cover the cost of excavating, flooring, plumbing and equipment and probably $x,000 would care for the basement and heating in the nurse's cottage. Minor needs are: more livestock, a few head only of course; pasture fencing; ditching and tilling; lime and phosphate for the fields; new black boards of slate; furnishings for cottages; full equipment for the nurse's cottage, the laboratory, hospital room, office and waiting-room. The $goo now on hand will barely pay for the plumbing and the immediate necessary repairs. It is apparent we need large individual gifts. There are many Pi Phis able to make them and I feel sure no better way could be found for investment in service to one's fellowmen. It would be a pleasure for every one to visit the Settlement School and realize its needs, its big usefulness and its glorious possibilities. Respectfully submitted, ABBIE B. LANGMAID.

REPORT OF THE CATALOGUER July 1918-July 1921 The Cataloguer submits the following report During the past three years the work of the Cataloguer has been augmented by the work on the mailing list for THE ARROW, formerly handled by the Alumnae Editor, and, during the past two years, by some clerical work for the fraternity. The work on the mailing list has proved to be so heavy that the original work of the cataloguer has, of necessity, been considerably neglected. The mailing; list grows with each year's new initiates to such an extent that that task alone is the work of one person, if it is kept up as it should be. The duties incident to keeping the mailing list up to date are manifold. First, there is the receiving of renewals of annual subscriptions, and an occasional life subscription, and the sending of moneys so received to the fraternity treasurer, and the checking of card and record on the galley mailing list. In addition, there are the changes to be made from the blanks sent in by individual sub-scribers, notifying of marriage or change of address, or both. Perhaps a short statement of the amount of work which each marriage, for example, involves would be of interest here. The old name has to be crossed off from the galley mailing list and the new name written in its proper place in this list,

REPORT OF THE CATALOGUER July 1918-July 1921 The Cataloguer submits the following report During the past three years the work of the Cataloguer has been augmented by the work on the mailing list for THE ARROW, formerly handled by the Alumnae Editor, and, during the past two years, by some clerical work for the fraternity. The work on the mailing list has proved to be so heavy that the original work of the cataloguer has, of necessity, been considerably neglected. The mailing; list grows with each year's new initiates to such an extent that that task alone is the work of one person, if it is kept up as it should be. The duties incident to keeping the mailing list up to date are manifold. First, there is the receiving of renewals of annual subscriptions, and an occasional life subscription, and the sending of moneys so received to the fraternity treasurer, and the checking of card and record on the galley mailing list. In addition, there are the changes to be made from the blanks sent in by individual sub-scribers, notifying of marriage or change of address, or both. Perhaps a short statement of the amount of work which each marriage, for example, involves would be of interest here. The old name has to be crossed off from the galley mailing list and the new name written in its proper place in this list,

The old name has to be crossed off from the galley mailing list and the new name written in its proper place in this list, 44 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI other annual reports of the fraternity, insure convenience, reduce expense and remove the chief cause of the inevitable delay in the appearance of the June ARROW. Our advertising rates have been doubled to meet the rising costs of production but no new advertising has been solicited. In October 1918 it was decided that the inclusion of the October Bulletin in the October number of THE ARROW was no longer practical so a regular number was issued and four regular numbers a year have since appeared. With the difficulties involved in belated issues of THE ARROW, the Bulletin has become more valuable than ever for the organization of the fraternity. The duties performed by THE ARRO\V Editor in her capacity as a member of Grand Council have been as usual many and varied. She has visited six-teen chapters officially, two others unofficially, inspected three petitioning groups, presided at the installation of New York A, assisted at the installation of Wisconsin B, attended the Editors' Conference of National Panhellenic Conference, made one visit to the Settlement School and has brought Grand Council message to the meetings of fourteen different alumna clubs. Since this report closes a period of service covering nearly a decade in the editorship, a personal word may be in order. During the past ten years your editor has watched with keenest interest the development of fraternity journal-ism as she has studied appreciatively the forty odd exchanges which came to her desk. Almost without exception they have grown in strength and increased in interest, keeping pace with the varied activities of the organizations they represent and indicating their characteristics. One of our contemporaries records the story of a wise father appealed to by a distraught daughter in the midst of a membership campaign who replied "Show me their magazines and I will make my decision as to the fraternity I would have you join." This is only one illustration of the emphasis laid upon fraternity journalism by the general reader. To him the publication represents the fraternity. Is it too much to expect that THE ARROW shall always be a translation of those ideals which are fundamental in our organization. No editor can realize this ambition alone and for her successor in office the retiring editor be-speaks the whole-hearted interest and support of the entire fraternity to the end that our magazine may always be a leader among fraternity journals. Respectfully submitted, SARAH POMEROY-RUGG. REPORT OF THE ALUMNrE EDITOR To 11 B (I) Fraternity, the Alumnae Editor submits the following report: The editorial work of the office of Alumnae Editor consists of collecting, editing and arranging alumna personals for every issue of THE ARROW, items for the department "Club Interests and Events," and the annual club reports which have been published in the June issue of THE ARROW. The alumnae club directory in the front of THE ARROW has been corrected for each issue and notices have been prepared for the Bulle in. The Alumnm Editor has also collected and edited various kinds of material for THE ARROW at the direction of THE ARROW Editor. Efforts are constantly being made to simplify, shorten and standardize the alumni personals, to give the most news in the smallest amount of space. If everyone sending in personals would be very exact and give full information it would save many unnecessary mistakes. It is very difficult to know which is correct when the same notice comes in from several different sources with no two exactly alike. The essential things in all personals are the full maiden name and husband's initials. Each year it has become more and more difficult to collect the annual club reports in time for the June ARROW. Founders' Day celebrations and the annual REPORTS OF OFFICERS 45 meetings of the clubs usually come about the time that all material must be in the hands of the printer if THE ARROW is to be issued on time. In past years printing conditions were such that it was possible to send in the club reports after Founders' Day and have them published in the June ARROW. This can no longer be done and with eighty clubs it is now impracticable to add paragraphs on Founders' Day happenings to proof, as has formerly been done. The Alumna Editor therefore recommends that after this year, the annual club reports be published in the October issue of THE ARROW. The Alumna Editor also recommends, in order to save time, space and additional cost of printing, that the class numerals following names be omitted in alumna personals and club reports. At the request of THE ARROW Editor, the Alumna! Editor has made two trips to Menasha, Wis., to confer with our publishers. As the personal representative of the Grand President two chapters were visited officially the past year. The Alumnae Editor assisted at the installation of Wisconsin B and Indiana A and visited a number of chapters and clubs since last convention. Talks on the Settlement School, illustrated with the steriopticon slides, have been given at various times and places. The slides have been in the care of the Alumnae Editor and it has been no light task to keep them making dates from coast to coast. In bringing to a close three years of work in this office, the Alumna Editor is deeply appreciative of the great privilege accorded her in the years of work and association with the retiring ARROW Editor. The work has at times been strenuous. All press work is pressure work when it must be done in a short space of time. The opportunity of keeping in personal touch with chapters, clubs and individual members more than compensates for the routine work involved in the regular duties of Alumnae Editor. Respectfully submitted, NINA H. ALLEN. REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Evelyn Bishop is completing her third year as head resident of the II B Settlement School. By her skill and knowledge of the community, its needs and limitations, she has avoided some and lightened other difficult situations. Through a sympathetic understanding of people generally she has quietly gained and held splendid cooperation from all the residents. The importance and value of this cannot be over estimated. There was added to our staff last year Lucy Nicholson, Berea, for the weaving, and Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario A, community and school nurse. Our school enrollment reached 127. High wages kept many older boys working who perhaps otherwise would have been in school. The percentage of attendance has risen steadily during the last three years. For advanced work, one of our Toys went to Athens University, preparatory department, the past year; another boy and a girl went to a North Carolina school; some to Murphy, and several to Carson Newman; one, who was persuaded to go to our school last winter after several years at "public works," went to Berea this summer. Reports come to us that these boys and girls( rank with the best in scholarship. The weaving did much towards meeting community needs. Already two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," have had their own looms made, patterned after our three of last year, and are working at home. Mrs. Anderson has sold many rugs and table scarfs to the hotel and its guests. Baskets have come in as never before. The attic was "running over" with them when I visited Gatlinburg in May. Workmanship has improved due to standards set by Miss Evelyn. Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors of Gatlinburg, Sevierville and Pigeon Forge. One large clinic, 46 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nose and throat, Was held in the fall resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma have been treated and cured. The childrens' teeth have improved. When necessary Miss Higinbotham, has "pulled" some. The efficiency of her committee of local women shows, as they themselves recognize, the benefit of the settlement work in the community. It is partly through the influence of the local advisory board appointed in 1919 that the men and women, quite generally, are feeling the responsibility of the school as never before. Sixty-seven acres of land, "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that we could hope to acquire for the school, 1vere purchased in the fall of 1920. A Delco plant large enough not only for the school but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel and the church, was installed. All are pleased to report ours "better than the Sevierville or Pigeon Forge lights." The second story of the Stuart cottage was floored and stairs put in to make it usable for a few boys. The old school house with a few repairs made housing for the manual training, while the former manual training quarters were transformed by means of a partition into two much-needed recitation rooms. Funds have come in well, taking into account financial conditions every-where. They have increased to meet increased needs. The land cost us $6,7oo, $1,700 of which is paid; the lighting plant, installation and housing costing near $3,000, has been entirely paid for. Several scholarships have been furnished. In many instances this last year clubs gave four times any previous year's contribution. One club, not by any means our largest, contributed more than $r,Soo. The committee has been a working committee. Melinda Stuart has given a vast amount of time to the finances ; May Keller has filed applications for teaching; Kate Miller has worked for an Endowment fund, while Mrs. Richardson has helped whenever possible in Miss Stuart's branch of work. I have made five visits to Gatlinburg since my appointment, spending eight or ten weeks there each year. Conferences on rural mountain work have been attended when possible by MiSs Bishop or myself representing the school. Melinda Stuart recently visited Gatlinburg and Kate Miller was there a year ago. I am glad to report visits from two of our national officers: Mrs. Rugg and Mrs. Nicker-son. Many other Pi Phis including Professor and Mrs. A. E. Jenks of Minnesota and Dr. and Mrs. Gault, Northwestern, have been down. Hotel guests always spend some time at the school or residents' cottage. Next year will be Emily Burton's fifth in Gatlinburg. Everyone appreciates the value of her long service. Marie Ditmars, Helen Chew, Lucy Nicholson and Phyllis Higinbotham, all, plan to carry on their splendid work of the past year. Mr. Creswell found his factory work and his classes in the school too heavy so he will be replaced by someone who can give all his time to school work. First yea* high school work has been offered the past two years, but next year we must add a second year of high school if we are to safeguard the young boys and girls who are ready for that grade of school work, becatise the children of high school age now are products of our school alone and so are ready for the advanced work at an earlier age than heretofore. One teacher will have to be added to our force for this increased high school work. Also, Mr. Creswell's place must be filled by a man giving full time with consequent increase in salary. A minimum of $6,000 should be allowed for teachers' salaries each of the two coming years. Miss Nicholson thinks she can make her weaving self-supporting during this year. She plans to make counterpanes or "kivers" popular among the weavers. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers and Ogle all have agreed to have office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office in the Ogle cottage is in readiness. Several clinics are planned when the cottage has been remodeled and equipped. REPORTS OF, OFFICERS 47 Two dormitories are needed, one for boys, the other for girls, housing fifteen or twenty each. The girls' building ought to be in readiness for this year's use, at least after Christmas. Cost of these would be approximately $15,000 each. A general water supply must come soon and a problem of sewage disposal must he met. Mr. Bliss, State Rural Engineer in Tennessee and a loyal endorser of the school, may be able to help us to a satisfactory solution of these two problems. An auditorium is desired by the community and the school needs one. This could be a building of two floors, thus furnishing more classrooms costing $5,000 to $10,000, according to its several uses. An outdoor gymnasium, practically only a floor and roof (costing perhaps $500 for material) was requested by the boys last winter, they proposing to do the work if the lumber could be furnished them. A heating plant and basement for the nurse's cottage ought to be put in next year; the basement in the school house excavated, concreted, and equipped for serving school lunches. Here, also, should be installed showers, for the boys and for the girls, which could be used also by the community. Two thousand dollars would cover the cost of excavating, flooring, plumbing and equipment and probably $x,000 would care for the basement and heating in the nurse's cottage. Minor needs are: more livestock, a few head only of course; pasture fencing; ditching and tilling; lime and phosphate for the fields; new black boards of slate; furnishings for cottages; full equipment for the nurse's cottage, the laboratory, hospital room, office and waiting-room. The $goo now on hand will barely pay for the plumbing and the immediate necessary repairs. It is apparent we need large individual gifts. There are many Pi Phis able to make them and I feel sure no better way could be found for investment in service to one's fellowmen. It would be a pleasure for every one to visit the Settlement School and realize its needs, its big usefulness and its glorious possibilities. Respectfully submitted, ABBIE B. LANGMAID.

STUART, Treasurer. REPORT OF THE CATALOGUER July 1918-July 1921 The Cataloguer submits the following report During the past three years the work of the Cataloguer has been augmented by the work on the mailing list for THE ARROW, formerly handled by the Alumnae Editor, and, during the past two years, by some clerical work for the fraternity. The work on the mailing list has proved to be so heavy that the original work of the cataloguer has, of necessity, been considerably neglected. The mailing; list grows with each year's new initiates to such an extent that that task alone is the work of one person, if it is kept up as it should be. The duties incident to keeping the mailing list up to date are manifold. First, there is the receiving of renewals of annual subscriptions, and an occasional life subscription, and the sending of moneys so received to the fraternity treasurer, and the checking of card and record on the galley mailing list. In addition, there are the changes to be made from the blanks sent in by individual sub-scribers, notifying of marriage or change of address, or both. Perhaps a short statement of the amount of work which each marriage, for example, involves would be of interest here. The old name has to be crossed off from the galley mailing list and the new name written in its proper place in this list,
