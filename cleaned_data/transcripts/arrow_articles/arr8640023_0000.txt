        "Best Dressed" Makes Own Clothes ANN FONCANNON, with her long blond-tobrown hair swinging behind her, was recently notified that she is one of Glamour's Top Ten Best Dressed. Ann, a journalism junior, feels that clothes are important the right kind and the right fit. Her sisters often find her sitting on her bed in belled jeans and a work shirt, making just that type of clothes. Her clothes are made to flatter her legs, which she feels are too long, and her vivacious always-on-the-move personality. She wears minis, findings little room in her closet for the midi, "because they look so terrible." She modeled her latest creation, a backless sundress made from her old bed spread, at the university's recent open House Fashion Show. This is just one of many activities she'll encounter in her year as one of the best dressed. Ann isn't all clothes. Through her work on the K-State Collegian, she became actively involved in the pollution campaign on campus. She planned an Environmental Teach-In in con-junction with the university's Environmental Awareness Week. She also became interested in the problem of urbanization and, as a result, took a seminar by MARSHA MARTIN Kansas Beta that conducted a thorough study of Manhattan, Kansas. Ann also enjoys small craft work and has made plaques and key chains for many of her sisters. In addition, she's been our fashion consultant and is truly deserving of her title.

That night we slept on the edge of an unused paved road, with four of us sleeping in the car because of threatened rain. The other two slept outside with the wind whistling around and bats skeeking over their heads. We went looking for adventure and we found more than we ever expected. But we are already trying to figure out where we will go next time. ATTENTION SEPTEMBER 15 is the deadline for the Winter, 1970, issue of The ARROW. Information must reach the editor by that date.

Katherine was chairman of their successful Arrowcraft sale held at the Urbana-Lincoln Hotel, and Boots, as general sales chairman, is responsible for sales at her home during the year. These enthusiastic Pi Phis spent several days in Gatlinburg shopping at the Arrowcraft Shop, touring Arrowmont, and visiting with some ofthe craftsmen in the area. Boots and Katherine returned home with a station wagon full of items they had personally selected, and with a greater appreciation of the craftsmanship that went into the hand-made products.

She will return in September to Dacca, East Pakistan, where she will teach crafts in the home economics department of the university there. Shaheda Khanam concentrates on her textile design. Shaheda is the third of her countrymen to at-tend Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. She came to this country with the aid of the Ford Foundation. Through a grant she first came to the United States last winter, and spent a quarter at the University of Oklahoma. From there she went to the University of Tennessee home economics department, where she is currently working toward her Masters in Crafts. It was as a graduate student at U.T. that Shaheda went to Arrowmont last summer to en-roll in enameling and textile design courses. In June Shaheda returns to Arrowmont to spend the entire summer. In addition to the invaluable knowledge she has received from her courses, she thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity of being with the other students. Shaheda speaks most fondly of her summer at Arrowmont as "one of the happiest times" she has spent in this country. She especially loved the mountains and the friendliness of the people. She valuesthe first hand experience of getting to know Americans of all ages and backgrounds through living, working, and studying together. Likewise the faculty and students enjoyed getting to know her. She brightened the dining room of the Staff House as she came into break-fast every morning wearing her colorful saris. All the students and teachers anticipated Shaheda's personal "fashion show." In addition to the numerous saris she brought from Pakistan, she silk screened and block printed several more while there at Arrowmont. As a part of her graduate work, Shaheda is writing her thesis, titled "Exploring the New Uses of Jute in Several Craft Media." Jute, a fiber obtained from plants, is presently used chiefly in sacking, burlap, and twine. This fibrous material is one of the leading natural products of Pakistan. Through her studies Shaheda hopes to find additional uses for this product, thereby increasing the possibilities for exports. This in turn would aid her countrymen economically.
