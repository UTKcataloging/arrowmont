"Each fall and spring a caravan )f cars and station wagons, loaded to no-visibility from any window, leaves Albuquerque and [rives into the Indian country some 40 miles away. Through one of the alumnae, whose family vas known there years ago, we rent a "fair weather" dance hall for the afternoon. This dance call is centrally located between two pueblos. There has been advance publicity about the Pi Phi -Linarnage Sale, and so, when we all arrive, they are there. Some fathers, many mothers with their )abies supported on their backs with their blankets, some in papoose fashion. The people are .ppreciative and we are dead tired but terribly thankful to be able to bring to these nice people [sable goods at a minimum cost. At first, the Indians bought junk first and necessities later. Now, hey rush for blankets, rugs and children's clothing. Then they look at clothes for themselves."
