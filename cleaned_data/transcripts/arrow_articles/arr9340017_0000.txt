        16 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI iarize new students with the campus, served as discussion group leaders, and provided entertainment for students and parents. Louisiana Beta Debbie Warner has been named outstanding L.S.U. Student, and received the Southeastern Life Methods Scholarship at the Leadership Convention in Dallas. Texas Beta Libby Francis attended the Northern Hemisphere World Championships, a sailing regatta held the first week in April. The regatta was held in New Orleans and drew sailors from all over the world. Mississippi Beta Bridget Schmitz is recipient, for the second consecutive year, of the Taylor Medal, the highest scholastic award given by the University of Mississippi. Bridget has been on the President's List seven consecutive semesters and was graduated in May with a 3.97 GPA! California Delta On Valentine's Day, while the Kappas were gathering for their Monday night dinner, the Pi Phis kidnapped them for a delicious dinner at the chapter house. Amid red and white decorations, both groups enjoyed the unexpected opportunity to share each other's company. Kansas Alpha Maureen Hanks has been awarded the Watkins-Berger scholarship by the University. The award is considered to be the highest under-graduate academic honor the University can bestow on a Kansas high school graduate. Pledges Surprise, Delight With Gift by KATHY TOMSYCK, South Carolina Beta When South Carolina Beta's fall pledge class proposed their pledge class project, they didn't stop at anything halfway. When it was suggested that they try to choose something which reflected part of themselves rather than an item which flashed a mere dollar sign, they put out their heart and souls. I know. I was their pledge trainer. It just so happened that our pledge meetings were held in our chapter room. Being so newly founded we hadn't had a chance to start decorating the room and so the pledges' prospects for a project were plentiful. On December 2nd, Pi Phi had its first annual Christmas party. The pledges had just finished announcing the winners of a baby picture contest which they sponsored, when Sabra Russel, pledge class president, presented the sisters with a beautiful rug to be hung in our chapter room. It was designed by Kathy Jennette with a burgundy background and light blue letters. The angel shone in white and the arrow in yellow. The sisters received this rug with great surprise, appreciation, and a big, big round of applause. !

Eleanor Bushnell Lehner Florida Beta (Photo by Donald Scott Harter) 17 Retirement Marks End of An Era Marian G. Heard, Director of Arrowmont since its inception, head of the Settlement School craft program for more than 30 years, and professor in the Department of Crafts, Interior Design and Housing, College of Home Economics, at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn., since 1936, will retire August 31 from both of those posts. For Arrowmont and Pi Beta Phi, Miss Heard's retirement marks the end of an era in which Arrowmont saw both its beginning and development take place under her direction. She has guided the activities of the summer craft workshop program since its inception in 1945. Under Miss Heard's guidance, a realistic working relationship has developed between the University of Tennessee and Pi Beta Phi whereby Arrowmont students can earn UT credit for their work in the crafts school. It was through her vision and leadership that the Arrowmont School is internationally famous today. The school reaches out not only to educators, craftspersons, and students from all over the world, but it has made a significant contribution to the economy and educational advancement of the Gatlinburg area. Miss Heard has been an inspiring teacher to her students through her sincere interest in them and through her personal philosophy. She has the understanding of and the ability to relate to people of all age groups and back-grounds. She is able to communicate to others how the crafts world can enrich their lives, and she has a genuine compassion for people everywhere. Having distinguished herself in the fields of art, crafts and interior design, her many professional affiliations and awards attest to the esteem in which she is held throughout the academic circles. The Trustees of Teachers College, Columbia University, awarded her a Distinguished Service Medal in 1976 in recognition of her out-standing contributions to art, education, and public service. At the University of Tennessee she was honored as the Alumni Distinguished Professor in 1971. And in 1974, she was the recipient of the Tennessee Women Award. In addition to the dual career from which she is retiring, Miss Heard in recent years has served as chairman of the Tennessee Crafts Advisory Committee of the Tennessee Arts Commission, chairman of the Tennessee Craft Workshop and Conference, program chairman for the Environmental Craft Work-shop and Conference, and-co-chairman of the National Art Education Workshop in Crafts. Among her many accomplishments in a most active career were the introduction of crafts in the curriculum at UT; the organization and direction of the Craft Education Program for the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild; planning and establishment of the first Craftsman's Fair; the direction of a craft survey of 11 southern states for the Rockefeller Foundation which resulted in grants being awarded to UT and the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild. The Ford Foundation sent her to Pakistan to help set up a crafts program at the college level and to help build an organization for the craftsmen of Pakistan. She has held offices in the following organizations: Pi Beta Phi (Miss Heard was initiated into membership at the Miami converntion in 1954 and is a member of Tennessee Gamma), Phi Kappa Phi, American Crafts Council, American Home Economics Association, National Art Education Association. American Association of University Professors, World Crafts Council, Southern High-land Handicraft Guild, Piedmont Southeast Crafts Council, Southeastern Art Education Association. Tennessee Artist-Craftsman's Association, Southeast Section of American Crafts Council, East Tennessee Art Education Association, the Board of Trustees of the National Crafts Council, and Arrowmont Board of Governors. A graduate of Alfred University, Alfred, N.Y., where she earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Ceramic Design, Miss Heard furthered her formal education at Columbia University Teachers College, New York City, N.Y., where she received a Master of Arts degree in Fine and Applied Arts. Her retirement in her home in Knoxville most certainly will be a busy one. She is a Pi Phi and all of us who wear the Arrow are indebted to Marian G. Heard for the lifetime of service she has given in our be-half. 18 Ray Pierotti Is Named Director of Arrowmont Grand Council of Pi Beta Phi has appointed Mr. Ray Pierotti as new Director of Arrowmont School of Crafts effective September 1.

His career in New York City has included serving as Administrative Assistant at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts of the American Crafts Council; instructor in the School of Visual Arts, Department of Graphic Design; Director of the Kipsbay Gallery; department head and instructor, Franklin Private School. Arrowmont's new director was academic ad-visor, The Experiment in International Living, Putney, Vt., and taught French Language and Literature at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, while completing his master's. A graduate of the University of Utah where he earned Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music and Master of Music degrees, he also received a Certificate de la Langue Francaise from the University of Paris where he studied from 1958 to 1960. His honorary appointments include: Board of Directors, Citizens for Artists Housing, New York City; Board of Directors, International Art Registry, Ltd.; Board of Directors, the Participation Project Foundation, Inc.; Advisory Board, Mary Duke Biddle Gallery for the Blind and Sighted, Raleigh, N.C.; Vice President, New York chapter of the University of Utah Alumni Association; past president of the New York Experiment in International Living Alumni Association.

Mr. Pierotti has had numerous magazine articles and musical compositions published. As Director of Arrowmont he also will be an associate professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in the Department of Crafts, Interior Design and Housing, College of Home Economics. 19 "You Must Be Proud To Be A Pi Phi" by B.O.G. CO-CHAIRMAN SARAH "SIS" MULLIS (Ed. note: "Sis" Mullis attended Arrowmont as a student in the summer of 1976.) This comment did not come from another sorority woman or from anyone associated with the fraternity system. These were the words of an Arrowmont student who knew nothing of Pi Beta Phi except that we owned the craft school she was attending. Students Martin Mueller, from Chile, and "Sis" Mullis, BOG co-chairman, (1 to r), observe as their instructor, Al Anderson, demonstrates the fine points of filing in jewelry class at Arrowmont. Anderson also is an assistant professor of metalcraft, Pennsylvania State University. Last July I was enrolled in a beginning jewelry class at Arrowmont and was attempting to be just another student. Purposely, I had asked Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, not to introduce me as a Board of Governors member. I wanted to be a student like every-one else, to be a part of my class, and to be able to listen to their comments, good and bad, about Arrowmont. I did not even tell my newly found friends who worked at the same table with me that I was a Pi Phi. My "cover was blown," however, through an innocent series of greetings by Janie, one of our hard working maids, and Ernie, one of our ever smiling maintenance men, and other BOG members present that week who insisted on taking my picture while I was in class. Fellow students knew this was my first time to take a course at Arrowmont, so one asked how I knew so many people. I told her that I some-times came to meetings in Gatlinburg. Then she asked if I was a Pi Phi, and I answered in the affirmative. She put down the piece of jewelry on which she was working, thought a minute, and said, "You must be very proud to be a Pi Phi." I replied that, yes, I always had been, but that I was especially so that week. I have one regret about attending Arrowmont that I did not go sooner. Others had told me about the feeling of oneness of the students, about the total dedication of the instructors, about the "Arrowmont Experience." I have heard convention speakers talk of the "Arrowmont Experience," Marian Heard describe it, but there is no way to put a feeling like that into words there is no substitute for BEING there and BEING a part of it. As a hospital pharmacist I normally spend my days filling prescriptions, not filing metals. I am living proof that someone with no art background and no craft experience can go to Arrowmont. (My instructor would corroborate this, if needed.) I would not say it was easy; it was just as I had been told. I was in class from morning till night. I was in class though be-cause I wanted to be. To "get away from it all," I usually take skiing vacations but my week at Arrowmont served the same purpose. The commitment and involvement you feel toward your class and your project totally engulfs you for the days you are there. If you want to find a new source of pride in Pi Beta Phi attend Arrowmont School of Crafts. Others can tell you what a tremendous school we have, but believe me, there is NO comparison to being there. There is NO comparison to experiencing Arrowmont your-self. Arrowcraft Shop expansion was under construction during the winter months. Moving the weaving department and bookkeeping office into the new facility was scheduled this May. Formal dedication is planned for the fall. 13.'7 est enefits Arrowmont "In Pasadena, Edith enjoyed gardening, housekeeping, being able to entertain friends, belonging to the Shakespeare Club, and being a member of Pi Beta Phi Alumnae Club. . . ." With these words, Edith I. Cooper's sister Edna partially explained the love for her Fraternity that prompted Edith to bequest $100,000 to Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. Both Edith and Edna, and an older sister Carrie, were members of Indiana Gamma. Edith served as president of her chapter and was delegate to the Berkeley Convention in 1915. In college, she majored in English Literature, and taught three years in Indiana before joining Edna in 1919 in Sheridan, Wyoming. From that time on, the two sisters lived together and shared their experiences. Miss Edith enjoyed the western life very much, according to her sister. Her life revolved around the friendly people, the good school in which she taught, and weekend trips to nearby mountains, sometimes on horseback into more remote areas. She particularly loved the spring when lovely flowers covered the hillsides. In 1924 she moved to Long Beach, Calif., and taught in Los Angeles. In 1941 Edith and Edna bought a home in Pasadena where theylived until 1963. During that time they were both loyal, active members of the Pasadena Alumnae Club. Even after they moved to a retirement home in Pomona, Calif., they continued to be dues paying members of the club, and were listed in its roster. Miss Edna called them "a wonderful group of women whose friendship has continued, even from a distance." During her active life, Edith particularly enjoyed traveling, having spent several summers in the Pacific Northwest, as well as journeying to Alaska, Hawaii, through the Panama Canal to New York with side excursions along the way, and two trips to Europe. Edith passed away March 5, 1975. Over the years, and especially after her retirement, Edith enjoyed careful study of business trends and investments. She was quite conservative, according to Edna, and liked to know the history of stock, its appeal to public acceptance, the popularity of its product, etc. The principal of her gift to Arrowmont will be invested, with the income from the investments being used as a constant memorial to Edith I. Cooper's love for Pi Beta Phi. In acknowledging the gift, Grand President Elizabeth Orr stated, ". . . though we some-times feel progress has been slow [at Arrowmont,] it has not been when you realize Pi Phi is the only sorority having a solely financed philanthropy. Our alumnae have made this possible and sometime in the future we hope to realize our dream of a year-round school. The Edith Cooper bequest brings this dream ever closer to reality." Tribute To A Friend by CONSTANCE FEGLES ADAMS, Minneapolis A. C. Mildred Ozias was the youngest daughter of the first principal of Minneapolis West High School. After studying at the University of Minnesota, where she was a member of Minnesota Alpha, she continued her education in Europe. Her major interest was music, as she was a gifted singer. While in Berlin, Mildred met a fellow American, Dr. Bern de Vries, a young practicing orthodontist and student. After her return to Minneapolis, Mildred sang professionally for ten years. Prior to her marriage to Dr. de Vries, "Mid" was unaccustomed to sports or an out-door life, but she was introduced to hunting and fishing by her young husband. Sheenjoyed participation in these activities, becoming an ardent fisherman and a proficient shot. Mildred de Vries loved life and kept in close touch with friends. Her commitment to Pi Beta Phi remained strong, true, and active throughout her life. When she died in 1970, the loss was felt by many who had known and loved this talented and colorful lady. Soon after Mildred's death, her husband established a scholarship fund for the use of Minnesota Alpha Pi Phis who were facing financial hardship and who could not continue active Fraternity membership without tempo (Continued on page 86) 21

With these words, Edith I. Cooper's sister Edna partially explained the love for her Fraternity that prompted Edith to bequest $100,000 to Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. Both Edith and Edna, and an older sister Carrie, were members of Indiana Gamma. Edith served as president of her chapter and was delegate to the Berkeley Convention in 1915. In college, she majored in English Literature, and taught three years in Indiana before joining Edna in 1919 in Sheridan, Wyoming. From that time on, the two sisters lived together and shared their experiences. Miss Edith enjoyed the western life very much, according to her sister. Her life revolved around the friendly people, the good school in which she taught, and weekend trips to nearby mountains, sometimes on horseback into more remote areas. She particularly loved the spring when lovely flowers covered the hillsides. In 1924 she moved to Long Beach, Calif., and taught in Los Angeles. In 1941 Edith and Edna bought a home in Pasadena where theylived until 1963. During that time they were both loyal, active members of the Pasadena Alumnae Club. Even after they moved to a retirement home in Pomona, Calif., they continued to be dues paying members of the club, and were listed in its roster. Miss Edna called them "a wonderful group of women whose friendship has continued, even from a distance." During her active life, Edith particularly enjoyed traveling, having spent several summers in the Pacific Northwest, as well as journeying to Alaska, Hawaii, through the Panama Canal to New York with side excursions along the way, and two trips to Europe. Edith passed away March 5, 1975. Over the years, and especially after her retirement, Edith enjoyed careful study of business trends and investments. She was quite conservative, according to Edna, and liked to know the history of stock, its appeal to public acceptance, the popularity of its product, etc. The principal of her gift to Arrowmont will be invested, with the income from the investments being used as a constant memorial to Edith I. Cooper's love for Pi Beta Phi. In acknowledging the gift, Grand President Elizabeth Orr stated, ". . . though we some-times feel progress has been slow [at Arrowmont,] it has not been when you realize Pi Phi is the only sorority having a solely financed philanthropy. Our alumnae have made this possible and sometime in the future we hope to realize our dream of a year-round school. The Edith Cooper bequest brings this dream ever closer to reality." Tribute To A Friend by CONSTANCE FEGLES ADAMS, Minneapolis A. C. Mildred Ozias was the youngest daughter of the first principal of Minneapolis West High School. After studying at the University of Minnesota, where she was a member of Minnesota Alpha, she continued her education in Europe. Her major interest was music, as she was a gifted singer. While in Berlin, Mildred met a fellow American, Dr. Bern de Vries, a young practicing orthodontist and student. After her return to Minneapolis, Mildred sang professionally for ten years. Prior to her marriage to Dr. de Vries, "Mid" was unaccustomed to sports or an out-door life, but she was introduced to hunting and fishing by her young husband. Sheenjoyed participation in these activities, becoming an ardent fisherman and a proficient shot. Mildred de Vries loved life and kept in close touch with friends. Her commitment to Pi Beta Phi remained strong, true, and active throughout her life. When she died in 1970, the loss was felt by many who had known and loved this talented and colorful lady. Soon after Mildred's death, her husband established a scholarship fund for the use of Minnesota Alpha Pi Phis who were facing financial hardship and who could not continue active Fraternity membership without tempo (Continued on page 86) 21 16 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI iarize new students with the campus, served as discussion group leaders, and provided entertainment for students and parents.

Amid red and white decorations, both groups enjoyed the unexpected opportunity to share each other's company. Kansas Alpha Maureen Hanks has been awarded the Watkins-Berger scholarship by the University. The award is considered to be the highest under-graduate academic honor the University can bestow on a Kansas high school graduate. Pledges Surprise, Delight With Gift by KATHY TOMSYCK, South Carolina Beta When South Carolina Beta's fall pledge class proposed their pledge class project, they didn't stop at anything halfway. When it was suggested that they try to choose something which reflected part of themselves rather than an item which flashed a mere dollar sign, they put out their heart and souls. I know. I was their pledge trainer. It just so happened that our pledge meetings were held in our chapter room. Being so newly founded we hadn't had a chance to start decorating the room and so the pledges' prospects for a project were plentiful. On December 2nd, Pi Phi had its first annual Christmas party. The pledges had just finished announcing the winners of a baby picture contest which they sponsored, when Sabra Russel, pledge class president, presented the sisters with a beautiful rug to be hung in our chapter room. It was designed by Kathy Jennette with a burgundy background and light blue letters. The angel shone in white and the arrow in yellow. The sisters received this rug with great surprise, appreciation, and a big, big round of applause. !

Eleanor Bushnell Lehner Florida Beta (Photo by Donald Scott Harter) 17 Retirement Marks End of An Era Marian G. Heard, Director of Arrowmont since its inception, head of the Settlement School craft program for more than 30 years, and professor in the Department of Crafts, Interior Design and Housing, College of Home Economics, at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn., since 1936, will retire August 31 from both of those posts. For Arrowmont and Pi Beta Phi, Miss Heard's retirement marks the end of an era in which Arrowmont saw both its beginning and development take place under her direction. She has guided the activities of the summer craft workshop program since its inception in 1945. Under Miss Heard's guidance, a realistic working relationship has developed between the University of Tennessee and Pi Beta Phi whereby Arrowmont students can earn UT credit for their work in the crafts school. It was through her vision and leadership that the Arrowmont School is internationally famous today. The school reaches out not only to educators, craftspersons, and students from all over the world, but it has made a significant contribution to the economy and educational advancement of the Gatlinburg area. Miss Heard has been an inspiring teacher to her students through her sincere interest in them and through her personal philosophy. She has the understanding of and the ability to relate to people of all age groups and back-grounds. She is able to communicate to others how the crafts world can enrich their lives, and she has a genuine compassion for people everywhere. Having distinguished herself in the fields of art, crafts and interior design, her many professional affiliations and awards attest to the esteem in which she is held throughout the academic circles. The Trustees of Teachers College, Columbia University, awarded her a Distinguished Service Medal in 1976 in recognition of her out-standing contributions to art, education, and public service. At the University of Tennessee she was honored as the Alumni Distinguished Professor in 1971. And in 1974, she was the recipient of the Tennessee Women Award. In addition to the dual career from which she is retiring, Miss Heard in recent years has served as chairman of the Tennessee Crafts Advisory Committee of the Tennessee Arts Commission, chairman of the Tennessee Craft Workshop and Conference, program chairman for the Environmental Craft Work-shop and Conference, and-co-chairman of the National Art Education Workshop in Crafts. Among her many accomplishments in a most active career were the introduction of crafts in the curriculum at UT; the organization and direction of the Craft Education Program for the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild; planning and establishment of the first Craftsman's Fair; the direction of a craft survey of 11 southern states for the Rockefeller Foundation which resulted in grants being awarded to UT and the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild. The Ford Foundation sent her to Pakistan to help set up a crafts program at the college level and to help build an organization for the craftsmen of Pakistan. She has held offices in the following organizations: Pi Beta Phi (Miss Heard was initiated into membership at the Miami converntion in 1954 and is a member of Tennessee Gamma), Phi Kappa Phi, American Crafts Council, American Home Economics Association, National Art Education Association. American Association of University Professors, World Crafts Council, Southern High-land Handicraft Guild, Piedmont Southeast Crafts Council, Southeastern Art Education Association. Tennessee Artist-Craftsman's Association, Southeast Section of American Crafts Council, East Tennessee Art Education Association, the Board of Trustees of the National Crafts Council, and Arrowmont Board of Governors. A graduate of Alfred University, Alfred, N.Y., where she earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Ceramic Design, Miss Heard furthered her formal education at Columbia University Teachers College, New York City, N.Y., where she received a Master of Arts degree in Fine and Applied Arts. Her retirement in her home in Knoxville most certainly will be a busy one. She is a Pi Phi and all of us who wear the Arrow are indebted to Marian G. Heard for the lifetime of service she has given in our be-half. 18 Ray Pierotti Is Named Director of Arrowmont Grand Council of Pi Beta Phi has appointed Mr. Ray Pierotti as new Director of Arrowmont School of Crafts effective September 1.

CO-CHAIRMAN SARAH "SIS" MULLIS (Ed. note: "Sis" Mullis attended Arrowmont as a student in the summer of 1976.) This comment did not come from another sorority woman or from anyone associated with the fraternity system. These were the words of an Arrowmont student who knew nothing of Pi Beta Phi except that we owned the craft school she was attending. Students Martin Mueller, from Chile, and "Sis" Mullis, BOG co-chairman, (1 to r), observe as their instructor, Al Anderson, demonstrates the fine points of filing in jewelry class at Arrowmont. Anderson also is an assistant professor of metalcraft, Pennsylvania State University. Last July I was enrolled in a beginning jewelry class at Arrowmont and was attempting to be just another student. Purposely, I had asked Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, not to introduce me as a Board of Governors member. I wanted to be a student like every-one else, to be a part of my class, and to be able to listen to their comments, good and bad, about Arrowmont. I did not even tell my newly found friends who worked at the same table with me that I was a Pi Phi. My "cover was blown," however, through an innocent series of greetings by Janie, one of our hard working maids, and Ernie, one of our ever smiling maintenance men, and other BOG members present that week who insisted on taking my picture while I was in class. Fellow students knew this was my first time to take a course at Arrowmont, so one asked how I knew so many people. I told her that I some-times came to meetings in Gatlinburg. Then she asked if I was a Pi Phi, and I answered in the affirmative. She put down the piece of jewelry on which she was working, thought a minute, and said, "You must be very proud to be a Pi Phi." I replied that, yes, I always had been, but that I was especially so that week. I have one regret about attending Arrowmont that I did not go sooner. Others had told me about the feeling of oneness of the students, about the total dedication of the instructors, about the "Arrowmont Experience." I have heard convention speakers talk of the "Arrowmont Experience," Marian Heard describe it, but there is no way to put a feeling like that into words there is no substitute for BEING there and BEING a part of it. As a hospital pharmacist I normally spend my days filling prescriptions, not filing metals. I am living proof that someone with no art background and no craft experience can go to Arrowmont. (My instructor would corroborate this, if needed.) I would not say it was easy; it was just as I had been told. I was in class from morning till night. I was in class though be-cause I wanted to be. To "get away from it all," I usually take skiing vacations but my week at Arrowmont served the same purpose. The commitment and involvement you feel toward your class and your project totally engulfs you for the days you are there. If you want to find a new source of pride in Pi Beta Phi attend Arrowmont School of Crafts. Others can tell you what a tremendous school we have, but believe me, there is NO comparison to being there. There is NO comparison to experiencing Arrowmont your-self. Arrowcraft Shop expansion was under construction during the winter months. Moving the weaving department and bookkeeping office into the new facility was scheduled this May.
