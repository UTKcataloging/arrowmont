        344 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the little tots, and busy promoting the work among the other Kappa organizations. Mrs. Vernon Kellogg, wife of Prof. Vernon Lyman Kellogg of the Entomology Department of Stanford University, is a member of Eta Chapter of I' 4) B. She was appointed the only American woman member of the commission for the Relief of Belgium and spent the last six months of 1916 in Belgium where her husband was in charge of the chief office of the commission on the field, at Brussels. Gamma Phis everywhere are endeavoring to increase the fund for Belgian relief by the sale of Mrs. Kellogg's book, a, press notice of which follows: Among the many thousands of war books that have been written since this world war began, probably the volume entitled Women of Belgium, Turning Tragedy to Triumph embodies the intensest human interest, the profound est pathos. It has just been published by the Funk and Wagnalls Company as a labor of love and philanthropy. All profits accruing from its sales go to the Commission forRelief in Belgium. The only American woman member of that Commission wrote the book Mrs. Charlotte Kellogg after spending eight months on Belgian soil; and her strong sympathy, her unfailing appreciation, intensify the literary charm of its pages. Learning how these women have labored, in their mothering of smitten millions, we get from this book side-lights upon the effects of the wan Richmond Times Despatch. Florence M. Marshall, the newly created head of the .Woman's Bureau of the Red Cross, is also a member of I' B, belonging to Delta Chapter. Another war book of unusual interest is entitled Short Rations, an American Woman in Germany, 1915-16. The author is Madeleine Z. Doty, A 0 II. Says the Christian Endeavor World of this book: Miss Doty went with the intention of finding out, if she could, where the common people of Germany stand in regard to war and peace, and also whether the food shortage is serious. She had difficulty in finding Germany's poor at all, not because there are no poor, but because official Germany, as she says, denies and hides them. Nevertheless, Miss Doty found them, and tells the story of their suffering. She is indignant at the efficient inefficiency of officialdom, the everlasting red tape, and the lack of understanding of human nature. One begins as one reads to get an idea of the wide-spread under-feeding that is endured with patient heroism. Miss Doty believes that the patience of the hungry people may turn to fury at any time. She foresaw the likelihood of a renewal of submarine ruthlessness. She intimates that there will probably be great changes in Germany when the men get back from the front and learn what their women folk have had to endure. In the mean-while the women suffer, are sick of the war, gagged, but yearning for peace that does not come. The book is interesting as a first-hand record of an eye-witness whose good name is a guaranty for its truthfulness. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 345 Mrs. Grace Humiston, the lawyer who solved the murder of Ruth Kruger after police efforts had failed, is a member of Nu Chap-ter of A 0 II. Mrs. Humiston has gained considerable publicity lately for her activities connected with social conditions near certain army camps. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON We have been very busy at Little Pigeon since the December ARROW getting a chapter of Red Cross organized, and still busier when we finally, in December, became a branch of the Sevierville chapter. While we, the teachers, were home for the Christmas holidays, Mrs. Ball, Iowa B, ex-'76 of Iowa City, our house guest, and Mrs. Platt, our chaperon, completed the organization and we returned to find a chapter of twenty-three ready and eager to begin work. It stirred our patriotism as few sights could have when we first descried the Red Cross cards in the windows of the little cabins on the mountain side. One cabin, which had no windows, displayed the card on the door. Mrs. Steve Whaley, a mountain. woman, was elected chairman, and a wise selection it has proved to be. Our materials came early in January and were distributed at a meeting at the cottage Saturday, J'anuary 19. The first yarn was for sweaters. They were a novelty to the people here and while they were responsive enough in undertaking to make them, it is in knitting socks where our chapter will make its record. You see it was not until very recently that the mountaineers knew what a machine-made sock looked like. Men, women, and children all took a hand with the needles, and the best part of it is, they were unknowingly making socks with the Kitchener toe. . When the weather "fairs up" Miss Nancy Ogle and Lucinda Husky are to begin spinning for us, and we are hoping to get enough interested to spin wool for all of the Sevier county chapters. In a patriotic undertaking, they would at the same time be able to make a neat little profit at the market price of yarn. Possibly you will be interested to know the names of the charter members. They are: Mrs. Stephen Whaley, Miss Mattie Ogle, Miss Josie Trentham, Mrs. H. S. Platt, Miss Little Reagan, Miss Arena Cardell, Mrs. C. C. Reagan, Mrs. Geo. W. Ball, Mrs..Tom McCarter, Mrs. Norman Prickett, Miss Nell Williams, Mrs. Brown, Miss Emma 346 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Maples, Mrs. J. V. Husky, Mrs. Marton Cabe, Mrs. George Ogle, Mrs. Annie Ogle, Mrs. Nick Husky, Mrs. Andy Huff, Mrs. E. L. Brown, Miss May Montgomery, Miss Ruth Meacham, Andy Huff. Meetings are held in the community room at the cottage Saturday afternoons. Most of the actual work is done in the homes, but soon the school children will be given special instructions and the sewing hour will be devoted to war work. They are bubbling over with enthusiasm and simply will not be denied. Of course our real center of interest lies in the boys from the "Burg" who are in service: Often a mother brings a letter from her boy and reads it at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father holds the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gives them the latest from the front. Most of these letters are intensely interesting. The liberal education of army life the boys who enjoyed no advantages and who "never seed over the mountains" suddenly entered into was enough to sweep them off their feet. Sometimes their impressions of the outside world are amusingly original, others show a remarkable sense of proportions. December, 14, 1917, Camp Devens, Ayer, Mass., c/o 307th Bakery Co. Dear Home/elks: As I havn't heard from you for some time I'll write again. I have been sick but not very bad for three days. I have just been lying around doing nothing. I am better now. I went to Boston last Saturday and I had a very nice time. *Miss Bertha Carr was up here at camp Friday before I went down there. She and another woman friend of hers took dinner with me. She met me at the depot in Boston and we went up to Bunker Hill monument, where one of the great battles of the Revolutionary War was fought. It is in the center of Charleston and is only a small hill. There is only a small vacant lot around the monument. The monument is a very large one. I was rather dissapointed with it. We went through some of the largest stores in Boston. One of them, with one in Chicago and another in New York, is used as an example for the United States. They were sure some stores, too. We went through the Boston Common Park ; it would be beautiful in the summer time. We went to the home of one of Bertha's friends nine miles from Boston and spent the night. They were very nice people. The girl there was q. Pi Phi also. Sunday we took a ferry boat across the harbor to Winthrop. The harbor is about a mile wide. Winthrop is eleven miles from Boston. I saw several forts defending the harbor and some ships. One was loading up to go to Halifax with relief. We went on out to the ocean then. It was low tide *Secretary of Boston Alumnae Club. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 347 but it was quite a show at that. The wind was blowing quite a bit and the waves were a show to me. We came back and went on a subway car to Cambridge, a suburb of Boston, and went around among the buildings of Harvard College. There are a lot of them and some of them are large ones, too. Longfellow's 'old home is at Cambridge but I didn't see it. It snowed last night, so there are about twelve inches of snow on the ground and drifted much deeper in places. I hope we will be sent south for the winter and there is a possibility of such a thing. What is being planned for Christmas at Gatlinburg? How are all the children getting along? Write me again soon, Yours, RICHARD CARR. All the boys at the front have spoken with appreciation of their adoption by Pi Phi clubs. Quoting from a letter from Minniz Ogle, Ft. Oglethorpe, Ga.; "Have I told you of my new Pi Phi correspondent, Miss Brown, in the University of Minneapolis, Minnesota? I received a swell Thanksgiving box from her. Believe me it was sure nice. She tells me that the girls there are planning to send me a knitted outfit for a Christmas present. 0, G won't that be great? She tells me of many wonderful things of the Pi Phis." And another time, "I just received a long letter from Miss Plank. True friends like that mean more in the army than riches." There are nine boys in service MINNIZ OGLE from Gatlinburg whom w e Ft. Oglethorpe, Ga. claim as "ours." They are Elmer Ogle, Elder Ogle, Elmer Watson, Richard Carr, Minniz Ogle, Dallard Ownby, Eli Watson, Eli Wilson, and Sam Ogle. Shortly after the holidays, at a partiotic rally, we raised a service flag for them, which now hangs over El.mER OGLE the fire-place in the hall of the school. Elmer Camp Custer, Mich. 348 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Ogle was home on furlough from Camp Custer and he spoke briefly on camp life. Although he actually suffered by being thus thrust into the limelight, his talk was excellent and the feature of the program. The story of Elmer's schooling reads like a romance. When he entered school in January, 1914, he could read with difficulty, could not write his name so one could read it, and had spent his entire life hunting and loafing about the Burg. The first time he came to the house he slipped in with his mother and the rest of the family and sat all evening with his hat on and said nothing at all. He is now, as the picture shows, as courteous and gentlemanly a young man as one would care to meet. Physically he is a splendid speciman, as were most of the boys who enlisted, having passed a 100% physical examinations. Elder Ogle, son of "Mrs. Nan," is another young man of whom we have reason to feel proud. Coming from the little log, schoolhouse on Mill Creek, he entered the Pi Phi school when the new one was built and soon proved himself one of our best pupils. His mother tells how she taught him to read when he was three years old and how he could read the Bible when he was four. After he finished our school, and before he joined the navy last April, he attended high school in Columbus, Ohio. He is now a gunner on the battle-ship, Louisiana, hoping to see active service in France soon. Of all the boys the Pi Phis have "adopted," Sam Ogle probably appreciates their friendly interest the most. His home life was most unhappy and the navy to him was a haven of refuge. Last heard of he =was "over there." Sam, I might add, enjoys the distinction of being one of our 'first pupils when the school was started in 1912. To each and every Pi Phi the teachers and pupils at Little Pigeon send greetings and sincere hopes for a happy year of useful endeavor and hear the children sing this song in welcome as you enter the MARJORIE JACKSON, Secretary. A RECENT VISIT TO GATLINBTJRG By NINA HARRIS ALLEN "We're loyal to you, Pi Phi dear, Oh, we think you are grand, Pi Phi dear, Each day our joys are heightened, Our hearts are lightened, Our lives are brightened, Here's to Pi Phi !" . Oh, if every Pi Phi could visit our Settlement School in Tennessee such as we believe we are now entering upon. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 349 Assembly Room for morning exercises, it would thrill you through and through and you would hold out your arms to them and tell them, as we did,. that no matter what comes or doesn't come, Pi Beta Phi will always be loyal to them. To visit the Settlement School in December with snowstorms and railroad congestion everywhere, was not an easy matter, but the ride over the mountains from Sevierville to Gatlinburg was so wondrously beautiful and our days at the school so full of interest and pleasure that we felt more than repaid for the hardships. Picture, if you can; the Southland under a blanket of snow, with every tree and shrub white and glistening in the bright sunshine, and all along the way gorgeous holly trees, their red berries shining bright against the glossy, dark green leaves; spruce trees loaded with tiny cones and the mistletoe hanging high in the tops of the great oak and sycamore trees. Much as Mr. Allen had heard of our work he was unprepared, as most of you would be, for our first view of our Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as it looks today, with its five completed buildings, all well equipped and furnished. In the center, facing the road and "Little Pigeon" stands the main School building. This contains a central hall, lined with well-filled bookcases and a fireplace. Opening from this, three large school-rooms may be thrown together by sliding partitions into one assembly room. On the right, cooking and sewing-rooms have been fitted up this year at small expense and on the left, a large light room is used for manual training. Beside the schoolhouse is the fine new teachers' residence, a modern twelve-room house finished entirely in native wood and furnished plainly but suitably. It is a great source of joy and comfort to teachers, visitors, mountain folk, old and young, from far and near, and for years to come will serve as a model for the homes to be built by the young people now growing up in our school. Next door, in what we call the "old cottage," Mr. and Mrs. Prick-eft have a cozy home. The way Mrs. 'Prickett cares for the baby boy who came in November is a lesson in itself to the mothers who visit her. Close to this cottage is another one, built like a Swiss chalet on the side of Pi Phi hill, to be used as necessity arises for keeping pupils 350 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI over night who live long distances. Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Ogle live in it and look after the grounds, heating plants, machinery, etc. The old schoolhouse near Baskins has been repaired and is used by the schoolboys as a clubhouse. The boys furnish their own fuel and take care of the place. The grandstand on the athletic field and the home of our faithful Pi Phi horse complete the. buildings. The coming of the railroad, which is now graded to within a few miles of Gatlinburg, will materially enlarge our field of usefulness, bringing us pupils from all along the line. We may wake up some day, in the not far distant future, to find our Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the center of a thriving little mountain city, with added opportunities for service. The Gatlinburg notes of the Sevier County Republican of December 19 give the following notice: Pi BETA PHI SCHOOL The auditorium of the Pi Phi school was filled to capaci.ty for the musical entertainment Friday night. The musicians who offered an evening of pleasure were Harvey Reagan, West Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels. An additional feature of the entertainment was a splendid war talk by Ford Allen, and a word of greeting from Pi Phis all over the United States by Mrs. Allen. Mr. and Mrs. Ford Allen of Chicago were guests at the Pi Phi cottage. Mrs. Allen was visiting the school in her official capacity as vice-president of the fraternity. OUR "ADOPTED BOYS" As announced in' the December ARROW an appeal was made to the alumnae clubs to "adopt" all boys in national service who came from Gatlinburg and vicinity. How eager the response has been on the part of the clubs and how much the boys have appreciated our thoughts of them can be seen from the words of Miss Elva Plank who agreed to start the enterprise. She writes: I began the first of November, and got eleven names from Gatlinburg and wrote each boy, sending him two stamped postcards for confirmation, or change of address. Some letters were returned, not called for, some I didn't hear from, and one came to me from dead letter office. I have kept on hunting them up until now I have located all but one, and have had letters from them. This one is in the war zone and I wrote him to address given me by his brother and hope soon to have an answer. The boys are all grateful in anticipating what the Pi Phis are going to do for them. Only a few have written since receiving gifts but I am sure each one has written the club who is sending things. OUR "ADOPTED BOYS" 351 I sent 'you a copy of the postcard saying, "I could not sleep for fear I would waken and find that it was a dream, that the Pi Phis were thinking of me." , 1 One said he didn't know what his superior officer would think as he had no comforts like this. (he said his officer was not from our school but from the county and that he would like to give him one of his gifts, as coming from Pi Phi. I gave the officer's name to a club and a few days ago received a letter from the boy, saying, "I am getting along fine, had a jolly Christmas. Those lovely Pi Phi girls are sending me many wonderful presents. Mr. Freeman (the officer) is also receiving nice presents, we certainly admire the Pi Phi band, the best of girls are Pi Phis. 1 . My brother is in the war zone, I don't have any idea I will be here another month. I have taken the examination for the hospital train, to help in the operating rooms. Think I will pass 0. K., if so I will soon be off for France. Must close, with grandest wishes to you for a happy New Year. As ever, give my love to the Pi Phis, one and all." One boy says, "I could use any of the welcome comforts you mention, and some American tobacco. Thankfully yours." He is in the war zone and I was just two months getting an answer to my letter. I sent him the tobacco at once and his name on to the club which was waiting for him. The Clubs have responded wonderfully and many more have asked for boys than I could' furnish. I thought at convention time we could probably trade around, and let new clubs take the boys for next winter, if the war lasts so long. I have given a good deal of detail to show how well the sudden idea worked out and how much we have added to the comfort of these boys by what we have done. Not one boy to whom I wrote had any of these comforts and every' one expressed thanks to the Pi Phis for their kind thoughts. Several thanked the Pi Phis for what they had done for Gatlinburg and many wished to express thanks for the schooling they had received at the hands of Pi Phi. I will send cards to several clubs, asking that if they have any letters from their boys, to send them to you at once. Several letters have come to the Editor in response to Miss Plank's request. This one was written to the Kansas City Club. *MRS. CHARLES E. FAETH, Kansas City, Mo. My Dear Friend: I received the many things you sent me and I was very glad to get them.

I searched the place over and over but in vain. I received the doughnuts all O. K. You please except my sincere thank to her and all who belong to the Club for remembering me. you know very well we boys are away from home and it's a different life to what any of us ever lived or experienced before, never the less we are happy to know that we are abel and can do such a great work for our country sake, even if it's a great sacrafise, and I must say-it is a great sacrafise, surrounded with much endurance and hard ships, but I try to look at the bright side of the picture, it's very hard indeed to give up all and go out as it seems to live a new life entirely, but while this is all true I rejoice to know that I can do such a great work. if I were at home I would come out and serve my country as I did but sooner, for I realize what it means as I never did before, and I feel that if I should give my life for my country I know there are others, thousands of others who have done the same. All is fair in love and war. Yes I must say I was surprised to have all the gifts and packages but never the less it was more than a pleasant surprise.

Dear Home/elks: As I havn't heard from you for some time I'll write again. I have been sick but not very bad for three days. I have just been lying around doing nothing. I am better now. I went to Boston last Saturday and I had a very nice time. *Miss Bertha Carr was up here at camp Friday before I went down there. She and another woman friend of hers took dinner with me. She met me at the depot in Boston and we went up to Bunker Hill monument, where one of the great battles of the Revolutionary War was fought. It is in the center of Charleston and is only a small hill. There is only a small vacant lot around the monument. The monument is a very large one. I was rather dissapointed with it. We went through some of the largest stores in Boston. One of them, with one in Chicago and another in New York, is used as an example for the United States. They were sure some stores, too. We went through the Boston Common Park ; it would be beautiful in the summer time. We went to the home of one of Bertha's friends nine miles from Boston and spent the night. They were very nice people. The girl there was q. Pi Phi also. Sunday we took a ferry boat across the harbor to Winthrop. The harbor is about a mile wide. Winthrop is eleven miles from Boston. I saw several forts defending the harbor and some ships. One was loading up to go to Halifax with relief. We went on out to the ocean then. It was low tide *Secretary of Boston Alumnae Club.

We came back and went on a subway car to Cambridge, a suburb of Boston, and went around among the buildings of Harvard College. There are a lot of them and some of them are large ones, too. Longfellow's 'old home is at Cambridge but I didn't see it. It snowed last night, so there are about twelve inches of snow on the ground and drifted much deeper in places. I hope we will be sent south for the winter and there is a possibility of such a thing. What is being planned for Christmas at Gatlinburg? How are all the children getting along? Write me again soon, Yours, RICHARD CARR. All the boys at the front have spoken with appreciation of their adoption by Pi Phi clubs. Quoting from a letter from Minniz Ogle, Ft. Oglethorpe, Ga.; "Have I told you of my new Pi Phi correspondent, Miss Brown, in the University of Minneapolis, Minnesota? I received a swell Thanksgiving box from her. Believe me it was sure nice. She tells me that the girls there are planning to send me a knitted outfit for a Christmas present. 0, G won't that be great? She tells me of many wonderful things of the Pi Phis." And another time, "I just received a long letter from Miss Plank. True friends like that mean more in the army than riches." There are nine boys in service MINNIZ OGLE from Gatlinburg whom w e Ft.

A RECENT VISIT TO GATLINBTJRG By NINA HARRIS ALLEN "We're loyal to you, Pi Phi dear, Oh, we think you are grand, Pi Phi dear, Each day our joys are heightened, Our hearts are lightened, Our lives are brightened, Here's to Pi Phi !" . Oh, if every Pi Phi could visit our Settlement School in Tennessee such as we believe we are now entering upon. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 349 Assembly Room for morning exercises, it would thrill you through and through and you would hold out your arms to them and tell them, as we did,. that no matter what comes or doesn't come, Pi Beta Phi will always be loyal to them. To visit the Settlement School in December with snowstorms and railroad congestion everywhere, was not an easy matter, but the ride over the mountains from Sevierville to Gatlinburg was so wondrously beautiful and our days at the school so full of interest and pleasure that we felt more than repaid for the hardships. Picture, if you can; the Southland under a blanket of snow, with every tree and shrub white and glistening in the bright sunshine, and all along the way gorgeous holly trees, their red berries shining bright against the glossy, dark green leaves; spruce trees loaded with tiny cones and the mistletoe hanging high in the tops of the great oak and sycamore trees. Much as Mr. Allen had heard of our work he was unprepared, as most of you would be, for our first view of our Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as it looks today, with its five completed buildings, all well equipped and furnished. In the center, facing the road and "Little Pigeon" stands the main School building. This contains a central hall, lined with well-filled bookcases and a fireplace. Opening from this, three large school-rooms may be thrown together by sliding partitions into one assembly room. On the right, cooking and sewing-rooms have been fitted up this year at small expense and on the left, a large light room is used for manual training. Beside the schoolhouse is the fine new teachers' residence, a modern twelve-room house finished entirely in native wood and furnished plainly but suitably. It is a great source of joy and comfort to teachers, visitors, mountain folk, old and young, from far and near, and for years to come will serve as a model for the homes to be built by the young people now growing up in our school. Next door, in what we call the "old cottage," Mr. and Mrs. Prick-eft have a cozy home. The way Mrs. 'Prickett cares for the baby boy who came in November is a lesson in itself to the mothers who visit her. Close to this cottage is another one, built like a Swiss chalet on the side of Pi Phi hill, to be used as necessity arises for keeping pupils 350 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI over night who live long distances. Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Ogle live in it and look after the grounds, heating plants, machinery, etc. The old schoolhouse near Baskins has been repaired and is used by the schoolboys as a clubhouse. The boys furnish their own fuel and take care of the place. The grandstand on the athletic field and the home of our faithful Pi Phi horse complete the. buildings. The coming of the railroad, which is now graded to within a few miles of Gatlinburg, will materially enlarge our field of usefulness, bringing us pupils from all along the line. We may wake up some day, in the not far distant future, to find our Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the center of a thriving little mountain city, with added opportunities for service. The Gatlinburg notes of the Sevier County Republican of December 19 give the following notice: Pi BETA PHI SCHOOL The auditorium of the Pi Phi school was filled to capaci.ty for the musical entertainment Friday night. The musicians who offered an evening of pleasure were Harvey Reagan, West Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels. An additional feature of the entertainment was a splendid war talk by Ford Allen, and a word of greeting from Pi Phis all over the United States by Mrs. Allen. Mr. and Mrs. Ford Allen of Chicago were guests at the Pi Phi cottage. Mrs. Allen was visiting the school in her official capacity as vice-president of the fraternity. OUR "ADOPTED BOYS" As announced in' the December ARROW an appeal was made to the alumnae clubs to "adopt" all boys in national service who came from Gatlinburg and vicinity. How eager the response has been on the part of the clubs and how much the boys have appreciated our thoughts of them can be seen from the words of Miss Elva Plank who agreed to start the enterprise. She writes: I began the first of November, and got eleven names from Gatlinburg and wrote each boy, sending him two stamped postcards for confirmation, or change of address. Some letters were returned, not called for, some I didn't hear from, and one came to me from dead letter office. I have kept on hunting them up until now I have located all but one, and have had letters from them. This one is in the war zone and I wrote him to address given me by his brother and hope soon to have an answer. The boys are all grateful in anticipating what the Pi Phis are going to do for them. Only a few have written since receiving gifts but I am sure each one has written the club who is sending things. OUR "ADOPTED BOYS" 351 I sent 'you a copy of the postcard saying, "I could not sleep for fear I would waken and find that it was a dream, that the Pi Phis were thinking of me." , 1 One said he didn't know what his superior officer would think as he had no comforts like this. (he said his officer was not from our school but from the county and that he would like to give him one of his gifts, as coming from Pi Phi. I gave the officer's name to a club and a few days ago received a letter from the boy, saying, "I am getting along fine, had a jolly Christmas. Those lovely Pi Phi girls are sending me many wonderful presents. Mr. Freeman (the officer) is also receiving nice presents, we certainly admire the Pi Phi band, the best of girls are Pi Phis. 1 . My brother is in the war zone, I don't have any idea I will be here another month. I have taken the examination for the hospital train, to help in the operating rooms. Think I will pass 0. K., if so I will soon be off for France. Must close, with grandest wishes to you for a happy New Year. As ever, give my love to the Pi Phis, one and all." One boy says, "I could use any of the welcome comforts you mention, and some American tobacco. Thankfully yours." He is in the war zone and I was just two months getting an answer to my letter. I sent him the tobacco at once and his name on to the club which was waiting for him. The Clubs have responded wonderfully and many more have asked for boys than I could' furnish. I thought at convention time we could probably trade around, and let new clubs take the boys for next winter, if the war lasts so long. I have given a good deal of detail to show how well the sudden idea worked out and how much we have added to the comfort of these boys by what we have done. Not one boy to whom I wrote had any of these comforts and every' one expressed thanks to the Pi Phis for their kind thoughts. Several thanked the Pi Phis for what they had done for Gatlinburg and many wished to express thanks for the schooling they had received at the hands of Pi Phi. I will send cards to several clubs, asking that if they have any letters from their boys, to send them to you at once. Several letters have come to the Editor in response to Miss Plank's request. This one was written to the Kansas City Club. *MRS. CHARLES E. FAETH, Kansas City, Mo. My Dear Friend: I received the many things you sent me and I was very glad to get them.

        348 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Ogle was home on furlough from Camp Custer and he spoke briefly on camp life. Although he actually suffered by being thus thrust into the limelight, his talk was excellent and the feature of the program. The story of Elmer's schooling reads like a romance. When he entered school in January, 1914, he could read with difficulty, could not write his name so one could read it, and had spent his entire life hunting and loafing about the Burg. The first time he came to the house he slipped in with his mother and the rest of the family and sat all evening with his hat on and said nothing at all. He is now, as the picture shows, as courteous and gentlemanly a young man as one would care to meet. Physically he is a splendid speciman, as were most of the boys who enlisted, having passed a 100% physical examinations. Elder Ogle, son of "Mrs. Nan," is another young man of whom we have reason to feel proud. Coming from the little log, schoolhouse on Mill Creek, he entered the Pi Phi school when the new one was built and soon proved himself one of our best pupils. His mother tells how she taught him to read when he was three years old and how he could read the Bible when he was four. After he finished our school, and before he joined the navy last April, he attended high school in Columbus, Ohio. He is now a gunner on the battle-ship, Louisiana, hoping to see active service in France soon. Of all the boys the Pi Phis have "adopted," Sam Ogle probably appreciates their friendly interest the most. His home life was most unhappy and the navy to him was a haven of refuge. Last heard of he =was "over there." Sam, I might add, enjoys the distinction of being one of our 'first pupils when the school was started in 1912. To each and every Pi Phi the teachers and pupils at Little Pigeon send greetings and sincere hopes for a happy year of useful endeavor and hear the children sing this song in welcome as you enter the MARJORIE JACKSON, Secretary. A RECENT VISIT TO GATLINBTJRG By NINA HARRIS ALLEN "We're loyal to you, Pi Phi dear, Oh, we think you are grand, Pi Phi dear, Each day our joys are heightened, Our hearts are lightened, Our lives are brightened, Here's to Pi Phi !" . Oh, if every Pi Phi could visit our Settlement School in Tennessee such as we believe we are now entering upon. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 349 Assembly Room for morning exercises, it would thrill you through and through and you would hold out your arms to them and tell them, as we did,. that no matter what comes or doesn't come, Pi Beta Phi will always be loyal to them. To visit the Settlement School in December with snowstorms and railroad congestion everywhere, was not an easy matter, but the ride over the mountains from Sevierville to Gatlinburg was so wondrously beautiful and our days at the school so full of interest and pleasure that we felt more than repaid for the hardships. Picture, if you can; the Southland under a blanket of snow, with every tree and shrub white and glistening in the bright sunshine, and all along the way gorgeous holly trees, their red berries shining bright against the glossy, dark green leaves; spruce trees loaded with tiny cones and the mistletoe hanging high in the tops of the great oak and sycamore trees. Much as Mr. Allen had heard of our work he was unprepared, as most of you would be, for our first view of our Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as it looks today, with its five completed buildings, all well equipped and furnished. In the center, facing the road and "Little Pigeon" stands the main School building. This contains a central hall, lined with well-filled bookcases and a fireplace. Opening from this, three large school-rooms may be thrown together by sliding partitions into one assembly room. On the right, cooking and sewing-rooms have been fitted up this year at small expense and on the left, a large light room is used for manual training. Beside the schoolhouse is the fine new teachers' residence, a modern twelve-room house finished entirely in native wood and furnished plainly but suitably. It is a great source of joy and comfort to teachers, visitors, mountain folk, old and young, from far and near, and for years to come will serve as a model for the homes to be built by the young people now growing up in our school. Next door, in what we call the "old cottage," Mr. and Mrs. Prick-eft have a cozy home. The way Mrs. 'Prickett cares for the baby boy who came in November is a lesson in itself to the mothers who visit her.

Mrs. Vernon Kellogg, wife of Prof. Vernon Lyman Kellogg of the Entomology Department of Stanford University, is a member of Eta Chapter of I' 4) B. She was appointed the only American woman member of the commission for the Relief of Belgium and spent the last six months of 1916 in Belgium where her husband was in charge of the chief office of the commission on the field, at Brussels. Gamma Phis everywhere are endeavoring to increase the fund for Belgian relief by the sale of Mrs. Kellogg's book, a, press notice of which follows: Among the many thousands of war books that have been written since this world war began, probably the volume entitled Women of Belgium, Turning Tragedy to Triumph embodies the intensest human interest, the profound est pathos. It has just been published by the Funk and Wagnalls Company as a labor of love and philanthropy. All profits accruing from its sales go to the Commission forRelief in Belgium. The only American woman member of that Commission wrote the book Mrs. Charlotte Kellogg after spending eight months on Belgian soil; and her strong sympathy, her unfailing appreciation, intensify the literary charm of its pages. Learning how these women have labored, in their mothering of smitten millions, we get from this book side-lights upon the effects of the wan Richmond Times Despatch. Florence M. Marshall, the newly created head of the .Woman's Bureau of the Red Cross, is also a member of I' B, belonging to Delta Chapter. Another war book of unusual interest is entitled Short Rations, an American Woman in Germany, 1915-16. The author is Madeleine Z. Doty, A 0 II. Says the Christian Endeavor World of this book: Miss Doty went with the intention of finding out, if she could, where the common people of Germany stand in regard to war and peace, and also whether the food shortage is serious. She had difficulty in finding Germany's poor at all, not because there are no poor, but because official Germany, as she says, denies and hides them. Nevertheless, Miss Doty found them, and tells the story of their suffering. She is indignant at the efficient inefficiency of officialdom, the everlasting red tape, and the lack of understanding of human nature. One begins as one reads to get an idea of the wide-spread under-feeding that is endured with patient heroism. Miss Doty believes that the patience of the hungry people may turn to fury at any time. She foresaw the likelihood of a renewal of submarine ruthlessness. She intimates that there will probably be great changes in Germany when the men get back from the front and learn what their women folk have had to endure. In the mean-while the women suffer, are sick of the war, gagged, but yearning for peace that does not come. The book is interesting as a first-hand record of an eye-witness whose good name is a guaranty for its truthfulness. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 345 Mrs. Grace Humiston, the lawyer who solved the murder of Ruth Kruger after police efforts had failed, is a member of Nu Chap-ter of A 0 II. Mrs. Humiston has gained considerable publicity lately for her activities connected with social conditions near certain army camps. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON We have been very busy at Little Pigeon since the December ARROW getting a chapter of Red Cross organized, and still busier when we finally, in December, became a branch of the Sevierville chapter. While we, the teachers, were home for the Christmas holidays, Mrs. Ball, Iowa B, ex-'76 of Iowa City, our house guest, and Mrs. Platt, our chaperon, completed the organization and we returned to find a chapter of twenty-three ready and eager to begin work. It stirred our patriotism as few sights could have when we first descried the Red Cross cards in the windows of the little cabins on the mountain side. One cabin, which had no windows, displayed the card on the door. Mrs. Steve Whaley, a mountain. woman, was elected chairman, and a wise selection it has proved to be. Our materials came early in January and were distributed at a meeting at the cottage Saturday, J'anuary 19. The first yarn was for sweaters. They were a novelty to the people here and while they were responsive enough in undertaking to make them, it is in knitting socks where our chapter will make its record. You see it was not until very recently that the mountaineers knew what a machine-made sock looked like. Men, women, and children all took a hand with the needles, and the best part of it is, they were unknowingly making socks with the Kitchener toe. . When the weather "fairs up" Miss Nancy Ogle and Lucinda Husky are to begin spinning for us, and we are hoping to get enough interested to spin wool for all of the Sevier county chapters. In a patriotic undertaking, they would at the same time be able to make a neat little profit at the market price of yarn. Possibly you will be interested to know the names of the charter members. They are: Mrs. Stephen Whaley, Miss Mattie Ogle, Miss Josie Trentham, Mrs. H. S. Platt, Miss Little Reagan, Miss Arena Cardell, Mrs. C. C. Reagan, Mrs. Geo. W. Ball, Mrs..Tom McCarter, Mrs. Norman Prickett, Miss Nell Williams, Mrs. Brown, Miss Emma 346 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Maples, Mrs. J. V. Husky, Mrs. Marton Cabe, Mrs. George Ogle, Mrs. Annie Ogle, Mrs. Nick Husky, Mrs. Andy Huff, Mrs. E. L. Brown, Miss May Montgomery, Miss Ruth Meacham, Andy Huff. Meetings are held in the community room at the cottage Saturday afternoons. Most of the actual work is done in the homes, but soon the school children will be given special instructions and the sewing hour will be devoted to war work. They are bubbling over with enthusiasm and simply will not be denied. Of course our real center of interest lies in the boys from the "Burg" who are in service: Often a mother brings a letter from her boy and reads it at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father holds the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gives them the latest from the front. Most of these letters are intensely interesting. The liberal education of army life the boys who enjoyed no advantages and who "never seed over the mountains" suddenly entered into was enough to sweep them off their feet. Sometimes their impressions of the outside world are amusingly original, others show a remarkable sense of proportions. December, 14, 1917, Camp Devens, Ayer, Mass., c/o 307th Bakery Co. Dear Home/elks: As I havn't heard from you for some time I'll write again. I have been sick but not very bad for three days. I have just been lying around doing nothing. I am better now. I went to Boston last Saturday and I had a very nice time. *Miss Bertha Carr was up here at camp Friday before I went down there. She and another woman friend of hers took dinner with me. She met me at the depot in Boston and we went up to Bunker Hill monument, where one of the great battles of the Revolutionary War was fought. It is in the center of Charleston and is only a small hill. There is only a small vacant lot around the monument. The monument is a very large one. I was rather dissapointed with it. We went through some of the largest stores in Boston. One of them, with one in Chicago and another in New York, is used as an example for the United States. They were sure some stores, too. We went through the Boston Common Park ; it would be beautiful in the summer time. We went to the home of one of Bertha's friends nine miles from Boston and spent the night. They were very nice people. The girl there was q. Pi Phi also. Sunday we took a ferry boat across the harbor to Winthrop. The harbor is about a mile wide. Winthrop is eleven miles from Boston. I saw several forts defending the harbor and some ships. One was loading up to go to Halifax with relief. We went on out to the ocean then. It was low tide *Secretary of Boston Alumnae Club. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 347 but it was quite a show at that. The wind was blowing quite a bit and the waves were a show to me. We came back and went on a subway car to Cambridge, a suburb of Boston, and went around among the buildings of Harvard College. There are a lot of them and some of them are large ones, too. Longfellow's 'old home is at Cambridge but I didn't see it. It snowed last night, so there are about twelve inches of snow on the ground and drifted much deeper in places. I hope we will be sent south for the winter and there is a possibility of such a thing. What is being planned for Christmas at Gatlinburg? How are all the children getting along? Write me again soon, Yours, RICHARD CARR. All the boys at the front have spoken with appreciation of their adoption by Pi Phi clubs. Quoting from a letter from Minniz Ogle, Ft. Oglethorpe, Ga.; "Have I told you of my new Pi Phi correspondent, Miss Brown, in the University of Minneapolis, Minnesota? I received a swell Thanksgiving box from her. Believe me it was sure nice. She tells me that the girls there are planning to send me a knitted outfit for a Christmas present. 0, G won't that be great? She tells me of many wonderful things of the Pi Phis." And another time, "I just received a long letter from Miss Plank. True friends like that mean more in the army than riches." There are nine boys in service MINNIZ OGLE from Gatlinburg whom w e Ft. Oglethorpe, Ga. claim as "ours." They are Elmer Ogle, Elder Ogle, Elmer Watson, Richard Carr, Minniz Ogle, Dallard Ownby, Eli Watson, Eli Wilson, and Sam Ogle. Shortly after the holidays, at a partiotic rally, we raised a service flag for them, which now hangs over El.mER OGLE the fire-place in the hall of the school. Elmer Camp Custer, Mich. 348 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Ogle was home on furlough from Camp Custer and he spoke briefly on camp life. Although he actually suffered by being thus thrust into the limelight, his talk was excellent and the feature of the program. The story of Elmer's schooling reads like a romance. When he entered school in January, 1914, he could read with difficulty, could not write his name so one could read it, and had spent his entire life hunting and loafing about the Burg. The first time he came to the house he slipped in with his mother and the rest of the family and sat all evening with his hat on and said nothing at all. He is now, as the picture shows, as courteous and gentlemanly a young man as one would care to meet. Physically he is a splendid speciman, as were most of the boys who enlisted, having passed a 100% physical examinations. Elder Ogle, son of "Mrs. Nan," is another young man of whom we have reason to feel proud. Coming from the little log, schoolhouse on Mill Creek, he entered the Pi Phi school when the new one was built and soon proved himself one of our best pupils. His mother tells how she taught him to read when he was three years old and how he could read the Bible when he was four. After he finished our school, and before he joined the navy last April, he attended high school in Columbus, Ohio. He is now a gunner on the battle-ship, Louisiana, hoping to see active service in France soon. Of all the boys the Pi Phis have "adopted," Sam Ogle probably appreciates their friendly interest the most. His home life was most unhappy and the navy to him was a haven of refuge. Last heard of he =was "over there." Sam, I might add, enjoys the distinction of being one of our 'first pupils when the school was started in 1912. To each and every Pi Phi the teachers and pupils at Little Pigeon send greetings and sincere hopes for a happy year of useful endeavor and hear the children sing this song in welcome as you enter the MARJORIE JACKSON, Secretary. A RECENT VISIT TO GATLINBTJRG By NINA HARRIS ALLEN "We're loyal to you, Pi Phi dear, Oh, we think you are grand, Pi Phi dear, Each day our joys are heightened, Our hearts are lightened, Our lives are brightened, Here's to Pi Phi !" . Oh, if every Pi Phi could visit our Settlement School in Tennessee such as we believe we are now entering upon. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 349 Assembly Room for morning exercises, it would thrill you through and through and you would hold out your arms to them and tell them, as we did,. that no matter what comes or doesn't come, Pi Beta Phi will always be loyal to them. To visit the Settlement School in December with snowstorms and railroad congestion everywhere, was not an easy matter, but the ride over the mountains from Sevierville to Gatlinburg was so wondrously beautiful and our days at the school so full of interest and pleasure that we felt more than repaid for the hardships. Picture, if you can; the Southland under a blanket of snow, with every tree and shrub white and glistening in the bright sunshine, and all along the way gorgeous holly trees, their red berries shining bright against the glossy, dark green leaves; spruce trees loaded with tiny cones and the mistletoe hanging high in the tops of the great oak and sycamore trees. Much as Mr. Allen had heard of our work he was unprepared, as most of you would be, for our first view of our Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as it looks today, with its five completed buildings, all well equipped and furnished. In the center, facing the road and "Little Pigeon" stands the main School building. This contains a central hall, lined with well-filled bookcases and a fireplace. Opening from this, three large school-rooms may be thrown together by sliding partitions into one assembly room. On the right, cooking and sewing-rooms have been fitted up this year at small expense and on the left, a large light room is used for manual training. Beside the schoolhouse is the fine new teachers' residence, a modern twelve-room house finished entirely in native wood and furnished plainly but suitably. It is a great source of joy and comfort to teachers, visitors, mountain folk, old and young, from far and near, and for years to come will serve as a model for the homes to be built by the young people now growing up in our school. Next door, in what we call the "old cottage," Mr. and Mrs. Prick-eft have a cozy home. The way Mrs. 'Prickett cares for the baby boy who came in November is a lesson in itself to the mothers who visit her. Close to this cottage is another one, built like a Swiss chalet on the side of Pi Phi hill, to be used as necessity arises for keeping pupils 350 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI over night who live long distances. Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Ogle live in it and look after the grounds, heating plants, machinery, etc. The old schoolhouse near Baskins has been repaired and is used by the schoolboys as a clubhouse. The boys furnish their own fuel and take care of the place. The grandstand on the athletic field and the home of our faithful Pi Phi horse complete the. buildings. The coming of the railroad, which is now graded to within a few miles of Gatlinburg, will materially enlarge our field of usefulness, bringing us pupils from all along the line. We may wake up some day, in the not far distant future, to find our Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the center of a thriving little mountain city, with added opportunities for service. The Gatlinburg notes of the Sevier County Republican of December 19 give the following notice: Pi BETA PHI SCHOOL The auditorium of the Pi Phi school was filled to capaci.ty for the musical entertainment Friday night. The musicians who offered an evening of pleasure were Harvey Reagan, West Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels. An additional feature of the entertainment was a splendid war talk by Ford Allen, and a word of greeting from Pi Phis all over the United States by Mrs. Allen. Mr. and Mrs. Ford Allen of Chicago were guests at the Pi Phi cottage. Mrs. Allen was visiting the school in her official capacity as vice-president of the fraternity. OUR "ADOPTED BOYS" As announced in' the December ARROW an appeal was made to the alumnae clubs to "adopt" all boys in national service who came from Gatlinburg and vicinity. How eager the response has been on the part of the clubs and how much the boys have appreciated our thoughts of them can be seen from the words of Miss Elva Plank who agreed to start the enterprise. She writes: I began the first of November, and got eleven names from Gatlinburg and wrote each boy, sending him two stamped postcards for confirmation, or change of address. Some letters were returned, not called for, some I didn't hear from, and one came to me from dead letter office. I have kept on hunting them up until now I have located all but one, and have had letters from them. This one is in the war zone and I wrote him to address given me by his brother and hope soon to have an answer. The boys are all grateful in anticipating what the Pi Phis are going to do for them. Only a few have written since receiving gifts but I am sure each one has written the club who is sending things. OUR "ADOPTED BOYS" 351 I sent 'you a copy of the postcard saying, "I could not sleep for fear I would waken and find that it was a dream, that the Pi Phis were thinking of me." , 1 One said he didn't know what his superior officer would think as he had no comforts like this. (he said his officer was not from our school but from the county and that he would like to give him one of his gifts, as coming from Pi Phi. I gave the officer's name to a club and a few days ago received a letter from the boy, saying, "I am getting along fine, had a jolly Christmas. Those lovely Pi Phi girls are sending me many wonderful presents. Mr. Freeman (the officer) is also receiving nice presents, we certainly admire the Pi Phi band, the best of girls are Pi Phis. 1 . My brother is in the war zone, I don't have any idea I will be here another month. I have taken the examination for the hospital train, to help in the operating rooms. Think I will pass 0. K., if so I will soon be off for France. Must close, with grandest wishes to you for a happy New Year. As ever, give my love to the Pi Phis, one and all." One boy says, "I could use any of the welcome comforts you mention, and some American tobacco. Thankfully yours." He is in the war zone and I was just two months getting an answer to my letter. I sent him the tobacco at once and his name on to the club which was waiting for him. The Clubs have responded wonderfully and many more have asked for boys than I could' furnish. I thought at convention time we could probably trade around, and let new clubs take the boys for next winter, if the war lasts so long. I have given a good deal of detail to show how well the sudden idea worked out and how much we have added to the comfort of these boys by what we have done. Not one boy to whom I wrote had any of these comforts and every' one expressed thanks to the Pi Phis for their kind thoughts. Several thanked the Pi Phis for what they had done for Gatlinburg and many wished to express thanks for the schooling they had received at the hands of Pi Phi. I will send cards to several clubs, asking that if they have any letters from their boys, to send them to you at once. Several letters have come to the Editor in response to Miss Plank's request. This one was written to the Kansas City Club. *MRS. CHARLES E. FAETH, Kansas City, Mo. My Dear Friend: I received the many things you sent me and I was very glad to get them.
