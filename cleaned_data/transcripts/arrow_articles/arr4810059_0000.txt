        58 The September ARROW selfish service rendered by the many rich a heritage. Their lives are a who have gone before, which has challenge to each one of us to. "carry made it possible for us to have so on." GRACE FILLER Report of the Chairman of the Settlement School IT IS a pleasure to report to the fraternity the steady forward progress of the Settlement School in Gatlinburg. No spectacular events mark the year 1930-31, but the definite influence of the school in the community can be seen in more than one way, and the loyalty of the people to the school can be measured by more than one event. This evidence is exceedingly hearteniqg when one considers the changes that are so rapidly making the remote village into one of many stopping places on a crowded holiday highway. The leadership of the school was never more needed, since material prosperity does not always bring higher ideals and unselfish motives, nor does a better standard of living con-note honesty of purpose and integrity of life. The mountaineer needs the school to help him preserve his native heritage of staunch ideals, honest purpose, outstanding integrity, and keen intelligence. Guidance is needed as never before. Living standards are changing in the burg, but in outlying districts little change can be noted from the early days of the school. The numbers attending the school vary little from year to year. The one hundred and seventy of this year is perhaps a high-water mark. The fact that the high school work is now being recognized by the state, and a small reimbursement per pupil voted annually is encouraging. The pressure for the last two years of high school to be given in Gatlinburg is great, but we cannot consider it under present crowded conditions. The pupilshave made splendid progress at school and gained much through other activities within the school, Those who are living in the dormitories are exceptionally privileged since they gain much from the close association with the staff. The largest problem now facing us is to find adequate and sanitary dormitory facilities for the boys who for the past three years have been crowded into a small, dark rented cottage without heat, except in the living rooms; and unsuitable in every way for the purpose to which it is being put. It is not right to ask the housemother to run the risk that she does there. Illness of a serious character has each year been evidenced among the dormitory boys. The management of the school under the new principal, Mr. King, has been most satisfactory. Teaching has progressed favorably with a staff who are enthusiastic teachers and leaders. Home economics, agriculture, and manual training, and weaving have taken their important place in the school curriculum under the most efficient direction of their respective teachers, as well as reaching into the near-by communities and having their influence upon the people in them. Volunteer work, done by Miss Glover and Miss Pratt, have eased the crowded duties of the other teachers, and made for a more effective daily pro-gram. Management of the home and supervision of the meals for a family of forty-five has been most success-fully carried out by Mrs. Rorex, with help from local girls as cooks, The September ARROW and dormitory girls in the cottages. The farm has been well handled and produced a satisfactory crop, and that in a time of widespread drought. This is due to the care of our farmers, aided by the dormitory boys. The work of our nurse, Frances Moore, would require a separate re-port, so varied and full is it. Her unselfish service is known throughout the countryside, and she is dearly loved, and her visits looked forward to. Lillie Reagan is the guardian of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center and meets the many problems that come to its doors in a capable and competent manner. As for the Arrowcraft business, one could talk endlessly of the ever in-creasing variety of beautiful and useful things that are to be found there. Each one of these lovely things rep-resents help to some local family: the bringing into some home of a necessity or a little luxury which otherwise would not reach it. LaDelle Allen can tell many a story of the men and women who have made baskets, furniture, towels, coverlets, etc., that would keep you spellbound. Her able assistants, Veatress Parton and Alice McCarter, are Gatlinburg girls of whom we are very proud. The Arrowcraft business has launched a new enterprise, and one that promises to bring worth-while returns. In April a little shop was opened in the Mountain View Hotel for the sale of Arrow-craft products. Many of the visitors at the hotel did not find their way to the Arrowcraft Shop, so we thought it wise to bring the shop to them. The few weeks' returns are proving the wisdom of this venture. Community activities continue to thrive under the wing of the school. Meetings of weaving women, parent-teachers association meetings, basket-ball for the older boys of the community under Mr. Mattil's able super-vision, Old Timers' Day, and other activities keep alive, al to grow, the plant of commun and civic responsibility. Sugarlands has had a st school year under the splend: tion of Eva Hathaway and En ton, in spite of unforeseen occl Scarlet fever closed the sc: two weeks in the fall. In the r the winter, Mrs. Dowell, our housemother at Sugarlands, ill very suddenly, and lay in condition for weeks. We are indeed that she has made a covery, but regretful that not come back to her belove tains to work with her love tain folk. The work that Mrs has done at Gatlinburg art lands cannot be estimated.

We ma to sell the teachers cottag Park very shortly, but we will to occupy it until there is nc need of a school in that pal Park.

To revive a lost handicraft is indeed a 11l thing, and we are fortunate been chosen' as the school in his is to be done. It shows a finite appraisal of, and high nt to, the work we are doing nburg. It will be the largest individual gift we have ever received. Under the guidance of Mr. Mattil, it should give wonderful opportunities to our boys for learning a new trade. Our school continues to take and keep its place among other mountain schools, and to make its contribution towards the solving of mountain school problems. It is a charter member of the newly-organized Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. We also have close connections with other agencies through the Mountain Workers Conference where we are well represented. In state and county teachers meetings, health conferences, Future Farmers of Tennessee organizations, and other educational groups, we are ably represented by our staff. Every member of the committee has had a busy and happy year working for the school. The duties of each are different, and the wholehearted way in which they have carried them out has been a joy to witness. The clear vision and helpful discussion of school problems in the round robins has greatly lightened the duties of the chairman. Blanche Curtis' duties have not been easy, for accidents will prevent the getting of copy on time, and disappointments were many. She has patiently borne with these, and given the fraternity clear-cut glimpses of what is being done at the school through the "Little Pigeon News." It is with regret that we recognize that her term of office is over, and with great appreciation, that we acknowledge the splendid way in which she has conducted her department in THE ARROW, and faithfully performed her secretarial duties. Helen Tottle has put the slides in order, and cared for requests for the slides and films, and arranged the In-formation Folder regarding the school, which is delighting you all. Rebecca White has had many and demanding duties which have kept her constantly busy. Letters to fraternity The September ARROW officers, alum= clubs, active chapters, and seniors of 1929 and 1930 have been written. She has issued Settlement School program material to eighteen clubs and three chapters, as well as material on the school and mountain people to individuals and other groups. She has maintained a very close contact with the Central Office and the Magazine Agency that was mutually beneficial. In the spring she conducted a survey of the interest that the club members take in the school through a questionnaire. The answers were tabulated. In addition she gathered together the statistical data which is chartered in the Settlement School exhibit at this Convention. Her carefulness, thoroughness, and deep interest could not be surpassed. For our treasurer, Grace Post, only words of the highest commendation can be used. She has been untiring in her efforts to simplify the books, and give the audit a form which will make it clear to all how we stand from year to year. This has been a discouraging year for her, as for all the committee since contributions have been slow in coming in, and in some instances there has been a substantial reduction under the previous year. Last July we cut our budget for this year to the lowest possible figure. Now we face the fact that we may not receive what we had budgeted for. We realize that clubs and chapters are doing their utmost to carry on as in previous years, and we are making no complaint. We must, however, let you know frankly the situation that is facing your Settlement School. The debt for the Indus-trial Building is large. It will be years before it is paid off at the present rate of reduction, and before that occurs, we are not justified in undertaking any new project, however badly needed. We do not, however, anticipate a reduction of staff or salaries, or a curtailment of present work so long asthe clubs, chapters, and individua wial continue to give their support in the past. We feel sure that we c count on you to continue to do wh you have done. The Chairman's duties have been pleasure because of the splendid c operation on the part of every mer ber of the Committee. She is deeply a preciative of this, and more than hap] to have had the opportunity and pH.), lege of knowing intimately such sple did women. In November, she may a visit to the school to accept ti wood-working shop. A visit of tl Founders had been planned for th time, but unfortunately none of the could come. In April, a conference three members of the committee w held at the home of Rebecca White. was deemed necessary to discuss ce taro problems and make some decisio: before committee meeting in Augur At the next meeting your Chairman r gretfully gives up her position aft four years of very happy servi for the Settlement School. She begs thank all those who have made h work a pleasure: To her Committ she gives a warm, affectionate a preciation of their sympathetic undt standing of the problems of the schc and their close cooperation in tryi: to forward the work there. To Gra: Council members, and in particular the Grand President, she expresses deep gratefulness for the patience a wisdom that have been shown in a vising her. To the Director of t School her heart goes out in tr admiration and heartfelt love for she has given of time and thought helping her work as chairman, a making it easier, and giving so mu and so generously of herself in friet ship. For the members of the staff the school she desires to express I pride that she feels, as does all Pi P in the accomplishments that they so successfully achieving through th work in the school. With gratitt i.2 ;he thanks the members of the frater-Iity---clubs, active chapters, and indiriduals as well as interested friends, The September ARROW for their generous support of the school. EDITH H. GORDON Report of the Director of the Pi Beta Phi Settle ent School THE report for 1930-31 'ollows closely that of 1929-30. This s to be expected under existing conlitions. The number in school would laturally continue about the same as tie cannot take more boarding pupils Lnd the daily attendance changes but ittle from year to year. The several lepartments of the school have coninued along the same lines with no hought of further development at )resent but a real effort to keep from aking any backward steps during this ime of financial depression. It has )een necessary for us to cut our bud--.et each year for the past three and Lgain this year we shall do the same, ret this we hope has not been done Frith serious results to the real work )f the school. Few schools have taken is small a cut as we have and again ve have our loyal Pi Phis to thank or their untiring efforts. There never tas been more positive proof of the )lace the schoOl holds in the hearts of he many, many Pi Phis than this coninued support during these difficult imes. Not only the contributions but he Arrowcraft business held up to Llmost the same fine mark. Surely here must have been a larger amount )f interest and energy expended to ac-:omplish these results than ever be-ore. The Smoky Mountain National Park s now assured and practically all the lecessary land has been turned over o the Government. While the park will tome to within a half mile of Gatlin-)urg we do not anticipate many :hanges for the school. Sugarlands is n the park area and we feel reasonibly sure that our extension work therewill end in the spring. All that will depend on the number of families remaining in that area of the park. Al-ready a great many tourists are coming, both winter and summer. Coming into Gatlinburg over a good highway and stopping at a comfortable modern hotel causes many Pi Phis to think the work of the school must be about over. Not so. Stop long enough to look a bit further and think a bit deeper and you will be convinced that there is still plenty to do. In fact each year brings more instead of less. Who dreamed all this when the school was first established ? Who would dream now of stopping? The challenge continues. The staff for the year has been: Evelyn Bishop, New York Alpha director. William King, University of Tennessee prin cipal, mathematics and science, seventh and tenth grades. Vivian Blair, Oregon Alpha English and history. Barbara Horton, Missouri Gamma fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri Beta second and third grades. Eleanor Brabson, East Tennessee Normal primer and first grade. Mary Rachel Armstrong, University of Tennessee home economics. F. D. Smith, University of Tennessee Smith Hughes Agriculture. Victoria Strand weaving. LaDelle Allen, Arkansas Alpha Arrowcraft. Elizabeth Cooke accountant. Frances Moore nurse. Mrs. Rorex girls' dormitory and manager boarding department. Miss Niblock housemother, boys' dormitory. Mrs. Dowell, Iowa Beta housemother, community worker, Sugarlands. Eva Hathaway, Iowa Beta principal fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, Sugar-lands. Emily Burton, Tennessee Alpha first, second, third, and fourth grades, Sugarlands. Miss Glover assistant in the high school, and Miss Pratt, assistant in the weaving de partment, were volunteer workers. The September ARROW The following local people were on the staff : Veatress Parton Arrowcraft Shop. Alice McCarter Arrowcraft Shop. Lillie Reagan assistant at the hospital. Ernest Reagan general work. Arlie McCarter gardens, furnaces, general work. Ambrose Ogle farm, supervisor of student labor of boys. Martha Cole cook. 011ie Higdon cook. School Although we had a new principal for the school and one new grade teacher, the work ran smoothly from the start and we can report a good school year. The total enrollment for the year was 170. Of this number 124 were in the first six grades and 46 in the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades. The changes made in the grade building of putting primer and first grade in one room, second, and third grades in the next, and fourth, fifth, and sixth grades in the third room proved much more satisfactory than having the first three grades in one room. It evened up numbers and work much better. The county allows us salaries for four grade teachers so the grade work is not carried at a financial loss. The state will also allow us this year a small amount per pupil for high school work. While the sum is not large we feel it will increase year by year and it will relieve some of our hardest working pupils of having to earn their tuition. Also this amount will be in cash instead of being worked out .by the pupils. Six pupils completed eighth grade and six completed second year high school. Of those who finished their work here all will probably go on to some other school to finish their course. There is a plea all the time for four years of high school here. This comes from the university as well as the people here, for they say so fewschools provide ways wherf can work their way througl training they receive ot school hours is of so mu HoweVer we cannot think 4 those two years yet for it wositate more room for board: and we are overcrowded no. The boys have had a goc ball team, Mr. King, the coaching. The girls did not side teams but instead had a club. It gave them practice games and we felt we real: plished more in physical trair rietta McCutchan coached tl One very real help in the past year has been in hay Glover in charge of the sti Miss Glover, a successful tee self, knew so well where she of the most help in the scho fact that she was giving he made no difference in the ste she spent in the school roon The noon lunch for the pr underweight grade childrer sumed with the usual good r The cooperation of the P. the teachers was a great hel ways than we can mention el their greatest help was witl lunch. Agriculture Smith Hughes Agricultu: linburg calls for leaving tt path of high school teachin an extent and one must bl to keep up with the variou that come night or day. S from the report of Don Sr culture teacher, give some i work but fail to tell half th Twenty-seven boys wen in the school classes, 11 in h 16 in seventh and eighth grr boys were given practical in connection with the we farm pruning and sprayir a shed for the protection ( 4 The September ARROW ivies, making hotbeds, slaughtering ogs, and "curing" meat comprise )me of the things done by the classes. Cow feed was bought and the boys -eighed and mixed it. Calls from arents of the boys were answered and eip giving in pruning, spraying, and le treating of sick animals. The F.F.T. organization was a wide-wake one. The boys sent two repremtatives to Nashville for the state invention in the spring and several [an to attend the summer camp for a loft time. The purpose of the club, quote Mr. Smith's report is "to :rengthen the confidence of the count' boy in himself, in country life ad in the business of farming." The Pi Beta Phi Chapter holds a tembership in the Sevier County arm Bureau. This year the boys premted a loving cup to be given to the (ost outstanding high school girl, her ame to be engraved on the cup. The ame of Adis Clabo was put on the ap. Adis is from Wears Valley. This an honor well worth working for tad the first of the kind to be estabshed in the school. A day unit class was held at Laurel ick, ten boys were enrolled and their .ork was with small shop tools. This spring six of the boys are rais-1g chicks gotten from the school ock. The boys painted a room in the :hoolhouse and erected a forty-foot agpole on the, school grounds. The Wears Valley class has been aid the past year for men instead of )ys. Thirty-six adult farmers took up le study of Burley tobacco raising. he individual work with the farmers ill continue through the summer. The farmers in the vicinity of atlinburg, under the direction of Le school agricultural department, )ught cooperatively twelve tons of Lttle feed at a material saving. Sev-.al bought fertilizer in this same ay. The home projects of the boys are always interesting, as the following list will show: Boys Kind of project 6 Hens 1 Horses 4 Brood sows 1 Fattening hog 4 Dairy cows 2 Beef calves 1 Acre of corn 3 1 / acres of potatoes 1 5,,g acre beans Evening class-25 farmers working with tobacco. Day unit class-6 boys working with poultry. Home Economics This department has followed the same course as in other years, high school work during the mornings, cornmrmity classes and visits in the after-noon. The high school girls follow the prescribed course but in addition have a great deal of practical experience. This year a project was made with the freshman girls in the dormitory of remodeling and repairing some dresses that had been sent in. As the girls are all working their way through school and often with little help from home, the dresses were a great help as well as a good lesson. The sophomore girls made their commencement dress-es. As the dormitory takes so much time out of school hours the freshman girls this summer will do their projects at home. A class was carried one afternoon each week in Sugarlands, one in Laurel Lick school, and an afternoon class in Gatlinburg for the women. Foods and clothing were taught in the two schools but the Gatlinburg class this past year studied homes. In the spring one kitchen was remodeled, one rearranged, a living room finished and furnished, as well as some other plans talked over. In May Mrs. Zucarello, of the state department, was here for an intensive The September ARROW sewing course and the accomplishments of these days under her are al-most unbelievable. Home visiting was quite a part of the program of this department the past year and one that should bring fine results. The development of the P.T.A. was a real accomplishment and one that was sponsored by this department. Although there was no Gatlinburg Fair the women had a fine exhibit of canning, cooking, sewing, and weaving in the fall. Dormitory Dormitory is a title much too large for our little cottages but not one bit too large for the work done. Any-thing in the line of dormitory life complicates the problems and adds to the expense of the school but there is no question of the big dividends it pays in the training given the boys and girls. That it is recognized is shown by the number of people asking to come to the dormitories, many more than we have any room for. We surely have proved over and over that boys and girls like to be busy and that as long as they are busy problems of discipline are few. Only those who want to go to school and who want to work come so we have a busy crowd most of the time. The first few months they are here the work has to be pretty carefully supervised but they are bright boys and girls and usually make real progress in course of a year. We feel that the training given in practical work is as valuable as that given in the class room. It is not possible to take more than twenty-five boys and girls and we usually do not have more than twenty. The ten in the boys' cottage have been in very crowded quarters but they never complain. We feel, however, that it is better to rent another cottage instead of the one we have rented thepast two years, moving the boy a larger place even though ft from the school. This necessitate ing some place for a wash and ( ing room and already a frienc given half enough to finish a roc the basement of the grade school ing. Last winter when there w much sickness we realized that a heated, crowded house caused difficulties that should be avoid We all feel that here is a big in which to develop boys and girl give valuable training. Health Combining so much of be school and community nursing i such a full program in Gatli. that we would gladly modify it knew how to make changes fc better. There are thirteen schools is district that the nurse visits a several of these schools carries a complete program. It requires l frequent visits and the cooperat. the teacher. Gatlinburg school awarded 2: ribbons the past year, which that each child had had all reme defects corrected, had been imtm against typhoid, diphtheria, smal had kept a satisfactory health record for one month, and had satisfactory school work. One tonsil clinic was held in S ville, twelve from Gatlinburg operated on. A Knoxville dentist contint come one Saturday each moni finds he has fewer patients, d doubt to the people being able. to Sevierville more easily and o: For this same reason the doctor discontinued their afternoons Health Center. While we som wish they did come regularly tl a saving in sterile supplies and as the people now get them for selves in most cases. 66 The September ARROW The past two years preventive tubercular work has been stressed. Several chest clinics have been held, the state sending their specialists for these clinics. An x-ray machine has been added to their equipment, which is of much help. Before the last chest clinic twenty tuberculin tests were given. There are a surprisingly large number of cases and a real effort is being made to put these cases under a home program of care that will be of benefit. The year has brought a good many interesting and hard cases. One baby from two miles above Elkmont has had to be taken to Knoxville frequently for treatment during the entire year. A fifteen-year-old girl with pellagra and leg ulcers was in the Health Center two weeks and while her legs are now healed (after being bad for five years) and she is back at her home in Laurel Lick, she still is under the care of the nurse. The Red Cross supply of milk got-ten this spring has been a great help for these cases. The dormitory pupils and staff have been on the sick list much of the year. Thirteen have been in the Health Center, a good many other sick at the various cottages. If one could stop outside work during these periods it would not be so difficult but as it is one nurse has to go in a good many different directions. Lillie Reagan is always the standby at the hospital and as dependable as ever. The nurse has watched with interest the results of the noon lunch, especially in the cases of the underweights, and has been much gratified with the results. She has given of her time all the year in helping with menus, hand washing, and of course cod liver oil. Perhaps a summing up of some of the work might help to give a little idea of the busy days. Mileage 10,131 iniles Field visits 1,064 Inoculations completed 383 Minor treatments and dressings at hospi tal 718 Little Mothers' classes 11 attendance 86 Home Hygiene classes 16 attendance 172 Mothers' Classes 2 attendance 11 But most difficult of all is the in-ability to cope with the difficult situations that the nurse is sure to find. How to help families in hard financial straits, to get children into the proper institutions, get medical care for those too far away and unable to pay, to solve family problems that you are called on to help with ; all these things complicate the work but also make it a worth-while service. Arro car Craft As the books close June 30 this re-port is not the final one. Arrowcraft, at the beginning o the fiscal year, opened its own books and own bank account. Not the least detail of the business has gone through the other school books. Surely this year there will be no doubt about where we stand when the final report is made. The business has held up well in spite of hard times. Sales have been of about the usual amount and payments prompt. The clubs must have made a great effort to have accomplished this and the results have been evidenced here in the employment given the women and in the prompt payments they have received. Orders from the clubs coming in early in the fall relieved some of the Christmas rush, returning all left-over goods and making final settlement be-fore the books closed helped, a good many clubs keeping the same person in charge was a help to the club and the school. If only the time could come when a club account could be carried under one name instead of The September ARROW several many difficulties would be avoided. The Arrowcraft means more to the community than we can tell and it would be utterly impossible for us to carry this large business, for a real business it is now, without the splendid support the clubs and chapters give. With nine shops in Gatlinburg selling weaving and other home products our cash sales from tourists cannot be expected to be on a very large scale. Also our overhead is much more than any other shop and some materials are of a better grade so prices are some higher in our shop. We do make every effort to send things out that will be lovely, that we can stand behind, and that will be salable. Our real business must be mail and express and the Pi This those who keep it going. Hotel Shop Arrowcraft has made a new venture this spring in putting a shop in the Mountain View Hotel. Mr. Huff built an attractive and very comfortable hotel last year and at once we aspired to a shop in the lobby. The spring was cold and business slow in starting but even this early we feel sure we can say the Shop is going to be a success. It is always interesting to notice the license plates on the cars parked in front of the hotel and even in winter one is surprised at the number of states represented every week-end. While a good many people come for several days there are a good many who stop at the hotel for only a short time and never are near the school. These are the ones who make the Shop worth while. Weaving Teaching weaving in Gatlinburg, like agriculture, home economics and nursing, is a varied program day by day. Imagine having your pupil; tered up and down Roaring Mill Creek, Baskins, and ever: creek, not one family living on proved road, distances you mus being anywhere from a short 1 a woman living in the field b the school to a trip of a half more horseback or on foot. Yo you can wait for some of then until a pleasant day but per: special order must be hurried t: and you go, rain or snow. Love outdoors, the people, and work sential. The seventh and eighth grac have a double period of weavit] school day. These girls do lit sale as their class work is real i tion from the very beginning class comes in the morning, a morning is also the time whe of the women come to the sch supplies, advice, and to make The afternoons are planned fo visits but one cannot have a dc worked out program from day Too many things interfere ti it. During the school year ther been 1,254 calls at the weavin; for supplies, warps, and advic, Strand has made 500 calls homes. I only wish I knew the 13 horseback, and walking these have required. This year, Miss Pratt, a horn onstration agent who has had time off because of poor heal helped in the weaving room. S. weighed materials, made out ders, and been of great help t Strand. She has done this v exchange for her board and 1-i has left Miss Strand time for instruction and has been a ver factory arrangement. There is a meeting for the N women one afternoon each m( The September ARROW th instructive and recreational. first half hour is given to some to subject for instruction.

From 25 to 35 women and although many have long walks and the weather is often am sure they must feel well re-for the effort of coming for the lance is very good. Because of monthly meetings and the home done we receive help from the department for vocational educa-.nd this helps greatly in taking of the salary of the weaving wr. 3s Strand has been with us two and we are looking forward to g her with us again next year.

Wood-working Shop Although this is a year when we are following a most rigid program of economy there is one piece of real development going on. This is possible through the gift of a new wood shop for the school. With no special interest in Pi Phi but a deep one in the development of the boys of the community, Mr. L. E. Voorheis has offered to build and equip a wood-working shop. Mr. Voorheis is from Cincinnati but has been spending much of his time in Gatlinburg for the past four or five years and is wide awake to the needs and the opportunities for help. The shop will be built of rock, will be well planned and equipped, will have a dry kiln and be large enough to keep several boys and men at work. While the boys will be in school part of the time it no doubt will be necessary to work a few men in order to keep up with the furniture orders that are always coming in. This will give an opportunity for the very kind of work we like to have. This is, much the largest individual gift that has ever come to the school and we shall make every effort for it to fulfill the mission it is designed for, However there are absolutely no strings attached to the gift in anyway. The past year Mr. Mattil has continued his wood-working business and the orders have kept from four to seven men busy all the time. There are also two classes each Saturday afternoon for these men and the local basket and furniture makers, subjects discussed being those pertaining to their work, those working in the shop had work along the line of mechanical drawing and designing, as well as construction problems relating to furniture making, with courses continuing at home. The other class was in the nature of a weekly conference of problems arising in their work at home. The September ARROW There is still the feeling that the wood-working department should be under the school management and eventually it must come to that but just now we should be very glad to have Mr. Mattil carry it. Possibly by the first of the year a different arrangement can be made. It may be that the department can be self-supporting, with the aid we receive from the state for this work. Our experience has been, however, that it al-ways takes a few years to put any industry on a self-supporting basis. Community One goes on for several years, not knowing whether much is being accomplished or not. Then suddenly some one thing develops with such rapidity you realize seeds must have been planted and roots growing for some time. Surely this must have been the case of the P.T.A. organization. The women responded too splendidly and loyally for any mushroom growth of community spirit. The thing that stimulated this growth was the need for a noon lunch for the primary and underweight grade children. This had been discontinued for three years but all felt it should be resumed and it was so voted at the 1930 committee meeting. The first steps taken were in the right direction. Members of the staff, particularly the nurse, home economics teacher and grade teachers, visited every home rep-resented in the school. They told the need of a nourishing lunch, the way they hoped it could be managed, and asked for the parents' cooperation in sending vegetables, fruit, etc. Almost every family responded gladly and their interest did not lag during the school year. Each Wednesday after-noon the home economics teacher and the nurse made out the menu for the week and wrote the notes to parents who were to furnish supplies for thosedays. The children bring a lunch fro home and one extra dish is given. may be tomatoes, custard, hot cocoa-plain but nourishing food. During ti fall a box supper was given which ne ted enough to buy spoons, cups, ar bowls for the lunch room. A supp] of paint and an afternoon of wor did wonders to cans, benches, and -b bless The high school girls took tun helping with the dishes and also tE hand-washing of fifty little folks. Two meetings are held each mont] one afternoon meeting devoted to bus ness and one night meeting whic takes the form of a community affai Harp singing, speaking, plays, an games furnished the entertainmen The women conduct the meetings an are continuing them through the sun men I only hope that out of this wi grow a group interested in civic in provement. With the rapidly changin Gatlinburg it is needed and it seen that there are leaders among the won en. For the first time several years Gal linburg did not have a fair. This wa due in part to the bad season for fan and garden crops and also to a lac of timely interest on the part of tb local people. No doubt an off-year i a good thing now an then, and vv are looking forward to a splendid fai this fall. Old Timers' Day continues to be a outstanding community day of th year. People, old and young, enjoy real home day with old friends an neighbors. The contests of spinnin weaving, corn-husking, and in fa( about everything one can imagine c the old days, create much interest an fun. It is the one distinctly Gatlinbur day of the year.

Sugarlands The opening of the school term in August found Mrs. Dowell Eva Hathaway, and Emily Burton back on duty, Mrs. Dowell for her 10th year, Emily for her 13th, and Eva for her fourth. The school was maintained as in other years. The eight grades were taught by Eva and Emily, the county paying their salaries. Mrs. Dowell was on the Pi Phi pay roll as housemother and community worker. Eva had shop work with some of the older boys, Mary Rachel Armstrong, the Gatlin-burg home economics teacher, had a class in Sugarlands one afternoon each week. While the school work has gone very well indeed, the girls have felt dissatisfied with their community accomplishments. The community has been demoralized for some time be-cause of the uncertainties connected with the establishment of the national park. All knew their homes must be sold. Some were glad, some sorry, and all wondered just what would come to pass. While many families moved during the year the enrollment remained large enough to make a two-teacher school necessary and we believe it will be about the same size next year. Our cottage is not yet sold but probably will be soon. However, we will be able to use it as long as there is need of a school there. When the Government really takes over the management of the park area we can look forward to a more settled condition again. In January Mrs. Dowell was very ill and we all had many anxious days. She has become stronger again but we fear for her to be in a place where she is so far from medical care and where there is neither telephone nor auto road. Mrs. Dowell has been such a vital part of the school family for The September ARROW 7] years and has so endeared herself to our group and the people of Gatlin-burg and Sugarlands and her place is so hard to fill, that she will be greatly missed. I have purposely omitted from this report a list of needs and improvements for the coming year. Until times are better and until all indebtedness is cleared .our program is one of the strictest economy. Yet we do not want it to be that which will cause us to go backward instead of forward. On the report of the treasurer the first of July will depend many of our plans for the coming year. Contributions came in wonderfully last year in spiteof difficult times and we believe the: will again this spring.

Reports from chapter representatives to college Panhellenics have been studied, however, and help has been given with the individual problems reported to her. She has maintained close relations with the N.P.C. Chairman of the Committee on College Panhellenics and has worked for the adjustment of all difficulties which involved Pi Beta Phi chapters. The record of the fraternity for ethical rushing is an enviable one and the past two years have found the fraternity free from any drastic penalization for the breaking of rushing rules. She urges, however, a still keener reali-zation on the part of individual members of the fraternity of their responsibility for keeping both the spirit and the letter of all rushing rules. No chapter, she honestly believes, deliberately breaks rushing rules; some are discredited because individual members thoughtlessly do break them. On some campuses, bid day is that in name only since all groups know definitely beforehand just what rushees are to be their pledges. Such a violation of the spirit of preferential bid-ding can but bring discredit to the fraternity system.

To revive a lost handicraft is indeed a 11l thing, and we are fortunate been chosen' as the school in his is to be done. It shows a finite appraisal of, and high nt to, the work we are doing nburg. It will be the largest individual gift we have ever received. Under the guidance of Mr. Mattil, it should give wonderful opportunities to our boys for learning a new trade. Our school continues to take and keep its place among other mountain schools, and to make its contribution towards the solving of mountain school problems. It is a charter member of the newly-organized Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. We also have close connections with other agencies through the Mountain Workers Conference where we are well represented. In state and county teachers meetings, health conferences, Future Farmers of Tennessee organizations, and other educational groups, we are ably represented by our staff. Every member of the committee has had a busy and happy year working for the school. The duties of each are different, and the wholehearted way in which they have carried them out has been a joy to witness. The clear vision and helpful discussion of school problems in the round robins has greatly lightened the duties of the chairman. Blanche Curtis' duties have not been easy, for accidents will prevent the getting of copy on time, and disappointments were many. She has patiently borne with these, and given the fraternity clear-cut glimpses of what is being done at the school through the "Little Pigeon News." It is with regret that we recognize that her term of office is over, and with great appreciation, that we acknowledge the splendid way in which she has conducted her department in THE ARROW, and faithfully performed her secretarial duties. Helen Tottle has put the slides in order, and cared for requests for the slides and films, and arranged the In-formation Folder regarding the school, which is delighting you all. Rebecca White has had many and demanding duties which have kept her constantly busy. Letters to fraternity The September ARROW officers, alum= clubs, active chapters, and seniors of 1929 and 1930 have been written. She has issued Settlement School program material to eighteen clubs and three chapters, as well as material on the school and mountain people to individuals and other groups. She has maintained a very close contact with the Central Office and the Magazine Agency that was mutually beneficial. In the spring she conducted a survey of the interest that the club members take in the school through a questionnaire. The answers were tabulated. In addition she gathered together the statistical data which is chartered in the Settlement School exhibit at this Convention. Her carefulness, thoroughness, and deep interest could not be surpassed. For our treasurer, Grace Post, only words of the highest commendation can be used. She has been untiring in her efforts to simplify the books, and give the audit a form which will make it clear to all how we stand from year to year. This has been a discouraging year for her, as for all the committee since contributions have been slow in coming in, and in some instances there has been a substantial reduction under the previous year. Last July we cut our budget for this year to the lowest possible figure. Now we face the fact that we may not receive what we had budgeted for. We realize that clubs and chapters are doing their utmost to carry on as in previous years, and we are making no complaint. We must, however, let you know frankly the situation that is facing your Settlement School. The debt for the Indus-trial Building is large. It will be years before it is paid off at the present rate of reduction, and before that occurs, we are not justified in undertaking any new project, however badly needed. We do not, however, anticipate a reduction of staff or salaries, or a curtailment of present work so long asthe clubs, chapters, and individua wial continue to give their support in the past. We feel sure that we c count on you to continue to do wh you have done. The Chairman's duties have been pleasure because of the splendid c operation on the part of every mer ber of the Committee. She is deeply a preciative of this, and more than hap] to have had the opportunity and pH.), lege of knowing intimately such sple did women. In November, she may a visit to the school to accept ti wood-working shop. A visit of tl Founders had been planned for th time, but unfortunately none of the could come. In April, a conference three members of the committee w held at the home of Rebecca White. was deemed necessary to discuss ce taro problems and make some decisio: before committee meeting in Augur At the next meeting your Chairman r gretfully gives up her position aft four years of very happy servi for the Settlement School. She begs thank all those who have made h work a pleasure: To her Committ she gives a warm, affectionate a preciation of their sympathetic undt standing of the problems of the schc and their close cooperation in tryi: to forward the work there. To Gra: Council members, and in particular the Grand President, she expresses deep gratefulness for the patience a wisdom that have been shown in a vising her. To the Director of t School her heart goes out in tr admiration and heartfelt love for she has given of time and thought helping her work as chairman, a making it easier, and giving so mu and so generously of herself in friet ship. For the members of the staff the school she desires to express I pride that she feels, as does all Pi P in the accomplishments that they so successfully achieving through th work in the school.

EDITH H. GORDON Report of the Director of the Pi Beta Phi Settle ent School THE report for 1930-31 'ollows closely that of 1929-30. This s to be expected under existing conlitions. The number in school would laturally continue about the same as tie cannot take more boarding pupils Lnd the daily attendance changes but ittle from year to year. The several lepartments of the school have coninued along the same lines with no hought of further development at )resent but a real effort to keep from aking any backward steps during this ime of financial depression. It has )een necessary for us to cut our bud--.et each year for the past three and Lgain this year we shall do the same, ret this we hope has not been done Frith serious results to the real work )f the school. Few schools have taken is small a cut as we have and again ve have our loyal Pi Phis to thank or their untiring efforts. There never tas been more positive proof of the )lace the schoOl holds in the hearts of he many, many Pi Phis than this coninued support during these difficult imes. Not only the contributions but he Arrowcraft business held up to Llmost the same fine mark. Surely here must have been a larger amount )f interest and energy expended to ac-:omplish these results than ever be-ore. The Smoky Mountain National Park s now assured and practically all the lecessary land has been turned over o the Government. While the park will tome to within a half mile of Gatlin-)urg we do not anticipate many :hanges for the school. Sugarlands is n the park area and we feel reasonibly sure that our extension work therewill end in the spring. All that will depend on the number of families remaining in that area of the park. Al-ready a great many tourists are coming, both winter and summer. Coming into Gatlinburg over a good highway and stopping at a comfortable modern hotel causes many Pi Phis to think the work of the school must be about over. Not so. Stop long enough to look a bit further and think a bit deeper and you will be convinced that there is still plenty to do. In fact each year brings more instead of less. Who dreamed all this when the school was first established ? Who would dream now of stopping? The challenge continues. The staff for the year has been: Evelyn Bishop, New York Alpha director. William King, University of Tennessee prin cipal, mathematics and science, seventh and tenth grades. Vivian Blair, Oregon Alpha English and history. Barbara Horton, Missouri Gamma fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri Beta second and third grades. Eleanor Brabson, East Tennessee Normal primer and first grade. Mary Rachel Armstrong, University of Tennessee home economics. F. D. Smith, University of Tennessee Smith Hughes Agriculture. Victoria Strand weaving. LaDelle Allen, Arkansas Alpha Arrowcraft. Elizabeth Cooke accountant. Frances Moore nurse. Mrs. Rorex girls' dormitory and manager boarding department. Miss Niblock housemother, boys' dormitory. Mrs. Dowell, Iowa Beta housemother, community worker, Sugarlands. Eva Hathaway, Iowa Beta principal fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, Sugar-lands. Emily Burton, Tennessee Alpha first, second, third, and fourth grades, Sugarlands. Miss Glover assistant in the high school, and Miss Pratt, assistant in the weaving de partment, were volunteer workers. The September ARROW The following local people were on the staff : Veatress Parton Arrowcraft Shop. Alice McCarter Arrowcraft Shop. Lillie Reagan assistant at the hospital. Ernest Reagan general work. Arlie McCarter gardens, furnaces, general work. Ambrose Ogle farm, supervisor of student labor of boys. Martha Cole cook. 011ie Higdon cook. School Although we had a new principal for the school and one new grade teacher, the work ran smoothly from the start and we can report a good school year. The total enrollment for the year was 170. Of this number 124 were in the first six grades and 46 in the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades. The changes made in the grade building of putting primer and first grade in one room, second, and third grades in the next, and fourth, fifth, and sixth grades in the third room proved much more satisfactory than having the first three grades in one room. It evened up numbers and work much better. The county allows us salaries for four grade teachers so the grade work is not carried at a financial loss. The state will also allow us this year a small amount per pupil for high school work. While the sum is not large we feel it will increase year by year and it will relieve some of our hardest working pupils of having to earn their tuition. Also this amount will be in cash instead of being worked out .by the pupils. Six pupils completed eighth grade and six completed second year high school. Of those who finished their work here all will probably go on to some other school to finish their course. There is a plea all the time for four years of high school here. This comes from the university as well as the people here, for they say so fewschools provide ways wherf can work their way througl training they receive ot school hours is of so mu HoweVer we cannot think 4 those two years yet for it wositate more room for board: and we are overcrowded no. The boys have had a goc ball team, Mr. King, the coaching. The girls did not side teams but instead had a club.

Cow feed was bought and the boys -eighed and mixed it. Calls from arents of the boys were answered and eip giving in pruning, spraying, and le treating of sick animals. The F.F.T. organization was a wide-wake one. The boys sent two repremtatives to Nashville for the state invention in the spring and several [an to attend the summer camp for a loft time. The purpose of the club, quote Mr. Smith's report is "to :rengthen the confidence of the count' boy in himself, in country life ad in the business of farming." The Pi Beta Phi Chapter holds a tembership in the Sevier County arm Bureau. This year the boys premted a loving cup to be given to the (ost outstanding high school girl, her ame to be engraved on the cup. The ame of Adis Clabo was put on the ap. Adis is from Wears Valley. This an honor well worth working for tad the first of the kind to be estabshed in the school. A day unit class was held at Laurel ick, ten boys were enrolled and their .ork was with small shop tools. This spring six of the boys are rais-1g chicks gotten from the school ock. The boys painted a room in the :hoolhouse and erected a forty-foot agpole on the, school grounds. The Wears Valley class has been aid the past year for men instead of )ys. Thirty-six adult farmers took up le study of Burley tobacco raising. he individual work with the farmers ill continue through the summer. The farmers in the vicinity of atlinburg, under the direction of Le school agricultural department, )ught cooperatively twelve tons of Lttle feed at a material saving. Sev-.al bought fertilizer in this same ay. The home projects of the boys are always interesting, as the following list will show: Boys Kind of project 6 Hens 1 Horses 4 Brood sows 1 Fattening hog 4 Dairy cows 2 Beef calves 1 Acre of corn 3 1 / acres of potatoes 1 5,,g acre beans Evening class-25 farmers working with tobacco. Day unit class-6 boys working with poultry. Home Economics This department has followed the same course as in other years, high school work during the mornings, cornmrmity classes and visits in the after-noon. The high school girls follow the prescribed course but in addition have a great deal of practical experience. This year a project was made with the freshman girls in the dormitory of remodeling and repairing some dresses that had been sent in. As the girls are all working their way through school and often with little help from home, the dresses were a great help as well as a good lesson. The sophomore girls made their commencement dress-es. As the dormitory takes so much time out of school hours the freshman girls this summer will do their projects at home. A class was carried one afternoon each week in Sugarlands, one in Laurel Lick school, and an afternoon class in Gatlinburg for the women. Foods and clothing were taught in the two schools but the Gatlinburg class this past year studied homes. In the spring one kitchen was remodeled, one rearranged, a living room finished and furnished, as well as some other plans talked over. In May Mrs. Zucarello, of the state department, was here for an intensive The September ARROW sewing course and the accomplishments of these days under her are al-most unbelievable. Home visiting was quite a part of the program of this department the past year and one that should bring fine results. The development of the P.T.A. was a real accomplishment and one that was sponsored by this department. Although there was no Gatlinburg Fair the women had a fine exhibit of canning, cooking, sewing, and weaving in the fall. Dormitory Dormitory is a title much too large for our little cottages but not one bit too large for the work done. Any-thing in the line of dormitory life complicates the problems and adds to the expense of the school but there is no question of the big dividends it pays in the training given the boys and girls. That it is recognized is shown by the number of people asking to come to the dormitories, many more than we have any room for. We surely have proved over and over that boys and girls like to be busy and that as long as they are busy problems of discipline are few. Only those who want to go to school and who want to work come so we have a busy crowd most of the time. The first few months they are here the work has to be pretty carefully supervised but they are bright boys and girls and usually make real progress in course of a year. We feel that the training given in practical work is as valuable as that given in the class room. It is not possible to take more than twenty-five boys and girls and we usually do not have more than twenty. The ten in the boys' cottage have been in very crowded quarters but they never complain. We feel, however, that it is better to rent another cottage instead of the one we have rented thepast two years, moving the boy a larger place even though ft from the school. This necessitate ing some place for a wash and ( ing room and already a frienc given half enough to finish a roc the basement of the grade school ing. Last winter when there w much sickness we realized that a heated, crowded house caused difficulties that should be avoid We all feel that here is a big in which to develop boys and girl give valuable training. Health Combining so much of be school and community nursing i such a full program in Gatli. that we would gladly modify it knew how to make changes fc better. There are thirteen schools is district that the nurse visits a several of these schools carries a complete program. It requires l frequent visits and the cooperat. the teacher. Gatlinburg school awarded 2: ribbons the past year, which that each child had had all reme defects corrected, had been imtm against typhoid, diphtheria, smal had kept a satisfactory health record for one month, and had satisfactory school work. One tonsil clinic was held in S ville, twelve from Gatlinburg operated on. A Knoxville dentist contint come one Saturday each moni finds he has fewer patients, d doubt to the people being able. to Sevierville more easily and o: For this same reason the doctor discontinued their afternoons Health Center. While we som wish they did come regularly tl a saving in sterile supplies and as the people now get them for selves in most cases. 66 The September ARROW The past two years preventive tubercular work has been stressed. Several chest clinics have been held, the state sending their specialists for these clinics. An x-ray machine has been added to their equipment, which is of much help. Before the last chest clinic twenty tuberculin tests were given. There are a surprisingly large number of cases and a real effort is being made to put these cases under a home program of care that will be of benefit. The year has brought a good many interesting and hard cases. One baby from two miles above Elkmont has had to be taken to Knoxville frequently for treatment during the entire year. A fifteen-year-old girl with pellagra and leg ulcers was in the Health Center two weeks and while her legs are now healed (after being bad for five years) and she is back at her home in Laurel Lick, she still is under the care of the nurse. The Red Cross supply of milk got-ten this spring has been a great help for these cases. The dormitory pupils and staff have been on the sick list much of the year. Thirteen have been in the Health Center, a good many other sick at the various cottages. If one could stop outside work during these periods it would not be so difficult but as it is one nurse has to go in a good many different directions. Lillie Reagan is always the standby at the hospital and as dependable as ever. The nurse has watched with interest the results of the noon lunch, especially in the cases of the underweights, and has been much gratified with the results. She has given of her time all the year in helping with menus, hand washing, and of course cod liver oil. Perhaps a summing up of some of the work might help to give a little idea of the busy days. Mileage 10,131 iniles Field visits 1,064 Inoculations completed 383 Minor treatments and dressings at hospi tal 718 Little Mothers' classes 11 attendance 86 Home Hygiene classes 16 attendance 172 Mothers' Classes 2 attendance 11 But most difficult of all is the in-ability to cope with the difficult situations that the nurse is sure to find. How to help families in hard financial straits, to get children into the proper institutions, get medical care for those too far away and unable to pay, to solve family problems that you are called on to help with ; all these things complicate the work but also make it a worth-while service. Arro car Craft As the books close June 30 this re-port is not the final one. Arrowcraft, at the beginning o the fiscal year, opened its own books and own bank account. Not the least detail of the business has gone through the other school books. Surely this year there will be no doubt about where we stand when the final report is made. The business has held up well in spite of hard times. Sales have been of about the usual amount and payments prompt. The clubs must have made a great effort to have accomplished this and the results have been evidenced here in the employment given the women and in the prompt payments they have received. Orders from the clubs coming in early in the fall relieved some of the Christmas rush, returning all left-over goods and making final settlement be-fore the books closed helped, a good many clubs keeping the same person in charge was a help to the club and the school. If only the time could come when a club account could be carried under one name instead of The September ARROW several many difficulties would be avoided. The Arrowcraft means more to the community than we can tell and it would be utterly impossible for us to carry this large business, for a real business it is now, without the splendid support the clubs and chapters give. With nine shops in Gatlinburg selling weaving and other home products our cash sales from tourists cannot be expected to be on a very large scale. Also our overhead is much more than any other shop and some materials are of a better grade so prices are some higher in our shop. We do make every effort to send things out that will be lovely, that we can stand behind, and that will be salable. Our real business must be mail and express and the Pi This those who keep it going. Hotel Shop Arrowcraft has made a new venture this spring in putting a shop in the Mountain View Hotel. Mr. Huff built an attractive and very comfortable hotel last year and at once we aspired to a shop in the lobby. The spring was cold and business slow in starting but even this early we feel sure we can say the Shop is going to be a success. It is always interesting to notice the license plates on the cars parked in front of the hotel and even in winter one is surprised at the number of states represented every week-end. While a good many people come for several days there are a good many who stop at the hotel for only a short time and never are near the school. These are the ones who make the Shop worth while. Weaving Teaching weaving in Gatlinburg, like agriculture, home economics and nursing, is a varied program day by day. Imagine having your pupil; tered up and down Roaring Mill Creek, Baskins, and ever: creek, not one family living on proved road, distances you mus being anywhere from a short 1 a woman living in the field b the school to a trip of a half more horseback or on foot. Yo you can wait for some of then until a pleasant day but per: special order must be hurried t: and you go, rain or snow. Love outdoors, the people, and work sential. The seventh and eighth grac have a double period of weavit] school day. These girls do lit sale as their class work is real i tion from the very beginning class comes in the morning, a morning is also the time whe of the women come to the sch supplies, advice, and to make The afternoons are planned fo visits but one cannot have a dc worked out program from day Too many things interfere ti it. During the school year ther been 1,254 calls at the weavin; for supplies, warps, and advic, Strand has made 500 calls homes. I only wish I knew the 13 horseback, and walking these have required. This year, Miss Pratt, a horn onstration agent who has had time off because of poor heal helped in the weaving room. S. weighed materials, made out ders, and been of great help t Strand. She has done this v exchange for her board and 1-i has left Miss Strand time for instruction and has been a ver factory arrangement.

Because of monthly meetings and the home done we receive help from the department for vocational educa-.nd this helps greatly in taking of the salary of the weaving wr. 3s Strand has been with us two and we are looking forward to g her with us again next year.

Wood-working Shop Although this is a year when we are following a most rigid program of economy there is one piece of real development going on. This is possible through the gift of a new wood shop for the school. With no special interest in Pi Phi but a deep one in the development of the boys of the community, Mr. L. E. Voorheis has offered to build and equip a wood-working shop. Mr. Voorheis is from Cincinnati but has been spending much of his time in Gatlinburg for the past four or five years and is wide awake to the needs and the opportunities for help. The shop will be built of rock, will be well planned and equipped, will have a dry kiln and be large enough to keep several boys and men at work. While the boys will be in school part of the time it no doubt will be necessary to work a few men in order to keep up with the furniture orders that are always coming in. This will give an opportunity for the very kind of work we like to have. This is, much the largest individual gift that has ever come to the school and we shall make every effort for it to fulfill the mission it is designed for, However there are absolutely no strings attached to the gift in anyway. The past year Mr. Mattil has continued his wood-working business and the orders have kept from four to seven men busy all the time. There are also two classes each Saturday afternoon for these men and the local basket and furniture makers, subjects discussed being those pertaining to their work, those working in the shop had work along the line of mechanical drawing and designing, as well as construction problems relating to furniture making, with courses continuing at home. The other class was in the nature of a weekly conference of problems arising in their work at home. The September ARROW There is still the feeling that the wood-working department should be under the school management and eventually it must come to that but just now we should be very glad to have Mr. Mattil carry it. Possibly by the first of the year a different arrangement can be made. It may be that the department can be self-supporting, with the aid we receive from the state for this work. Our experience has been, however, that it al-ways takes a few years to put any industry on a self-supporting basis. Community One goes on for several years, not knowing whether much is being accomplished or not. Then suddenly some one thing develops with such rapidity you realize seeds must have been planted and roots growing for some time. Surely this must have been the case of the P.T.A. organization. The women responded too splendidly and loyally for any mushroom growth of community spirit. The thing that stimulated this growth was the need for a noon lunch for the primary and underweight grade children. This had been discontinued for three years but all felt it should be resumed and it was so voted at the 1930 committee meeting. The first steps taken were in the right direction. Members of the staff, particularly the nurse, home economics teacher and grade teachers, visited every home rep-resented in the school. They told the need of a nourishing lunch, the way they hoped it could be managed, and asked for the parents' cooperation in sending vegetables, fruit, etc. Almost every family responded gladly and their interest did not lag during the school year. Each Wednesday after-noon the home economics teacher and the nurse made out the menu for the week and wrote the notes to parents who were to furnish supplies for thosedays. The children bring a lunch fro home and one extra dish is given. may be tomatoes, custard, hot cocoa-plain but nourishing food. During ti fall a box supper was given which ne ted enough to buy spoons, cups, ar bowls for the lunch room. A supp] of paint and an afternoon of wor did wonders to cans, benches, and -b bless The high school girls took tun helping with the dishes and also tE hand-washing of fifty little folks. Two meetings are held each mont] one afternoon meeting devoted to bus ness and one night meeting whic takes the form of a community affai Harp singing, speaking, plays, an games furnished the entertainmen The women conduct the meetings an are continuing them through the sun men I only hope that out of this wi grow a group interested in civic in provement. With the rapidly changin Gatlinburg it is needed and it seen that there are leaders among the won en. For the first time several years Gal linburg did not have a fair. This wa due in part to the bad season for fan and garden crops and also to a lac of timely interest on the part of tb local people. No doubt an off-year i a good thing now an then, and vv are looking forward to a splendid fai this fall. Old Timers' Day continues to be a outstanding community day of th year. People, old and young, enjoy real home day with old friends an neighbors. The contests of spinnin weaving, corn-husking, and in fa( about everything one can imagine c the old days, create much interest an fun. It is the one distinctly Gatlinbur day of the year.

Sugarlands The opening of the school term in August found Mrs. Dowell Eva Hathaway, and Emily Burton back on duty, Mrs. Dowell for her 10th year, Emily for her 13th, and Eva for her fourth. The school was maintained as in other years. The eight grades were taught by Eva and Emily, the county paying their salaries. Mrs. Dowell was on the Pi Phi pay roll as housemother and community worker. Eva had shop work with some of the older boys, Mary Rachel Armstrong, the Gatlin-burg home economics teacher, had a class in Sugarlands one afternoon each week. While the school work has gone very well indeed, the girls have felt dissatisfied with their community accomplishments. The community has been demoralized for some time be-cause of the uncertainties connected with the establishment of the national park. All knew their homes must be sold. Some were glad, some sorry, and all wondered just what would come to pass. While many families moved during the year the enrollment remained large enough to make a two-teacher school necessary and we believe it will be about the same size next year. Our cottage is not yet sold but probably will be soon. However, we will be able to use it as long as there is need of a school there. When the Government really takes over the management of the park area we can look forward to a more settled condition again. In January Mrs. Dowell was very ill and we all had many anxious days. She has become stronger again but we fear for her to be in a place where she is so far from medical care and where there is neither telephone nor auto road. Mrs. Dowell has been such a vital part of the school family for The September ARROW 7] years and has so endeared herself to our group and the people of Gatlin-burg and Sugarlands and her place is so hard to fill, that she will be greatly missed. I have purposely omitted from this report a list of needs and improvements for the coming year. Until times are better and until all indebtedness is cleared .our program is one of the strictest economy. Yet we do not want it to be that which will cause us to go backward instead of forward. On the report of the treasurer the first of July will depend many of our plans for the coming year. Contributions came in wonderfully last year in spiteof difficult times and we believe the: will again this spring. Because of illness in my family i was necessary for me to live awa: from the school from September t( May. The staff so willing carried a much of my work as it could, in addi tion to its own, Council and Corn mittee were most considerate and for giving of my shortcomings and thos( who have waited an unduly long tim( for letters to be answered have beer more than patient.

Reports from chapter representatives to college Panhellenics have been studied, however, and help has been given with the individual problems reported to her. She has maintained close relations with the N.P.C. Chairman of the Committee on College Panhellenics and has worked for the adjustment of all difficulties which involved Pi Beta Phi chapters. The record of the fraternity for ethical rushing is an enviable one and the past two years have found the fraternity free from any drastic penalization for the breaking of rushing rules. She urges, however, a still keener reali-zation on the part of individual members of the fraternity of their responsibility for keeping both the spirit and the letter of all rushing rules. No chapter, she honestly believes, deliberately breaks rushing rules; some are discredited because individual members thoughtlessly do break them. On some campuses, bid day is that in name only since all groups know definitely beforehand just what rushees are to be their pledges. Such a violation of the spirit of preferential bid-ding can but bring discredit to the fraternity system. The condition can-not be remedied by any one fraternity but Pi Beta Phi chapters could well be the leaders in bringing about a correct use of the preferential bidding

        i.2 ;he thanks the members of the frater-Iity---clubs, active chapters, and indiriduals as well as interested friends, The September ARROW for their generous support of the school. EDITH H. GORDON Report of the Director of the Pi Beta Phi Settle ent School THE report for 1930-31 'ollows closely that of 1929-30. This s to be expected under existing conlitions. The number in school would laturally continue about the same as tie cannot take more boarding pupils Lnd the daily attendance changes but ittle from year to year. The several lepartments of the school have coninued along the same lines with no hought of further development at )resent but a real effort to keep from aking any backward steps during this ime of financial depression. It has )een necessary for us to cut our bud--.et each year for the past three and Lgain this year we shall do the same, ret this we hope has not been done Frith serious results to the real work )f the school. Few schools have taken is small a cut as we have and again ve have our loyal Pi Phis to thank or their untiring efforts. There never tas been more positive proof of the )lace the schoOl holds in the hearts of he many, many Pi Phis than this coninued support during these difficult imes. Not only the contributions but he Arrowcraft business held up to Llmost the same fine mark. Surely here must have been a larger amount )f interest and energy expended to ac-:omplish these results than ever be-ore. The Smoky Mountain National Park s now assured and practically all the lecessary land has been turned over o the Government. While the park will tome to within a half mile of Gatlin-)urg we do not anticipate many :hanges for the school. Sugarlands is n the park area and we feel reasonibly sure that our extension work therewill end in the spring. All that will depend on the number of families remaining in that area of the park. Al-ready a great many tourists are coming, both winter and summer. Coming into Gatlinburg over a good highway and stopping at a comfortable modern hotel causes many Pi Phis to think the work of the school must be about over. Not so. Stop long enough to look a bit further and think a bit deeper and you will be convinced that there is still plenty to do. In fact each year brings more instead of less. Who dreamed all this when the school was first established ? Who would dream now of stopping? The challenge continues. The staff for the year has been: Evelyn Bishop, New York Alpha director. William King, University of Tennessee prin cipal, mathematics and science, seventh and tenth grades. Vivian Blair, Oregon Alpha English and history. Barbara Horton, Missouri Gamma fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri Beta second and third grades. Eleanor Brabson, East Tennessee Normal primer and first grade. Mary Rachel Armstrong, University of Tennessee home economics. F. D. Smith, University of Tennessee Smith Hughes Agriculture. Victoria Strand weaving. LaDelle Allen, Arkansas Alpha Arrowcraft.

Emily Burton, Tennessee Alpha first, second, third, and fourth grades, Sugarlands. Miss Glover assistant in the high school, and Miss Pratt, assistant in the weaving de partment, were volunteer workers.

Ernest Reagan general work. Arlie McCarter gardens, furnaces, general work. Ambrose Ogle farm, supervisor of student labor of boys. Martha Cole cook. 011ie Higdon cook. School Although we had a new principal for the school and one new grade teacher, the work ran smoothly from the start and we can report a good school year. The total enrollment for the year was 170. Of this number 124 were in the first six grades and 46 in the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades. The changes made in the grade building of putting primer and first grade in one room, second, and third grades in the next, and fourth, fifth, and sixth grades in the third room proved much more satisfactory than having the first three grades in one room. It evened up numbers and work much better. The county allows us salaries for four grade teachers so the grade work is not carried at a financial loss. The state will also allow us this year a small amount per pupil for high school work. While the sum is not large we feel it will increase year by year and it will relieve some of our hardest working pupils of having to earn their tuition. Also this amount will be in cash instead of being worked out .by the pupils. Six pupils completed eighth grade and six completed second year high school. Of those who finished their work here all will probably go on to some other school to finish their course. There is a plea all the time for four years of high school here. This comes from the university as well as the people here, for they say so fewschools provide ways wherf can work their way througl training they receive ot school hours is of so mu HoweVer we cannot think 4 those two years yet for it wositate more room for board: and we are overcrowded no.

Cow feed was bought and the boys -eighed and mixed it. Calls from arents of the boys were answered and eip giving in pruning, spraying, and le treating of sick animals. The F.F.T. organization was a wide-wake one. The boys sent two repremtatives to Nashville for the state invention in the spring and several [an to attend the summer camp for a loft time. The purpose of the club, quote Mr. Smith's report is "to :rengthen the confidence of the count' boy in himself, in country life ad in the business of farming." The Pi Beta Phi Chapter holds a tembership in the Sevier County arm Bureau. This year the boys premted a loving cup to be given to the (ost outstanding high school girl, her ame to be engraved on the cup. The ame of Adis Clabo was put on the ap. Adis is from Wears Valley. This an honor well worth working for tad the first of the kind to be estabshed in the school. A day unit class was held at Laurel ick, ten boys were enrolled and their .ork was with small shop tools.

Day unit class-6 boys working with poultry. Home Economics This department has followed the same course as in other years, high school work during the mornings, cornmrmity classes and visits in the after-noon. The high school girls follow the prescribed course but in addition have a great deal of practical experience. This year a project was made with the freshman girls in the dormitory of remodeling and repairing some dresses that had been sent in. As the girls are all working their way through school and often with little help from home, the dresses were a great help as well as a good lesson. The sophomore girls made their commencement dress-es. As the dormitory takes so much time out of school hours the freshman girls this summer will do their projects at home. A class was carried one afternoon each week in Sugarlands, one in Laurel Lick school, and an afternoon class in Gatlinburg for the women. Foods and clothing were taught in the two schools but the Gatlinburg class this past year studied homes. In the spring one kitchen was remodeled, one rearranged, a living room finished and furnished, as well as some other plans talked over. In May Mrs. Zucarello, of the state department, was here for an intensive The September ARROW sewing course and the accomplishments of these days under her are al-most unbelievable. Home visiting was quite a part of the program of this department the past year and one that should bring fine results. The development of the P.T.A. was a real accomplishment and one that was sponsored by this department. Although there was no Gatlinburg Fair the women had a fine exhibit of canning, cooking, sewing, and weaving in the fall. Dormitory Dormitory is a title much too large for our little cottages but not one bit too large for the work done. Any-thing in the line of dormitory life complicates the problems and adds to the expense of the school but there is no question of the big dividends it pays in the training given the boys and girls. That it is recognized is shown by the number of people asking to come to the dormitories, many more than we have any room for. We surely have proved over and over that boys and girls like to be busy and that as long as they are busy problems of discipline are few. Only those who want to go to school and who want to work come so we have a busy crowd most of the time. The first few months they are here the work has to be pretty carefully supervised but they are bright boys and girls and usually make real progress in course of a year. We feel that the training given in practical work is as valuable as that given in the class room. It is not possible to take more than twenty-five boys and girls and we usually do not have more than twenty. The ten in the boys' cottage have been in very crowded quarters but they never complain. We feel, however, that it is better to rent another cottage instead of the one we have rented thepast two years, moving the boy a larger place even though ft from the school. This necessitate ing some place for a wash and ( ing room and already a frienc given half enough to finish a roc the basement of the grade school ing. Last winter when there w much sickness we realized that a heated, crowded house caused difficulties that should be avoid We all feel that here is a big in which to develop boys and girl give valuable training. Health Combining so much of be school and community nursing i such a full program in Gatli. that we would gladly modify it knew how to make changes fc better. There are thirteen schools is district that the nurse visits a several of these schools carries a complete program. It requires l frequent visits and the cooperat. the teacher. Gatlinburg school awarded 2: ribbons the past year, which that each child had had all reme defects corrected, had been imtm against typhoid, diphtheria, smal had kept a satisfactory health record for one month, and had satisfactory school work. One tonsil clinic was held in S ville, twelve from Gatlinburg operated on. A Knoxville dentist contint come one Saturday each moni finds he has fewer patients, d doubt to the people being able. to Sevierville more easily and o: For this same reason the doctor discontinued their afternoons Health Center. While we som wish they did come regularly tl a saving in sterile supplies and as the people now get them for selves in most cases. 66 The September ARROW The past two years preventive tubercular work has been stressed. Several chest clinics have been held, the state sending their specialists for these clinics. An x-ray machine has been added to their equipment, which is of much help. Before the last chest clinic twenty tuberculin tests were given. There are a surprisingly large number of cases and a real effort is being made to put these cases under a home program of care that will be of benefit. The year has brought a good many interesting and hard cases. One baby from two miles above Elkmont has had to be taken to Knoxville frequently for treatment during the entire year. A fifteen-year-old girl with pellagra and leg ulcers was in the Health Center two weeks and while her legs are now healed (after being bad for five years) and she is back at her home in Laurel Lick, she still is under the care of the nurse. The Red Cross supply of milk got-ten this spring has been a great help for these cases. The dormitory pupils and staff have been on the sick list much of the year. Thirteen have been in the Health Center, a good many other sick at the various cottages. If one could stop outside work during these periods it would not be so difficult but as it is one nurse has to go in a good many different directions. Lillie Reagan is always the standby at the hospital and as dependable as ever. The nurse has watched with interest the results of the noon lunch, especially in the cases of the underweights, and has been much gratified with the results. She has given of her time all the year in helping with menus, hand washing, and of course cod liver oil. Perhaps a summing up of some of the work might help to give a little idea of the busy days. Mileage 10,131 iniles Field visits 1,064 Inoculations completed 383 Minor treatments and dressings at hospi tal 718 Little Mothers' classes 11 attendance 86 Home Hygiene classes 16 attendance 172 Mothers' Classes 2 attendance 11 But most difficult of all is the in-ability to cope with the difficult situations that the nurse is sure to find. How to help families in hard financial straits, to get children into the proper institutions, get medical care for those too far away and unable to pay, to solve family problems that you are called on to help with ; all these things complicate the work but also make it a worth-while service. Arro car Craft As the books close June 30 this re-port is not the final one. Arrowcraft, at the beginning o the fiscal year, opened its own books and own bank account. Not the least detail of the business has gone through the other school books. Surely this year there will be no doubt about where we stand when the final report is made. The business has held up well in spite of hard times. Sales have been of about the usual amount and payments prompt. The clubs must have made a great effort to have accomplished this and the results have been evidenced here in the employment given the women and in the prompt payments they have received. Orders from the clubs coming in early in the fall relieved some of the Christmas rush, returning all left-over goods and making final settlement be-fore the books closed helped, a good many clubs keeping the same person in charge was a help to the club and the school. If only the time could come when a club account could be carried under one name instead of The September ARROW several many difficulties would be avoided. The Arrowcraft means more to the community than we can tell and it would be utterly impossible for us to carry this large business, for a real business it is now, without the splendid support the clubs and chapters give. With nine shops in Gatlinburg selling weaving and other home products our cash sales from tourists cannot be expected to be on a very large scale. Also our overhead is much more than any other shop and some materials are of a better grade so prices are some higher in our shop. We do make every effort to send things out that will be lovely, that we can stand behind, and that will be salable. Our real business must be mail and express and the Pi This those who keep it going. Hotel Shop Arrowcraft has made a new venture this spring in putting a shop in the Mountain View Hotel. Mr. Huff built an attractive and very comfortable hotel last year and at once we aspired to a shop in the lobby. The spring was cold and business slow in starting but even this early we feel sure we can say the Shop is going to be a success. It is always interesting to notice the license plates on the cars parked in front of the hotel and even in winter one is surprised at the number of states represented every week-end. While a good many people come for several days there are a good many who stop at the hotel for only a short time and never are near the school. These are the ones who make the Shop worth while. Weaving Teaching weaving in Gatlinburg, like agriculture, home economics and nursing, is a varied program day by day. Imagine having your pupil; tered up and down Roaring Mill Creek, Baskins, and ever: creek, not one family living on proved road, distances you mus being anywhere from a short 1 a woman living in the field b the school to a trip of a half more horseback or on foot. Yo you can wait for some of then until a pleasant day but per: special order must be hurried t: and you go, rain or snow. Love outdoors, the people, and work sential. The seventh and eighth grac have a double period of weavit] school day. These girls do lit sale as their class work is real i tion from the very beginning class comes in the morning, a morning is also the time whe of the women come to the sch supplies, advice, and to make The afternoons are planned fo visits but one cannot have a dc worked out program from day Too many things interfere ti it. During the school year ther been 1,254 calls at the weavin; for supplies, warps, and advic, Strand has made 500 calls homes. I only wish I knew the 13 horseback, and walking these have required. This year, Miss Pratt, a horn onstration agent who has had time off because of poor heal helped in the weaving room. S. weighed materials, made out ders, and been of great help t Strand. She has done this v exchange for her board and 1-i has left Miss Strand time for instruction and has been a ver factory arrangement.

Wood-working Shop Although this is a year when we are following a most rigid program of economy there is one piece of real development going on. This is possible through the gift of a new wood shop for the school. With no special interest in Pi Phi but a deep one in the development of the boys of the community, Mr. L. E. Voorheis has offered to build and equip a wood-working shop. Mr. Voorheis is from Cincinnati but has been spending much of his time in Gatlinburg for the past four or five years and is wide awake to the needs and the opportunities for help. The shop will be built of rock, will be well planned and equipped, will have a dry kiln and be large enough to keep several boys and men at work. While the boys will be in school part of the time it no doubt will be necessary to work a few men in order to keep up with the furniture orders that are always coming in. This will give an opportunity for the very kind of work we like to have. This is, much the largest individual gift that has ever come to the school and we shall make every effort for it to fulfill the mission it is designed for, However there are absolutely no strings attached to the gift in anyway. The past year Mr. Mattil has continued his wood-working business and the orders have kept from four to seven men busy all the time. There are also two classes each Saturday afternoon for these men and the local basket and furniture makers, subjects discussed being those pertaining to their work, those working in the shop had work along the line of mechanical drawing and designing, as well as construction problems relating to furniture making, with courses continuing at home. The other class was in the nature of a weekly conference of problems arising in their work at home. The September ARROW There is still the feeling that the wood-working department should be under the school management and eventually it must come to that but just now we should be very glad to have Mr. Mattil carry it. Possibly by the first of the year a different arrangement can be made. It may be that the department can be self-supporting, with the aid we receive from the state for this work. Our experience has been, however, that it al-ways takes a few years to put any industry on a self-supporting basis. Community One goes on for several years, not knowing whether much is being accomplished or not. Then suddenly some one thing develops with such rapidity you realize seeds must have been planted and roots growing for some time. Surely this must have been the case of the P.T.A. organization. The women responded too splendidly and loyally for any mushroom growth of community spirit. The thing that stimulated this growth was the need for a noon lunch for the primary and underweight grade children. This had been discontinued for three years but all felt it should be resumed and it was so voted at the 1930 committee meeting. The first steps taken were in the right direction. Members of the staff, particularly the nurse, home economics teacher and grade teachers, visited every home rep-resented in the school. They told the need of a nourishing lunch, the way they hoped it could be managed, and asked for the parents' cooperation in sending vegetables, fruit, etc. Almost every family responded gladly and their interest did not lag during the school year. Each Wednesday after-noon the home economics teacher and the nurse made out the menu for the week and wrote the notes to parents who were to furnish supplies for thosedays. The children bring a lunch fro home and one extra dish is given. may be tomatoes, custard, hot cocoa-plain but nourishing food. During ti fall a box supper was given which ne ted enough to buy spoons, cups, ar bowls for the lunch room. A supp] of paint and an afternoon of wor did wonders to cans, benches, and -b bless The high school girls took tun helping with the dishes and also tE hand-washing of fifty little folks. Two meetings are held each mont] one afternoon meeting devoted to bus ness and one night meeting whic takes the form of a community affai Harp singing, speaking, plays, an games furnished the entertainmen The women conduct the meetings an are continuing them through the sun men I only hope that out of this wi grow a group interested in civic in provement. With the rapidly changin Gatlinburg it is needed and it seen that there are leaders among the won en. For the first time several years Gal linburg did not have a fair. This wa due in part to the bad season for fan and garden crops and also to a lac of timely interest on the part of tb local people. No doubt an off-year i a good thing now an then, and vv are looking forward to a splendid fai this fall. Old Timers' Day continues to be a outstanding community day of th year. People, old and young, enjoy real home day with old friends an neighbors. The contests of spinnin weaving, corn-husking, and in fa( about everything one can imagine c the old days, create much interest an fun. It is the one distinctly Gatlinbur day of the year.

Sugarlands The opening of the school term in August found Mrs. Dowell Eva Hathaway, and Emily Burton back on duty, Mrs. Dowell for her 10th year, Emily for her 13th, and Eva for her fourth. The school was maintained as in other years. The eight grades were taught by Eva and Emily, the county paying their salaries. Mrs. Dowell was on the Pi Phi pay roll as housemother and community worker. Eva had shop work with some of the older boys, Mary Rachel Armstrong, the Gatlin-burg home economics teacher, had a class in Sugarlands one afternoon each week. While the school work has gone very well indeed, the girls have felt dissatisfied with their community accomplishments. The community has been demoralized for some time be-cause of the uncertainties connected with the establishment of the national park. All knew their homes must be sold. Some were glad, some sorry, and all wondered just what would come to pass. While many families moved during the year the enrollment remained large enough to make a two-teacher school necessary and we believe it will be about the same size next year. Our cottage is not yet sold but probably will be soon. However, we will be able to use it as long as there is need of a school there. When the Government really takes over the management of the park area we can look forward to a more settled condition again. In January Mrs. Dowell was very ill and we all had many anxious days. She has become stronger again but we fear for her to be in a place where she is so far from medical care and where there is neither telephone nor auto road. Mrs. Dowell has been such a vital part of the school family for The September ARROW 7] years and has so endeared herself to our group and the people of Gatlin-burg and Sugarlands and her place is so hard to fill, that she will be greatly missed. I have purposely omitted from this report a list of needs and improvements for the coming year. Until times are better and until all indebtedness is cleared .our program is one of the strictest economy. Yet we do not want it to be that which will cause us to go backward instead of forward. On the report of the treasurer the first of July will depend many of our plans for the coming year. Contributions came in wonderfully last year in spiteof difficult times and we believe the: will again this spring.

Reports from chapter representatives to college Panhellenics have been studied, however, and help has been given with the individual problems reported to her. She has maintained close relations with the N.P.C. Chairman of the Committee on College Panhellenics and has worked for the adjustment of all difficulties which involved Pi Beta Phi chapters. The record of the fraternity for ethical rushing is an enviable one and the past two years have found the fraternity free from any drastic penalization for the breaking of rushing rules. She urges, however, a still keener reali-zation on the part of individual members of the fraternity of their responsibility for keeping both the spirit and the letter of all rushing rules. No chapter, she honestly believes, deliberately breaks rushing rules; some are discredited because individual members thoughtlessly do break them. On some campuses, bid day is that in name only since all groups know definitely beforehand just what rushees are to be their pledges. Such a violation of the spirit of preferential bid-ding can but bring discredit to the fraternity system. The condition can-not be remedied by any one fraternity but Pi Beta Phi chapters could well be the leaders in bringing about a correct use of the preferential bidding

        4 The September ARROW ivies, making hotbeds, slaughtering ogs, and "curing" meat comprise )me of the things done by the classes. Cow feed was bought and the boys -eighed and mixed it. Calls from arents of the boys were answered and eip giving in pruning, spraying, and le treating of sick animals. The F.F.T. organization was a wide-wake one. The boys sent two repremtatives to Nashville for the state invention in the spring and several [an to attend the summer camp for a loft time. The purpose of the club, quote Mr. Smith's report is "to :rengthen the confidence of the count' boy in himself, in country life ad in the business of farming." The Pi Beta Phi Chapter holds a tembership in the Sevier County arm Bureau. This year the boys premted a loving cup to be given to the (ost outstanding high school girl, her ame to be engraved on the cup. The ame of Adis Clabo was put on the ap. Adis is from Wears Valley. This an honor well worth working for tad the first of the kind to be estabshed in the school. A day unit class was held at Laurel ick, ten boys were enrolled and their .ork was with small shop tools. This spring six of the boys are rais-1g chicks gotten from the school ock. The boys painted a room in the :hoolhouse and erected a forty-foot agpole on the, school grounds. The Wears Valley class has been aid the past year for men instead of )ys. Thirty-six adult farmers took up le study of Burley tobacco raising. he individual work with the farmers ill continue through the summer. The farmers in the vicinity of atlinburg, under the direction of Le school agricultural department, )ught cooperatively twelve tons of Lttle feed at a material saving. Sev-.al bought fertilizer in this same ay. The home projects of the boys are always interesting, as the following list will show: Boys Kind of project 6 Hens 1 Horses 4 Brood sows 1 Fattening hog 4 Dairy cows 2 Beef calves 1 Acre of corn 3 1 / acres of potatoes 1 5,,g acre beans Evening class-25 farmers working with tobacco. Day unit class-6 boys working with poultry. Home Economics This department has followed the same course as in other years, high school work during the mornings, cornmrmity classes and visits in the after-noon. The high school girls follow the prescribed course but in addition have a great deal of practical experience. This year a project was made with the freshman girls in the dormitory of remodeling and repairing some dresses that had been sent in. As the girls are all working their way through school and often with little help from home, the dresses were a great help as well as a good lesson. The sophomore girls made their commencement dress-es. As the dormitory takes so much time out of school hours the freshman girls this summer will do their projects at home. A class was carried one afternoon each week in Sugarlands, one in Laurel Lick school, and an afternoon class in Gatlinburg for the women. Foods and clothing were taught in the two schools but the Gatlinburg class this past year studied homes. In the spring one kitchen was remodeled, one rearranged, a living room finished and furnished, as well as some other plans talked over. In May Mrs. Zucarello, of the state department, was here for an intensive The September ARROW sewing course and the accomplishments of these days under her are al-most unbelievable. Home visiting was quite a part of the program of this department the past year and one that should bring fine results. The development of the P.T.A. was a real accomplishment and one that was sponsored by this department. Although there was no Gatlinburg Fair the women had a fine exhibit of canning, cooking, sewing, and weaving in the fall. Dormitory Dormitory is a title much too large for our little cottages but not one bit too large for the work done. Any-thing in the line of dormitory life complicates the problems and adds to the expense of the school but there is no question of the big dividends it pays in the training given the boys and girls. That it is recognized is shown by the number of people asking to come to the dormitories, many more than we have any room for. We surely have proved over and over that boys and girls like to be busy and that as long as they are busy problems of discipline are few. Only those who want to go to school and who want to work come so we have a busy crowd most of the time. The first few months they are here the work has to be pretty carefully supervised but they are bright boys and girls and usually make real progress in course of a year. We feel that the training given in practical work is as valuable as that given in the class room. It is not possible to take more than twenty-five boys and girls and we usually do not have more than twenty. The ten in the boys' cottage have been in very crowded quarters but they never complain. We feel, however, that it is better to rent another cottage instead of the one we have rented thepast two years, moving the boy a larger place even though ft from the school. This necessitate ing some place for a wash and ( ing room and already a frienc given half enough to finish a roc the basement of the grade school ing. Last winter when there w much sickness we realized that a heated, crowded house caused difficulties that should be avoid We all feel that here is a big in which to develop boys and girl give valuable training. Health Combining so much of be school and community nursing i such a full program in Gatli. that we would gladly modify it knew how to make changes fc better. There are thirteen schools is district that the nurse visits a several of these schools carries a complete program. It requires l frequent visits and the cooperat. the teacher. Gatlinburg school awarded 2: ribbons the past year, which that each child had had all reme defects corrected, had been imtm against typhoid, diphtheria, smal had kept a satisfactory health record for one month, and had satisfactory school work. One tonsil clinic was held in S ville, twelve from Gatlinburg operated on. A Knoxville dentist contint come one Saturday each moni finds he has fewer patients, d doubt to the people being able. to Sevierville more easily and o: For this same reason the doctor discontinued their afternoons Health Center. While we som wish they did come regularly tl a saving in sterile supplies and as the people now get them for selves in most cases. 66 The September ARROW The past two years preventive tubercular work has been stressed. Several chest clinics have been held, the state sending their specialists for these clinics. An x-ray machine has been added to their equipment, which is of much help. Before the last chest clinic twenty tuberculin tests were given. There are a surprisingly large number of cases and a real effort is being made to put these cases under a home program of care that will be of benefit. The year has brought a good many interesting and hard cases. One baby from two miles above Elkmont has had to be taken to Knoxville frequently for treatment during the entire year. A fifteen-year-old girl with pellagra and leg ulcers was in the Health Center two weeks and while her legs are now healed (after being bad for five years) and she is back at her home in Laurel Lick, she still is under the care of the nurse. The Red Cross supply of milk got-ten this spring has been a great help for these cases. The dormitory pupils and staff have been on the sick list much of the year. Thirteen have been in the Health Center, a good many other sick at the various cottages. If one could stop outside work during these periods it would not be so difficult but as it is one nurse has to go in a good many different directions. Lillie Reagan is always the standby at the hospital and as dependable as ever. The nurse has watched with interest the results of the noon lunch, especially in the cases of the underweights, and has been much gratified with the results. She has given of her time all the year in helping with menus, hand washing, and of course cod liver oil. Perhaps a summing up of some of the work might help to give a little idea of the busy days. Mileage 10,131 iniles Field visits 1,064 Inoculations completed 383 Minor treatments and dressings at hospi tal 718 Little Mothers' classes 11 attendance 86 Home Hygiene classes 16 attendance 172 Mothers' Classes 2 attendance 11 But most difficult of all is the in-ability to cope with the difficult situations that the nurse is sure to find. How to help families in hard financial straits, to get children into the proper institutions, get medical care for those too far away and unable to pay, to solve family problems that you are called on to help with ; all these things complicate the work but also make it a worth-while service. Arro car Craft As the books close June 30 this re-port is not the final one. Arrowcraft, at the beginning o the fiscal year, opened its own books and own bank account. Not the least detail of the business has gone through the other school books. Surely this year there will be no doubt about where we stand when the final report is made. The business has held up well in spite of hard times. Sales have been of about the usual amount and payments prompt. The clubs must have made a great effort to have accomplished this and the results have been evidenced here in the employment given the women and in the prompt payments they have received. Orders from the clubs coming in early in the fall relieved some of the Christmas rush, returning all left-over goods and making final settlement be-fore the books closed helped, a good many clubs keeping the same person in charge was a help to the club and the school. If only the time could come when a club account could be carried under one name instead of The September ARROW several many difficulties would be avoided. The Arrowcraft means more to the community than we can tell and it would be utterly impossible for us to carry this large business, for a real business it is now, without the splendid support the clubs and chapters give. With nine shops in Gatlinburg selling weaving and other home products our cash sales from tourists cannot be expected to be on a very large scale. Also our overhead is much more than any other shop and some materials are of a better grade so prices are some higher in our shop. We do make every effort to send things out that will be lovely, that we can stand behind, and that will be salable. Our real business must be mail and express and the Pi This those who keep it going. Hotel Shop Arrowcraft has made a new venture this spring in putting a shop in the Mountain View Hotel. Mr. Huff built an attractive and very comfortable hotel last year and at once we aspired to a shop in the lobby. The spring was cold and business slow in starting but even this early we feel sure we can say the Shop is going to be a success. It is always interesting to notice the license plates on the cars parked in front of the hotel and even in winter one is surprised at the number of states represented every week-end. While a good many people come for several days there are a good many who stop at the hotel for only a short time and never are near the school. These are the ones who make the Shop worth while. Weaving Teaching weaving in Gatlinburg, like agriculture, home economics and nursing, is a varied program day by day. Imagine having your pupil; tered up and down Roaring Mill Creek, Baskins, and ever: creek, not one family living on proved road, distances you mus being anywhere from a short 1 a woman living in the field b the school to a trip of a half more horseback or on foot. Yo you can wait for some of then until a pleasant day but per: special order must be hurried t: and you go, rain or snow. Love outdoors, the people, and work sential. The seventh and eighth grac have a double period of weavit] school day. These girls do lit sale as their class work is real i tion from the very beginning class comes in the morning, a morning is also the time whe of the women come to the sch supplies, advice, and to make The afternoons are planned fo visits but one cannot have a dc worked out program from day Too many things interfere ti it. During the school year ther been 1,254 calls at the weavin; for supplies, warps, and advic, Strand has made 500 calls homes. I only wish I knew the 13 horseback, and walking these have required. This year, Miss Pratt, a horn onstration agent who has had time off because of poor heal helped in the weaving room. S. weighed materials, made out ders, and been of great help t Strand. She has done this v exchange for her board and 1-i has left Miss Strand time for instruction and has been a ver factory arrangement. There is a meeting for the N women one afternoon each m( The September ARROW th instructive and recreational. first half hour is given to some to subject for instruction. Then v games and ballad singing. Each committee is appointed to bring efreshments for the next time :ley are served in the lunch room school. From 25 to 35 women and although many have long walks and the weather is often am sure they must feel well re-for the effort of coming for the lance is very good. Because of monthly meetings and the home done we receive help from the department for vocational educa-.nd this helps greatly in taking of the salary of the weaving wr. 3s Strand has been with us two and we are looking forward to g her with us again next year. O ice e office work increases year by as Miss Cooke realizes all too In addition to the regular work Dking after all the bills for the and keeping that work going, are the time slips for the dormi-)oys and girls to be checked twice nth and their statements made lach student knows exactly where :ands at the end of each two The ever increasing amount .rrowcraft business could keep usy in the office most of the time of only the shipping business but t connected with the local people must be cared for through the and a great many are bringing eir weaving, furniture and bas-111 the time. t the biggest part of the whole in trying to keep expenses with-at budget that has been. cut for )ast three years and that may to take another cut this sum-because of hard times all over Duntry. Wood-working Shop Although this is a year when we are following a most rigid program of economy there is one piece of real development going on. This is possible through the gift of a new wood shop for the school. With no special interest in Pi Phi but a deep one in the development of the boys of the community, Mr. L. E. Voorheis has offered to build and equip a wood-working shop. Mr. Voorheis is from Cincinnati but has been spending much of his time in Gatlinburg for the past four or five years and is wide awake to the needs and the opportunities for help. The shop will be built of rock, will be well planned and equipped, will have a dry kiln and be large enough to keep several boys and men at work. While the boys will be in school part of the time it no doubt will be necessary to work a few men in order to keep up with the furniture orders that are always coming in. This will give an opportunity for the very kind of work we like to have. This is, much the largest individual gift that has ever come to the school and we shall make every effort for it to fulfill the mission it is designed for, However there are absolutely no strings attached to the gift in anyway. The past year Mr. Mattil has continued his wood-working business and the orders have kept from four to seven men busy all the time. There are also two classes each Saturday afternoon for these men and the local basket and furniture makers, subjects discussed being those pertaining to their work, those working in the shop had work along the line of mechanical drawing and designing, as well as construction problems relating to furniture making, with courses continuing at home. The other class was in the nature of a weekly conference of problems arising in their work at home. The September ARROW There is still the feeling that the wood-working department should be under the school management and eventually it must come to that but just now we should be very glad to have Mr. Mattil carry it. Possibly by the first of the year a different arrangement can be made. It may be that the department can be self-supporting, with the aid we receive from the state for this work. Our experience has been, however, that it al-ways takes a few years to put any industry on a self-supporting basis. Community One goes on for several years, not knowing whether much is being accomplished or not. Then suddenly some one thing develops with such rapidity you realize seeds must have been planted and roots growing for some time. Surely this must have been the case of the P.T.A. organization. The women responded too splendidly and loyally for any mushroom growth of community spirit. The thing that stimulated this growth was the need for a noon lunch for the primary and underweight grade children. This had been discontinued for three years but all felt it should be resumed and it was so voted at the 1930 committee meeting. The first steps taken were in the right direction. Members of the staff, particularly the nurse, home economics teacher and grade teachers, visited every home rep-resented in the school. They told the need of a nourishing lunch, the way they hoped it could be managed, and asked for the parents' cooperation in sending vegetables, fruit, etc. Almost every family responded gladly and their interest did not lag during the school year. Each Wednesday after-noon the home economics teacher and the nurse made out the menu for the week and wrote the notes to parents who were to furnish supplies for thosedays. The children bring a lunch fro home and one extra dish is given. may be tomatoes, custard, hot cocoa-plain but nourishing food. During ti fall a box supper was given which ne ted enough to buy spoons, cups, ar bowls for the lunch room. A supp] of paint and an afternoon of wor did wonders to cans, benches, and -b bless The high school girls took tun helping with the dishes and also tE hand-washing of fifty little folks. Two meetings are held each mont] one afternoon meeting devoted to bus ness and one night meeting whic takes the form of a community affai Harp singing, speaking, plays, an games furnished the entertainmen The women conduct the meetings an are continuing them through the sun men I only hope that out of this wi grow a group interested in civic in provement. With the rapidly changin Gatlinburg it is needed and it seen that there are leaders among the won en. For the first time several years Gal linburg did not have a fair. This wa due in part to the bad season for fan and garden crops and also to a lac of timely interest on the part of tb local people. No doubt an off-year i a good thing now an then, and vv are looking forward to a splendid fai this fall. Old Timers' Day continues to be a outstanding community day of th year. People, old and young, enjoy real home day with old friends an neighbors. The contests of spinnin weaving, corn-husking, and in fa( about everything one can imagine c the old days, create much interest an fun. It is the one distinctly Gatlinbur day of the year.

Sugarlands The opening of the school term in August found Mrs. Dowell Eva Hathaway, and Emily Burton back on duty, Mrs. Dowell for her 10th year, Emily for her 13th, and Eva for her fourth. The school was maintained as in other years. The eight grades were taught by Eva and Emily, the county paying their salaries. Mrs. Dowell was on the Pi Phi pay roll as housemother and community worker. Eva had shop work with some of the older boys, Mary Rachel Armstrong, the Gatlin-burg home economics teacher, had a class in Sugarlands one afternoon each week. While the school work has gone very well indeed, the girls have felt dissatisfied with their community accomplishments. The community has been demoralized for some time be-cause of the uncertainties connected with the establishment of the national park. All knew their homes must be sold. Some were glad, some sorry, and all wondered just what would come to pass. While many families moved during the year the enrollment remained large enough to make a two-teacher school necessary and we believe it will be about the same size next year. Our cottage is not yet sold but probably will be soon. However, we will be able to use it as long as there is need of a school there. When the Government really takes over the management of the park area we can look forward to a more settled condition again. In January Mrs. Dowell was very ill and we all had many anxious days. She has become stronger again but we fear for her to be in a place where she is so far from medical care and where there is neither telephone nor auto road. Mrs. Dowell has been such a vital part of the school family for The September ARROW 7] years and has so endeared herself to our group and the people of Gatlin-burg and Sugarlands and her place is so hard to fill, that she will be greatly missed. I have purposely omitted from this report a list of needs and improvements for the coming year. Until times are better and until all indebtedness is cleared .our program is one of the strictest economy. Yet we do not want it to be that which will cause us to go backward instead of forward. On the report of the treasurer the first of July will depend many of our plans for the coming year. Contributions came in wonderfully last year in spiteof difficult times and we believe the: will again this spring.

Reports from chapter representatives to college Panhellenics have been studied, however, and help has been given with the individual problems reported to her. She has maintained close relations with the N.P.C. Chairman of the Committee on College Panhellenics and has worked for the adjustment of all difficulties which involved Pi Beta Phi chapters. The record of the fraternity for ethical rushing is an enviable one and the past two years have found the fraternity free from any drastic penalization for the breaking of rushing rules. She urges, however, a still keener reali-zation on the part of individual members of the fraternity of their responsibility for keeping both the spirit and the letter of all rushing rules. No chapter, she honestly believes, deliberately breaks rushing rules; some are discredited because individual members thoughtlessly do break them. On some campuses, bid day is that in name only since all groups know definitely beforehand just what rushees are to be their pledges. Such a violation of the spirit of preferential bid-ding can but bring discredit to the fraternity system. The condition can-not be remedied by any one fraternity but Pi Beta Phi chapters could well be the leaders in bringing about a correct use of the preferential bidding

        66 The September ARROW The past two years preventive tubercular work has been stressed. Several chest clinics have been held, the state sending their specialists for these clinics. An x-ray machine has been added to their equipment, which is of much help. Before the last chest clinic twenty tuberculin tests were given. There are a surprisingly large number of cases and a real effort is being made to put these cases under a home program of care that will be of benefit. The year has brought a good many interesting and hard cases. One baby from two miles above Elkmont has had to be taken to Knoxville frequently for treatment during the entire year. A fifteen-year-old girl with pellagra and leg ulcers was in the Health Center two weeks and while her legs are now healed (after being bad for five years) and she is back at her home in Laurel Lick, she still is under the care of the nurse. The Red Cross supply of milk got-ten this spring has been a great help for these cases. The dormitory pupils and staff have been on the sick list much of the year. Thirteen have been in the Health Center, a good many other sick at the various cottages. If one could stop outside work during these periods it would not be so difficult but as it is one nurse has to go in a good many different directions. Lillie Reagan is always the standby at the hospital and as dependable as ever. The nurse has watched with interest the results of the noon lunch, especially in the cases of the underweights, and has been much gratified with the results. She has given of her time all the year in helping with menus, hand washing, and of course cod liver oil. Perhaps a summing up of some of the work might help to give a little idea of the busy days. Mileage 10,131 iniles Field visits 1,064 Inoculations completed 383 Minor treatments and dressings at hospi tal 718 Little Mothers' classes 11 attendance 86 Home Hygiene classes 16 attendance 172 Mothers' Classes 2 attendance 11 But most difficult of all is the in-ability to cope with the difficult situations that the nurse is sure to find. How to help families in hard financial straits, to get children into the proper institutions, get medical care for those too far away and unable to pay, to solve family problems that you are called on to help with ; all these things complicate the work but also make it a worth-while service. Arro car Craft As the books close June 30 this re-port is not the final one. Arrowcraft, at the beginning o the fiscal year, opened its own books and own bank account. Not the least detail of the business has gone through the other school books. Surely this year there will be no doubt about where we stand when the final report is made. The business has held up well in spite of hard times. Sales have been of about the usual amount and payments prompt. The clubs must have made a great effort to have accomplished this and the results have been evidenced here in the employment given the women and in the prompt payments they have received. Orders from the clubs coming in early in the fall relieved some of the Christmas rush, returning all left-over goods and making final settlement be-fore the books closed helped, a good many clubs keeping the same person in charge was a help to the club and the school. If only the time could come when a club account could be carried under one name instead of The September ARROW several many difficulties would be avoided. The Arrowcraft means more to the community than we can tell and it would be utterly impossible for us to carry this large business, for a real business it is now, without the splendid support the clubs and chapters give. With nine shops in Gatlinburg selling weaving and other home products our cash sales from tourists cannot be expected to be on a very large scale. Also our overhead is much more than any other shop and some materials are of a better grade so prices are some higher in our shop. We do make every effort to send things out that will be lovely, that we can stand behind, and that will be salable. Our real business must be mail and express and the Pi This those who keep it going. Hotel Shop Arrowcraft has made a new venture this spring in putting a shop in the Mountain View Hotel. Mr. Huff built an attractive and very comfortable hotel last year and at once we aspired to a shop in the lobby. The spring was cold and business slow in starting but even this early we feel sure we can say the Shop is going to be a success. It is always interesting to notice the license plates on the cars parked in front of the hotel and even in winter one is surprised at the number of states represented every week-end. While a good many people come for several days there are a good many who stop at the hotel for only a short time and never are near the school. These are the ones who make the Shop worth while. Weaving Teaching weaving in Gatlinburg, like agriculture, home economics and nursing, is a varied program day by day. Imagine having your pupil; tered up and down Roaring Mill Creek, Baskins, and ever: creek, not one family living on proved road, distances you mus being anywhere from a short 1 a woman living in the field b the school to a trip of a half more horseback or on foot. Yo you can wait for some of then until a pleasant day but per: special order must be hurried t: and you go, rain or snow. Love outdoors, the people, and work sential. The seventh and eighth grac have a double period of weavit] school day. These girls do lit sale as their class work is real i tion from the very beginning class comes in the morning, a morning is also the time whe of the women come to the sch supplies, advice, and to make The afternoons are planned fo visits but one cannot have a dc worked out program from day Too many things interfere ti it. During the school year ther been 1,254 calls at the weavin; for supplies, warps, and advic, Strand has made 500 calls homes. I only wish I knew the 13 horseback, and walking these have required. This year, Miss Pratt, a horn onstration agent who has had time off because of poor heal helped in the weaving room. S. weighed materials, made out ders, and been of great help t Strand.

Wood-working Shop Although this is a year when we are following a most rigid program of economy there is one piece of real development going on. This is possible through the gift of a new wood shop for the school. With no special interest in Pi Phi but a deep one in the development of the boys of the community, Mr. L. E. Voorheis has offered to build and equip a wood-working shop. Mr. Voorheis is from Cincinnati but has been spending much of his time in Gatlinburg for the past four or five years and is wide awake to the needs and the opportunities for help. The shop will be built of rock, will be well planned and equipped, will have a dry kiln and be large enough to keep several boys and men at work. While the boys will be in school part of the time it no doubt will be necessary to work a few men in order to keep up with the furniture orders that are always coming in. This will give an opportunity for the very kind of work we like to have. This is, much the largest individual gift that has ever come to the school and we shall make every effort for it to fulfill the mission it is designed for, However there are absolutely no strings attached to the gift in anyway. The past year Mr. Mattil has continued his wood-working business and the orders have kept from four to seven men busy all the time. There are also two classes each Saturday afternoon for these men and the local basket and furniture makers, subjects discussed being those pertaining to their work, those working in the shop had work along the line of mechanical drawing and designing, as well as construction problems relating to furniture making, with courses continuing at home. The other class was in the nature of a weekly conference of problems arising in their work at home. The September ARROW There is still the feeling that the wood-working department should be under the school management and eventually it must come to that but just now we should be very glad to have Mr. Mattil carry it. Possibly by the first of the year a different arrangement can be made. It may be that the department can be self-supporting, with the aid we receive from the state for this work. Our experience has been, however, that it al-ways takes a few years to put any industry on a self-supporting basis. Community One goes on for several years, not knowing whether much is being accomplished or not. Then suddenly some one thing develops with such rapidity you realize seeds must have been planted and roots growing for some time. Surely this must have been the case of the P.T.A. organization. The women responded too splendidly and loyally for any mushroom growth of community spirit. The thing that stimulated this growth was the need for a noon lunch for the primary and underweight grade children. This had been discontinued for three years but all felt it should be resumed and it was so voted at the 1930 committee meeting. The first steps taken were in the right direction. Members of the staff, particularly the nurse, home economics teacher and grade teachers, visited every home rep-resented in the school. They told the need of a nourishing lunch, the way they hoped it could be managed, and asked for the parents' cooperation in sending vegetables, fruit, etc. Almost every family responded gladly and their interest did not lag during the school year. Each Wednesday after-noon the home economics teacher and the nurse made out the menu for the week and wrote the notes to parents who were to furnish supplies for thosedays. The children bring a lunch fro home and one extra dish is given. may be tomatoes, custard, hot cocoa-plain but nourishing food. During ti fall a box supper was given which ne ted enough to buy spoons, cups, ar bowls for the lunch room. A supp] of paint and an afternoon of wor did wonders to cans, benches, and -b bless The high school girls took tun helping with the dishes and also tE hand-washing of fifty little folks. Two meetings are held each mont] one afternoon meeting devoted to bus ness and one night meeting whic takes the form of a community affai Harp singing, speaking, plays, an games furnished the entertainmen The women conduct the meetings an are continuing them through the sun men I only hope that out of this wi grow a group interested in civic in provement. With the rapidly changin Gatlinburg it is needed and it seen that there are leaders among the won en. For the first time several years Gal linburg did not have a fair. This wa due in part to the bad season for fan and garden crops and also to a lac of timely interest on the part of tb local people. No doubt an off-year i a good thing now an then, and vv are looking forward to a splendid fai this fall. Old Timers' Day continues to be a outstanding community day of th year. People, old and young, enjoy real home day with old friends an neighbors. The contests of spinnin weaving, corn-husking, and in fa( about everything one can imagine c the old days, create much interest an fun. It is the one distinctly Gatlinbur day of the year.

Sugarlands The opening of the school term in August found Mrs. Dowell Eva Hathaway, and Emily Burton back on duty, Mrs. Dowell for her 10th year, Emily for her 13th, and Eva for her fourth. The school was maintained as in other years. The eight grades were taught by Eva and Emily, the county paying their salaries. Mrs. Dowell was on the Pi Phi pay roll as housemother and community worker. Eva had shop work with some of the older boys, Mary Rachel Armstrong, the Gatlin-burg home economics teacher, had a class in Sugarlands one afternoon each week. While the school work has gone very well indeed, the girls have felt dissatisfied with their community accomplishments. The community has been demoralized for some time be-cause of the uncertainties connected with the establishment of the national park. All knew their homes must be sold. Some were glad, some sorry, and all wondered just what would come to pass. While many families moved during the year the enrollment remained large enough to make a two-teacher school necessary and we believe it will be about the same size next year. Our cottage is not yet sold but probably will be soon. However, we will be able to use it as long as there is need of a school there. When the Government really takes over the management of the park area we can look forward to a more settled condition again. In January Mrs. Dowell was very ill and we all had many anxious days. She has become stronger again but we fear for her to be in a place where she is so far from medical care and where there is neither telephone nor auto road. Mrs. Dowell has been such a vital part of the school family for The September ARROW 7] years and has so endeared herself to our group and the people of Gatlin-burg and Sugarlands and her place is so hard to fill, that she will be greatly missed. I have purposely omitted from this report a list of needs and improvements for the coming year. Until times are better and until all indebtedness is cleared .our program is one of the strictest economy. Yet we do not want it to be that which will cause us to go backward instead of forward. On the report of the treasurer the first of July will depend many of our plans for the coming year. Contributions came in wonderfully last year in spiteof difficult times and we believe the: will again this spring.

Reports from chapter representatives to college Panhellenics have been studied, however, and help has been given with the individual problems reported to her. She has maintained close relations with the N.P.C. Chairman of the Committee on College Panhellenics and has worked for the adjustment of all difficulties which involved Pi Beta Phi chapters. The record of the fraternity for ethical rushing is an enviable one and the past two years have found the fraternity free from any drastic penalization for the breaking of rushing rules. She urges, however, a still keener reali-zation on the part of individual members of the fraternity of their responsibility for keeping both the spirit and the letter of all rushing rules. No chapter, she honestly believes, deliberately breaks rushing rules; some are discredited because individual members thoughtlessly do break them. On some campuses, bid day is that in name only since all groups know definitely beforehand just what rushees are to be their pledges. Such a violation of the spirit of preferential bid-ding can but bring discredit to the fraternity system. The condition can-not be remedied by any one fraternity but Pi Beta Phi chapters could well be the leaders in bringing about a correct use of the preferential bidding

Wood-working Shop Although this is a year when we are following a most rigid program of economy there is one piece of real development going on. This is possible through the gift of a new wood shop for the school. With no special interest in Pi Phi but a deep one in the development of the boys of the community, Mr. L. E. Voorheis has offered to build and equip a wood-working shop. Mr. Voorheis is from Cincinnati but has been spending much of his time in Gatlinburg for the past four or five years and is wide awake to the needs and the opportunities for help. The shop will be built of rock, will be well planned and equipped, will have a dry kiln and be large enough to keep several boys and men at work. While the boys will be in school part of the time it no doubt will be necessary to work a few men in order to keep up with the furniture orders that are always coming in. This will give an opportunity for the very kind of work we like to have. This is, much the largest individual gift that has ever come to the school and we shall make every effort for it to fulfill the mission it is designed for, However there are absolutely no strings attached to the gift in anyway. The past year Mr. Mattil has continued his wood-working business and the orders have kept from four to seven men busy all the time. There are also two classes each Saturday afternoon for these men and the local basket and furniture makers, subjects discussed being those pertaining to their work, those working in the shop had work along the line of mechanical drawing and designing, as well as construction problems relating to furniture making, with courses continuing at home. The other class was in the nature of a weekly conference of problems arising in their work at home. The September ARROW There is still the feeling that the wood-working department should be under the school management and eventually it must come to that but just now we should be very glad to have Mr. Mattil carry it. Possibly by the first of the year a different arrangement can be made. It may be that the department can be self-supporting, with the aid we receive from the state for this work. Our experience has been, however, that it al-ways takes a few years to put any industry on a self-supporting basis. Community One goes on for several years, not knowing whether much is being accomplished or not. Then suddenly some one thing develops with such rapidity you realize seeds must have been planted and roots growing for some time. Surely this must have been the case of the P.T.A. organization. The women responded too splendidly and loyally for any mushroom growth of community spirit. The thing that stimulated this growth was the need for a noon lunch for the primary and underweight grade children. This had been discontinued for three years but all felt it should be resumed and it was so voted at the 1930 committee meeting. The first steps taken were in the right direction. Members of the staff, particularly the nurse, home economics teacher and grade teachers, visited every home rep-resented in the school. They told the need of a nourishing lunch, the way they hoped it could be managed, and asked for the parents' cooperation in sending vegetables, fruit, etc. Almost every family responded gladly and their interest did not lag during the school year. Each Wednesday after-noon the home economics teacher and the nurse made out the menu for the week and wrote the notes to parents who were to furnish supplies for thosedays. The children bring a lunch fro home and one extra dish is given. may be tomatoes, custard, hot cocoa-plain but nourishing food. During ti fall a box supper was given which ne ted enough to buy spoons, cups, ar bowls for the lunch room. A supp] of paint and an afternoon of wor did wonders to cans, benches, and -b bless The high school girls took tun helping with the dishes and also tE hand-washing of fifty little folks. Two meetings are held each mont] one afternoon meeting devoted to bus ness and one night meeting whic takes the form of a community affai Harp singing, speaking, plays, an games furnished the entertainmen The women conduct the meetings an are continuing them through the sun men I only hope that out of this wi grow a group interested in civic in provement. With the rapidly changin Gatlinburg it is needed and it seen that there are leaders among the won en. For the first time several years Gal linburg did not have a fair. This wa due in part to the bad season for fan and garden crops and also to a lac of timely interest on the part of tb local people. No doubt an off-year i a good thing now an then, and vv are looking forward to a splendid fai this fall. Old Timers' Day continues to be a outstanding community day of th year. People, old and young, enjoy real home day with old friends an neighbors. The contests of spinnin weaving, corn-husking, and in fa( about everything one can imagine c the old days, create much interest an fun. It is the one distinctly Gatlinbur day of the year.

Sugarlands The opening of the school term in August found Mrs. Dowell Eva Hathaway, and Emily Burton back on duty, Mrs. Dowell for her 10th year, Emily for her 13th, and Eva for her fourth. The school was maintained as in other years. The eight grades were taught by Eva and Emily, the county paying their salaries. Mrs. Dowell was on the Pi Phi pay roll as housemother and community worker. Eva had shop work with some of the older boys, Mary Rachel Armstrong, the Gatlin-burg home economics teacher, had a class in Sugarlands one afternoon each week. While the school work has gone very well indeed, the girls have felt dissatisfied with their community accomplishments. The community has been demoralized for some time be-cause of the uncertainties connected with the establishment of the national park. All knew their homes must be sold. Some were glad, some sorry, and all wondered just what would come to pass. While many families moved during the year the enrollment remained large enough to make a two-teacher school necessary and we believe it will be about the same size next year. Our cottage is not yet sold but probably will be soon. However, we will be able to use it as long as there is need of a school there. When the Government really takes over the management of the park area we can look forward to a more settled condition again. In January Mrs. Dowell was very ill and we all had many anxious days. She has become stronger again but we fear for her to be in a place where she is so far from medical care and where there is neither telephone nor auto road. Mrs. Dowell has been such a vital part of the school family for The September ARROW 7] years and has so endeared herself to our group and the people of Gatlin-burg and Sugarlands and her place is so hard to fill, that she will be greatly missed. I have purposely omitted from this report a list of needs and improvements for the coming year. Until times are better and until all indebtedness is cleared .our program is one of the strictest economy. Yet we do not want it to be that which will cause us to go backward instead of forward. On the report of the treasurer the first of July will depend many of our plans for the coming year. Contributions came in wonderfully last year in spiteof difficult times and we believe the: will again this spring.

Reports from chapter representatives to college Panhellenics have been studied, however, and help has been given with the individual problems reported to her. She has maintained close relations with the N.P.C. Chairman of the Committee on College Panhellenics and has worked for the adjustment of all difficulties which involved Pi Beta Phi chapters. The record of the fraternity for ethical rushing is an enviable one and the past two years have found the fraternity free from any drastic penalization for the breaking of rushing rules. She urges, however, a still keener reali-zation on the part of individual members of the fraternity of their responsibility for keeping both the spirit and the letter of all rushing rules. No chapter, she honestly believes, deliberately breaks rushing rules; some are discredited because individual members thoughtlessly do break them. On some campuses, bid day is that in name only since all groups know definitely beforehand just what rushees are to be their pledges. Such a violation of the spirit of preferential bid-ding can but bring discredit to the fraternity system. The condition can-not be remedied by any one fraternity but Pi Beta Phi chapters could well be the leaders in bringing about a correct use of the preferential bidding

Sugarlands The opening of the school term in August found Mrs. Dowell Eva Hathaway, and Emily Burton back on duty, Mrs. Dowell for her 10th year, Emily for her 13th, and Eva for her fourth. The school was maintained as in other years. The eight grades were taught by Eva and Emily, the county paying their salaries. Mrs. Dowell was on the Pi Phi pay roll as housemother and community worker. Eva had shop work with some of the older boys, Mary Rachel Armstrong, the Gatlin-burg home economics teacher, had a class in Sugarlands one afternoon each week. While the school work has gone very well indeed, the girls have felt dissatisfied with their community accomplishments. The community has been demoralized for some time be-cause of the uncertainties connected with the establishment of the national park. All knew their homes must be sold. Some were glad, some sorry, and all wondered just what would come to pass. While many families moved during the year the enrollment remained large enough to make a two-teacher school necessary and we believe it will be about the same size next year. Our cottage is not yet sold but probably will be soon. However, we will be able to use it as long as there is need of a school there. When the Government really takes over the management of the park area we can look forward to a more settled condition again. In January Mrs. Dowell was very ill and we all had many anxious days. She has become stronger again but we fear for her to be in a place where she is so far from medical care and where there is neither telephone nor auto road. Mrs. Dowell has been such a vital part of the school family for The September ARROW 7] years and has so endeared herself to our group and the people of Gatlin-burg and Sugarlands and her place is so hard to fill, that she will be greatly missed. I have purposely omitted from this report a list of needs and improvements for the coming year. Until times are better and until all indebtedness is cleared .our program is one of the strictest economy. Yet we do not want it to be that which will cause us to go backward instead of forward. On the report of the treasurer the first of July will depend many of our plans for the coming year. Contributions came in wonderfully last year in spiteof difficult times and we believe the: will again this spring. Because of illness in my family i was necessary for me to live awa: from the school from September t( May.

Reports from chapter representatives to college Panhellenics have been studied, however, and help has been given with the individual problems reported to her. She has maintained close relations with the N.P.C. Chairman of the Committee on College Panhellenics and has worked for the adjustment of all difficulties which involved Pi Beta Phi chapters. The record of the fraternity for ethical rushing is an enviable one and the past two years have found the fraternity free from any drastic penalization for the breaking of rushing rules. She urges, however, a still keener reali-zation on the part of individual members of the fraternity of their responsibility for keeping both the spirit and the letter of all rushing rules. No chapter, she honestly believes, deliberately breaks rushing rules; some are discredited because individual members thoughtlessly do break them. On some campuses, bid day is that in name only since all groups know definitely beforehand just what rushees are to be their pledges. Such a violation of the spirit of preferential bid-ding can but bring discredit to the fraternity system. The condition can-not be remedied by any one fraternity but Pi Beta Phi chapters could well be the leaders in bringing about a correct use of the preferential bidding

Reports from chapter representatives to college Panhellenics have been studied, however, and help has been given with the individual problems reported to her. She has maintained close relations with the N.P.C. Chairman of the Committee on College Panhellenics and has worked for the adjustment of all difficulties which involved Pi Beta Phi chapters. The record of the fraternity for ethical rushing is an enviable one and the past two years have found the fraternity free from any drastic penalization for the breaking of rushing rules. She urges, however, a still keener reali-zation on the part of individual members of the fraternity of their responsibility for keeping both the spirit and the letter of all rushing rules. No chapter, she honestly believes, deliberately breaks rushing rules; some are discredited because individual members thoughtlessly do break them. On some campuses, bid day is that in name only since all groups know definitely beforehand just what rushees are to be their pledges. Such a violation of the spirit of preferential bid-ding can but bring discredit to the fraternity system. The condition can-not be remedied by any one fraternity but Pi Beta Phi chapters could well be the leaders in bringing about a correct use of the preferential bidding

Reports from chapter representatives to college Panhellenics have been studied, however, and help has been given with the individual problems reported to her. She has maintained close relations with the N.P.C. Chairman of the Committee on College Panhellenics and has worked for the adjustment of all difficulties which involved Pi Beta Phi chapters. The record of the fraternity for ethical rushing is an enviable one and the past two years have found the fraternity free from any drastic penalization for the breaking of rushing rules. She urges, however, a still keener reali-zation on the part of individual members of the fraternity of their responsibility for keeping both the spirit and the letter of all rushing rules. No chapter, she honestly believes, deliberately breaks rushing rules; some are discredited because individual members thoughtlessly do break them. On some campuses, bid day is that in name only since all groups know definitely beforehand just what rushees are to be their pledges. Such a violation of the spirit of preferential bid-ding can but bring discredit to the fraternity system. The condition can-not be remedied by any one fraternity but Pi Beta Phi chapters could well be the leaders in bringing about a correct use of the preferential bidding 58 The September ARROW selfish service rendered by the many rich a heritage.

GRACE FILLER Report of the Chairman of the Settlement School IT IS a pleasure to report to the fraternity the steady forward progress of the Settlement School in Gatlinburg. No spectacular events mark the year 1930-31, but the definite influence of the school in the community can be seen in more than one way, and the loyalty of the people to the school can be measured by more than one event. This evidence is exceedingly hearteniqg when one considers the changes that are so rapidly making the remote village into one of many stopping places on a crowded holiday highway. The leadership of the school was never more needed, since material prosperity does not always bring higher ideals and unselfish motives, nor does a better standard of living con-note honesty of purpose and integrity of life. The mountaineer needs the school to help him preserve his native heritage of staunch ideals, honest purpose, outstanding integrity, and keen intelligence. Guidance is needed as never before. Living standards are changing in the burg, but in outlying districts little change can be noted from the early days of the school. The numbers attending the school vary little from year to year. The one hundred and seventy of this year is perhaps a high-water mark. The fact that the high school work is now being recognized by the state, and a small reimbursement per pupil voted annually is encouraging. The pressure for the last two years of high school to be given in Gatlinburg is great, but we cannot consider it under present crowded conditions. The pupilshave made splendid progress at school and gained much through other activities within the school, Those who are living in the dormitories are exceptionally privileged since they gain much from the close association with the staff. The largest problem now facing us is to find adequate and sanitary dormitory facilities for the boys who for the past three years have been crowded into a small, dark rented cottage without heat, except in the living rooms; and unsuitable in every way for the purpose to which it is being put. It is not right to ask the housemother to run the risk that she does there. Illness of a serious character has each year been evidenced among the dormitory boys. The management of the school under the new principal, Mr. King, has been most satisfactory. Teaching has progressed favorably with a staff who are enthusiastic teachers and leaders. Home economics, agriculture, and manual training, and weaving have taken their important place in the school curriculum under the most efficient direction of their respective teachers, as well as reaching into the near-by communities and having their influence upon the people in them. Volunteer work, done by Miss Glover and Miss Pratt, have eased the crowded duties of the other teachers, and made for a more effective daily pro-gram. Management of the home and supervision of the meals for a family of forty-five has been most success-fully carried out by Mrs. Rorex, with help from local girls as cooks, The September ARROW and dormitory girls in the cottages. The farm has been well handled and produced a satisfactory crop, and that in a time of widespread drought. This is due to the care of our farmers, aided by the dormitory boys. The work of our nurse, Frances Moore, would require a separate re-port, so varied and full is it. Her unselfish service is known throughout the countryside, and she is dearly loved, and her visits looked forward to. Lillie Reagan is the guardian of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center and meets the many problems that come to its doors in a capable and competent manner. As for the Arrowcraft business, one could talk endlessly of the ever in-creasing variety of beautiful and useful things that are to be found there. Each one of these lovely things rep-resents help to some local family: the bringing into some home of a necessity or a little luxury which otherwise would not reach it. LaDelle Allen can tell many a story of the men and women who have made baskets, furniture, towels, coverlets, etc., that would keep you spellbound. Her able assistants, Veatress Parton and Alice McCarter, are Gatlinburg girls of whom we are very proud. The Arrowcraft business has launched a new enterprise, and one that promises to bring worth-while returns. In April a little shop was opened in the Mountain View Hotel for the sale of Arrow-craft products. Many of the visitors at the hotel did not find their way to the Arrowcraft Shop, so we thought it wise to bring the shop to them. The few weeks' returns are proving the wisdom of this venture. Community activities continue to thrive under the wing of the school. Meetings of weaving women, parent-teachers association meetings, basket-ball for the older boys of the community under Mr. Mattil's able super-vision, Old Timers' Day, and other activities keep alive, al to grow, the plant of commun and civic responsibility. Sugarlands has had a st school year under the splend: tion of Eva Hathaway and En ton, in spite of unforeseen occl Scarlet fever closed the sc: two weeks in the fall. In the r the winter, Mrs. Dowell, our housemother at Sugarlands, ill very suddenly, and lay in condition for weeks. We are indeed that she has made a covery, but regretful that not come back to her belove tains to work with her love tain folk. The work that Mrs has done at Gatlinburg art lands cannot be estimated.

We ma to sell the teachers cottag Park very shortly, but we will to occupy it until there is nc need of a school in that pal Park. The separation of the Ar business from the school b( establishing it as a unit by it entailed much work on the pe bookkeeper, Miss Cooke, but ing for a clearer understandii financial state.

To revive a lost handicraft is indeed a 11l thing, and we are fortunate been chosen' as the school in his is to be done. It shows a finite appraisal of, and high nt to, the work we are doing nburg. It will be the largest individual gift we have ever received. Under the guidance of Mr. Mattil, it should give wonderful opportunities to our boys for learning a new trade. Our school continues to take and keep its place among other mountain schools, and to make its contribution towards the solving of mountain school problems. It is a charter member of the newly-organized Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. We also have close connections with other agencies through the Mountain Workers Conference where we are well represented. In state and county teachers meetings, health conferences, Future Farmers of Tennessee organizations, and other educational groups, we are ably represented by our staff. Every member of the committee has had a busy and happy year working for the school. The duties of each are different, and the wholehearted way in which they have carried them out has been a joy to witness. The clear vision and helpful discussion of school problems in the round robins has greatly lightened the duties of the chairman. Blanche Curtis' duties have not been easy, for accidents will prevent the getting of copy on time, and disappointments were many. She has patiently borne with these, and given the fraternity clear-cut glimpses of what is being done at the school through the "Little Pigeon News." It is with regret that we recognize that her term of office is over, and with great appreciation, that we acknowledge the splendid way in which she has conducted her department in THE ARROW, and faithfully performed her secretarial duties. Helen Tottle has put the slides in order, and cared for requests for the slides and films, and arranged the In-formation Folder regarding the school, which is delighting you all. Rebecca White has had many and demanding duties which have kept her constantly busy. Letters to fraternity The September ARROW officers, alum= clubs, active chapters, and seniors of 1929 and 1930 have been written. She has issued Settlement School program material to eighteen clubs and three chapters, as well as material on the school and mountain people to individuals and other groups. She has maintained a very close contact with the Central Office and the Magazine Agency that was mutually beneficial. In the spring she conducted a survey of the interest that the club members take in the school through a questionnaire. The answers were tabulated. In addition she gathered together the statistical data which is chartered in the Settlement School exhibit at this Convention. Her carefulness, thoroughness, and deep interest could not be surpassed. For our treasurer, Grace Post, only words of the highest commendation can be used. She has been untiring in her efforts to simplify the books, and give the audit a form which will make it clear to all how we stand from year to year. This has been a discouraging year for her, as for all the committee since contributions have been slow in coming in, and in some instances there has been a substantial reduction under the previous year. Last July we cut our budget for this year to the lowest possible figure. Now we face the fact that we may not receive what we had budgeted for. We realize that clubs and chapters are doing their utmost to carry on as in previous years, and we are making no complaint. We must, however, let you know frankly the situation that is facing your Settlement School. The debt for the Indus-trial Building is large. It will be years before it is paid off at the present rate of reduction, and before that occurs, we are not justified in undertaking any new project, however badly needed. We do not, however, anticipate a reduction of staff or salaries, or a curtailment of present work so long asthe clubs, chapters, and individua wial continue to give their support in the past. We feel sure that we c count on you to continue to do wh you have done. The Chairman's duties have been pleasure because of the splendid c operation on the part of every mer ber of the Committee. She is deeply a preciative of this, and more than hap] to have had the opportunity and pH.), lege of knowing intimately such sple did women. In November, she may a visit to the school to accept ti wood-working shop. A visit of tl Founders had been planned for th time, but unfortunately none of the could come. In April, a conference three members of the committee w held at the home of Rebecca White. was deemed necessary to discuss ce taro problems and make some decisio: before committee meeting in Augur At the next meeting your Chairman r gretfully gives up her position aft four years of very happy servi for the Settlement School. She begs thank all those who have made h work a pleasure: To her Committ she gives a warm, affectionate a preciation of their sympathetic undt standing of the problems of the schc and their close cooperation in tryi: to forward the work there. To Gra: Council members, and in particular the Grand President, she expresses deep gratefulness for the patience a wisdom that have been shown in a vising her. To the Director of t School her heart goes out in tr admiration and heartfelt love for she has given of time and thought helping her work as chairman, a making it easier, and giving so mu and so generously of herself in friet ship. For the members of the staff the school she desires to express I pride that she feels, as does all Pi P in the accomplishments that they so successfully achieving through th work in the school. With gratitt i.2 ;he thanks the members of the frater-Iity---clubs, active chapters, and indiriduals as well as interested friends, The September ARROW for their generous support of the school. EDITH H. GORDON Report of the Director of the Pi Beta Phi Settle ent School THE report for 1930-31 'ollows closely that of 1929-30. This s to be expected under existing conlitions. The number in school would laturally continue about the same as tie cannot take more boarding pupils Lnd the daily attendance changes but ittle from year to year. The several lepartments of the school have coninued along the same lines with no hought of further development at )resent but a real effort to keep from aking any backward steps during this ime of financial depression. It has )een necessary for us to cut our bud--.et each year for the past three and Lgain this year we shall do the same, ret this we hope has not been done Frith serious results to the real work )f the school. Few schools have taken is small a cut as we have and again ve have our loyal Pi Phis to thank or their untiring efforts. There never tas been more positive proof of the )lace the schoOl holds in the hearts of he many, many Pi Phis than this coninued support during these difficult imes. Not only the contributions but he Arrowcraft business held up to Llmost the same fine mark. Surely here must have been a larger amount )f interest and energy expended to ac-:omplish these results than ever be-ore. The Smoky Mountain National Park s now assured and practically all the lecessary land has been turned over o the Government. While the park will tome to within a half mile of Gatlin-)urg we do not anticipate many :hanges for the school. Sugarlands is n the park area and we feel reasonibly sure that our extension work therewill end in the spring. All that will depend on the number of families remaining in that area of the park. Al-ready a great many tourists are coming, both winter and summer. Coming into Gatlinburg over a good highway and stopping at a comfortable modern hotel causes many Pi Phis to think the work of the school must be about over. Not so. Stop long enough to look a bit further and think a bit deeper and you will be convinced that there is still plenty to do. In fact each year brings more instead of less. Who dreamed all this when the school was first established ? Who would dream now of stopping? The challenge continues. The staff for the year has been: Evelyn Bishop, New York Alpha director. William King, University of Tennessee prin cipal, mathematics and science, seventh and tenth grades. Vivian Blair, Oregon Alpha English and history. Barbara Horton, Missouri Gamma fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri Beta second and third grades. Eleanor Brabson, East Tennessee Normal primer and first grade. Mary Rachel Armstrong, University of Tennessee home economics. F. D. Smith, University of Tennessee Smith Hughes Agriculture. Victoria Strand weaving. LaDelle Allen, Arkansas Alpha Arrowcraft. Elizabeth Cooke accountant. Frances Moore nurse. Mrs. Rorex girls' dormitory and manager boarding department. Miss Niblock housemother, boys' dormitory. Mrs. Dowell, Iowa Beta housemother, community worker, Sugarlands. Eva Hathaway, Iowa Beta principal fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, Sugar-lands. Emily Burton, Tennessee Alpha first, second, third, and fourth grades, Sugarlands. Miss Glover assistant in the high school, and Miss Pratt, assistant in the weaving de partment, were volunteer workers. The September ARROW The following local people were on the staff : Veatress Parton Arrowcraft Shop. Alice McCarter Arrowcraft Shop. Lillie Reagan assistant at the hospital. Ernest Reagan general work. Arlie McCarter gardens, furnaces, general work. Ambrose Ogle farm, supervisor of student labor of boys. Martha Cole cook. 011ie Higdon cook. School Although we had a new principal for the school and one new grade teacher, the work ran smoothly from the start and we can report a good school year. The total enrollment for the year was 170. Of this number 124 were in the first six grades and 46 in the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades. The changes made in the grade building of putting primer and first grade in one room, second, and third grades in the next, and fourth, fifth, and sixth grades in the third room proved much more satisfactory than having the first three grades in one room. It evened up numbers and work much better. The county allows us salaries for four grade teachers so the grade work is not carried at a financial loss. The state will also allow us this year a small amount per pupil for high school work. While the sum is not large we feel it will increase year by year and it will relieve some of our hardest working pupils of having to earn their tuition. Also this amount will be in cash instead of being worked out .by the pupils. Six pupils completed eighth grade and six completed second year high school. Of those who finished their work here all will probably go on to some other school to finish their course. There is a plea all the time for four years of high school here. This comes from the university as well as the people here, for they say so fewschools provide ways wherf can work their way througl training they receive ot school hours is of so mu HoweVer we cannot think 4 those two years yet for it wositate more room for board: and we are overcrowded no. The boys have had a goc ball team, Mr. King, the coaching. The girls did not side teams but instead had a club. It gave them practice games and we felt we real: plished more in physical trair rietta McCutchan coached tl One very real help in the past year has been in hay Glover in charge of the sti Miss Glover, a successful tee self, knew so well where she of the most help in the scho fact that she was giving he made no difference in the ste she spent in the school roon The noon lunch for the pr underweight grade childrer sumed with the usual good r The cooperation of the P. the teachers was a great hel ways than we can mention el their greatest help was witl lunch. Agriculture Smith Hughes Agricultu: linburg calls for leaving tt path of high school teachin an extent and one must bl to keep up with the variou that come night or day. S from the report of Don Sr culture teacher, give some i work but fail to tell half th Twenty-seven boys wen in the school classes, 11 in h 16 in seventh and eighth grr boys were given practical in connection with the we farm pruning and sprayir a shed for the protection ( 4 The September ARROW ivies, making hotbeds, slaughtering ogs, and "curing" meat comprise )me of the things done by the classes. Cow feed was bought and the boys -eighed and mixed it. Calls from arents of the boys were answered and eip giving in pruning, spraying, and le treating of sick animals. The F.F.T. organization was a wide-wake one. The boys sent two repremtatives to Nashville for the state invention in the spring and several [an to attend the summer camp for a loft time. The purpose of the club, quote Mr. Smith's report is "to :rengthen the confidence of the count' boy in himself, in country life ad in the business of farming." The Pi Beta Phi Chapter holds a tembership in the Sevier County arm Bureau. This year the boys premted a loving cup to be given to the (ost outstanding high school girl, her ame to be engraved on the cup. The ame of Adis Clabo was put on the ap. Adis is from Wears Valley. This an honor well worth working for tad the first of the kind to be estabshed in the school. A day unit class was held at Laurel ick, ten boys were enrolled and their .ork was with small shop tools. This spring six of the boys are rais-1g chicks gotten from the school ock. The boys painted a room in the :hoolhouse and erected a forty-foot agpole on the, school grounds. The Wears Valley class has been aid the past year for men instead of )ys. Thirty-six adult farmers took up le study of Burley tobacco raising. he individual work with the farmers ill continue through the summer. The farmers in the vicinity of atlinburg, under the direction of Le school agricultural department, )ught cooperatively twelve tons of Lttle feed at a material saving. Sev-.al bought fertilizer in this same ay. The home projects of the boys are always interesting, as the following list will show: Boys Kind of project 6 Hens 1 Horses 4 Brood sows 1 Fattening hog 4 Dairy cows 2 Beef calves 1 Acre of corn 3 1 / acres of potatoes 1 5,,g acre beans Evening class-25 farmers working with tobacco. Day unit class-6 boys working with poultry. Home Economics This department has followed the same course as in other years, high school work during the mornings, cornmrmity classes and visits in the after-noon. The high school girls follow the prescribed course but in addition have a great deal of practical experience. This year a project was made with the freshman girls in the dormitory of remodeling and repairing some dresses that had been sent in. As the girls are all working their way through school and often with little help from home, the dresses were a great help as well as a good lesson. The sophomore girls made their commencement dress-es. As the dormitory takes so much time out of school hours the freshman girls this summer will do their projects at home. A class was carried one afternoon each week in Sugarlands, one in Laurel Lick school, and an afternoon class in Gatlinburg for the women. Foods and clothing were taught in the two schools but the Gatlinburg class this past year studied homes. In the spring one kitchen was remodeled, one rearranged, a living room finished and furnished, as well as some other plans talked over. In May Mrs. Zucarello, of the state department, was here for an intensive The September ARROW sewing course and the accomplishments of these days under her are al-most unbelievable. Home visiting was quite a part of the program of this department the past year and one that should bring fine results. The development of the P.T.A. was a real accomplishment and one that was sponsored by this department. Although there was no Gatlinburg Fair the women had a fine exhibit of canning, cooking, sewing, and weaving in the fall. Dormitory Dormitory is a title much too large for our little cottages but not one bit too large for the work done. Any-thing in the line of dormitory life complicates the problems and adds to the expense of the school but there is no question of the big dividends it pays in the training given the boys and girls. That it is recognized is shown by the number of people asking to come to the dormitories, many more than we have any room for. We surely have proved over and over that boys and girls like to be busy and that as long as they are busy problems of discipline are few. Only those who want to go to school and who want to work come so we have a busy crowd most of the time. The first few months they are here the work has to be pretty carefully supervised but they are bright boys and girls and usually make real progress in course of a year. We feel that the training given in practical work is as valuable as that given in the class room. It is not possible to take more than twenty-five boys and girls and we usually do not have more than twenty. The ten in the boys' cottage have been in very crowded quarters but they never complain. We feel, however, that it is better to rent another cottage instead of the one we have rented thepast two years, moving the boy a larger place even though ft from the school. This necessitate ing some place for a wash and ( ing room and already a frienc given half enough to finish a roc the basement of the grade school ing. Last winter when there w much sickness we realized that a heated, crowded house caused difficulties that should be avoid We all feel that here is a big in which to develop boys and girl give valuable training. Health Combining so much of be school and community nursing i such a full program in Gatli. that we would gladly modify it knew how to make changes fc better. There are thirteen schools is district that the nurse visits a several of these schools carries a complete program. It requires l frequent visits and the cooperat. the teacher. Gatlinburg school awarded 2: ribbons the past year, which that each child had had all reme defects corrected, had been imtm against typhoid, diphtheria, smal had kept a satisfactory health record for one month, and had satisfactory school work. One tonsil clinic was held in S ville, twelve from Gatlinburg operated on. A Knoxville dentist contint come one Saturday each moni finds he has fewer patients, d doubt to the people being able. to Sevierville more easily and o: For this same reason the doctor discontinued their afternoons Health Center. While we som wish they did come regularly tl a saving in sterile supplies and as the people now get them for selves in most cases. 66 The September ARROW The past two years preventive tubercular work has been stressed. Several chest clinics have been held, the state sending their specialists for these clinics. An x-ray machine has been added to their equipment, which is of much help. Before the last chest clinic twenty tuberculin tests were given. There are a surprisingly large number of cases and a real effort is being made to put these cases under a home program of care that will be of benefit. The year has brought a good many interesting and hard cases. One baby from two miles above Elkmont has had to be taken to Knoxville frequently for treatment during the entire year. A fifteen-year-old girl with pellagra and leg ulcers was in the Health Center two weeks and while her legs are now healed (after being bad for five years) and she is back at her home in Laurel Lick, she still is under the care of the nurse. The Red Cross supply of milk got-ten this spring has been a great help for these cases. The dormitory pupils and staff have been on the sick list much of the year. Thirteen have been in the Health Center, a good many other sick at the various cottages. If one could stop outside work during these periods it would not be so difficult but as it is one nurse has to go in a good many different directions. Lillie Reagan is always the standby at the hospital and as dependable as ever. The nurse has watched with interest the results of the noon lunch, especially in the cases of the underweights, and has been much gratified with the results. She has given of her time all the year in helping with menus, hand washing, and of course cod liver oil. Perhaps a summing up of some of the work might help to give a little idea of the busy days. Mileage 10,131 iniles Field visits 1,064 Inoculations completed 383 Minor treatments and dressings at hospi tal 718 Little Mothers' classes 11 attendance 86 Home Hygiene classes 16 attendance 172 Mothers' Classes 2 attendance 11 But most difficult of all is the in-ability to cope with the difficult situations that the nurse is sure to find. How to help families in hard financial straits, to get children into the proper institutions, get medical care for those too far away and unable to pay, to solve family problems that you are called on to help with ; all these things complicate the work but also make it a worth-while service. Arro car Craft As the books close June 30 this re-port is not the final one. Arrowcraft, at the beginning o the fiscal year, opened its own books and own bank account. Not the least detail of the business has gone through the other school books. Surely this year there will be no doubt about where we stand when the final report is made. The business has held up well in spite of hard times. Sales have been of about the usual amount and payments prompt. The clubs must have made a great effort to have accomplished this and the results have been evidenced here in the employment given the women and in the prompt payments they have received. Orders from the clubs coming in early in the fall relieved some of the Christmas rush, returning all left-over goods and making final settlement be-fore the books closed helped, a good many clubs keeping the same person in charge was a help to the club and the school. If only the time could come when a club account could be carried under one name instead of The September ARROW several many difficulties would be avoided. The Arrowcraft means more to the community than we can tell and it would be utterly impossible for us to carry this large business, for a real business it is now, without the splendid support the clubs and chapters give. With nine shops in Gatlinburg selling weaving and other home products our cash sales from tourists cannot be expected to be on a very large scale. Also our overhead is much more than any other shop and some materials are of a better grade so prices are some higher in our shop. We do make every effort to send things out that will be lovely, that we can stand behind, and that will be salable. Our real business must be mail and express and the Pi This those who keep it going. Hotel Shop Arrowcraft has made a new venture this spring in putting a shop in the Mountain View Hotel. Mr. Huff built an attractive and very comfortable hotel last year and at once we aspired to a shop in the lobby. The spring was cold and business slow in starting but even this early we feel sure we can say the Shop is going to be a success. It is always interesting to notice the license plates on the cars parked in front of the hotel and even in winter one is surprised at the number of states represented every week-end. While a good many people come for several days there are a good many who stop at the hotel for only a short time and never are near the school. These are the ones who make the Shop worth while. Weaving Teaching weaving in Gatlinburg, like agriculture, home economics and nursing, is a varied program day by day. Imagine having your pupil; tered up and down Roaring Mill Creek, Baskins, and ever: creek, not one family living on proved road, distances you mus being anywhere from a short 1 a woman living in the field b the school to a trip of a half more horseback or on foot. Yo you can wait for some of then until a pleasant day but per: special order must be hurried t: and you go, rain or snow. Love outdoors, the people, and work sential. The seventh and eighth grac have a double period of weavit] school day. These girls do lit sale as their class work is real i tion from the very beginning class comes in the morning, a morning is also the time whe of the women come to the sch supplies, advice, and to make The afternoons are planned fo visits but one cannot have a dc worked out program from day Too many things interfere ti it. During the school year ther been 1,254 calls at the weavin; for supplies, warps, and advic, Strand has made 500 calls homes. I only wish I knew the 13 horseback, and walking these have required. This year, Miss Pratt, a horn onstration agent who has had time off because of poor heal helped in the weaving room. S. weighed materials, made out ders, and been of great help t Strand. She has done this v exchange for her board and 1-i has left Miss Strand time for instruction and has been a ver factory arrangement.

Wood-working Shop Although this is a year when we are following a most rigid program of economy there is one piece of real development going on. This is possible through the gift of a new wood shop for the school. With no special interest in Pi Phi but a deep one in the development of the boys of the community, Mr. L. E. Voorheis has offered to build and equip a wood-working shop. Mr. Voorheis is from Cincinnati but has been spending much of his time in Gatlinburg for the past four or five years and is wide awake to the needs and the opportunities for help. The shop will be built of rock, will be well planned and equipped, will have a dry kiln and be large enough to keep several boys and men at work. While the boys will be in school part of the time it no doubt will be necessary to work a few men in order to keep up with the furniture orders that are always coming in. This will give an opportunity for the very kind of work we like to have. This is, much the largest individual gift that has ever come to the school and we shall make every effort for it to fulfill the mission it is designed for, However there are absolutely no strings attached to the gift in anyway. The past year Mr. Mattil has continued his wood-working business and the orders have kept from four to seven men busy all the time. There are also two classes each Saturday afternoon for these men and the local basket and furniture makers, subjects discussed being those pertaining to their work, those working in the shop had work along the line of mechanical drawing and designing, as well as construction problems relating to furniture making, with courses continuing at home. The other class was in the nature of a weekly conference of problems arising in their work at home. The September ARROW There is still the feeling that the wood-working department should be under the school management and eventually it must come to that but just now we should be very glad to have Mr. Mattil carry it. Possibly by the first of the year a different arrangement can be made. It may be that the department can be self-supporting, with the aid we receive from the state for this work. Our experience has been, however, that it al-ways takes a few years to put any industry on a self-supporting basis. Community One goes on for several years, not knowing whether much is being accomplished or not. Then suddenly some one thing develops with such rapidity you realize seeds must have been planted and roots growing for some time. Surely this must have been the case of the P.T.A. organization. The women responded too splendidly and loyally for any mushroom growth of community spirit. The thing that stimulated this growth was the need for a noon lunch for the primary and underweight grade children. This had been discontinued for three years but all felt it should be resumed and it was so voted at the 1930 committee meeting. The first steps taken were in the right direction. Members of the staff, particularly the nurse, home economics teacher and grade teachers, visited every home rep-resented in the school. They told the need of a nourishing lunch, the way they hoped it could be managed, and asked for the parents' cooperation in sending vegetables, fruit, etc. Almost every family responded gladly and their interest did not lag during the school year. Each Wednesday after-noon the home economics teacher and the nurse made out the menu for the week and wrote the notes to parents who were to furnish supplies for thosedays. The children bring a lunch fro home and one extra dish is given. may be tomatoes, custard, hot cocoa-plain but nourishing food. During ti fall a box supper was given which ne ted enough to buy spoons, cups, ar bowls for the lunch room. A supp] of paint and an afternoon of wor did wonders to cans, benches, and -b bless The high school girls took tun helping with the dishes and also tE hand-washing of fifty little folks. Two meetings are held each mont] one afternoon meeting devoted to bus ness and one night meeting whic takes the form of a community affai Harp singing, speaking, plays, an games furnished the entertainmen The women conduct the meetings an are continuing them through the sun men I only hope that out of this wi grow a group interested in civic in provement. With the rapidly changin Gatlinburg it is needed and it seen that there are leaders among the won en. For the first time several years Gal linburg did not have a fair. This wa due in part to the bad season for fan and garden crops and also to a lac of timely interest on the part of tb local people. No doubt an off-year i a good thing now an then, and vv are looking forward to a splendid fai this fall. Old Timers' Day continues to be a outstanding community day of th year. People, old and young, enjoy real home day with old friends an neighbors. The contests of spinnin weaving, corn-husking, and in fa( about everything one can imagine c the old days, create much interest an fun. It is the one distinctly Gatlinbur day of the year.

Sugarlands The opening of the school term in August found Mrs. Dowell Eva Hathaway, and Emily Burton back on duty, Mrs. Dowell for her 10th year, Emily for her 13th, and Eva for her fourth. The school was maintained as in other years. The eight grades were taught by Eva and Emily, the county paying their salaries. Mrs. Dowell was on the Pi Phi pay roll as housemother and community worker. Eva had shop work with some of the older boys, Mary Rachel Armstrong, the Gatlin-burg home economics teacher, had a class in Sugarlands one afternoon each week. While the school work has gone very well indeed, the girls have felt dissatisfied with their community accomplishments. The community has been demoralized for some time be-cause of the uncertainties connected with the establishment of the national park. All knew their homes must be sold. Some were glad, some sorry, and all wondered just what would come to pass. While many families moved during the year the enrollment remained large enough to make a two-teacher school necessary and we believe it will be about the same size next year. Our cottage is not yet sold but probably will be soon. However, we will be able to use it as long as there is need of a school there. When the Government really takes over the management of the park area we can look forward to a more settled condition again. In January Mrs. Dowell was very ill and we all had many anxious days. She has become stronger again but we fear for her to be in a place where she is so far from medical care and where there is neither telephone nor auto road. Mrs. Dowell has been such a vital part of the school family for The September ARROW 7] years and has so endeared herself to our group and the people of Gatlin-burg and Sugarlands and her place is so hard to fill, that she will be greatly missed. I have purposely omitted from this report a list of needs and improvements for the coming year. Until times are better and until all indebtedness is cleared .our program is one of the strictest economy. Yet we do not want it to be that which will cause us to go backward instead of forward. On the report of the treasurer the first of July will depend many of our plans for the coming year. Contributions came in wonderfully last year in spiteof difficult times and we believe the: will again this spring.

Reports from chapter representatives to college Panhellenics have been studied, however, and help has been given with the individual problems reported to her. She has maintained close relations with the N.P.C. Chairman of the Committee on College Panhellenics and has worked for the adjustment of all difficulties which involved Pi Beta Phi chapters. The record of the fraternity for ethical rushing is an enviable one and the past two years have found the fraternity free from any drastic penalization for the breaking of rushing rules. She urges, however, a still keener reali-zation on the part of individual members of the fraternity of their responsibility for keeping both the spirit and the letter of all rushing rules. No chapter, she honestly believes, deliberately breaks rushing rules; some are discredited because individual members thoughtlessly do break them. On some campuses, bid day is that in name only since all groups know definitely beforehand just what rushees are to be their pledges. Such a violation of the spirit of preferential bid-ding can but bring discredit to the fraternity system. The condition can-not be remedied by any one fraternity but Pi Beta Phi chapters could well be the leaders in bringing about a correct use of the preferential bidding
