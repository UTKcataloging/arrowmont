'24 45S Rodney Ave., Portland, Ore. A DRESS FOR MRS. COOLIDGE The Pi Beta Phis of Kansas City will long remember Armistice Day of 1926, as it brought to the city for the dedication of its Memorial, President and Mrs. Coolidge. Since their stay was of only a few hours duration it was impossible for the Pi Phis to obtain any time for the entertnment of M Is. Coolidge. Anxious, how. ever, to do something to express their admiration and love for her, a n d feeling that flowers would bring only a momeat's pleasure a n d could then be lost to her in the myriads of other bouquets, these Pi Phis decided that a gift f r o in the Settlement S .c h o o 1 at Gatlinbur:T, Tenn., might bring her lasting pleasure. When this idea was transmitted to Miss Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident at the School, it received her hearty endorsement and she straightway set the School's most expert weaver, Edna McCarter, a girl of fifteen, to work upon the weaving of a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block 'pattern of self color. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by AGNts MILLER TURNER (MRS. J. R.), EDNA McCARTER .4 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PM The material arrived in Kansas City just a day before the ne for its presentation and was greatly admired by those who Ld a glimpse of it, ere, with a picture of the young weaver at m:loom, it went into its snowy wrappings, and was bound about ith ties of wine and blue. Mrs. Clyde Porter (Willie M. Reed, Iowa r), president the alumnae club, presented the dress through a courteous It watchful member of the Secret Service on guard at the pot:-1s of the presidential suite. Later Mrs. A. I. Beach (Marjorie [arshall, Kansas A), the wife of Kansas City's mayor, and host-s, to the President's party, told Mrs. Coolidge the details of Le weaving of the dress and found her to be most appreciative it. So, in the gardens of the White House in early spring per--11)s our lovely First Lady will walk, clad in a gown of softest hate. Several days after the presentation a most cordial note of wanks came from Mrs. Coolidge to the Kansas Alumnae Club. The Kansas City Star gives the following colorful descripon of Mrs. Coolidge during her first hours in the city : "The winsome smile of the First Lady of the land was one of the high-Tilts of the arrival of the presidential party. The President stepped from .e train with formal and dignified mein to meet the welcoming committee. at it was the smiling and beautiful woman alert of countenance and ready receive the hearty greeting of an admiring populace with genuine sinxity, who won all hearts.

SCHOOL STATE After a six weeks stay at Fluff's Inn, Mrs. R. A. Nickerson from St. Louis was so impressed with the work carried on by our School that she talked herself into the task of furnishing the program for an evening meeting of the St. Louis Alumnae Club. Mrs. Nickerson, not being a Pi Phi sent an S. O. S. to Miss Bishop for facts and the following will be self-explanatory. Dec. 11, 1.926 My Dear Mrs. Nickerson: Of course I remember you very well. To be sure I didn't see you or Mrs. Chandler as often as the Shop girls did but I knew you just the same. It is mighty nice of you to be roped into this and am sure we, as well as the St. Louis Pi Phis appreciate it. I find the clubs are so much more interested when they can really talk. with someone who has been to the School. Helen Chew, from the Sugarlands, has been having an enforced vacation this week (Inc to an attaek of the flu so when your letter came I read it to her and she said (just joking) that she would answer it for me as was rushing around trying to get baskets and weaving off in time for Christmas. Well, It didn't take me long really to call her bluff and the enclosed is the result. In reading over what she has written I find that she has entirely left out the Sugarlands work. Maybe she was too modest. Three years ago Helen started work six miles above here and now, with two other girls carries on not only the regular county school work there but does a good deal of most interesting adult work. Last year she had a class of boys two or three times a week after the regular school hours, then visited many older people and gave them personal intruetion. Several over sixty years learned to read and write their names. This year she is having night school at the cottage and some after-noon classes too. A sawmill in the Sugarlands has been furnishing a most interesting night class, the school morale being kept up to a large extent by the .man who is in charge of the work. With the lumber camp men who come twice a week, our night class numbers seventeen Impils amid then monthly attendance from one hundred to one hundred and fifty. Every class ends with an hour's play and because it is new they play like children. Last year we closed at Christmas, but this year this adult work bids fair to continue through the entire school year. In addition to the annual Christmas tree they have what I think is just fine, a community dinner on Thanksgiving at the schoolhouse. This is always preceded by a Thanksgiving sermon and this year, the additional pleasure of Mr. Harve Reagan's guitar.. 416 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI Cora McCarter, one of our local girls, has been with Miss Chew ever since she has been in Sugarlands and this year we have a Pi Phi from Indianapolis, Martha Flowers. The county is building a new schoolhouse at Sugarlands this year and the girls hope to be in it by the holidays. It is a three room, mod-ern building, a great improvement over the one room house they have had to teach in. Also it will have desks and a sliding partition between the rooms, which can easily be made into an auditorium. The people gave two acres of land adjoining the county school ground and on this the Pi Phis are building a Teachers' Cottage. A fund from the Pi Phis in Athens, Ohio has made the starting of this house possible, and although not sufficient to finish it now, they expect finally to complete it entirely. The house will be ready for the girls to move into by the first of the year. I had no idea I was going to draw such a prize from Helen but know you will be pleased with it. All good wishes for the meeting. Very sincerely ETELYN BIsHor December 11, 1926 My Dear Mrs. Nickerson : Miss Evelyn asked me to answer your letter, really for the purpose of giving me a little recuperation after a week of flu. She would do a great deal better herself, but maybe I can help you a little. I was here for four years and then went to the new center in the Sugarlands three years ago. Some of the newer girls might give you details that now pass me. One's first years are so full of the new ways of the people. To answer your first question about our new nurse. Miss Ruby Ryman is our nurse now, not a Pi Phi but a splendid girl who would do us credit if she were. At this time of year, with so much dampness and rain, colds and flu keep her traveling from one home to another. Measles have been in both schools all fall with now and then a case of mumps. Several babies have made their advent, with her assistance, and I believe next week we are to have an operation in the hospital. This fall we had a splendid tonsil clinic, with Dr. Potter, a specialist from Knoxville, in charge. A Knoxville dentist comes twice a month to our hospital. For the first few months he came only one Saturday a month but there was so much to be done he found that even Sundays would not take care of the patients so now takes two week-ends in the Burg. For quite a while our nurse has been working to get the feet of several children straightened. She has taken them to Knoxville Hospitals, where they are so fine to us. Just this fall two children, either by braces or operation, are walking with straightened feet. Kate NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 417 Iluskey, from the Sugarlands, and Eula Floyd from Baskins. Because Eula's mother was a young girl of fourteen who did not realize her responsibility in keeping braces on continually, Eula has been taken to the Shriners' Hospital in Lexington until she can be perfectly cured. Although every year increases the confidence of the people in our nurse, bringing them to her for help, still a larger part of her work is in the homes. She also keeps in touch with the county schools of this district by giving inoculations, vaccinations, eye examinations and weighing and measuring the school children. Any needing special care are then turned over to the doctors who come to us from time to time. No work done by our school comes nearer touching the vital part of the people's lives than the nurse's. Ruby is unusually tall, light curl. hair, a very straight forward and sincere girl in her relation to people. More community work is done by our weaving teacher, Gene Red-ding, also not a Pi Phi but just as interested in the School as if she were. This year her work is in the homes more than among the school children, with whom this department naturally started. She works in thirty homes, running about forty looms for the school. This work covers a radius of about five miles. Men, women and children weave. In many homes it is the only source of income, in others supplementary. No doubt you know the various articles we make: Dress goods, towels, scarfs, rugs, bath mats. curtain materials, bags and coverlets. Aside from this hand work we handle all sorts of baskets, made in the homes of the people. Our hand-work has grown to a considerable business, one of the largest departments in the School. Miss Redding has had splendid training, and with a fine taste naturally, is developing a very great appreciation among: the people for beauty as a nice fabric. She is tall and slender, dark hair and grey eyes. She comes from Boston, with a Boston twist to her words, and although this is her second year here she continues to take "Bahths." Jean Steel has classes in Domestic Science, in the School in the mornings and in this community and others in the afternoons. These community classes are for adults, held in most cases in the local schoolhouses. Her attendance for a month will average from seventy-five to one hundred, with usually from three to six to a class. There is no more discouraging work than the pioneer steps of such work with the mountain women. 'Two or three seem a small number but when the situation is really understood, it is a great triumph. The typical. mountain woman stays in her home. It is what you might call a folk way with the people, rather than a lack of interest, the changing of which is very slow. Every impression, no matter how small, leaves a dint of tremendous importance in their lives, becoming evident at the least expected moments. Jean is another one outside the ranks of Pi Phi. She is a very practical minded girl, with the keenest possible sense of humor. The 418 THE ARROVV OIP PI BETA PHI picture she makes in her new, long sheep skin coat, on our handsomest horse, "Lady", as she rides down the road, is a picture never to be for-gotten. We should add that in addition to the afore mentioned coat, she has a large horse blanket festooned around her,: giving the appearance of an old time circuit rider. Our agricultural man, Mr, Mattil, has been with us more than ...four years, carrying his work into many connnunities, through classes among the farmers, talks, pictures and fairs. Many men consult him every week about personal problems, often getting their start c...ht blooded stack, good seeds for their tields and varieties of fruits for their orchards. During the time lie has been here he has developed a community chicken hatchery at the school, a. pig club that has been the means of putting Berkshire pigs of the best kind through these hills, built up the County fair, assisted in building farm buildings for the school and community and developed the athletics in the school. Mr. Mattil is a Delta Tau Delta, from the University of Tennessee, tall and slender, with 'a very amiable disposition, allowing him to maintain his position with fortitude among fourteen women. Ills Ford, his horse and his dog are in constant use, and even if he desired, he could never make a get-away to the city alone. No one in. the place will ho moire missed, when he leaves us, (with the exception of Miss Evelyn 1 as Mr. Mattil. In the office this year La Done Allen is the new assistant to Miss Evelyn. *She is a Pi Phi from the University of Arkansas, valling Memphis and Little Rock, home. A well. set up girl, with brown hair and eyes, very hard boiled when it comes to postage money and telephone tolls. Every call over our new telephone is 20e amounting to a considerable sum if charged to the School, also causing a lot of trouble always to make change, consequently La Delle's string to every call. As all school bills go through her hands she is quite nut important appendage to the institution. Without her we never would have 1Jeen able to carry on the immense amount of business .pertaining to the industrial work that has so nearly swamped us this fall. In the School we have six teachers, not counting the special ont,s'. Each with two grades in a room, with the exception of the kindergarten, a new department this year. Our school now carries its pupils from the kindergarten through second year high school. We Intrnber 66 boys and 58 girls, not counting any of the community (qasses. Seven boys and girls are living here on the place. Dorothy Trainer, from Chicago, the youngest in the family of teachers, teaches the kindergarten, a class which numbers from six to eighteen, depending upon the weather and measles, etc. As there was no available room in the school-house for this class she has her class in what has always been the dining-room. of the Teachers Cottage. Dorothy is a decided blonde, with a thinking head on very small and young shoulders. She is new in the game but learning fast. 'NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 419 the primary is Emily Burton, from Montclair. She has first and second grades. Very small and exceedingly young looking but with nine years residence, an element to be reckoned with. Her years of service should make her worthy of wearing the Arrow. The next two grades are taught by Mrs. Chapin, of New York City. Herself a Pi Phi, as well as a Pi Phi mother. She came to us to live in the little girls' dormitory but remained to teach in the school. Elmer Watson, of the local community, teaches the 5th and 6th grades. He helps with the athletics and without him our Sunday School would fall far below its present standard. In the high school are Marion Folsom and Maggie White. Marion is a T.,7niversity of Vermont Pi Phi, with a residence here of four years. Dark and active, and, with a boyish bob and a sparkli)g eye, she is abundantly able to take care of her room full of boys. faggie White is the other one of our blondes, a Pi Phi from Austin, Texas, but hardly one of the wild western Texans you read about in books, a typical bud of the modern college. She came to us three years ago a society butterfly but today can hunt possum and climb mountains with any of them. No doubt much of this is due to Marion's strenuous training. Miss 1~,~c lyre's mother feeds us three times a day, and a good fetsling it is. She lives in the girls' dormitory with the girls. Mrs. McCarter, who has been in the boys' dormitory for two years, and Aunt Lizzie who has been with the teachers for eight -years, do the cooking. Aunt Lis.zie has moved from the Teachers' Cottage to the Girls' Dormitory, even taking her clock from the living room (the very dock promised to Miss Evelyn when she married, but because of Miss Evelyn's procrastination, Aunt Lizzie has turned Indian Giver and has taken it back.) Mrs. 1)owell, a Pi Phi from Simpson College, is keeping house :gor the boys on the hill. Boys girls and teachers all have their meals together this year, a plan which is working out very well, even though the dining room. in the girls' dormitory is much too small. While this simplifies things somewhat it is so necessary to have a woman like Mrs. Dowell who can make a real home for the boys. It would take me too long to recount the virtues of our Head rtesident, Miss Evelyn, but if you visited the school for any length of time you came in contact with her personally and you can give a picture of your own, which would mean more to you, as well as to the girls. We close this week Friday with our annual Christmas exercises and Christmas tree. This happy time is made possible for the children by the lovely boxes sent to us from the clubs, and the extra Christmas cheeks take care of the candy and oranges given, not only to our own school boys and girls but many more up and down the creeks. 420 THE ARROW Or Pi BETA PHI Alice Kendall, of fhe local chapter there, could give you some mor( personal touches, after spending three summers here. Sincerely, HELEN CHEW A. TRIBUTE TO PI BETA PHI From the Lyre of Alpha Chi Omega we quote the following: SOUTHERN HIGHLANDERS I have been dean of girls in Murphy Collegiate Institute in Sevier ville, Tennessee the last two years. This school is in the heart of the Smoky Mountains, and has as its students boys and girls now known as Southern Highlanders. Contrary to the prevailing idea that the mountaineer is an idolent, ignorant sort, he is the soul of ambition when once he is given an opportunity. I have never seen such types of physical perfection-fine featured, erect, well groomed American boys and girls. I could write volumes of my admiration for the Southern Highlanders, but I can give an idea of life and service there with one concrete example. Just two years ago this month I felt a new sense of pride in my privilege of being a fraternity woman when I saw the embodiment of a wonderful fraternity ideal, worked out in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I had gone with the president of our school to an old fashioned county fair, high up in the mountains. Hundreds of men on horseback, a mountain of corn, old fashioned fiddlers-I felt as if I was looking at a movie. Suddenly I heard a Pi Phi song sung by a chorus of some thirty or forty boys and girls ranging in age from eight to fourteen years. I wish that I could describe it so that everyone could get the thrill that I did as I watched those children singing their praise to Pi Phi, who has made education possible for them. I have visited the school itself several times since then for it holds a wonderful fascination for me. Forty miles from Knoxville over a road winding around the mountains one reaches the Pi Phi school, situated in a Valley, surrounded by mountains. There are cottages for the girls, cottages for the boys, a cottage for the teachers, a school, a hospital. Besides regular school work, agriculture and handicraft are taught to the boys, household arts and textile crafts to the girls. The teachers are Pi Phis-Pi Phis from Canada, from Texas, from Illinois--harming, vigorous girls, devoted to their work and their fraternity. The nurse, untiring in her service, rides the mountains day and night, cares for all who need her skill, and receives the love and gratitude of the whole countryside. The superintendent of the school, Miss Bishop, is known and hailed NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 421 by everyone in Sevier County as Miss Evelyn. To her belongs the credit for the steady improvement, the constant advancement of the school. In the last year the road has been improved, hotels repaired, and Gatlinburg which lies at the foot of. Mt. Le Conte is fast becoming a summer resort. I asked Miss Evelyn what they would do as Gatlinburg grew larger and more modern. She replied, "We will move back, back to the mountains. Our duty is to give education to the children who would not have a chance other-wise. MARY HELEN THOMAS, A, Chi Omega FOURTEEN YEARS ON LITTLE PIGEON lowing article for the editor News The Pi Beta Phi Fraternity feels that in having founded the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the ideals of the first at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, it responded to a need and lived up to the ideals of the first Greek letter fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, founded at William and Mary College, back in colonial days. Fraternities and colleges have done a good d e a 1 of constructive work. Most of the higher and cultural colleges maintain settlements of some kind, placing these mainly irt large cities where conditions are crowded and a foreign element has to be taken care of. The Pi Beta Phi work, we feel, is unique in that, Upon request, Mrs. Lutcher Stark, Jr., (Nita Hill, Texas A), who is Chairman of the Settlement School, wrote the fol Nu for the Theta of Theta Kappa NITA HILL STARK Texas A instead of doing our work with the foreign element, we are dealing with the truest type of American. THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI Since our earliest recollections there has been a division between the peoples of the mountains and those of the plains. The Pi Phis feel that through their -code of ethics they have learned that any experimental effort toward humanized service, with its object the betterment of humanity, is worthy of consideration and that it of vital significance to our Nation. Several years ago there were numerous newspaper articles that touched on the tragic ignorance of the primitive life of the mountaineers of North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At the Swarthmore Convention in 1910, the Washington Alumnae Club delegate appealed to the National Fraternity to sanction the establishment of a school in one of these districts. For nearly two years the Fraternity enlisted the help of Congress men, State Legislators and Government officials, in order to locate the most needy place. A committee found that Gatlinburg or Little Pigeon," as it is familiarly known, in Sevier County, Tennessee, offered a most excellent field for such work as our dreams had been anticipating. It is a recognized fact that all of the big things that have happened in history have usually started in a very small way. So, we felt that our beginning being so small was destined to be great. interesting to know that we started school with one teacher, an experienced mountain worker, whose house rent cost us all of one and one-half dollars per month. The people of these mountains, the -Unaka Range, a part of the Appalachain system, have, an interesting history. They are descendants of Scotch, Scotch-Irish, French and a few French-Italians, known as Waldensians, however, all of which is too long a story to take up here. 'Should anyone be more interested in this, it would be advisable for him to read "The Land of Saddle Bags," A Study of the Mountain People of Appalachia, by James Watt Raine. Much has been said about the ancestry of these mountaineers and their customs, so I shall not go into detail, as my main object here is to present the School to the members of your fraternity. The purpose of the School is to give to the mountaineers of South-eastern Tennessee educational training, equivalent to an elementary and high school course, with particular emphasis on industrial and agricultural work, to provide a health center, to maintain a settlement house with recreational activities, and to extend to the mountaineers such help as from time to time is needed. Gatlinburg, on the Little Pigeon River, lies forty-eight miles by automobile road southeast of Knoxville. It is sixteen miles from Sevierville, the County Seat of Sevier county. At present there is no railroad connection from Sevierville to Gatlinburg and only this year has a telephone line been. installed. 422 NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 423 AN IDEAL DISPLAY FOR A SETTLEMENT SCHOOL MEETING Memphis, Tennessee Alumnae Club Teachirig in a settlement requires a different method and, to quote from another writer, it has been found that the mounaineers cannot take "their learning heavily." It must be given out in small parcels, sonletimes tlimugh social atmosphere, developing fellowship and. good will. Our first school was at the junction of Baskins Creek and "Little Pigeon River," and we felt that even though we could only run the school four months of that year that each year we could increase the length of the term until we would have a full nine months school term. At the beginning of our School Gatlinburg was a little hamlet of six or seven houses and an ()pen air blacksmith shOp, a tumbled down school house wonderfully ventilated, as many boards had fallen off, and an equally well ventilated Baptist church. I remember a service I attended in the last mentioned ehur(...!Ii. The flies nearly ate us up and those we killed with the hymn books gave a very meaty dinner to the religious chickens that attended services. Church was held once a month by a preaeller who. was more or less uneducated. The age of the students in the beginning varied from ten to forty. And, another thing we had to contend with was that children of actual school age had to bring the younger children with them, in order to be able to come to school at all. The natives were suspicious of outsiders, did 424 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI not want any interference, but they desired better educational ad-vantages. They had tQ accept the work offered by Pi Beta Phi. Their spirit of hospitality, crude as it was, prevailed and a cooperative working atmosphere was created among the young workers. It was not an easy beginning. And, to this day, we have to consider, very care-fully, public opinion. In looking backward, we find that in the early part of 1912 they had their first sociable. It was a primitive room with long seats, no desks, very low ceilings supported by poles, and there were six of these poles. Here they were taught to sing and here the two Pi Phi workers said, "All these people at Gatlinburg need is a light and a chance." It is interesting to know that we had to teach these children their games. They (lid not even know how to "drop the handkerchief." And, now, each year it is with a great deal of satisfaction we watch these healthy young Americans play with their neighbors at "tug of war", baseball, basketball, and such sports during the county Gatlinburg fair. Fbr some years we have promoted community interest in a fair which would do credit to any thriving community. In speaking of basketball, I feel l should tell you of a funny instance that happened several years ago. We have a very good friend who has a summer home at Gatlinburg. He provided the basketball team with their suits, and the teacher who has charge of athletics instructed the boys to don their uniforms. After quite a long time they appeared with their suits over their overalls, as they felt that they were entirely too immodest otherwise. I shall not go into detail to tell you how uninviting their homes were, but, if at any time you were occasioned to be there, they were always open to welcome in a stranger. The teachers at the Pi Beta Phi school were looked upon to be peculiar if they happened to be more than twenty when they arrived at Gatlinburg to teach because they were not married. Early marriages, as early as twelve and thirteen to nineteen, were contracted and it was no unusual sight to see a family of thirteen to nineteen children. They are, however, marrying later in life on the whole than in 1912, and there are fewer children. When the World War came, Gatlinburg sent her quota of mountaineers. They went in the 30th Division which came from the mountains .of North and South Carolina and Tennessee. You may depend upon it that the men of the 30th Division could shoot, for hunting game had not died out in their country. We have stars for nineteen boys on our service flag, of which there are three gold stars. I have told you mainly of our beginning and now I want to tell you of our work as it is today. Our plant has grown from one little school house to quite a number of houses. We have the main building, the teachers cottage, two cottages for girls dormitories, which are supervised by matrons and teachers, one cottage for boys, a museum and NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 425 a health center. The pupils who board at the school are kept there through scholarships given by certain people from over the United States, while others of them do part time work to pay for their tuition. In the Smith-Hughes Agricultural work, we conduct a short course in Animal Husbandry. We have an "Endless Pig Chain" where a boy is given a pig with a contract to return a certain per cent of the little pigs. Those, in turn, are given to another boy who raises another litter of pigs, returning so many back to the school. The same scheme is contracted in promoting thoroughbred chicken raising. Gatlinburg soil is well adapted for fruit raising, especially apples. In reaching the older people we have asked the father to give the boy one tree out of his orchard. The class in the Agricultural Department h a s corn() to this tree, sprayed it, pruned it, and cultivated it. The father notices that the apples on this tree are of a more even size; that it is free of rust and BUILDING CHICKEN HOUSE spots, so he comes to ask us to help him. This is a part of our community work. We have taught them that it is better to raise thorough-bred cattle and chickens. We have taught them how to build a barn that is up-to-date, yet in keeping with this isolated district. We also have the Smith-Hughes Domestic Economy classes. Here we have classes in canning, studies in balanced diets, and practical as well as theoretical cooking and sewing. The ages of the students in these classes range from twelve to seventy years. Beside the regular school course, we have classes in weaving. We promote weaving among adults as a rainy day industry. We encourage the people in farming and cattle raising, but we also promote this weaving and basket making for rainy clay purposes. We feel very proud of the advancement in this line. We have a very well organized Health center. Every three weeks we hold dental clinics, and during the summer some Chicago dentists assist in this work for .a very small fee. We promote education in sanitation and health hygiene and feel that we have accomplished a great deal. Some interesting statistics of Sevier County, I think, .should bE noted here. The number of desks there in 1916 was forty-three, and it 1923, 2100. In 1916 there were no libraries. Now, there are twenty one. There were no consolidated schools in 1913, but in, .1923 them 1-26 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI THE NEW BARN AND OLD ONE were thirty-two with two or more teachers. In 1915 there were 5113 pupils, ,and in 1923, .6994, with a decrease in population. I' have not said Much about the finances or operation of the school. The donations to the School have' always been voluntary and never have the funds decreased since the beginning, but each year we find that the members of Pi Beta Phi are more .willing to give to this great cause than ever. We feel that with this wonderful object to work for that there has been a closer bond of fellowship between alumnae clubs and active chapters. The Pi Beta Phis have contributed annually by individual gifts through clubs .who have conducted sales of industrial goods such as weaving and basket work, or at bridge parties, etc. The School is supervised by a committee of five who makes an annual visit to the school, the Chairman making two visits, annually. At the School proper, there is .an excellent staff of people, particularly and peculiarly suited to conduct classrooms, meet obstacles and mingle in the civic and religious life of the community. Our work has grown to such an extent that we have opened up an extension work at Sugar-lands, upon the request of the people of that community. At this center we have been conducting classes in adult education.. It is a pathetic sight to see old men and women, some grandparents, struggling to learn to write their names, and it also gives us a great deal of pleasure to see their joy in having learned this feat. May the spirit that fostered the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in the beginning, support it through the years to come, that the entire work may act as a leaven to help not only the Pi Phis, but the Fraternity spirit from one end of this great nation to its+ uttermost bounds, NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 42: for the world's greatest teacher said: "Inasmuch as ye did it unto on of the least of these, Ye have done it unto me." NITA HILL STARK FORD PARTY VISITS GATLINBURG From The KnoAlville Journal of October 27, 1926, we quote: Henry Ford will arrive in Knoxville over the L. and N. railway about 8 :3 o'clock this morning.

Mrs. Clyde Porter (Willie M. Reed, Iowa r), president the alumnae club, presented the dress through a courteous It watchful member of the Secret Service on guard at the pot:-1s of the presidential suite. Later Mrs. A. I. Beach (Marjorie [arshall, Kansas A), the wife of Kansas City's mayor, and host-s, to the President's party, told Mrs. Coolidge the details of Le weaving of the dress and found her to be most appreciative it. So, in the gardens of the White House in early spring per--11)s our lovely First Lady will walk, clad in a gown of softest hate. Several days after the presentation a most cordial note of wanks came from Mrs. Coolidge to the Kansas Alumnae Club. The Kansas City Star gives the following colorful descripon of Mrs. Coolidge during her first hours in the city : "The winsome smile of the First Lady of the land was one of the high-Tilts of the arrival of the presidential party. The President stepped from .e train with formal and dignified mein to meet the welcoming committee. at it was the smiling and beautiful woman alert of countenance and ready receive the hearty greeting of an admiring populace with genuine sinxity, who won all hearts. "Simple and gracious of manner, she was ready for the day's events r that best of preparations with which humanity can be fortified. a will-,gness to be pleased by the hospitality that is offered in which she w king part by her volition. "Mrs. Coolidge has a knowledge of the value of time, a rare thing in woman. She proved it by arraying herself upon arising, in the costume hich she was to wear for the principal events of the day, the Memorial edication and the luncheon at the Hotel Meulebach. she stepped from the train platform the crowd saw a tall woman L a broad brimmed sea green velvet hat and a long black seal skin coat hich was wrapped closely about her slender figure. Recognition was Lstantanecus from the assembled crowds. Mrs. Coolidge's luxuriant, long gown hair, could be seen beneath the big green hat with a mink bow on Le left side. Bronze reptile skin shoes and matching hose and bronze gloves 'ere in evidence. Every woman with an eye to pretty accessories noted the Lde button earrings which the First Lady of the land wore. "At the Hotel Meulebach Mrs. Coolidge took time to write a personal ote, and to have a quiet chat with the President; then, into a cream and )ld bag she tucked the little necessities of the day ; a green and tan chifm handkerchief and a pale green one of linen, a compact, and a gold pen-I. Without the slightest confusion, without the opening of trunk or bag, le First Lady of the land was ready for the day." NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 415 r,srs 'ru. SCHOOL STATE After a six weeks stay at Fluff's Inn, Mrs. R. A. Nickerson from St. Louis was so impressed with the work carried on by our School that she talked herself into the task of furnishing the program for an evening meeting of the St. Louis Alumnae Club. Mrs. Nickerson, not being a Pi Phi sent an S. O. S. to Miss Bishop for facts and the following will be self-explanatory. Dec. 11, 1.926 My Dear Mrs. Nickerson: Of course I remember you very well. To be sure I didn't see you or Mrs. Chandler as often as the Shop girls did but I knew you just the same. It is mighty nice of you to be roped into this and am sure we, as well as the St. Louis Pi Phis appreciate it. I find the clubs are so much more interested when they can really talk. with someone who has been to the School. Helen Chew, from the Sugarlands, has been having an enforced vacation this week (Inc to an attaek of the flu so when your letter came I read it to her and she said (just joking) that she would answer it for me as was rushing around trying to get baskets and weaving off in time for Christmas. Well, It didn't take me long really to call her bluff and the enclosed is the result. In reading over what she has written I find that she has entirely left out the Sugarlands work. Maybe she was too modest. Three years ago Helen started work six miles above here and now, with two other girls carries on not only the regular county school work there but does a good deal of most interesting adult work. Last year she had a class of boys two or three times a week after the regular school hours, then visited many older people and gave them personal intruetion. Several over sixty years learned to read and write their names. This year she is having night school at the cottage and some after-noon classes too. A sawmill in the Sugarlands has been furnishing a most interesting night class, the school morale being kept up to a large extent by the .man who is in charge of the work. With the lumber camp men who come twice a week, our night class numbers seventeen Impils amid then monthly attendance from one hundred to one hundred and fifty. Every class ends with an hour's play and because it is new they play like children. Last year we closed at Christmas, but this year this adult work bids fair to continue through the entire school year. In addition to the annual Christmas tree they have what I think is just fine, a community dinner on Thanksgiving at the schoolhouse. This is always preceded by a Thanksgiving sermon and this year, the additional pleasure of Mr. Harve Reagan's guitar.. 416 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI Cora McCarter, one of our local girls, has been with Miss Chew ever since she has been in Sugarlands and this year we have a Pi Phi from Indianapolis, Martha Flowers. The county is building a new schoolhouse at Sugarlands this year and the girls hope to be in it by the holidays. It is a three room, mod-ern building, a great improvement over the one room house they have had to teach in. Also it will have desks and a sliding partition between the rooms, which can easily be made into an auditorium. The people gave two acres of land adjoining the county school ground and on this the Pi Phis are building a Teachers' Cottage. A fund from the Pi Phis in Athens, Ohio has made the starting of this house possible, and although not sufficient to finish it now, they expect finally to complete it entirely. The house will be ready for the girls to move into by the first of the year. I had no idea I was going to draw such a prize from Helen but know you will be pleased with it. All good wishes for the meeting. Very sincerely ETELYN BIsHor December 11, 1926 My Dear Mrs. Nickerson : Miss Evelyn asked me to answer your letter, really for the purpose of giving me a little recuperation after a week of flu. She would do a great deal better herself, but maybe I can help you a little. I was here for four years and then went to the new center in the Sugarlands three years ago. Some of the newer girls might give you details that now pass me. One's first years are so full of the new ways of the people. To answer your first question about our new nurse. Miss Ruby Ryman is our nurse now, not a Pi Phi but a splendid girl who would do us credit if she were. At this time of year, with so much dampness and rain, colds and flu keep her traveling from one home to another. Measles have been in both schools all fall with now and then a case of mumps. Several babies have made their advent, with her assistance, and I believe next week we are to have an operation in the hospital. This fall we had a splendid tonsil clinic, with Dr. Potter, a specialist from Knoxville, in charge. A Knoxville dentist comes twice a month to our hospital. For the first few months he came only one Saturday a month but there was so much to be done he found that even Sundays would not take care of the patients so now takes two week-ends in the Burg. For quite a while our nurse has been working to get the feet of several children straightened. She has taken them to Knoxville Hospitals, where they are so fine to us. Just this fall two children, either by braces or operation, are walking with straightened feet. Kate NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 417 Iluskey, from the Sugarlands, and Eula Floyd from Baskins. Because Eula's mother was a young girl of fourteen who did not realize her responsibility in keeping braces on continually, Eula has been taken to the Shriners' Hospital in Lexington until she can be perfectly cured. Although every year increases the confidence of the people in our nurse, bringing them to her for help, still a larger part of her work is in the homes. She also keeps in touch with the county schools of this district by giving inoculations, vaccinations, eye examinations and weighing and measuring the school children. Any needing special care are then turned over to the doctors who come to us from time to time. No work done by our school comes nearer touching the vital part of the people's lives than the nurse's. Ruby is unusually tall, light curl. hair, a very straight forward and sincere girl in her relation to people. More community work is done by our weaving teacher, Gene Red-ding, also not a Pi Phi but just as interested in the School as if she were. This year her work is in the homes more than among the school children, with whom this department naturally started. She works in thirty homes, running about forty looms for the school. This work covers a radius of about five miles. Men, women and children weave. In many homes it is the only source of income, in others supplementary. No doubt you know the various articles we make: Dress goods, towels, scarfs, rugs, bath mats. curtain materials, bags and coverlets. Aside from this hand work we handle all sorts of baskets, made in the homes of the people. Our hand-work has grown to a considerable business, one of the largest departments in the School. Miss Redding has had splendid training, and with a fine taste naturally, is developing a very great appreciation among: the people for beauty as a nice fabric. She is tall and slender, dark hair and grey eyes. She comes from Boston, with a Boston twist to her words, and although this is her second year here she continues to take "Bahths." Jean Steel has classes in Domestic Science, in the School in the mornings and in this community and others in the afternoons. These community classes are for adults, held in most cases in the local schoolhouses. Her attendance for a month will average from seventy-five to one hundred, with usually from three to six to a class. There is no more discouraging work than the pioneer steps of such work with the mountain women. 'Two or three seem a small number but when the situation is really understood, it is a great triumph. The typical. mountain woman stays in her home. It is what you might call a folk way with the people, rather than a lack of interest, the changing of which is very slow. Every impression, no matter how small, leaves a dint of tremendous importance in their lives, becoming evident at the least expected moments. Jean is another one outside the ranks of Pi Phi. She is a very practical minded girl, with the keenest possible sense of humor. The 418 THE ARROVV OIP PI BETA PHI picture she makes in her new, long sheep skin coat, on our handsomest horse, "Lady", as she rides down the road, is a picture never to be for-gotten. We should add that in addition to the afore mentioned coat, she has a large horse blanket festooned around her,: giving the appearance of an old time circuit rider. Our agricultural man, Mr, Mattil, has been with us more than ...four years, carrying his work into many connnunities, through classes among the farmers, talks, pictures and fairs. Many men consult him every week about personal problems, often getting their start c...ht blooded stack, good seeds for their tields and varieties of fruits for their orchards. During the time lie has been here he has developed a community chicken hatchery at the school, a. pig club that has been the means of putting Berkshire pigs of the best kind through these hills, built up the County fair, assisted in building farm buildings for the school and community and developed the athletics in the school. Mr. Mattil is a Delta Tau Delta, from the University of Tennessee, tall and slender, with 'a very amiable disposition, allowing him to maintain his position with fortitude among fourteen women. Ills Ford, his horse and his dog are in constant use, and even if he desired, he could never make a get-away to the city alone. No one in. the place will ho moire missed, when he leaves us, (with the exception of Miss Evelyn 1 as Mr. Mattil. In the office this year La Done Allen is the new assistant to Miss Evelyn. *She is a Pi Phi from the University of Arkansas, valling Memphis and Little Rock, home. A well. set up girl, with brown hair and eyes, very hard boiled when it comes to postage money and telephone tolls. Every call over our new telephone is 20e amounting to a considerable sum if charged to the School, also causing a lot of trouble always to make change, consequently La Delle's string to every call. As all school bills go through her hands she is quite nut important appendage to the institution. Without her we never would have 1Jeen able to carry on the immense amount of business .pertaining to the industrial work that has so nearly swamped us this fall. In the School we have six teachers, not counting the special ont,s'. Each with two grades in a room, with the exception of the kindergarten, a new department this year. Our school now carries its pupils from the kindergarten through second year high school. We Intrnber 66 boys and 58 girls, not counting any of the community (qasses. Seven boys and girls are living here on the place. Dorothy Trainer, from Chicago, the youngest in the family of teachers, teaches the kindergarten, a class which numbers from six to eighteen, depending upon the weather and measles, etc. As there was no available room in the school-house for this class she has her class in what has always been the dining-room. of the Teachers Cottage. Dorothy is a decided blonde, with a thinking head on very small and young shoulders. She is new in the game but learning fast. 'NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 419 the primary is Emily Burton, from Montclair. She has first and second grades. Very small and exceedingly young looking but with nine years residence, an element to be reckoned with. Her years of service should make her worthy of wearing the Arrow. The next two grades are taught by Mrs. Chapin, of New York City. Herself a Pi Phi, as well as a Pi Phi mother. She came to us to live in the little girls' dormitory but remained to teach in the school. Elmer Watson, of the local community, teaches the 5th and 6th grades. He helps with the athletics and without him our Sunday School would fall far below its present standard. In the high school are Marion Folsom and Maggie White. Marion is a T.,7niversity of Vermont Pi Phi, with a residence here of four years. Dark and active, and, with a boyish bob and a sparkli)g eye, she is abundantly able to take care of her room full of boys. faggie White is the other one of our blondes, a Pi Phi from Austin, Texas, but hardly one of the wild western Texans you read about in books, a typical bud of the modern college. She came to us three years ago a society butterfly but today can hunt possum and climb mountains with any of them. No doubt much of this is due to Marion's strenuous training. Miss 1~,~c lyre's mother feeds us three times a day, and a good fetsling it is. She lives in the girls' dormitory with the girls. Mrs. McCarter, who has been in the boys' dormitory for two years, and Aunt Lizzie who has been with the teachers for eight -years, do the cooking. Aunt Lis.zie has moved from the Teachers' Cottage to the Girls' Dormitory, even taking her clock from the living room (the very dock promised to Miss Evelyn when she married, but because of Miss Evelyn's procrastination, Aunt Lizzie has turned Indian Giver and has taken it back.) Mrs. 1)owell, a Pi Phi from Simpson College, is keeping house :gor the boys on the hill. Boys girls and teachers all have their meals together this year, a plan which is working out very well, even though the dining room. in the girls' dormitory is much too small. While this simplifies things somewhat it is so necessary to have a woman like Mrs. Dowell who can make a real home for the boys. It would take me too long to recount the virtues of our Head rtesident, Miss Evelyn, but if you visited the school for any length of time you came in contact with her personally and you can give a picture of your own, which would mean more to you, as well as to the girls. We close this week Friday with our annual Christmas exercises and Christmas tree. This happy time is made possible for the children by the lovely boxes sent to us from the clubs, and the extra Christmas cheeks take care of the candy and oranges given, not only to our own school boys and girls but many more up and down the creeks. 420 THE ARROW Or Pi BETA PHI Alice Kendall, of fhe local chapter there, could give you some mor( personal touches, after spending three summers here. Sincerely, HELEN CHEW A. TRIBUTE TO PI BETA PHI From the Lyre of Alpha Chi Omega we quote the following: SOUTHERN HIGHLANDERS I have been dean of girls in Murphy Collegiate Institute in Sevier ville, Tennessee the last two years. This school is in the heart of the Smoky Mountains, and has as its students boys and girls now known as Southern Highlanders. Contrary to the prevailing idea that the mountaineer is an idolent, ignorant sort, he is the soul of ambition when once he is given an opportunity. I have never seen such types of physical perfection-fine featured, erect, well groomed American boys and girls. I could write volumes of my admiration for the Southern Highlanders, but I can give an idea of life and service there with one concrete example. Just two years ago this month I felt a new sense of pride in my privilege of being a fraternity woman when I saw the embodiment of a wonderful fraternity ideal, worked out in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I had gone with the president of our school to an old fashioned county fair, high up in the mountains. Hundreds of men on horseback, a mountain of corn, old fashioned fiddlers-I felt as if I was looking at a movie. Suddenly I heard a Pi Phi song sung by a chorus of some thirty or forty boys and girls ranging in age from eight to fourteen years. I wish that I could describe it so that everyone could get the thrill that I did as I watched those children singing their praise to Pi Phi, who has made education possible for them. I have visited the school itself several times since then for it holds a wonderful fascination for me. Forty miles from Knoxville over a road winding around the mountains one reaches the Pi Phi school, situated in a Valley, surrounded by mountains. There are cottages for the girls, cottages for the boys, a cottage for the teachers, a school, a hospital. Besides regular school work, agriculture and handicraft are taught to the boys, household arts and textile crafts to the girls. The teachers are Pi Phis-Pi Phis from Canada, from Texas, from Illinois--harming, vigorous girls, devoted to their work and their fraternity. The nurse, untiring in her service, rides the mountains day and night, cares for all who need her skill, and receives the love and gratitude of the whole countryside. The superintendent of the school, Miss Bishop, is known and hailed NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 421 by everyone in Sevier County as Miss Evelyn. To her belongs the credit for the steady improvement, the constant advancement of the school. In the last year the road has been improved, hotels repaired, and Gatlinburg which lies at the foot of. Mt. Le Conte is fast becoming a summer resort. I asked Miss Evelyn what they would do as Gatlinburg grew larger and more modern. She replied, "We will move back, back to the mountains. Our duty is to give education to the children who would not have a chance other-wise. MARY HELEN THOMAS, A, Chi Omega FOURTEEN YEARS ON LITTLE PIGEON lowing article for the editor News The Pi Beta Phi Fraternity feels that in having founded the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the ideals of the first at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, it responded to a need and lived up to the ideals of the first Greek letter fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, founded at William and Mary College, back in colonial days. Fraternities and colleges have done a good d e a 1 of constructive work. Most of the higher and cultural colleges maintain settlements of some kind, placing these mainly irt large cities where conditions are crowded and a foreign element has to be taken care of. The Pi Beta Phi work, we feel, is unique in that, Upon request, Mrs. Lutcher Stark, Jr., (Nita Hill, Texas A), who is Chairman of the Settlement School, wrote the fol Nu for the Theta of Theta Kappa NITA HILL STARK Texas A instead of doing our work with the foreign element, we are dealing with the truest type of American. THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI Since our earliest recollections there has been a division between the peoples of the mountains and those of the plains. The Pi Phis feel that through their -code of ethics they have learned that any experimental effort toward humanized service, with its object the betterment of humanity, is worthy of consideration and that it of vital significance to our Nation. Several years ago there were numerous newspaper articles that touched on the tragic ignorance of the primitive life of the mountaineers of North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At the Swarthmore Convention in 1910, the Washington Alumnae Club delegate appealed to the National Fraternity to sanction the establishment of a school in one of these districts. For nearly two years the Fraternity enlisted the help of Congress men, State Legislators and Government officials, in order to locate the most needy place. A committee found that Gatlinburg or Little Pigeon," as it is familiarly known, in Sevier County, Tennessee, offered a most excellent field for such work as our dreams had been anticipating. It is a recognized fact that all of the big things that have happened in history have usually started in a very small way. So, we felt that our beginning being so small was destined to be great. interesting to know that we started school with one teacher, an experienced mountain worker, whose house rent cost us all of one and one-half dollars per month. The people of these mountains, the -Unaka Range, a part of the Appalachain system, have, an interesting history. They are descendants of Scotch, Scotch-Irish, French and a few French-Italians, known as Waldensians, however, all of which is too long a story to take up here. 'Should anyone be more interested in this, it would be advisable for him to read "The Land of Saddle Bags," A Study of the Mountain People of Appalachia, by James Watt Raine. Much has been said about the ancestry of these mountaineers and their customs, so I shall not go into detail, as my main object here is to present the School to the members of your fraternity. The purpose of the School is to give to the mountaineers of South-eastern Tennessee educational training, equivalent to an elementary and high school course, with particular emphasis on industrial and agricultural work, to provide a health center, to maintain a settlement house with recreational activities, and to extend to the mountaineers such help as from time to time is needed. Gatlinburg, on the Little Pigeon River, lies forty-eight miles by automobile road southeast of Knoxville. It is sixteen miles from Sevierville, the County Seat of Sevier county. At present there is no railroad connection from Sevierville to Gatlinburg and only this year has a telephone line been. installed. 422 NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 423 AN IDEAL DISPLAY FOR A SETTLEMENT SCHOOL MEETING Memphis, Tennessee Alumnae Club Teachirig in a settlement requires a different method and, to quote from another writer, it has been found that the mounaineers cannot take "their learning heavily." It must be given out in small parcels, sonletimes tlimugh social atmosphere, developing fellowship and. good will. Our first school was at the junction of Baskins Creek and "Little Pigeon River," and we felt that even though we could only run the school four months of that year that each year we could increase the length of the term until we would have a full nine months school term. At the beginning of our School Gatlinburg was a little hamlet of six or seven houses and an ()pen air blacksmith shOp, a tumbled down school house wonderfully ventilated, as many boards had fallen off, and an equally well ventilated Baptist church. I remember a service I attended in the last mentioned ehur(...!Ii. The flies nearly ate us up and those we killed with the hymn books gave a very meaty dinner to the religious chickens that attended services. Church was held once a month by a preaeller who. was more or less uneducated. The age of the students in the beginning varied from ten to forty. And, another thing we had to contend with was that children of actual school age had to bring the younger children with them, in order to be able to come to school at all. The natives were suspicious of outsiders, did 424 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI not want any interference, but they desired better educational ad-vantages. They had tQ accept the work offered by Pi Beta Phi. Their spirit of hospitality, crude as it was, prevailed and a cooperative working atmosphere was created among the young workers. It was not an easy beginning. And, to this day, we have to consider, very care-fully, public opinion. In looking backward, we find that in the early part of 1912 they had their first sociable. It was a primitive room with long seats, no desks, very low ceilings supported by poles, and there were six of these poles. Here they were taught to sing and here the two Pi Phi workers said, "All these people at Gatlinburg need is a light and a chance." It is interesting to know that we had to teach these children their games. They (lid not even know how to "drop the handkerchief." And, now, each year it is with a great deal of satisfaction we watch these healthy young Americans play with their neighbors at "tug of war", baseball, basketball, and such sports during the county Gatlinburg fair. Fbr some years we have promoted community interest in a fair which would do credit to any thriving community. In speaking of basketball, I feel l should tell you of a funny instance that happened several years ago. We have a very good friend who has a summer home at Gatlinburg. He provided the basketball team with their suits, and the teacher who has charge of athletics instructed the boys to don their uniforms. After quite a long time they appeared with their suits over their overalls, as they felt that they were entirely too immodest otherwise. I shall not go into detail to tell you how uninviting their homes were, but, if at any time you were occasioned to be there, they were always open to welcome in a stranger. The teachers at the Pi Beta Phi school were looked upon to be peculiar if they happened to be more than twenty when they arrived at Gatlinburg to teach because they were not married. Early marriages, as early as twelve and thirteen to nineteen, were contracted and it was no unusual sight to see a family of thirteen to nineteen children. They are, however, marrying later in life on the whole than in 1912, and there are fewer children. When the World War came, Gatlinburg sent her quota of mountaineers. They went in the 30th Division which came from the mountains .of North and South Carolina and Tennessee. You may depend upon it that the men of the 30th Division could shoot, for hunting game had not died out in their country. We have stars for nineteen boys on our service flag, of which there are three gold stars. I have told you mainly of our beginning and now I want to tell you of our work as it is today. Our plant has grown from one little school house to quite a number of houses. We have the main building, the teachers cottage, two cottages for girls dormitories, which are supervised by matrons and teachers, one cottage for boys, a museum and NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 425 a health center. The pupils who board at the school are kept there through scholarships given by certain people from over the United States, while others of them do part time work to pay for their tuition. In the Smith-Hughes Agricultural work, we conduct a short course in Animal Husbandry. We have an "Endless Pig Chain" where a boy is given a pig with a contract to return a certain per cent of the little pigs. Those, in turn, are given to another boy who raises another litter of pigs, returning so many back to the school. The same scheme is contracted in promoting thoroughbred chicken raising. Gatlinburg soil is well adapted for fruit raising, especially apples. In reaching the older people we have asked the father to give the boy one tree out of his orchard. The class in the Agricultural Department h a s corn() to this tree, sprayed it, pruned it, and cultivated it. The father notices that the apples on this tree are of a more even size; that it is free of rust and BUILDING CHICKEN HOUSE spots, so he comes to ask us to help him. This is a part of our community work. We have taught them that it is better to raise thorough-bred cattle and chickens. We have taught them how to build a barn that is up-to-date, yet in keeping with this isolated district. We also have the Smith-Hughes Domestic Economy classes. Here we have classes in canning, studies in balanced diets, and practical as well as theoretical cooking and sewing. The ages of the students in these classes range from twelve to seventy years. Beside the regular school course, we have classes in weaving. We promote weaving among adults as a rainy day industry. We encourage the people in farming and cattle raising, but we also promote this weaving and basket making for rainy clay purposes. We feel very proud of the advancement in this line. We have a very well organized Health center. Every three weeks we hold dental clinics, and during the summer some Chicago dentists assist in this work for .a very small fee. We promote education in sanitation and health hygiene and feel that we have accomplished a great deal. Some interesting statistics of Sevier County, I think, .should bE noted here. The number of desks there in 1916 was forty-three, and it 1923, 2100. In 1916 there were no libraries. Now, there are twenty one. There were no consolidated schools in 1913, but in, .1923 them 1-26 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI THE NEW BARN AND OLD ONE were thirty-two with two or more teachers. In 1915 there were 5113 pupils, ,and in 1923, .6994, with a decrease in population. I' have not said Much about the finances or operation of the school. The donations to the School have' always been voluntary and never have the funds decreased since the beginning, but each year we find that the members of Pi Beta Phi are more .willing to give to this great cause than ever. We feel that with this wonderful object to work for that there has been a closer bond of fellowship between alumnae clubs and active chapters. The Pi Beta Phis have contributed annually by individual gifts through clubs .who have conducted sales of industrial goods such as weaving and basket work, or at bridge parties, etc. The School is supervised by a committee of five who makes an annual visit to the school, the Chairman making two visits, annually. At the School proper, there is .an excellent staff of people, particularly and peculiarly suited to conduct classrooms, meet obstacles and mingle in the civic and religious life of the community.

        416 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI Cora McCarter, one of our local girls, has been with Miss Chew ever since she has been in Sugarlands and this year we have a Pi Phi from Indianapolis, Martha Flowers. The county is building a new schoolhouse at Sugarlands this year and the girls hope to be in it by the holidays. It is a three room, mod-ern building, a great improvement over the one room house they have had to teach in. Also it will have desks and a sliding partition between the rooms, which can easily be made into an auditorium. The people gave two acres of land adjoining the county school ground and on this the Pi Phis are building a Teachers' Cottage. A fund from the Pi Phis in Athens, Ohio has made the starting of this house possible, and although not sufficient to finish it now, they expect finally to complete it entirely. The house will be ready for the girls to move into by the first of the year. I had no idea I was going to draw such a prize from Helen but know you will be pleased with it. All good wishes for the meeting. Very sincerely ETELYN BIsHor December 11, 1926 My Dear Mrs. Nickerson : Miss Evelyn asked me to answer your letter, really for the purpose of giving me a little recuperation after a week of flu. She would do a great deal better herself, but maybe I can help you a little. I was here for four years and then went to the new center in the Sugarlands three years ago. Some of the newer girls might give you details that now pass me. One's first years are so full of the new ways of the people. To answer your first question about our new nurse. Miss Ruby Ryman is our nurse now, not a Pi Phi but a splendid girl who would do us credit if she were. At this time of year, with so much dampness and rain, colds and flu keep her traveling from one home to another. Measles have been in both schools all fall with now and then a case of mumps. Several babies have made their advent, with her assistance, and I believe next week we are to have an operation in the hospital. This fall we had a splendid tonsil clinic, with Dr. Potter, a specialist from Knoxville, in charge. A Knoxville dentist comes twice a month to our hospital. For the first few months he came only one Saturday a month but there was so much to be done he found that even Sundays would not take care of the patients so now takes two week-ends in the Burg. For quite a while our nurse has been working to get the feet of several children straightened. She has taken them to Knoxville Hospitals, where they are so fine to us. Just this fall two children, either by braces or operation, are walking with straightened feet. Kate NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 417 Iluskey, from the Sugarlands, and Eula Floyd from Baskins. Because Eula's mother was a young girl of fourteen who did not realize her responsibility in keeping braces on continually, Eula has been taken to the Shriners' Hospital in Lexington until she can be perfectly cured. Although every year increases the confidence of the people in our nurse, bringing them to her for help, still a larger part of her work is in the homes. She also keeps in touch with the county schools of this district by giving inoculations, vaccinations, eye examinations and weighing and measuring the school children. Any needing special care are then turned over to the doctors who come to us from time to time. No work done by our school comes nearer touching the vital part of the people's lives than the nurse's. Ruby is unusually tall, light curl. hair, a very straight forward and sincere girl in her relation to people. More community work is done by our weaving teacher, Gene Red-ding, also not a Pi Phi but just as interested in the School as if she were. This year her work is in the homes more than among the school children, with whom this department naturally started. She works in thirty homes, running about forty looms for the school. This work covers a radius of about five miles. Men, women and children weave. In many homes it is the only source of income, in others supplementary. No doubt you know the various articles we make: Dress goods, towels, scarfs, rugs, bath mats. curtain materials, bags and coverlets. Aside from this hand work we handle all sorts of baskets, made in the homes of the people. Our hand-work has grown to a considerable business, one of the largest departments in the School. Miss Redding has had splendid training, and with a fine taste naturally, is developing a very great appreciation among: the people for beauty as a nice fabric. She is tall and slender, dark hair and grey eyes. She comes from Boston, with a Boston twist to her words, and although this is her second year here she continues to take "Bahths." Jean Steel has classes in Domestic Science, in the School in the mornings and in this community and others in the afternoons. These community classes are for adults, held in most cases in the local schoolhouses. Her attendance for a month will average from seventy-five to one hundred, with usually from three to six to a class. There is no more discouraging work than the pioneer steps of such work with the mountain women. 'Two or three seem a small number but when the situation is really understood, it is a great triumph. The typical. mountain woman stays in her home. It is what you might call a folk way with the people, rather than a lack of interest, the changing of which is very slow. Every impression, no matter how small, leaves a dint of tremendous importance in their lives, becoming evident at the least expected moments. Jean is another one outside the ranks of Pi Phi. She is a very practical minded girl, with the keenest possible sense of humor. The 418 THE ARROVV OIP PI BETA PHI picture she makes in her new, long sheep skin coat, on our handsomest horse, "Lady", as she rides down the road, is a picture never to be for-gotten. We should add that in addition to the afore mentioned coat, she has a large horse blanket festooned around her,: giving the appearance of an old time circuit rider. Our agricultural man, Mr, Mattil, has been with us more than ...four years, carrying his work into many connnunities, through classes among the farmers, talks, pictures and fairs. Many men consult him every week about personal problems, often getting their start c...ht blooded stack, good seeds for their tields and varieties of fruits for their orchards. During the time lie has been here he has developed a community chicken hatchery at the school, a. pig club that has been the means of putting Berkshire pigs of the best kind through these hills, built up the County fair, assisted in building farm buildings for the school and community and developed the athletics in the school. Mr. Mattil is a Delta Tau Delta, from the University of Tennessee, tall and slender, with 'a very amiable disposition, allowing him to maintain his position with fortitude among fourteen women. Ills Ford, his horse and his dog are in constant use, and even if he desired, he could never make a get-away to the city alone. No one in. the place will ho moire missed, when he leaves us, (with the exception of Miss Evelyn 1 as Mr. Mattil. In the office this year La Done Allen is the new assistant to Miss Evelyn. *She is a Pi Phi from the University of Arkansas, valling Memphis and Little Rock, home. A well. set up girl, with brown hair and eyes, very hard boiled when it comes to postage money and telephone tolls. Every call over our new telephone is 20e amounting to a considerable sum if charged to the School, also causing a lot of trouble always to make change, consequently La Delle's string to every call. As all school bills go through her hands she is quite nut important appendage to the institution. Without her we never would have 1Jeen able to carry on the immense amount of business .pertaining to the industrial work that has so nearly swamped us this fall. In the School we have six teachers, not counting the special ont,s'. Each with two grades in a room, with the exception of the kindergarten, a new department this year. Our school now carries its pupils from the kindergarten through second year high school. We Intrnber 66 boys and 58 girls, not counting any of the community (qasses. Seven boys and girls are living here on the place. Dorothy Trainer, from Chicago, the youngest in the family of teachers, teaches the kindergarten, a class which numbers from six to eighteen, depending upon the weather and measles, etc. As there was no available room in the school-house for this class she has her class in what has always been the dining-room. of the Teachers Cottage. Dorothy is a decided blonde, with a thinking head on very small and young shoulders. She is new in the game but learning fast. 'NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 419 the primary is Emily Burton, from Montclair. She has first and second grades. Very small and exceedingly young looking but with nine years residence, an element to be reckoned with. Her years of service should make her worthy of wearing the Arrow. The next two grades are taught by Mrs. Chapin, of New York City. Herself a Pi Phi, as well as a Pi Phi mother. She came to us to live in the little girls' dormitory but remained to teach in the school. Elmer Watson, of the local community, teaches the 5th and 6th grades. He helps with the athletics and without him our Sunday School would fall far below its present standard. In the high school are Marion Folsom and Maggie White. Marion is a T.,7niversity of Vermont Pi Phi, with a residence here of four years. Dark and active, and, with a boyish bob and a sparkli)g eye, she is abundantly able to take care of her room full of boys. faggie White is the other one of our blondes, a Pi Phi from Austin, Texas, but hardly one of the wild western Texans you read about in books, a typical bud of the modern college. She came to us three years ago a society butterfly but today can hunt possum and climb mountains with any of them. No doubt much of this is due to Marion's strenuous training. Miss 1~,~c lyre's mother feeds us three times a day, and a good fetsling it is. She lives in the girls' dormitory with the girls. Mrs. McCarter, who has been in the boys' dormitory for two years, and Aunt Lizzie who has been with the teachers for eight -years, do the cooking. Aunt Lis.zie has moved from the Teachers' Cottage to the Girls' Dormitory, even taking her clock from the living room (the very dock promised to Miss Evelyn when she married, but because of Miss Evelyn's procrastination, Aunt Lizzie has turned Indian Giver and has taken it back.) Mrs. 1)owell, a Pi Phi from Simpson College, is keeping house :gor the boys on the hill. Boys girls and teachers all have their meals together this year, a plan which is working out very well, even though the dining room. in the girls' dormitory is much too small. While this simplifies things somewhat it is so necessary to have a woman like Mrs. Dowell who can make a real home for the boys. It would take me too long to recount the virtues of our Head rtesident, Miss Evelyn, but if you visited the school for any length of time you came in contact with her personally and you can give a picture of your own, which would mean more to you, as well as to the girls. We close this week Friday with our annual Christmas exercises and Christmas tree. This happy time is made possible for the children by the lovely boxes sent to us from the clubs, and the extra Christmas cheeks take care of the candy and oranges given, not only to our own school boys and girls but many more up and down the creeks. 420 THE ARROW Or Pi BETA PHI Alice Kendall, of fhe local chapter there, could give you some mor( personal touches, after spending three summers here. Sincerely, HELEN CHEW A. TRIBUTE TO PI BETA PHI From the Lyre of Alpha Chi Omega we quote the following: SOUTHERN HIGHLANDERS I have been dean of girls in Murphy Collegiate Institute in Sevier ville, Tennessee the last two years. This school is in the heart of the Smoky Mountains, and has as its students boys and girls now known as Southern Highlanders. Contrary to the prevailing idea that the mountaineer is an idolent, ignorant sort, he is the soul of ambition when once he is given an opportunity. I have never seen such types of physical perfection-fine featured, erect, well groomed American boys and girls. I could write volumes of my admiration for the Southern Highlanders, but I can give an idea of life and service there with one concrete example. Just two years ago this month I felt a new sense of pride in my privilege of being a fraternity woman when I saw the embodiment of a wonderful fraternity ideal, worked out in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I had gone with the president of our school to an old fashioned county fair, high up in the mountains. Hundreds of men on horseback, a mountain of corn, old fashioned fiddlers-I felt as if I was looking at a movie. Suddenly I heard a Pi Phi song sung by a chorus of some thirty or forty boys and girls ranging in age from eight to fourteen years. I wish that I could describe it so that everyone could get the thrill that I did as I watched those children singing their praise to Pi Phi, who has made education possible for them. I have visited the school itself several times since then for it holds a wonderful fascination for me. Forty miles from Knoxville over a road winding around the mountains one reaches the Pi Phi school, situated in a Valley, surrounded by mountains. There are cottages for the girls, cottages for the boys, a cottage for the teachers, a school, a hospital. Besides regular school work, agriculture and handicraft are taught to the boys, household arts and textile crafts to the girls. The teachers are Pi Phis-Pi Phis from Canada, from Texas, from Illinois--harming, vigorous girls, devoted to their work and their fraternity. The nurse, untiring in her service, rides the mountains day and night, cares for all who need her skill, and receives the love and gratitude of the whole countryside. The superintendent of the school, Miss Bishop, is known and hailed NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 421 by everyone in Sevier County as Miss Evelyn. To her belongs the credit for the steady improvement, the constant advancement of the school. In the last year the road has been improved, hotels repaired, and Gatlinburg which lies at the foot of. Mt. Le Conte is fast becoming a summer resort. I asked Miss Evelyn what they would do as Gatlinburg grew larger and more modern. She replied, "We will move back, back to the mountains. Our duty is to give education to the children who would not have a chance other-wise. MARY HELEN THOMAS, A, Chi Omega FOURTEEN YEARS ON LITTLE PIGEON lowing article for the editor News The Pi Beta Phi Fraternity feels that in having founded the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the ideals of the first at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, it responded to a need and lived up to the ideals of the first Greek letter fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, founded at William and Mary College, back in colonial days. Fraternities and colleges have done a good d e a 1 of constructive work. Most of the higher and cultural colleges maintain settlements of some kind, placing these mainly irt large cities where conditions are crowded and a foreign element has to be taken care of. The Pi Beta Phi work, we feel, is unique in that, Upon request, Mrs. Lutcher Stark, Jr., (Nita Hill, Texas A), who is Chairman of the Settlement School, wrote the fol Nu for the Theta of Theta Kappa NITA HILL STARK Texas A instead of doing our work with the foreign element, we are dealing with the truest type of American. THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI Since our earliest recollections there has been a division between the peoples of the mountains and those of the plains. The Pi Phis feel that through their -code of ethics they have learned that any experimental effort toward humanized service, with its object the betterment of humanity, is worthy of consideration and that it of vital significance to our Nation. Several years ago there were numerous newspaper articles that touched on the tragic ignorance of the primitive life of the mountaineers of North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At the Swarthmore Convention in 1910, the Washington Alumnae Club delegate appealed to the National Fraternity to sanction the establishment of a school in one of these districts. For nearly two years the Fraternity enlisted the help of Congress men, State Legislators and Government officials, in order to locate the most needy place. A committee found that Gatlinburg or Little Pigeon," as it is familiarly known, in Sevier County, Tennessee, offered a most excellent field for such work as our dreams had been anticipating. It is a recognized fact that all of the big things that have happened in history have usually started in a very small way. So, we felt that our beginning being so small was destined to be great. interesting to know that we started school with one teacher, an experienced mountain worker, whose house rent cost us all of one and one-half dollars per month. The people of these mountains, the -Unaka Range, a part of the Appalachain system, have, an interesting history. They are descendants of Scotch, Scotch-Irish, French and a few French-Italians, known as Waldensians, however, all of which is too long a story to take up here. 'Should anyone be more interested in this, it would be advisable for him to read "The Land of Saddle Bags," A Study of the Mountain People of Appalachia, by James Watt Raine. Much has been said about the ancestry of these mountaineers and their customs, so I shall not go into detail, as my main object here is to present the School to the members of your fraternity. The purpose of the School is to give to the mountaineers of South-eastern Tennessee educational training, equivalent to an elementary and high school course, with particular emphasis on industrial and agricultural work, to provide a health center, to maintain a settlement house with recreational activities, and to extend to the mountaineers such help as from time to time is needed. Gatlinburg, on the Little Pigeon River, lies forty-eight miles by automobile road southeast of Knoxville. It is sixteen miles from Sevierville, the County Seat of Sevier county. At present there is no railroad connection from Sevierville to Gatlinburg and only this year has a telephone line been. installed. 422 NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 423 AN IDEAL DISPLAY FOR A SETTLEMENT SCHOOL MEETING Memphis, Tennessee Alumnae Club Teachirig in a settlement requires a different method and, to quote from another writer, it has been found that the mounaineers cannot take "their learning heavily." It must be given out in small parcels, sonletimes tlimugh social atmosphere, developing fellowship and. good will. Our first school was at the junction of Baskins Creek and "Little Pigeon River," and we felt that even though we could only run the school four months of that year that each year we could increase the length of the term until we would have a full nine months school term. At the beginning of our School Gatlinburg was a little hamlet of six or seven houses and an ()pen air blacksmith shOp, a tumbled down school house wonderfully ventilated, as many boards had fallen off, and an equally well ventilated Baptist church. I remember a service I attended in the last mentioned ehur(...!Ii. The flies nearly ate us up and those we killed with the hymn books gave a very meaty dinner to the religious chickens that attended services. Church was held once a month by a preaeller who. was more or less uneducated. The age of the students in the beginning varied from ten to forty. And, another thing we had to contend with was that children of actual school age had to bring the younger children with them, in order to be able to come to school at all. The natives were suspicious of outsiders, did 424 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI not want any interference, but they desired better educational ad-vantages. They had tQ accept the work offered by Pi Beta Phi. Their spirit of hospitality, crude as it was, prevailed and a cooperative working atmosphere was created among the young workers. It was not an easy beginning. And, to this day, we have to consider, very care-fully, public opinion. In looking backward, we find that in the early part of 1912 they had their first sociable. It was a primitive room with long seats, no desks, very low ceilings supported by poles, and there were six of these poles. Here they were taught to sing and here the two Pi Phi workers said, "All these people at Gatlinburg need is a light and a chance." It is interesting to know that we had to teach these children their games. They (lid not even know how to "drop the handkerchief." And, now, each year it is with a great deal of satisfaction we watch these healthy young Americans play with their neighbors at "tug of war", baseball, basketball, and such sports during the county Gatlinburg fair. Fbr some years we have promoted community interest in a fair which would do credit to any thriving community. In speaking of basketball, I feel l should tell you of a funny instance that happened several years ago. We have a very good friend who has a summer home at Gatlinburg. He provided the basketball team with their suits, and the teacher who has charge of athletics instructed the boys to don their uniforms. After quite a long time they appeared with their suits over their overalls, as they felt that they were entirely too immodest otherwise. I shall not go into detail to tell you how uninviting their homes were, but, if at any time you were occasioned to be there, they were always open to welcome in a stranger. The teachers at the Pi Beta Phi school were looked upon to be peculiar if they happened to be more than twenty when they arrived at Gatlinburg to teach because they were not married. Early marriages, as early as twelve and thirteen to nineteen, were contracted and it was no unusual sight to see a family of thirteen to nineteen children. They are, however, marrying later in life on the whole than in 1912, and there are fewer children. When the World War came, Gatlinburg sent her quota of mountaineers. They went in the 30th Division which came from the mountains .of North and South Carolina and Tennessee. You may depend upon it that the men of the 30th Division could shoot, for hunting game had not died out in their country. We have stars for nineteen boys on our service flag, of which there are three gold stars. I have told you mainly of our beginning and now I want to tell you of our work as it is today. Our plant has grown from one little school house to quite a number of houses. We have the main building, the teachers cottage, two cottages for girls dormitories, which are supervised by matrons and teachers, one cottage for boys, a museum and NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 425 a health center. The pupils who board at the school are kept there through scholarships given by certain people from over the United States, while others of them do part time work to pay for their tuition. In the Smith-Hughes Agricultural work, we conduct a short course in Animal Husbandry. We have an "Endless Pig Chain" where a boy is given a pig with a contract to return a certain per cent of the little pigs. Those, in turn, are given to another boy who raises another litter of pigs, returning so many back to the school. The same scheme is contracted in promoting thoroughbred chicken raising. Gatlinburg soil is well adapted for fruit raising, especially apples. In reaching the older people we have asked the father to give the boy one tree out of his orchard. The class in the Agricultural Department h a s corn() to this tree, sprayed it, pruned it, and cultivated it. The father notices that the apples on this tree are of a more even size; that it is free of rust and BUILDING CHICKEN HOUSE spots, so he comes to ask us to help him. This is a part of our community work. We have taught them that it is better to raise thorough-bred cattle and chickens. We have taught them how to build a barn that is up-to-date, yet in keeping with this isolated district. We also have the Smith-Hughes Domestic Economy classes. Here we have classes in canning, studies in balanced diets, and practical as well as theoretical cooking and sewing. The ages of the students in these classes range from twelve to seventy years. Beside the regular school course, we have classes in weaving. We promote weaving among adults as a rainy day industry. We encourage the people in farming and cattle raising, but we also promote this weaving and basket making for rainy clay purposes. We feel very proud of the advancement in this line. We have a very well organized Health center. Every three weeks we hold dental clinics, and during the summer some Chicago dentists assist in this work for .a very small fee. We promote education in sanitation and health hygiene and feel that we have accomplished a great deal. Some interesting statistics of Sevier County, I think, .should bE noted here. The number of desks there in 1916 was forty-three, and it 1923, 2100. In 1916 there were no libraries. Now, there are twenty one. There were no consolidated schools in 1913, but in, .1923 them 1-26 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI THE NEW BARN AND OLD ONE were thirty-two with two or more teachers. In 1915 there were 5113 pupils, ,and in 1923, .6994, with a decrease in population. I' have not said Much about the finances or operation of the school. The donations to the School have' always been voluntary and never have the funds decreased since the beginning, but each year we find that the members of Pi Beta Phi are more .willing to give to this great cause than ever. We feel that with this wonderful object to work for that there has been a closer bond of fellowship between alumnae clubs and active chapters. The Pi Beta Phis have contributed annually by individual gifts through clubs .who have conducted sales of industrial goods such as weaving and basket work, or at bridge parties, etc. The School is supervised by a committee of five who makes an annual visit to the school, the Chairman making two visits, annually. At the School proper, there is .an excellent staff of people, particularly and peculiarly suited to conduct classrooms, meet obstacles and mingle in the civic and religious life of the community. Our work has grown to such an extent that we have opened up an extension work at Sugar-lands, upon the request of the people of that community. At this center we have been conducting classes in adult education.. It is a pathetic sight to see old men and women, some grandparents, struggling to learn to write their names, and it also gives us a great deal of pleasure to see their joy in having learned this feat. May the spirit that fostered the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in the beginning, support it through the years to come, that the entire work may act as a leaven to help not only the Pi Phis, but the Fraternity spirit from one end of this great nation to its+ uttermost bounds, NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 42: for the world's greatest teacher said: "Inasmuch as ye did it unto on of the least of these, Ye have done it unto me."

Seven boys and girls are living here on the place. Dorothy Trainer, from Chicago, the youngest in the family of teachers, teaches the kindergarten, a class which numbers from six to eighteen, depending upon the weather and measles, etc. As there was no available room in the school-house for this class she has her class in what has always been the dining-room. of the Teachers Cottage. Dorothy is a decided blonde, with a thinking head on very small and young shoulders. She is new in the game but learning fast. 'NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 419 the primary is Emily Burton, from Montclair. She has first and second grades. Very small and exceedingly young looking but with nine years residence, an element to be reckoned with. Her years of service should make her worthy of wearing the Arrow. The next two grades are taught by Mrs. Chapin, of New York City. Herself a Pi Phi, as well as a Pi Phi mother. She came to us to live in the little girls' dormitory but remained to teach in the school. Elmer Watson, of the local community, teaches the 5th and 6th grades. He helps with the athletics and without him our Sunday School would fall far below its present standard. In the high school are Marion Folsom and Maggie White. Marion is a T.,7niversity of Vermont Pi Phi, with a residence here of four years. Dark and active, and, with a boyish bob and a sparkli)g eye, she is abundantly able to take care of her room full of boys. faggie White is the other one of our blondes, a Pi Phi from Austin, Texas, but hardly one of the wild western Texans you read about in books, a typical bud of the modern college. She came to us three years ago a society butterfly but today can hunt possum and climb mountains with any of them. No doubt much of this is due to Marion's strenuous training. Miss 1~,~c lyre's mother feeds us three times a day, and a good fetsling it is. She lives in the girls' dormitory with the girls. Mrs. McCarter, who has been in the boys' dormitory for two years, and Aunt Lizzie who has been with the teachers for eight -years, do the cooking. Aunt Lis.zie has moved from the Teachers' Cottage to the Girls' Dormitory, even taking her clock from the living room (the very dock promised to Miss Evelyn when she married, but because of Miss Evelyn's procrastination, Aunt Lizzie has turned Indian Giver and has taken it back.) Mrs. 1)owell, a Pi Phi from Simpson College, is keeping house :gor the boys on the hill. Boys girls and teachers all have their meals together this year, a plan which is working out very well, even though the dining room. in the girls' dormitory is much too small. While this simplifies things somewhat it is so necessary to have a woman like Mrs. Dowell who can make a real home for the boys. It would take me too long to recount the virtues of our Head rtesident, Miss Evelyn, but if you visited the school for any length of time you came in contact with her personally and you can give a picture of your own, which would mean more to you, as well as to the girls. We close this week Friday with our annual Christmas exercises and Christmas tree. This happy time is made possible for the children by the lovely boxes sent to us from the clubs, and the extra Christmas cheeks take care of the candy and oranges given, not only to our own school boys and girls but many more up and down the creeks. 420 THE ARROW Or Pi BETA PHI Alice Kendall, of fhe local chapter there, could give you some mor( personal touches, after spending three summers here.

TRIBUTE TO PI BETA PHI From the Lyre of Alpha Chi Omega we quote the following: SOUTHERN HIGHLANDERS I have been dean of girls in Murphy Collegiate Institute in Sevier ville, Tennessee the last two years. This school is in the heart of the Smoky Mountains, and has as its students boys and girls now known as Southern Highlanders. Contrary to the prevailing idea that the mountaineer is an idolent, ignorant sort, he is the soul of ambition when once he is given an opportunity. I have never seen such types of physical perfection-fine featured, erect, well groomed American boys and girls. I could write volumes of my admiration for the Southern Highlanders, but I can give an idea of life and service there with one concrete example. Just two years ago this month I felt a new sense of pride in my privilege of being a fraternity woman when I saw the embodiment of a wonderful fraternity ideal, worked out in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I had gone with the president of our school to an old fashioned county fair, high up in the mountains. Hundreds of men on horseback, a mountain of corn, old fashioned fiddlers-I felt as if I was looking at a movie. Suddenly I heard a Pi Phi song sung by a chorus of some thirty or forty boys and girls ranging in age from eight to fourteen years. I wish that I could describe it so that everyone could get the thrill that I did as I watched those children singing their praise to Pi Phi, who has made education possible for them. I have visited the school itself several times since then for it holds a wonderful fascination for me. Forty miles from Knoxville over a road winding around the mountains one reaches the Pi Phi school, situated in a Valley, surrounded by mountains. There are cottages for the girls, cottages for the boys, a cottage for the teachers, a school, a hospital. Besides regular school work, agriculture and handicraft are taught to the boys, household arts and textile crafts to the girls. The teachers are Pi Phis-Pi Phis from Canada, from Texas, from Illinois--harming, vigorous girls, devoted to their work and their fraternity. The nurse, untiring in her service, rides the mountains day and night, cares for all who need her skill, and receives the love and gratitude of the whole countryside. The superintendent of the school, Miss Bishop, is known and hailed NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 421 by everyone in Sevier County as Miss Evelyn. To her belongs the credit for the steady improvement, the constant advancement of the school. In the last year the road has been improved, hotels repaired, and Gatlinburg which lies at the foot of. Mt. Le Conte is fast becoming a summer resort. I asked Miss Evelyn what they would do as Gatlinburg grew larger and more modern. She replied, "We will move back, back to the mountains. Our duty is to give education to the children who would not have a chance other-wise.

The Pi Phis feel that through their -code of ethics they have learned that any experimental effort toward humanized service, with its object the betterment of humanity, is worthy of consideration and that it of vital significance to our Nation. Several years ago there were numerous newspaper articles that touched on the tragic ignorance of the primitive life of the mountaineers of North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At the Swarthmore Convention in 1910, the Washington Alumnae Club delegate appealed to the National Fraternity to sanction the establishment of a school in one of these districts. For nearly two years the Fraternity enlisted the help of Congress men, State Legislators and Government officials, in order to locate the most needy place. A committee found that Gatlinburg or Little Pigeon," as it is familiarly known, in Sevier County, Tennessee, offered a most excellent field for such work as our dreams had been anticipating. It is a recognized fact that all of the big things that have happened in history have usually started in a very small way. So, we felt that our beginning being so small was destined to be great. interesting to know that we started school with one teacher, an experienced mountain worker, whose house rent cost us all of one and one-half dollars per month. The people of these mountains, the -Unaka Range, a part of the Appalachain system, have, an interesting history. They are descendants of Scotch, Scotch-Irish, French and a few French-Italians, known as Waldensians, however, all of which is too long a story to take up here. 'Should anyone be more interested in this, it would be advisable for him to read "The Land of Saddle Bags," A Study of the Mountain People of Appalachia, by James Watt Raine. Much has been said about the ancestry of these mountaineers and their customs, so I shall not go into detail, as my main object here is to present the School to the members of your fraternity. The purpose of the School is to give to the mountaineers of South-eastern Tennessee educational training, equivalent to an elementary and high school course, with particular emphasis on industrial and agricultural work, to provide a health center, to maintain a settlement house with recreational activities, and to extend to the mountaineers such help as from time to time is needed. Gatlinburg, on the Little Pigeon River, lies forty-eight miles by automobile road southeast of Knoxville. It is sixteen miles from Sevierville, the County Seat of Sevier county. At present there is no railroad connection from Sevierville to Gatlinburg and only this year has a telephone line been. installed. 422 NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 423 AN IDEAL DISPLAY FOR A SETTLEMENT SCHOOL MEETING Memphis, Tennessee Alumnae Club Teachirig in a settlement requires a different method and, to quote from another writer, it has been found that the mounaineers cannot take "their learning heavily." It must be given out in small parcels, sonletimes tlimugh social atmosphere, developing fellowship and. good will. Our first school was at the junction of Baskins Creek and "Little Pigeon River," and we felt that even though we could only run the school four months of that year that each year we could increase the length of the term until we would have a full nine months school term. At the beginning of our School Gatlinburg was a little hamlet of six or seven houses and an ()pen air blacksmith shOp, a tumbled down school house wonderfully ventilated, as many boards had fallen off, and an equally well ventilated Baptist church. I remember a service I attended in the last mentioned ehur(...!Ii. The flies nearly ate us up and those we killed with the hymn books gave a very meaty dinner to the religious chickens that attended services. Church was held once a month by a preaeller who. was more or less uneducated. The age of the students in the beginning varied from ten to forty. And, another thing we had to contend with was that children of actual school age had to bring the younger children with them, in order to be able to come to school at all. The natives were suspicious of outsiders, did 424 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI not want any interference, but they desired better educational ad-vantages. They had tQ accept the work offered by Pi Beta Phi. Their spirit of hospitality, crude as it was, prevailed and a cooperative working atmosphere was created among the young workers. It was not an easy beginning. And, to this day, we have to consider, very care-fully, public opinion. In looking backward, we find that in the early part of 1912 they had their first sociable. It was a primitive room with long seats, no desks, very low ceilings supported by poles, and there were six of these poles. Here they were taught to sing and here the two Pi Phi workers said, "All these people at Gatlinburg need is a light and a chance." It is interesting to know that we had to teach these children their games. They (lid not even know how to "drop the handkerchief." And, now, each year it is with a great deal of satisfaction we watch these healthy young Americans play with their neighbors at "tug of war", baseball, basketball, and such sports during the county Gatlinburg fair. Fbr some years we have promoted community interest in a fair which would do credit to any thriving community. In speaking of basketball, I feel l should tell you of a funny instance that happened several years ago. We have a very good friend who has a summer home at Gatlinburg. He provided the basketball team with their suits, and the teacher who has charge of athletics instructed the boys to don their uniforms. After quite a long time they appeared with their suits over their overalls, as they felt that they were entirely too immodest otherwise. I shall not go into detail to tell you how uninviting their homes were, but, if at any time you were occasioned to be there, they were always open to welcome in a stranger. The teachers at the Pi Beta Phi school were looked upon to be peculiar if they happened to be more than twenty when they arrived at Gatlinburg to teach because they were not married. Early marriages, as early as twelve and thirteen to nineteen, were contracted and it was no unusual sight to see a family of thirteen to nineteen children. They are, however, marrying later in life on the whole than in 1912, and there are fewer children. When the World War came, Gatlinburg sent her quota of mountaineers. They went in the 30th Division which came from the mountains .of North and South Carolina and Tennessee. You may depend upon it that the men of the 30th Division could shoot, for hunting game had not died out in their country. We have stars for nineteen boys on our service flag, of which there are three gold stars. I have told you mainly of our beginning and now I want to tell you of our work as it is today. Our plant has grown from one little school house to quite a number of houses. We have the main building, the teachers cottage, two cottages for girls dormitories, which are supervised by matrons and teachers, one cottage for boys, a museum and NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 425 a health center. The pupils who board at the school are kept there through scholarships given by certain people from over the United States, while others of them do part time work to pay for their tuition. In the Smith-Hughes Agricultural work, we conduct a short course in Animal Husbandry. We have an "Endless Pig Chain" where a boy is given a pig with a contract to return a certain per cent of the little pigs. Those, in turn, are given to another boy who raises another litter of pigs, returning so many back to the school. The same scheme is contracted in promoting thoroughbred chicken raising. Gatlinburg soil is well adapted for fruit raising, especially apples. In reaching the older people we have asked the father to give the boy one tree out of his orchard. The class in the Agricultural Department h a s corn() to this tree, sprayed it, pruned it, and cultivated it. The father notices that the apples on this tree are of a more even size; that it is free of rust and BUILDING CHICKEN HOUSE spots, so he comes to ask us to help him. This is a part of our community work. We have taught them that it is better to raise thorough-bred cattle and chickens. We have taught them how to build a barn that is up-to-date, yet in keeping with this isolated district. We also have the Smith-Hughes Domestic Economy classes. Here we have classes in canning, studies in balanced diets, and practical as well as theoretical cooking and sewing. The ages of the students in these classes range from twelve to seventy years. Beside the regular school course, we have classes in weaving. We promote weaving among adults as a rainy day industry. We encourage the people in farming and cattle raising, but we also promote this weaving and basket making for rainy clay purposes. We feel very proud of the advancement in this line. We have a very well organized Health center. Every three weeks we hold dental clinics, and during the summer some Chicago dentists assist in this work for .a very small fee. We promote education in sanitation and health hygiene and feel that we have accomplished a great deal. Some interesting statistics of Sevier County, I think, .should bE noted here. The number of desks there in 1916 was forty-three, and it 1923, 2100. In 1916 there were no libraries. Now, there are twenty one. There were no consolidated schools in 1913, but in, .1923 them 1-26 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI THE NEW BARN AND OLD ONE were thirty-two with two or more teachers. In 1915 there were 5113 pupils, ,and in 1923, .6994, with a decrease in population. I' have not said Much about the finances or operation of the school. The donations to the School have' always been voluntary and never have the funds decreased since the beginning, but each year we find that the members of Pi Beta Phi are more .willing to give to this great cause than ever. We feel that with this wonderful object to work for that there has been a closer bond of fellowship between alumnae clubs and active chapters. The Pi Beta Phis have contributed annually by individual gifts through clubs .who have conducted sales of industrial goods such as weaving and basket work, or at bridge parties, etc. The School is supervised by a committee of five who makes an annual visit to the school, the Chairman making two visits, annually. At the School proper, there is .an excellent staff of people, particularly and peculiarly suited to conduct classrooms, meet obstacles and mingle in the civic and religious life of the community. Our work has grown to such an extent that we have opened up an extension work at Sugar-lands, upon the request of the people of that community. At this center we have been conducting classes in adult education.. It is a pathetic sight to see old men and women, some grandparents, struggling to learn to write their names, and it also gives us a great deal of pleasure to see their joy in having learned this feat. May the spirit that fostered the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in the beginning, support it through the years to come, that the entire work may act as a leaven to help not only the Pi Phis, but the Fraternity spirit from one end of this great nation to its+ uttermost bounds, NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 42: for the world's greatest teacher said: "Inasmuch as ye did it unto on of the least of these, Ye have done it unto me."

        THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI Since our earliest recollections there has been a division between the peoples of the mountains and those of the plains. The Pi Phis feel that through their -code of ethics they have learned that any experimental effort toward humanized service, with its object the betterment of humanity, is worthy of consideration and that it of vital significance to our Nation. Several years ago there were numerous newspaper articles that touched on the tragic ignorance of the primitive life of the mountaineers of North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At the Swarthmore Convention in 1910, the Washington Alumnae Club delegate appealed to the National Fraternity to sanction the establishment of a school in one of these districts. For nearly two years the Fraternity enlisted the help of Congress men, State Legislators and Government officials, in order to locate the most needy place. A committee found that Gatlinburg or Little Pigeon," as it is familiarly known, in Sevier County, Tennessee, offered a most excellent field for such work as our dreams had been anticipating. It is a recognized fact that all of the big things that have happened in history have usually started in a very small way. So, we felt that our beginning being so small was destined to be great. interesting to know that we started school with one teacher, an experienced mountain worker, whose house rent cost us all of one and one-half dollars per month. The people of these mountains, the -Unaka Range, a part of the Appalachain system, have, an interesting history. They are descendants of Scotch, Scotch-Irish, French and a few French-Italians, known as Waldensians, however, all of which is too long a story to take up here. 'Should anyone be more interested in this, it would be advisable for him to read "The Land of Saddle Bags," A Study of the Mountain People of Appalachia, by James Watt Raine. Much has been said about the ancestry of these mountaineers and their customs, so I shall not go into detail, as my main object here is to present the School to the members of your fraternity. The purpose of the School is to give to the mountaineers of South-eastern Tennessee educational training, equivalent to an elementary and high school course, with particular emphasis on industrial and agricultural work, to provide a health center, to maintain a settlement house with recreational activities, and to extend to the mountaineers such help as from time to time is needed. Gatlinburg, on the Little Pigeon River, lies forty-eight miles by automobile road southeast of Knoxville. It is sixteen miles from Sevierville, the County Seat of Sevier county. At present there is no railroad connection from Sevierville to Gatlinburg and only this year has a telephone line been. installed. 422 NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 423 AN IDEAL DISPLAY FOR A SETTLEMENT SCHOOL MEETING Memphis, Tennessee Alumnae Club Teachirig in a settlement requires a different method and, to quote from another writer, it has been found that the mounaineers cannot take "their learning heavily." It must be given out in small parcels, sonletimes tlimugh social atmosphere, developing fellowship and. good will. Our first school was at the junction of Baskins Creek and "Little Pigeon River," and we felt that even though we could only run the school four months of that year that each year we could increase the length of the term until we would have a full nine months school term. At the beginning of our School Gatlinburg was a little hamlet of six or seven houses and an ()pen air blacksmith shOp, a tumbled down school house wonderfully ventilated, as many boards had fallen off, and an equally well ventilated Baptist church. I remember a service I attended in the last mentioned ehur(...!Ii. The flies nearly ate us up and those we killed with the hymn books gave a very meaty dinner to the religious chickens that attended services. Church was held once a month by a preaeller who. was more or less uneducated. The age of the students in the beginning varied from ten to forty. And, another thing we had to contend with was that children of actual school age had to bring the younger children with them, in order to be able to come to school at all. The natives were suspicious of outsiders, did 424 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI not want any interference, but they desired better educational ad-vantages. They had tQ accept the work offered by Pi Beta Phi. Their spirit of hospitality, crude as it was, prevailed and a cooperative working atmosphere was created among the young workers. It was not an easy beginning. And, to this day, we have to consider, very care-fully, public opinion. In looking backward, we find that in the early part of 1912 they had their first sociable. It was a primitive room with long seats, no desks, very low ceilings supported by poles, and there were six of these poles. Here they were taught to sing and here the two Pi Phi workers said, "All these people at Gatlinburg need is a light and a chance." It is interesting to know that we had to teach these children their games. They (lid not even know how to "drop the handkerchief." And, now, each year it is with a great deal of satisfaction we watch these healthy young Americans play with their neighbors at "tug of war", baseball, basketball, and such sports during the county Gatlinburg fair. Fbr some years we have promoted community interest in a fair which would do credit to any thriving community. In speaking of basketball, I feel l should tell you of a funny instance that happened several years ago. We have a very good friend who has a summer home at Gatlinburg. He provided the basketball team with their suits, and the teacher who has charge of athletics instructed the boys to don their uniforms. After quite a long time they appeared with their suits over their overalls, as they felt that they were entirely too immodest otherwise. I shall not go into detail to tell you how uninviting their homes were, but, if at any time you were occasioned to be there, they were always open to welcome in a stranger. The teachers at the Pi Beta Phi school were looked upon to be peculiar if they happened to be more than twenty when they arrived at Gatlinburg to teach because they were not married. Early marriages, as early as twelve and thirteen to nineteen, were contracted and it was no unusual sight to see a family of thirteen to nineteen children. They are, however, marrying later in life on the whole than in 1912, and there are fewer children. When the World War came, Gatlinburg sent her quota of mountaineers. They went in the 30th Division which came from the mountains .of North and South Carolina and Tennessee. You may depend upon it that the men of the 30th Division could shoot, for hunting game had not died out in their country. We have stars for nineteen boys on our service flag, of which there are three gold stars. I have told you mainly of our beginning and now I want to tell you of our work as it is today. Our plant has grown from one little school house to quite a number of houses. We have the main building, the teachers cottage, two cottages for girls dormitories, which are supervised by matrons and teachers, one cottage for boys, a museum and NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 425 a health center. The pupils who board at the school are kept there through scholarships given by certain people from over the United States, while others of them do part time work to pay for their tuition. In the Smith-Hughes Agricultural work, we conduct a short course in Animal Husbandry. We have an "Endless Pig Chain" where a boy is given a pig with a contract to return a certain per cent of the little pigs. Those, in turn, are given to another boy who raises another litter of pigs, returning so many back to the school. The same scheme is contracted in promoting thoroughbred chicken raising. Gatlinburg soil is well adapted for fruit raising, especially apples. In reaching the older people we have asked the father to give the boy one tree out of his orchard. The class in the Agricultural Department h a s corn() to this tree, sprayed it, pruned it, and cultivated it. The father notices that the apples on this tree are of a more even size; that it is free of rust and BUILDING CHICKEN HOUSE spots, so he comes to ask us to help him. This is a part of our community work. We have taught them that it is better to raise thorough-bred cattle and chickens. We have taught them how to build a barn that is up-to-date, yet in keeping with this isolated district. We also have the Smith-Hughes Domestic Economy classes. Here we have classes in canning, studies in balanced diets, and practical as well as theoretical cooking and sewing. The ages of the students in these classes range from twelve to seventy years. Beside the regular school course, we have classes in weaving. We promote weaving among adults as a rainy day industry. We encourage the people in farming and cattle raising, but we also promote this weaving and basket making for rainy clay purposes. We feel very proud of the advancement in this line. We have a very well organized Health center. Every three weeks we hold dental clinics, and during the summer some Chicago dentists assist in this work for .a very small fee. We promote education in sanitation and health hygiene and feel that we have accomplished a great deal. Some interesting statistics of Sevier County, I think, .should bE noted here. The number of desks there in 1916 was forty-three, and it 1923, 2100. In 1916 there were no libraries. Now, there are twenty one.

Since their stay was of only a few hours duration it was impossible for the Pi Phis to obtain any time for the entertnment of M Is. Coolidge. Anxious, how. ever, to do something to express their admiration and love for her, a n d feeling that flowers would bring only a momeat's pleasure a n d could then be lost to her in the myriads of other bouquets, these Pi Phis decided that a gift f r o in the Settlement S .c h o o 1 at Gatlinbur:T, Tenn., might bring her lasting pleasure. When this idea was transmitted to Miss Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident at the School, it received her hearty endorsement and she straightway set the School's most expert weaver, Edna McCarter, a girl of fifteen, to work upon the weaving of a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block 'pattern of self color.

Several days after the presentation a most cordial note of wanks came from Mrs. Coolidge to the Kansas Alumnae Club.

SCHOOL STATE After a six weeks stay at Fluff's Inn, Mrs. R. A. Nickerson from St. Louis was so impressed with the work carried on by our School that she talked herself into the task of furnishing the program for an evening meeting of the St. Louis Alumnae Club. Mrs. Nickerson, not being a Pi Phi sent an S. O. S. to Miss Bishop for facts and the following will be self-explanatory. Dec. 11, 1.926 My Dear Mrs. Nickerson: Of course I remember you very well. To be sure I didn't see you or Mrs. Chandler as often as the Shop girls did but I knew you just the same. It is mighty nice of you to be roped into this and am sure we, as well as the St. Louis Pi Phis appreciate it. I find the clubs are so much more interested when they can really talk. with someone who has been to the School. Helen Chew, from the Sugarlands, has been having an enforced vacation this week (Inc to an attaek of the flu so when your letter came I read it to her and she said (just joking) that she would answer it for me as was rushing around trying to get baskets and weaving off in time for Christmas. Well, It didn't take me long really to call her bluff and the enclosed is the result. In reading over what she has written I find that she has entirely left out the Sugarlands work. Maybe she was too modest. Three years ago Helen started work six miles above here and now, with two other girls carries on not only the regular county school work there but does a good deal of most interesting adult work. Last year she had a class of boys two or three times a week after the regular school hours, then visited many older people and gave them personal intruetion. Several over sixty years learned to read and write their names. This year she is having night school at the cottage and some after-noon classes too. A sawmill in the Sugarlands has been furnishing a most interesting night class, the school morale being kept up to a large extent by the .man who is in charge of the work. With the lumber camp men who come twice a week, our night class numbers seventeen Impils amid then monthly attendance from one hundred to one hundred and fifty. Every class ends with an hour's play and because it is new they play like children. Last year we closed at Christmas, but this year this adult work bids fair to continue through the entire school year. In addition to the annual Christmas tree they have what I think is just fine, a community dinner on Thanksgiving at the schoolhouse. This is always preceded by a Thanksgiving sermon and this year, the additional pleasure of Mr. Harve Reagan's guitar.. 416 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI Cora McCarter, one of our local girls, has been with Miss Chew ever since she has been in Sugarlands and this year we have a Pi Phi from Indianapolis, Martha Flowers. The county is building a new schoolhouse at Sugarlands this year and the girls hope to be in it by the holidays. It is a three room, mod-ern building, a great improvement over the one room house they have had to teach in. Also it will have desks and a sliding partition between the rooms, which can easily be made into an auditorium. The people gave two acres of land adjoining the county school ground and on this the Pi Phis are building a Teachers' Cottage. A fund from the Pi Phis in Athens, Ohio has made the starting of this house possible, and although not sufficient to finish it now, they expect finally to complete it entirely. The house will be ready for the girls to move into by the first of the year. I had no idea I was going to draw such a prize from Helen but know you will be pleased with it. All good wishes for the meeting. Very sincerely ETELYN BIsHor December 11, 1926 My Dear Mrs. Nickerson : Miss Evelyn asked me to answer your letter, really for the purpose of giving me a little recuperation after a week of flu. She would do a great deal better herself, but maybe I can help you a little. I was here for four years and then went to the new center in the Sugarlands three years ago. Some of the newer girls might give you details that now pass me. One's first years are so full of the new ways of the people. To answer your first question about our new nurse. Miss Ruby Ryman is our nurse now, not a Pi Phi but a splendid girl who would do us credit if she were. At this time of year, with so much dampness and rain, colds and flu keep her traveling from one home to another. Measles have been in both schools all fall with now and then a case of mumps. Several babies have made their advent, with her assistance, and I believe next week we are to have an operation in the hospital. This fall we had a splendid tonsil clinic, with Dr. Potter, a specialist from Knoxville, in charge. A Knoxville dentist comes twice a month to our hospital. For the first few months he came only one Saturday a month but there was so much to be done he found that even Sundays would not take care of the patients so now takes two week-ends in the Burg. For quite a while our nurse has been working to get the feet of several children straightened. She has taken them to Knoxville Hospitals, where they are so fine to us. Just this fall two children, either by braces or operation, are walking with straightened feet. Kate NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 417 Iluskey, from the Sugarlands, and Eula Floyd from Baskins. Because Eula's mother was a young girl of fourteen who did not realize her responsibility in keeping braces on continually, Eula has been taken to the Shriners' Hospital in Lexington until she can be perfectly cured. Although every year increases the confidence of the people in our nurse, bringing them to her for help, still a larger part of her work is in the homes. She also keeps in touch with the county schools of this district by giving inoculations, vaccinations, eye examinations and weighing and measuring the school children. Any needing special care are then turned over to the doctors who come to us from time to time. No work done by our school comes nearer touching the vital part of the people's lives than the nurse's. Ruby is unusually tall, light curl. hair, a very straight forward and sincere girl in her relation to people. More community work is done by our weaving teacher, Gene Red-ding, also not a Pi Phi but just as interested in the School as if she were. This year her work is in the homes more than among the school children, with whom this department naturally started. She works in thirty homes, running about forty looms for the school. This work covers a radius of about five miles. Men, women and children weave. In many homes it is the only source of income, in others supplementary. No doubt you know the various articles we make: Dress goods, towels, scarfs, rugs, bath mats. curtain materials, bags and coverlets. Aside from this hand work we handle all sorts of baskets, made in the homes of the people. Our hand-work has grown to a considerable business, one of the largest departments in the School. Miss Redding has had splendid training, and with a fine taste naturally, is developing a very great appreciation among: the people for beauty as a nice fabric. She is tall and slender, dark hair and grey eyes. She comes from Boston, with a Boston twist to her words, and although this is her second year here she continues to take "Bahths." Jean Steel has classes in Domestic Science, in the School in the mornings and in this community and others in the afternoons. These community classes are for adults, held in most cases in the local schoolhouses. Her attendance for a month will average from seventy-five to one hundred, with usually from three to six to a class. There is no more discouraging work than the pioneer steps of such work with the mountain women. 'Two or three seem a small number but when the situation is really understood, it is a great triumph. The typical. mountain woman stays in her home. It is what you might call a folk way with the people, rather than a lack of interest, the changing of which is very slow. Every impression, no matter how small, leaves a dint of tremendous importance in their lives, becoming evident at the least expected moments. Jean is another one outside the ranks of Pi Phi. She is a very practical minded girl, with the keenest possible sense of humor. The 418 THE ARROVV OIP PI BETA PHI picture she makes in her new, long sheep skin coat, on our handsomest horse, "Lady", as she rides down the road, is a picture never to be for-gotten. We should add that in addition to the afore mentioned coat, she has a large horse blanket festooned around her,: giving the appearance of an old time circuit rider. Our agricultural man, Mr, Mattil, has been with us more than ...four years, carrying his work into many connnunities, through classes among the farmers, talks, pictures and fairs. Many men consult him every week about personal problems, often getting their start c...ht blooded stack, good seeds for their tields and varieties of fruits for their orchards. During the time lie has been here he has developed a community chicken hatchery at the school, a. pig club that has been the means of putting Berkshire pigs of the best kind through these hills, built up the County fair, assisted in building farm buildings for the school and community and developed the athletics in the school. Mr. Mattil is a Delta Tau Delta, from the University of Tennessee, tall and slender, with 'a very amiable disposition, allowing him to maintain his position with fortitude among fourteen women. Ills Ford, his horse and his dog are in constant use, and even if he desired, he could never make a get-away to the city alone. No one in. the place will ho moire missed, when he leaves us, (with the exception of Miss Evelyn 1 as Mr. Mattil. In the office this year La Done Allen is the new assistant to Miss Evelyn. *She is a Pi Phi from the University of Arkansas, valling Memphis and Little Rock, home. A well. set up girl, with brown hair and eyes, very hard boiled when it comes to postage money and telephone tolls. Every call over our new telephone is 20e amounting to a considerable sum if charged to the School, also causing a lot of trouble always to make change, consequently La Delle's string to every call. As all school bills go through her hands she is quite nut important appendage to the institution. Without her we never would have 1Jeen able to carry on the immense amount of business .pertaining to the industrial work that has so nearly swamped us this fall. In the School we have six teachers, not counting the special ont,s'. Each with two grades in a room, with the exception of the kindergarten, a new department this year. Our school now carries its pupils from the kindergarten through second year high school. We Intrnber 66 boys and 58 girls, not counting any of the community (qasses. Seven boys and girls are living here on the place. Dorothy Trainer, from Chicago, the youngest in the family of teachers, teaches the kindergarten, a class which numbers from six to eighteen, depending upon the weather and measles, etc. As there was no available room in the school-house for this class she has her class in what has always been the dining-room. of the Teachers Cottage. Dorothy is a decided blonde, with a thinking head on very small and young shoulders. She is new in the game but learning fast. 'NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 419 the primary is Emily Burton, from Montclair. She has first and second grades. Very small and exceedingly young looking but with nine years residence, an element to be reckoned with. Her years of service should make her worthy of wearing the Arrow. The next two grades are taught by Mrs. Chapin, of New York City. Herself a Pi Phi, as well as a Pi Phi mother. She came to us to live in the little girls' dormitory but remained to teach in the school. Elmer Watson, of the local community, teaches the 5th and 6th grades. He helps with the athletics and without him our Sunday School would fall far below its present standard. In the high school are Marion Folsom and Maggie White. Marion is a T.,7niversity of Vermont Pi Phi, with a residence here of four years. Dark and active, and, with a boyish bob and a sparkli)g eye, she is abundantly able to take care of her room full of boys. faggie White is the other one of our blondes, a Pi Phi from Austin, Texas, but hardly one of the wild western Texans you read about in books, a typical bud of the modern college. She came to us three years ago a society butterfly but today can hunt possum and climb mountains with any of them. No doubt much of this is due to Marion's strenuous training. Miss 1~,~c lyre's mother feeds us three times a day, and a good fetsling it is. She lives in the girls' dormitory with the girls. Mrs. McCarter, who has been in the boys' dormitory for two years, and Aunt Lizzie who has been with the teachers for eight -years, do the cooking. Aunt Lis.zie has moved from the Teachers' Cottage to the Girls' Dormitory, even taking her clock from the living room (the very dock promised to Miss Evelyn when she married, but because of Miss Evelyn's procrastination, Aunt Lizzie has turned Indian Giver and has taken it back.) Mrs. 1)owell, a Pi Phi from Simpson College, is keeping house :gor the boys on the hill. Boys girls and teachers all have their meals together this year, a plan which is working out very well, even though the dining room. in the girls' dormitory is much too small. While this simplifies things somewhat it is so necessary to have a woman like Mrs. Dowell who can make a real home for the boys. It would take me too long to recount the virtues of our Head rtesident, Miss Evelyn, but if you visited the school for any length of time you came in contact with her personally and you can give a picture of your own, which would mean more to you, as well as to the girls. We close this week Friday with our annual Christmas exercises and Christmas tree. This happy time is made possible for the children by the lovely boxes sent to us from the clubs, and the extra Christmas cheeks take care of the candy and oranges given, not only to our own school boys and girls but many more up and down the creeks. 420 THE ARROW Or Pi BETA PHI Alice Kendall, of fhe local chapter there, could give you some mor( personal touches, after spending three summers here. Sincerely, HELEN CHEW A. TRIBUTE TO PI BETA PHI From the Lyre of Alpha Chi Omega we quote the following: SOUTHERN HIGHLANDERS I have been dean of girls in Murphy Collegiate Institute in Sevier ville, Tennessee the last two years. This school is in the heart of the Smoky Mountains, and has as its students boys and girls now known as Southern Highlanders. Contrary to the prevailing idea that the mountaineer is an idolent, ignorant sort, he is the soul of ambition when once he is given an opportunity. I have never seen such types of physical perfection-fine featured, erect, well groomed American boys and girls. I could write volumes of my admiration for the Southern Highlanders, but I can give an idea of life and service there with one concrete example. Just two years ago this month I felt a new sense of pride in my privilege of being a fraternity woman when I saw the embodiment of a wonderful fraternity ideal, worked out in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I had gone with the president of our school to an old fashioned county fair, high up in the mountains. Hundreds of men on horseback, a mountain of corn, old fashioned fiddlers-I felt as if I was looking at a movie. Suddenly I heard a Pi Phi song sung by a chorus of some thirty or forty boys and girls ranging in age from eight to fourteen years. I wish that I could describe it so that everyone could get the thrill that I did as I watched those children singing their praise to Pi Phi, who has made education possible for them. I have visited the school itself several times since then for it holds a wonderful fascination for me. Forty miles from Knoxville over a road winding around the mountains one reaches the Pi Phi school, situated in a Valley, surrounded by mountains. There are cottages for the girls, cottages for the boys, a cottage for the teachers, a school, a hospital. Besides regular school work, agriculture and handicraft are taught to the boys, household arts and textile crafts to the girls. The teachers are Pi Phis-Pi Phis from Canada, from Texas, from Illinois--harming, vigorous girls, devoted to their work and their fraternity. The nurse, untiring in her service, rides the mountains day and night, cares for all who need her skill, and receives the love and gratitude of the whole countryside. The superintendent of the school, Miss Bishop, is known and hailed NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 421 by everyone in Sevier County as Miss Evelyn. To her belongs the credit for the steady improvement, the constant advancement of the school. In the last year the road has been improved, hotels repaired, and Gatlinburg which lies at the foot of. Mt. Le Conte is fast becoming a summer resort. I asked Miss Evelyn what they would do as Gatlinburg grew larger and more modern. She replied, "We will move back, back to the mountains. Our duty is to give education to the children who would not have a chance other-wise. MARY HELEN THOMAS, A, Chi Omega FOURTEEN YEARS ON LITTLE PIGEON lowing article for the editor News The Pi Beta Phi Fraternity feels that in having founded the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the ideals of the first at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, it responded to a need and lived up to the ideals of the first Greek letter fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, founded at William and Mary College, back in colonial days. Fraternities and colleges have done a good d e a 1 of constructive work. Most of the higher and cultural colleges maintain settlements of some kind, placing these mainly irt large cities where conditions are crowded and a foreign element has to be taken care of. The Pi Beta Phi work, we feel, is unique in that, Upon request, Mrs. Lutcher Stark, Jr., (Nita Hill, Texas A), who is Chairman of the Settlement School, wrote the fol Nu for the Theta of Theta Kappa NITA HILL STARK Texas A instead of doing our work with the foreign element, we are dealing with the truest type of American. THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI Since our earliest recollections there has been a division between the peoples of the mountains and those of the plains. The Pi Phis feel that through their -code of ethics they have learned that any experimental effort toward humanized service, with its object the betterment of humanity, is worthy of consideration and that it of vital significance to our Nation. Several years ago there were numerous newspaper articles that touched on the tragic ignorance of the primitive life of the mountaineers of North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At the Swarthmore Convention in 1910, the Washington Alumnae Club delegate appealed to the National Fraternity to sanction the establishment of a school in one of these districts. For nearly two years the Fraternity enlisted the help of Congress men, State Legislators and Government officials, in order to locate the most needy place. A committee found that Gatlinburg or Little Pigeon," as it is familiarly known, in Sevier County, Tennessee, offered a most excellent field for such work as our dreams had been anticipating. It is a recognized fact that all of the big things that have happened in history have usually started in a very small way. So, we felt that our beginning being so small was destined to be great. interesting to know that we started school with one teacher, an experienced mountain worker, whose house rent cost us all of one and one-half dollars per month. The people of these mountains, the -Unaka Range, a part of the Appalachain system, have, an interesting history. They are descendants of Scotch, Scotch-Irish, French and a few French-Italians, known as Waldensians, however, all of which is too long a story to take up here. 'Should anyone be more interested in this, it would be advisable for him to read "The Land of Saddle Bags," A Study of the Mountain People of Appalachia, by James Watt Raine. Much has been said about the ancestry of these mountaineers and their customs, so I shall not go into detail, as my main object here is to present the School to the members of your fraternity. The purpose of the School is to give to the mountaineers of South-eastern Tennessee educational training, equivalent to an elementary and high school course, with particular emphasis on industrial and agricultural work, to provide a health center, to maintain a settlement house with recreational activities, and to extend to the mountaineers such help as from time to time is needed. Gatlinburg, on the Little Pigeon River, lies forty-eight miles by automobile road southeast of Knoxville. It is sixteen miles from Sevierville, the County Seat of Sevier county. At present there is no railroad connection from Sevierville to Gatlinburg and only this year has a telephone line been. installed. 422 NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 423 AN IDEAL DISPLAY FOR A SETTLEMENT SCHOOL MEETING Memphis, Tennessee Alumnae Club Teachirig in a settlement requires a different method and, to quote from another writer, it has been found that the mounaineers cannot take "their learning heavily." It must be given out in small parcels, sonletimes tlimugh social atmosphere, developing fellowship and. good will. Our first school was at the junction of Baskins Creek and "Little Pigeon River," and we felt that even though we could only run the school four months of that year that each year we could increase the length of the term until we would have a full nine months school term. At the beginning of our School Gatlinburg was a little hamlet of six or seven houses and an ()pen air blacksmith shOp, a tumbled down school house wonderfully ventilated, as many boards had fallen off, and an equally well ventilated Baptist church. I remember a service I attended in the last mentioned ehur(...!Ii. The flies nearly ate us up and those we killed with the hymn books gave a very meaty dinner to the religious chickens that attended services. Church was held once a month by a preaeller who. was more or less uneducated. The age of the students in the beginning varied from ten to forty. And, another thing we had to contend with was that children of actual school age had to bring the younger children with them, in order to be able to come to school at all. The natives were suspicious of outsiders, did 424 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI not want any interference, but they desired better educational ad-vantages. They had tQ accept the work offered by Pi Beta Phi. Their spirit of hospitality, crude as it was, prevailed and a cooperative working atmosphere was created among the young workers. It was not an easy beginning. And, to this day, we have to consider, very care-fully, public opinion. In looking backward, we find that in the early part of 1912 they had their first sociable. It was a primitive room with long seats, no desks, very low ceilings supported by poles, and there were six of these poles. Here they were taught to sing and here the two Pi Phi workers said, "All these people at Gatlinburg need is a light and a chance." It is interesting to know that we had to teach these children their games. They (lid not even know how to "drop the handkerchief." And, now, each year it is with a great deal of satisfaction we watch these healthy young Americans play with their neighbors at "tug of war", baseball, basketball, and such sports during the county Gatlinburg fair. Fbr some years we have promoted community interest in a fair which would do credit to any thriving community. In speaking of basketball, I feel l should tell you of a funny instance that happened several years ago. We have a very good friend who has a summer home at Gatlinburg. He provided the basketball team with their suits, and the teacher who has charge of athletics instructed the boys to don their uniforms. After quite a long time they appeared with their suits over their overalls, as they felt that they were entirely too immodest otherwise. I shall not go into detail to tell you how uninviting their homes were, but, if at any time you were occasioned to be there, they were always open to welcome in a stranger. The teachers at the Pi Beta Phi school were looked upon to be peculiar if they happened to be more than twenty when they arrived at Gatlinburg to teach because they were not married. Early marriages, as early as twelve and thirteen to nineteen, were contracted and it was no unusual sight to see a family of thirteen to nineteen children. They are, however, marrying later in life on the whole than in 1912, and there are fewer children. When the World War came, Gatlinburg sent her quota of mountaineers. They went in the 30th Division which came from the mountains .of North and South Carolina and Tennessee. You may depend upon it that the men of the 30th Division could shoot, for hunting game had not died out in their country. We have stars for nineteen boys on our service flag, of which there are three gold stars. I have told you mainly of our beginning and now I want to tell you of our work as it is today. Our plant has grown from one little school house to quite a number of houses. We have the main building, the teachers cottage, two cottages for girls dormitories, which are supervised by matrons and teachers, one cottage for boys, a museum and NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 425 a health center. The pupils who board at the school are kept there through scholarships given by certain people from over the United States, while others of them do part time work to pay for their tuition. In the Smith-Hughes Agricultural work, we conduct a short course in Animal Husbandry. We have an "Endless Pig Chain" where a boy is given a pig with a contract to return a certain per cent of the little pigs. Those, in turn, are given to another boy who raises another litter of pigs, returning so many back to the school. The same scheme is contracted in promoting thoroughbred chicken raising. Gatlinburg soil is well adapted for fruit raising, especially apples. In reaching the older people we have asked the father to give the boy one tree out of his orchard. The class in the Agricultural Department h a s corn() to this tree, sprayed it, pruned it, and cultivated it. The father notices that the apples on this tree are of a more even size; that it is free of rust and BUILDING CHICKEN HOUSE spots, so he comes to ask us to help him. This is a part of our community work. We have taught them that it is better to raise thorough-bred cattle and chickens. We have taught them how to build a barn that is up-to-date, yet in keeping with this isolated district. We also have the Smith-Hughes Domestic Economy classes. Here we have classes in canning, studies in balanced diets, and practical as well as theoretical cooking and sewing. The ages of the students in these classes range from twelve to seventy years. Beside the regular school course, we have classes in weaving. We promote weaving among adults as a rainy day industry. We encourage the people in farming and cattle raising, but we also promote this weaving and basket making for rainy clay purposes. We feel very proud of the advancement in this line. We have a very well organized Health center. Every three weeks we hold dental clinics, and during the summer some Chicago dentists assist in this work for .a very small fee. We promote education in sanitation and health hygiene and feel that we have accomplished a great deal. Some interesting statistics of Sevier County, I think, .should bE noted here. The number of desks there in 1916 was forty-three, and it 1923, 2100. In 1916 there were no libraries. Now, there are twenty one. There were no consolidated schools in 1913, but in, .1923 them 1-26 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI THE NEW BARN AND OLD ONE were thirty-two with two or more teachers. In 1915 there were 5113 pupils, ,and in 1923, .6994, with a decrease in population. I' have not said Much about the finances or operation of the school. The donations to the School have' always been voluntary and never have the funds decreased since the beginning, but each year we find that the members of Pi Beta Phi are more .willing to give to this great cause than ever. We feel that with this wonderful object to work for that there has been a closer bond of fellowship between alumnae clubs and active chapters. The Pi Beta Phis have contributed annually by individual gifts through clubs .who have conducted sales of industrial goods such as weaving and basket work, or at bridge parties, etc. The School is supervised by a committee of five who makes an annual visit to the school, the Chairman making two visits, annually. At the School proper, there is .an excellent staff of people, particularly and peculiarly suited to conduct classrooms, meet obstacles and mingle in the civic and religious life of the community. Our work has grown to such an extent that we have opened up an extension work at Sugar-lands, upon the request of the people of that community. At this center we have been conducting classes in adult education.. It is a pathetic sight to see old men and women, some grandparents, struggling to learn to write their names, and it also gives us a great deal of pleasure to see their joy in having learned this feat. May the spirit that fostered the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in the beginning, support it through the years to come, that the entire work may act as a leaven to help not only the Pi Phis, but the Fraternity spirit from one end of this great nation to its+ uttermost bounds, NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 42: for the world's greatest teacher said: "Inasmuch as ye did it unto on of the least of these, Ye have done it unto me."
