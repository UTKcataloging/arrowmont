MERRITT, Phi Mu, University of Mi, m Coral Gables In "Fraternity Month" Is your chapter library one in name only a spot so designated because your National Council has decreed that a library is an essential part of a chapter room or lodge or house? Is it a dark corner not suitable for any purpose, but it can house a few books, and you can say you have a library? Are the books in it mostly discarded textbooks and poorly chosen "gift" books which the recipient wished to discard? If your library resembles the one described above, it is time you were doing something about it. First, choose a quiet room or alcove or pleasant corner in which simple, attractive bookshelves can be built and paint them to harmonize with the other furnishings. A few comfortable chairs, good lights, and enticing books will do the rest. A card index file should be made of all books and a simple system of borrowing and returning set up. Your sorority bookplate will add to the attractiveness of any book and will make it easier to find if some thoughtless reader keeps it out too long. After all, the librarian needs some duties to make her feel important. Come to Convention Shamrock Hotel, Houston, Texas July 7-13, 1952. Settle ent School ep0t'tS CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE HE GREATNESS of a nation and the greatness of Tan organization lie in the number of its members who are willing to assume non-enforceable responsibilities." This quotation applies well to Pi Beta Phi whose members voluntarily assume duties, interests, and responsibilities for love of the fraternity and its projects. The Settlement School, in its years of existence, with the careful planning of the few and the noble support of the many certainly is the result of the willing spirit above mentioned. Individually and in groups Pi Beta Phis have rallied to the maintenance of their project in Tennessee. . Originally, the purpose was basic in fact rudimentary education. With passing years the community of Gatlinburg and Sevier County, Tennessee have been able to assume some of the burden, Now fraternity interest has widened to include other fields of endeavor and to lend support more especially to a large health program and the development of crafts in that area. The fraternity leases our school buildings and playgrounds to the County for a nominal fee. The County provides maintenance and pays all teachers' salaries save four. In order to assist in making the Pi Beta Phi School fully accredited, Pi Beta Phi assumed the hiring and the salary of the Physical Education and Health teacher some years ago. To develop the physical well-being of youth seemed a most Important phase of our Health program. Then, to improve and expand the natural talents, music and craft instruction were added. This coming year Mr. Walter Ogle will again be School Superintendent and principal of the high school with Mrs. Ann Lighter serving as assistant principal. Mr. Ogle felt that the past school year did not run as smoothly as other years; in the fall the fine new County grade school building was not ready for several months and this caused an overcrowded condition with resulting uncertainty and unhappiness for the teachers. This coming year the County will strive toward the 6 6 3 plan of education and prospects are brighter. We find Mr. Ogle, Mr. Ingle, local County school board member and the County Superintendent, Mr. Seaton all cooperative in consulting Pi Beta Phi about the hiring of new teachers. Mr. Hartford Granitz, graduate of the University of Chattanooga, has been the instructor in Physical Education and Health this year. His major coaching was in basketball where, due to inexperienced players, the boys' team won only fourteen games of the twenty-four scheduled. The girls won ten and lost twelve. In the tourney, the boys went to the semi-finals and placed one boy on the all-tourney team. In addition to basketball other sports, tumbling, gymnastics, touchball, badminton, swimming, tennis, volley ball, soft ball and shuffle board, were introduced, varying according to the weather. Need for a larger gymnasium and more gymnasium equipment sorely handicaps the program. Mr. Ogle praised Mr. Granitz' work and influence.very highly. Marilyn Jones, a member of Pi Beta Phi, has ably handled the Arts and Crafts department and we regret that she will not be able to return. To quote Marilyn's own report gives a little idea of what she found in Gatlinburg: "The interest, abilities and background of the students have made my job one of great pleasure, for here in the Smokies, creating through self-expression is an inherent ability." Her aim, throughart, was to encourage independent thinking and the ability to work with others. Planning with the teachers made possible art work integrated with their regular grade school studies. For example, in the study of Gatlinburg, one group made for display pottery in local clay, hand weaving, and carved soap to typify the wood carvers; another, a map of the town, an over life-size papier-mache bear and a scrap book. The fifth grade worked out ten different marionette shows, all participating in the writing, designing, planning, and creating of their. own marionettes. As the sixth grade studied Greek history they wrote and gave their own Greek play in assembly; the backdrops, costumes, properties, Greek masks, statuary, all were original. In addition to these group studies individual art expression was made possible in all grades. In the high school students learned principles of basic design, fine arts, the use of water colors and oil and became familiar with the outstanding painters of all time. Craft work continued even after school hours when some of the students learned of enameling, pottery, candle making, weaving and book-binding. Re-quests even came from adults for special classes. Mr. Carl Huskey, with only a part time school day to give instruction because of his own shop work, gave fine help in wood-working to the high school boys. The coming year some replacements in machinery will make possible larger classes and more precise results. The County Superintendent feels this subject most important for there are so many woodworking shops in those hills where talented boys can secure employment. In music, Mrs. Aletha Armstrong aspires to greater melody and harmony and to inspiring more students to make use of their voices. For the first time this year eight boys have been added to the glee club of thirty-two and appeared on final programs something unheard of. Also for the first time a choir has been used in the assemblies, thus stimulating general musical appreciation. In the grade school, regular instruction was given all year with various smaller groups appearing in public from time to time. An original Christmas play using rare and seldom heard carols was given and the finale for the year was a patriotic pageant. For both of these the Art department lent full sup-port in creating backgrounds and striking scenes. During the summer visit of the province officers, Mrs. Armstrong spoke of the great contribution Pi Phi makes to the young people by bringing to them a real appreciation for finer music with the best in records and by offering an opportunity for proper development of their voices. At the same time, Mrs. Ann Lighter who, during her supervision of the Grace Coolidge Library at the school, has received books, magazines and furniture as gifts for the library thanked the officers and through them all Pi Phis for their generosity. So convincingly did these two ex-press their appreciation and the further need for assistance the officers, on their departure from Gatlin-burg, left thirty dollars as their own contribution to further the music program and to add to the library of the Pi Beta Phi School. In a cooperative scheme for improving the appearance of the school this spring in order to raise its state classification, Pi Beta Phi gave two hundred dollars which repaired the gymnasium walls and provided the labor for their painting. The County paid 47 4. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW for the paint and both teachers and students volunteered their services in the cause of beautification. A special mention goes to the P.T.A. for its leader-ship in the best interests of the school. Sufficient funds were raised to enlarge and continue. the operation of the school lunch room where, with government aid, hot lunches are offered daily. These are particularly important to the youngsters who arrive by bus at such early hours. Some of them deposit the youngsters on the school grounds before seven in the morning. The P.T.A. also contributed toward the improvement of the elementary school library. Pi Beta Phi is proud of its staff and the effort each makes for the school and the community. One teacher sponsors the Beta club (two drove a group to the state convention at Nashville this spring) ; another is a Girl Scout leader; others are class sponsors; others are helpful in transportation of teams for sport events or in case of illness. Each makes her personal contribution to her, or his, church as well as to community developments. The demands upon their time some-times seem out of proportion. Miss Dyer is doing a very competent work as Director. Since February we have enjoyed having Lillian Hansen, Kansas Beta, as Assistant to the Director and she has stepped nicely into her new responsibilities. She chaperons the dormitory girls in Stuart Cottage as one of her duties. Last year all our girls finished high school and we have had five new girls learning a great deal under the tutelage of Miss Hodgen, our House Manager. There have been no school boys staying with us this year but already the applications of several are at hand. The dormitory system provides girls and boys who live far away or beyond the bus line, a chance for education with less difficulty and gives us the benefit of their help a few hours a week in part payment for their board and room. We could not maintain our school through fair or foul weather were it not for our Maintenance man, Arlie Watson who needs no introduction after his recent feature in the ARROW. His son Neal ably assists him as does Preacher Richard Watson when the Pi Phi farm is not requiring his attention. Our live stock, namely the pigs, two old mules and the chickens, are the responsibility of Richard and he takes great pride in the abundance of fresh eggs, chickens and the vegetables served at our table. This past year Teachers' Cottage was brightened with lovely new living room drapes, designed and hand-woven by Tina McMorran, our weaving de-signer. In like manner the bedrooms of Stuart Cottage were made more attractive with new curtains de-signed by Tina, woven by Miss Hodgen, made by Mrs. Jones the cook and with the addition of new spreads. Stuart and Pollard were lightened with some interior painting and during the coming year Stuart, Pollard, Teachers' Cottage and the Red Barn all will require exterior coats of paint. As announced at the 1950 Convention, plans for a new Staff House move steadily forward but not too swiftly. At present the architect is working on the detail drawings and specifications and we hope it will be started in the early fall. This building will give more comfortable quarters for the all-year staff and will provide additional housing for the Summer Workshop, a very important factor in future plans. Closely linked with the school program and vital to the community through health education is our Jennie Nicol Health Center presided over by Marjorie Chalmers, R.N. This year like all others has been a busy one. Perhaps the simplest means of showing the activity is a list of the type of work done these past twelve months. ' '84 Field Visits Office Calls 22 11 First Aid 1928 Diphtheria Immunizations 232 Small Pox Vaccinations :268384 Total Typhoid Inoculations 799 Completed Typhoid Series . . . . Total Pertussis Inoculations 108 Completed Pertussis Series 38 Therapeutic Inoculations . . 175 Health Talks Pupil Inspections and Examinations . . . 3786 113 Newspaper Articles . . . 55 Chest X-Rays 724 Pupil inspections and examinotions eomprise the greatest number of calls. Pre-school clinics were held with the cooperation of the local doctors and the path between grade school and Health Center is well worn by visits for various ailtnents, poison ivy being the greatest, or for first aid in case of minor accidents. Friday afternoons are given to a well baby or pre-natal clinic where the shy babies, sometimes brought by an older sister, are comforted after a shot by a toy sup-plied from the Pi Phi gifts sent there. In addition to our own school, the health cif the rural school children is also looked after, both through their visits to the Health Center and by Marjorie in regular calls at the school-houses, weather permitting. From the Division of Tuberculosis Control, the mobile trucks came to our Center several times this year. Some stops were for regular check-ups and others for food handlers and public survey. A total of 1,425 were x-rayed. Three children were sent to the Crippled Children's Clinic in Knoxville, two to be re-fitted with braces and the other, victim of spastic paralysis, received a light wheel chair, purchased with contributions from neighbors and friends. Marjorie has assisted the Scouts by holding First Aid classes and assisting in examinations and inocula--tions before the exodus to caitisps. She was chosen to represent Sevier County at a short course in nursing atomic cases given by the Knoxville chapter of the Red Cross. She has also aided the local doctors and the Citizens' Council in planning for Civilian Defense and Community Health in case of bombings. Outside the general line of duty our nurse has faithfully written a gratuitous health column for the weekly newspaper wherein she gives many good precautionary hints and sage health advice to the reading public. Her frequent invitations to talk before outside organizations speaks well for her place in the nursing profession. Her faith in the part our Health Center plays in the better health of school and community spurs her on to greater deeds. We appreciate the continued interest of Sigma Phi Gamma, International Sorority, which through its "service for mountain children" fund has .made possible both x-ray and eye correction with new glasses for those unable to pay. Several of the separate chapters have become interested and have sent supplies or special funds whereby new strip films and slides for educational purposes could be purchased. The Pi Phi Richmond, Virginia alumina club sent fourteen dollars with which pictures to show dental care were bought and five dollars sent by Mrs. T. C. Bowles in memory of Louise Spalding Malin were used for new ear and eye charts. The layettes provided by the Westchester Alum= Club are so very welcome as are the separate donations to the loan closet. Arrowcraft is another very important part of the Pi Beta Phi School. Through their orders to Arrowcraft SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 Pi Phis everywhere are in direct touch with the School and if they visit the shop, want to hear all about the rest of our development. The visual evidences of the beautiful products cannot fail to make them cognizant of our crafts relations in the Smokies. Ethel M. Snow, our competent manager, has filled many orders to clubs and chapters this past year while at the same time local sales at the shop have been larger. She, and the Committee as well, appreciate the more business-like approach with orders and the prompter settlement of accounts. Some day perhaps all clubs and individuals will realize they must not demand greater credit leniency from Pi Beta Phi than from any other merchant with whom they trade and will awaken to the fact that a good credit rating in Pi Beta Phi is wise, too. From year to year usually the same clubs are -best sellers" but this year two things were proven: one, that a new untouched territory presents a great field and little sales resistance; two, that a small new club, with enthusiasm and effort can aspire to high sales rank. The Coos Bay, Oregon club, newly organized and small, sold .$1,916.Oo worth of Arrow_ craft products, standing second only to Champaign, Illinois, again first. Eleven clubs topped the one thou-sand dollar mark in sales: Portland, Oregon; Pitts-burgh, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Houston, Texas ; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Madison, Wisconsin; Eugene, Oregon and Northern New Jersey. Tina McMorran, weaving designer has given us some beautiful new designs, gorgeous in coloring, ready for the new price list. To picture all articles would make the price list prohibitive and much must be left to faith in past production. There have been steep advances in cotton and linen threads which will mean a change in some of the articles woven and such old stand-bys as the white under arm bag will be missing. However the new things such as party aprons with metallic threads, seamless bags, a new formal luncheon set, new stoles, new linen and other towels, a new wool dirndl, all will take their places most satisfyingly.. The wool dirndl skirts started a year ago now total more than six hundred-forty-three sold and are still in demand. Of interest to those who dislike taxes is the newly designed dressy bag with a woven-in-handle, which will be tax free. The quality of our weaving is above criticism at all times. But a recognition of it came this spring when we were asked by the Tennessee Educational Association to provide a small exhibit for Tennessee's room at the national meeting of the N. E. in San Francisco this summer, It is the only craft exhibit to be shown. We would give special mention to Mrs. McCutchan who handles the little shop in the Mountain View Hotel in Gatlinburg so ably, accommodating her time there to the convenience of her patrons, be the hour early or late. Also to one who has much to do with the success of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Eunice Cole without whose skill at figures both you and we would be in difficulty! Perhaps she would like it said here to those officers whose clubs have paid nothing on their Arrow-craft indebtedness that they ask them to explain the valid reason for such an oversight or investigate for themselves the reasons wherefore. We regretted losing Lura Owenby Porter, who had been with Arrowcraft for sixteen years, when she left to join her husband in Kentucky and also Hattie Trentham when she found family business interests required her resignation. Wanda Ogle from the sales department stepped into the position of assistant weaving designer under Tina and Mrs. Snow has takenon two new sales girls, Reba Owenby and Margaret Ogle. Edna Cook is now the Senior sales girl and assists Mrs. Snow in filling both mail orders and shop sales with discriminating care. Of interest is the fact that Margaret Ogle's mother was one of our faithful weavers for many years. During the year we lost another long-time weaver, Mollie Moore, when her family moved to a farm near Knoxville. She had been with Arrowcraft almost from the beginning and had woven only Whig Rose mats and runners for about sixteen years. For the first time in three years the Committee arranged its annual meeting to coincide with the Summer Workshop session and was immensely proud of what it saw. The few thousand dollars budgeted each year toward this particular craft development is one of our most necessary expenditures. For the seventh summer Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee have planned this Workshop in Weaving, Pottery, jewelry Making, Textile Decoration and Metal Work. The consensus of opinion was that this was the most successful session to date, and Miss Jessie W. Harris, head of U. T. College of Home Economics, who had not seen the Workshop for two years because of being in Europe was most enthusiastic on her visit this summer. Pi Beta Phi is fortunate that the University will lend Miss Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design each year to head the Workshop as she is exceedingly well liked and skilled. The school buildings are transformed to make way for the Workshop and all of our equipment and much from the University is in use. Twenty-six states were represented among the students and staff this summer. Some of the students remain fo? the full six weeks, others for three weeks only and some are studying for credit while others for recreation. There were six Pi Phis among this summer's students and many other Pi Phis could avail themselves of this opportunity. The enrollment of necessity is limited because of lack of enough housing facilities and the individual classes are also restricted for no instructor can do justice with a teaching overload. There is no age limitation and this summer there have been two bright young ninety and almost ninety year olds. Each term concludes with an Open House where the results of the three weeks' study are artistically displayed and each pupil demonstrates her particular craft. In addition to the work accomplished there is time for picnicking and other recreation and trips to nearby Craft centers are arranged. This year all went by bus to Asheville, North Carolina to attend the Craftsman's Fair, previously held on the Pi Phi Green in Gatlinburg but this year moved to North Carolina. The Fair was held in the Civic Auditorium and had an attendance of 8,600 for the four days. Pi Beta Phi sent over a loom, set up with a bag warp in bright colors upon which Tina McMorran and her assistant wove. They also took their warping bars for purposes of demonstration. There were exhibits of various craft making as well as a salesroom where all the crafts had their wares on hand for sale. In a smaller fashion there will be a local Crafts Fair on our grounds in late September when the forty-eight governors of the United States with those of Alaska, Guam and Hawaii convene for their annual conference. Each Governor is permitted to have a party of six and the Fair is just one event planned for their entertainment. Pi Beta Phi is hoping that many National Panhellenic members will be among the ladies in the group to whom can be shown the project about which they have so often heard our School. Again this year the Gateway Players under the 50 THE SEP m ki ER ARK() v. direction of Mr. John Richards of the New York Academy . of Dramatic Arts are making use of the school auditorium as a theatre. With an excellent cast of young players they are presenting leading plays as entertainment for vacation visitors. These players from New York are gaining experience for Broadway parts and at the same time enjoying a type of living in the mountains, far different than that to which they are accustomed. There is tremendous satisfaction in hearing that the general contributions of both alumnae clubs and active chapters to the Settlement School show an in-crease over the 1949-50 figures. Just as one's personal living costs have mounted, so must the Settlement School Committee provide for possible increasing expenses in its budget; therefore the added donations are particularly appreciated. The St. Louis club continues to give its receipts from the big summer fashion show and thereby, with its thousand dollar contribution, ranks first among alumnae club contributors. Then follow Philadelphia ($527.00); Cleveland East ($345.00); Milwaukee ($250.00); Pittsburgh ($225.00) ; Indianapolis ($210.00) ; Denver ($200.00). Among active chapters, honors go to: Maryland Alpha ($1,000.00 balance from its chapter treasury); Missouri Beta ($125.00) ; Nebraska Beta ($106.10) ; Texas Alpha ($100.00). Every contribution from one dollar upwards is important and valued for the spirit which prompted it; together, the ones and fives and seventy-fives make a good showing where much is needed. As interest increases, particularly among active chapters, so will our project broaden in scope. To have the clubs of four provinces and the chapters of seven, one hundred percent is good but not good enough. What a tribute, for the fortieth anniversary of the opening of the Settlement School next year to have every club and chapter a contributor ! The check from the Central Office Magazine Agency for $8,770.57 was happily received. Your continuance as informed Pi Phis through the reading of current magazines is urged along with your giving your own and your neighbors' subscriptions to those magazines to the Pi Beta Phi agency. For the second year the Franklin Magazine Agency returned as a gift to the school, the check sent them for the school magazine subscriptions. This came as an acknowledgement of the large business Pi Phi has given them through the years. This year we shall have a new printing of the Cook Book. It had been said that an entirely new book might be advisable but after considering the large amount of time, effort and expense involved in gathering new recipes, and the continued popularity of our present edition, it was decided to arrange for a re-print. The Memorial Fund provides a satisfying medium for an expression of sympathy in the loss of a friend or dear one. The donor may state where or how she wishes the money used or may leave its distribution to the wise discretion of the Committee. In the case of a bequest, the Settlement School Treasurer should be contacted for the proper legal form. The many boxes of toys, clothing, books, fruit and candy, in addition to the extra checks at Christmas time are always welcome. They provide a special gift of game or book for each grade school room and an individual gift to each child in our grade school and those of the three nearest rural schools. The staff, too, has enjoyed and appreciated the thoughtfulness of some clubs, chapters and single Pi Phis in sending them special remembrances. It is wonderful when Pi Phis remember those in Gatlinburg who work for Pi Phi objectives in Tennessee. There are Pi Phis who remain uncertain of the values to the fraternity in a continuation of our pro-gram in Tennessee. What would be our program if we did pull away? Where would the fraternity receive greater satisfaction in any undertaking (nor more recognition) than its health program, its continued encouragement of native arts and crafts and its supplemental help in education ? Because of the fast development of the tourist travel to Smoky Mountain National Park, the town has lost some of its natural charm; the residents themselves are concerned. One of our province officers after being in Gatlinburg for the first time wrote that she was not disappointed in the School but in the town. Not seeing anything of the mountains nor the mountaineers, it was a little hard, from the appearance of the main street, to under-stand the need for our School there. Fortunately for her peace of mind, her husband and her boys had time for some investigating and could explain what conditions were off the main street. For example, when one realizes that open ditches still carry sewage--and not far from our School and the main street, too--one knows that all the public health problems have not been solved. The same holds true for education. Some newcomers to the town fail to see the need for Pi Beta Phi in the school but they have not attempted nor succeeded in getting the necessary help from the County Court. County funds are not available for other construction in Gatlinburg now, though all should be proud of the modern new grade school building in use this year. There will be no County nurse next year which will make the load for our Health Center still heavier. As the County or city proves its ability to accomplish its own proper development, Pi Beta Phi will gladly step into other fields. Obviously the time is not yet. The Committee experienced very special pleasure during its annual meeting in having both the Grand Council and the Province officers in Gatlinburg for a part of the time. First hand visual education surpasses word description. Both from the comments at the time and correspondence since, we have learned that the officers really saw that our project is worthy of fraternity interest and support. At our Committee meeting we missed the presence and help of Harriet Rauch, detained at home because of her mother's illness. She will continue to handle the News of Little Pigeon and other publicity. Ethel Smith will again serve as Secretary and will be consultant on the school library. Nellis Gibson will handle the circulation of our films the new, the old, and the Workshop films are all available. The Treasurer's books for the School are again in the hands of Olivia Smith Moore. The work of the Committee is heavy and the distribution of some of the responsibility among four others lightens the load for the chairman. She is appreciative of all that each one does and all of us are grateful for the assistance from Grand Council, particularly the help of our contact member, Miss Onken. We also recognize the immeasurable help of the other officers in their contacts with each club and chapter. "Our shadow, our influence may fall where we may never be !" The Committee is conscious of this truth as it surveys the help of all the many alumnae and actives whose faith in the Settlement School is manifested in their constant support and their continued interest. A simple deed may mean a bettered life; a single act may mean greater happiness for some child; a contribution, large or small, can mean continued success and progress in Gatlinburg. RUTH BARRETT SMITH THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1951 51 THE PAST YEAR has been the busiest one that I have spent in Gatlinburg. After Nancy Holmes left the first of August, I had no help until February first when Lillian Hansen, Kansas 13, came to work at the school. She has been efficient. and helpful and has already made a place for herself in the school and in the town. Besides her work at the school she has undertaken the leadership of and Girl Scout Troop and is secretary of the P.T.A. and of the Episcopal Auxiliary. Community Building in this rapidly rowing, town never stops. The winter and bad weather conditions slow things down but with the first hint of spring a fever of activity breaks out in order to have accommodations ready for the opening of the season. The Baptist congregation razed their old church and are now building a new and much larger structure on the same site. It is built of Crab Orchard stone and wood and is rather modern in design. A small field stone church has been built up in the Airport field by the Episcopalians. It is attractive and will be more so when it is fully completed. .Some new furnishings and a pipe organ have been added to the new Methodist church which is now practically complete. Another improvement to the churches of the town has been at the Roaring Fork church where they have new pews and an acre of ground purchased for a parking lot. A site has been purchased for a Catholic church. The First National Bank of Gatlinburg opened March first. It is located in the Maples building and provides the town with up to date banking facilities. Numerous tourist businesses have been built and old ones changed and improved. The Mountain View has done some extensive interior remodeling and the Edgepark Inn has been enlarged and converted into a modern Motel. A coffee shop in the basement is one of the new eating places that have sprung up all over town. The Chamber of Commerce and tourist bureau have been merged. and Mr. Bart Leeper hired as the Secretary. He is bringing much advertising to the area in national magazines and papers and is organizing and promoting several conventions. Chief of these will be the annual Conference of the Governors which meets in Gatlinburg in late September, 1951. Union church services on Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter were held. The annual party for the benefit of the village library brought entertainment to, the local people and a sense of working together for a common good. School The school year has been marked by important beginnings and changes in several phases of the pro-gram. For the first time all grades were placed under the direction of one man. Mr. Walter Ogle did no teaching but served as principal of the high school and superintended the work in the elementary school. A business course was introduced and typing and bookkeeping taught to juniors and seniors. Two type-writers were given as a parting gift by last year's graduating class, the P.T.A. purchased eight and Sevier County the other ten. The boys in the wood working class constructed some of the necessary tables. Another first was the football team. The county hired a coach who organized and coached the first Pi Phi football team. A group of interested Gatlinburg citizens organized the Gatlinburg Athletic Associationand collected $1,100.00 for necessary uniforms and equipment. The boys really did very well. In their eight game schedule they won three games and lost five. The new elementary building, built by the County on land donated by us, was not ready for occupancy until November first. Until that time conditions through the school were very unsatisfactory and crowded but after the first four grades were moved into their lovely new quarters much confusion was eliminated. For the first time we participated in a program with the University of Tennessee Department of Education, whereby thirteen senior students did their practice teaching in our school system during the winter quarter. This group brought fresh enthusiasm and new ideas to the school. The University, the community and the school were well satisfied with results of the experiment. Since the first of October the high school building has served as headquarters for the Baptist congregation for Sunday and mid-week services while their new church is under construction. Up to the seventh grade the teaching has been well done and the school has run smoothly. An at-tempt was made to departmentalize the seventh and eighth grades but this did not work out. The teachers that had been hired were not certificated properly for the work; the seventh grade teacher was out of school almost a month on account of illness and was very weak in discipline. A substitute was hired to take his work while he was ill and was retained to teach half of the grade when it was decided necessary to divide the grade into two sections. The grade has been a problem all year and will take skillful handling next year. Kelly Huskey again taught the eighth grade. He did some nice work with the ;unior girls and boys basketball teams and contributed to their success in winning many games. In the high school there were several changes in the faculty. Mrs. Lighter was on leave of absence for one year from the English and library position and while the person who replaced her did her best, the school missed the stability and good judgement Mrs. Lighter has always contributed. Our coach of last year. Wm. J. Miracle, was recalled to army service just before school opened. We were able to secure the services of Mr. Hartford Granitz from the University of Chattanooga who has filled the position well. He assisted with the football program by helping Mr. Levelling with the back field coaching. His basketball season was not too successful, due to inexperienced players. Even with the changes and additions mentioned, the school has not been quite up to other years. Furnace failures and poor janitor services were unnecessary handicaps. The confusion resulting from the delayed completion of the new building,. poor discipline, and some poor teaching, have all contributed to this result. The usual Halloween Carnival came of and the junior and Senior classes gave plays. The big Christmas program was much curtailed on account of furnace failures prohibiting rehearsals. The younger children all had room parties where there were gift exchanges and in the lower grades, the presents that were sent by Pi Phi active and Alumnae Clubs. Mrs. Armstrong varied her custom of presenting the grade school children in an operetta by giving a Patriotic Pageant. While this did not use as many children it was colorful and timely. Both the basketball and football teams were feted at banquets and the juniors entertained the seniors at their annual affair. 52 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Several new pieces of equipment were added during the year: one electric sewing machine for the home economics department and a new mimeograph for the use of the teachers. After the new building was occupied, one of the vacant class rooms was fitted up for visual education and another room served for the Girl Scouts. Mr. Granitz .and his boys constructed a shed as an addition to the gymnasium dressing rooms from old materials secured from the Baptist Church. Some necessary repairs and painting were accomplished during the year by a cooperative effort of the Fraternity, which gave $200.00 to repairing the gym and hall with new plywood in the broken spots and labor for some painting. The County paid for the paint used and the students and teachers did some painting. At the Craft Shop there was a complete re-decorating of the Art room which was planned by Marilyn Jones and one of the student teachers. The girls enlisted the aid of their friends and worked long hours themselves. It has been quite the style to get the rooms freshened up. All of the class rooms and the hall in the elementary building were repainted and a number of the ones in the high school building. The roof of the old elementary building was finally painted after a wait of three years. For the second year the Franklin Square Magazine Agency returned the check that was sent to pay for the school magazine subscriptions. This check for $68.50 was a gift from them in recognition of the Pi Phi business during the years. Other gifts have been made by Alumnae Clubs and individuals in the form of books to the library. We have added several fine reference books which are memorials to Pi Phis. Commencement events went off well in the dignified manner that I think is a great credit to the school. First, for the Seniors, was their trip. This year the class and sponsors went to Florida on a circle tour for five days. It is always a highlight of the four years of school. We hold no exercises for the eighth grade but they did present a little play on Friday evening before the last week of school. Dr. Tames Wilder gave the Baccalaureate address in the Methodist Church. This was another first for the new pipe organ provided the instrumental music and was used to accompany the glee club girls when they sang. On Class night the alas and gowns were replaced with pretty formals for the girls and neat suits for the boys of the class of twenty-one. Before the Commencement pro-gram we entertained ten guests at the Dormitory at dinner. This is an annual courtesy that we extend to the sneaker of the evening, the, class sponsor, principal, the County Superintendent and this year our local school board member, Mr. Fred Ingle, and their wives. Rev. Roy Reece of the Methodist Church in Sevierville gave the address, and Mr. Seaton presented the diplomas. Awards were given the outstanding students by the American Legion, the P.T.A. and the Director of the school. P.T.A. The revenue from Bingo games was not as much as in former years so the organization has operated on a curtailed budget. Additional revenue came from three rummage sales that brought in three hundred and forty dollars. One hundred of this amount was used for the elementary school library. The other main project has been the operation of the school lunch room. The old coal range was replaced with an electric one. The Lions and Rotary Clubs each gave a hundred dollars towards this project. In order to qualify for federal and state funds the lunch room had to be enlarged and improved. This involved turning.1 store room into a dining room and the building of storage shelves in the kitchen. Where so many children ride the school bus, leaving home at an early hour and sometimes not getting home until late, the hot lunch program is a great asset to a school. We are fortunate in having a group of interested people who will spend the time and energy to carry on a hot lunch programsuccessfully. Many free Iwslches are given during the year to children who cannot afford the daily twenty-five cent cost. The last payment was made on the large Hobart electric mixer that was purchased last year. City water was turned into the system in the fall. Dormitory We started the school year with three new girls and four boys. The boys were like the ten little Indians for now we have none ! Two found that they had to work at home, one enlisted in the air corps and the fourth one I had to send home since he would not obey rules. The number of girls increased to five during the year. I chaperoned them at Stuart until Lillian came in February. Most of the girls could not have a high school education if they did not live at the school. They are learning many things from working under Miss Hodgen and from their association with Lillian. Last winter, Arlie and Neal painted the interior of Stuart. Tina designed some new curtains for the house, Miss Hodgen wove the yardage and Mrs. Jones made them up. We bought new bedspreads and think the house is most attractive. The school family has been smaller than usual this year. We were glad to have Mr. Granitz board with us until his wife could be released from her position and they established their home in an apartment up in the Assembly grounds. Mr. Schoolfield, one of the student teachers, lived at the school for the six weeks that his group was in town. Two piano teachers have used Stuart as a piano studio. Their private pupils came over from school during school hours for their lessons. Health Center The year has been a busy one with the health center having been put to many uses. Many lives have been touched and helped by the services offered by our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, and the facilities of our health program. The State Mobile T.B. Unit used the Health Center for three clinics held during the year. Last summer two pre-school clinics were held in the building. One of these was for the rural children who were brought in for their examinations in the school bus. Some of the mothers came along when the children were shy. After days in school, when the nurse is found to be a friend in need this shyness wears off and all their cuts and bruises are taken to the nurse as a matter of course. Three rural schools are serviced by our nurse as well as the five hundred children in the school here. On Friday afternoon there is a well baby and pre-natal clinic for anyone interested. Marjorie has been active in plans for Civilian Defense and Community Health in case of bombings. Gatlinburg is not thought to be a likely target but might be used as a center to care for wounded from other areas such as Oak Ridge or Alcoa. Marjorie was chosen to represent Sevier County at a short course given by the Knoxville Red Cross Chapter in nursing in atomic cases. She has held classes in First Aid for 'Girl Scouts and now has a weekly class for some of the American Legion Auxiliary members. We have again been helped in our work by Sigma Phi Gamma International Sorority. Their national organization gave us $87.00 and several chapters have added THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 to that with gifts of money and supplies. The Ponca City, Oklahoma chapter sent ten dollars that Marjorie used for necessary x-rays for a needy boy. Other than that the money sent was used for eye corrections and helped to pay for glasses for a number of children who could not otherwise have afforded them. Seattle and Pendleton, Oregon, chapters sent gifts of $25.00 each. Among our own chapters and clubs, a check for $14.00 from May L. Keller Alumni Club of Richmond was sent for pictures to show dental care. New eye and ear charts were purchased from a five dollar check that Mrs. T. C. Bowles from Glendale, California, sent in memory of Louise Spalding Malin. The Westchester Alumnx Club have made layettes for us, a very much appreciated gift. Babies are a never failing crop in the mountains! The farmer is always at the mercy of the weather. We can do nothing about it but prepare for sudden changes and make the best of conditions. Our new modern chicken houses paid off well during an especially cold winter. We were about the only people around who had any eggs and commanded excellent prices from the Mountain View Hotel and Carl's Market as well as having all we needed for the kitchen. We keep a few pigs and still have our two old mules. They are useful for getting wood down from the hills and are rented out to local people who want small plowing jobs done. Richard Watson cares for our livestock and garden. He takes pride in having fine chickens, eggs, and vegetables for our table as well as flowers to deck the shop. On Sunday he is the minister in the little Glades Church. Arrow Craft Shop Business at Arrow Craft has gone along as usual. Mrs. Snow filled larger orders and more of them for alumnae clubs and active chapters than ever before. Mrs. McCutchan operated the shop in the Mountain View Hotel, suiting her hours for keeping open to the time that most of the guests would be in the lobby. Two important changes in personnel have occurred during the year. The first one was when Lura Owenby Porter left on January first to establish her home in Kentucky with her doctor husband. She had been with the shop for 16 years and knew the weavers and their families very well. They all co-operated with Mrs. McMorran and the girls in the shop to make the annual Christmas party of the Weavers a memorable farewell one for her. It was held at Stuart with refreshments served at Pollard. A lovely electric mixer was the gift that was presented to her by the group. Wanda Ogle moved from the selling end to production and has worked out well as a helper for Mrs. McMorran. The second change came June first when Hattie Trentham left the shop to devote her time to the operation of her tourist facilities. She was greatly missed but Margaret Ogle, a graduate of the school and daughter of Mertie who was our laundress for years, took that position. Tina has worked out some lovely new designs that will be in the next price list. These include a mother and daughter apron set, a party apron with metallic threads, several new towels in colored linen and a pure white one, seamless bags, a formal luncheon set in white and silver, wool dirndl skirts and some new scarfs. A recognition of the quality of the weavings produced and sold by the shop came recently when the Tennessee Education Association asked us to supply them with a small exhibit for the Tennessee headquarters room at the National Education Association to be held in San Francisco this summer. Since this is the only craft exhibit to be shown, we feel honored that our school was chosen to represent the state at this important meeting. Other Uses for Our Buildings and Grounds In addition to the school being used for church services, several other outside events made use of our facilities. Our own Workshop in Crafts should not be called "outside" for it is sponsored jointly by us and the University of Tennessee. All of our equipment, plus much from the University, is used to make that project a success. Last summer marked the sixth annual Workshop. Students came from twenty-five states, including quite a number from Tennessee. New Mexico was the most remote but ,Texas also was rep-resented. The class of work done by the students was exceptionally high. Two Open House evenings were held, one at the close of each half session. Over three hundred guests came at the last evening, to watch the demonstrations ' and to see the lovely pieces of jewelry, metal work, pottery and weaving that had been made during .the Workshop. We were glad to have a Pi Phi weaving teacher and two graduate assistants as well as several Pi Phi representatives among the students. For the third consecutive year the Craftsman's Fair of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild was held on our grounds. Financially, it was the most successful one ever held for instead of being in the red there was a profit of $4,000.00. Seventy-eight individuals and centers were represented in the exhibits which were beautifully displayed in the high school building. There were 103 demonstrators working at 22 different crafts. The folk dancing and ballad singing exhibitions were always well attended and when there was audience participation the stage was taxed to accommodate the crowds. Demonstrators and Dancers were housed in our Workshop dormitories. Another activity of the summer was that of the Gateway Stock Company engagement. Mr. Richards brought young students from the N. Y. Academy of Dramatic Arts and gave a repertoire of plays five nights a week. Our Auditorium serves as the theater and a class room is used for dressing rooms by making a division in the center of it. This does not work too well, especially in wet weather for there is no inside passageway. On Friday nights the P.T.A. sponsored their Bingo games. In November a Folk Festival sponsored by the Council of Southern Mountain Workers was held at the school. This marked quite an advance in that the School Board voted to allow the dancing to be held in a school that receives County funds. Reviewing the events of this busy year, I am again mindful of the wonderful cooperation that I have received from the local staff, Grand Council, and the members of the Settlement School Committee. I wish to express appreciation and thanks to our members who have sent gifts to the school for they help to bring pleasure to so many and give us the joy of representing them in giving. The contacts with visiting Pi Phis have been pleasant.

        4. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW for the paint and both teachers and students volunteered their services in the cause of beautification. A special mention goes to the P.T.A. for its leader-ship in the best interests of the school. Sufficient funds were raised to enlarge and continue. the operation of the school lunch room where, with government aid, hot lunches are offered daily. These are particularly important to the youngsters who arrive by bus at such early hours. Some of them deposit the youngsters on the school grounds before seven in the morning. The P.T.A. also contributed toward the improvement of the elementary school library. Pi Beta Phi is proud of its staff and the effort each makes for the school and the community. One teacher sponsors the Beta club (two drove a group to the state convention at Nashville this spring) ; another is a Girl Scout leader; others are class sponsors; others are helpful in transportation of teams for sport events or in case of illness. Each makes her personal contribution to her, or his, church as well as to community developments. The demands upon their time some-times seem out of proportion. Miss Dyer is doing a very competent work as Director. Since February we have enjoyed having Lillian Hansen, Kansas Beta, as Assistant to the Director and she has stepped nicely into her new responsibilities. She chaperons the dormitory girls in Stuart Cottage as one of her duties. Last year all our girls finished high school and we have had five new girls learning a great deal under the tutelage of Miss Hodgen, our House Manager. There have been no school boys staying with us this year but already the applications of several are at hand. The dormitory system provides girls and boys who live far away or beyond the bus line, a chance for education with less difficulty and gives us the benefit of their help a few hours a week in part payment for their board and room. We could not maintain our school through fair or foul weather were it not for our Maintenance man, Arlie Watson who needs no introduction after his recent feature in the ARROW. His son Neal ably assists him as does Preacher Richard Watson when the Pi Phi farm is not requiring his attention. Our live stock, namely the pigs, two old mules and the chickens, are the responsibility of Richard and he takes great pride in the abundance of fresh eggs, chickens and the vegetables served at our table. This past year Teachers' Cottage was brightened with lovely new living room drapes, designed and hand-woven by Tina McMorran, our weaving de-signer. In like manner the bedrooms of Stuart Cottage were made more attractive with new curtains de-signed by Tina, woven by Miss Hodgen, made by Mrs. Jones the cook and with the addition of new spreads. Stuart and Pollard were lightened with some interior painting and during the coming year Stuart, Pollard, Teachers' Cottage and the Red Barn all will require exterior coats of paint. As announced at the 1950 Convention, plans for a new Staff House move steadily forward but not too swiftly. At present the architect is working on the detail drawings and specifications and we hope it will be started in the early fall. This building will give more comfortable quarters for the all-year staff and will provide additional housing for the Summer Workshop, a very important factor in future plans. Closely linked with the school program and vital to the community through health education is our Jennie Nicol Health Center presided over by Marjorie Chalmers, R.N. This year like all others has been a busy one. Perhaps the simplest means of showing the activity is a list of the type of work done these past twelve months.

Pre-school clinics were held with the cooperation of the local doctors and the path between grade school and Health Center is well worn by visits for various ailtnents, poison ivy being the greatest, or for first aid in case of minor accidents. Friday afternoons are given to a well baby or pre-natal clinic where the shy babies, sometimes brought by an older sister, are comforted after a shot by a toy sup-plied from the Pi Phi gifts sent there. In addition to our own school, the health cif the rural school children is also looked after, both through their visits to the Health Center and by Marjorie in regular calls at the school-houses, weather permitting. From the Division of Tuberculosis Control, the mobile trucks came to our Center several times this year. Some stops were for regular check-ups and others for food handlers and public survey. A total of 1,425 were x-rayed. Three children were sent to the Crippled Children's Clinic in Knoxville, two to be re-fitted with braces and the other, victim of spastic paralysis, received a light wheel chair, purchased with contributions from neighbors and friends. Marjorie has assisted the Scouts by holding First Aid classes and assisting in examinations and inocula--tions before the exodus to caitisps. She was chosen to represent Sevier County at a short course in nursing atomic cases given by the Knoxville chapter of the Red Cross. She has also aided the local doctors and the Citizens' Council in planning for Civilian Defense and Community Health in case of bombings. Outside the general line of duty our nurse has faithfully written a gratuitous health column for the weekly newspaper wherein she gives many good precautionary hints and sage health advice to the reading public. Her frequent invitations to talk before outside organizations speaks well for her place in the nursing profession. Her faith in the part our Health Center plays in the better health of school and community spurs her on to greater deeds. We appreciate the continued interest of Sigma Phi Gamma, International Sorority, which through its "service for mountain children" fund has .made possible both x-ray and eye correction with new glasses for those unable to pay. Several of the separate chapters have become interested and have sent supplies or special funds whereby new strip films and slides for educational purposes could be purchased. The Pi Phi Richmond, Virginia alumina club sent fourteen dollars with which pictures to show dental care were bought and five dollars sent by Mrs. T. C. Bowles in memory of Louise Spalding Malin were used for new ear and eye charts. The layettes provided by the Westchester Alum= Club are so very welcome as are the separate donations to the loan closet. Arrowcraft is another very important part of the Pi Beta Phi School. Through their orders to Arrowcraft SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 Pi Phis everywhere are in direct touch with the School and if they visit the shop, want to hear all about the rest of our development. The visual evidences of the beautiful products cannot fail to make them cognizant of our crafts relations in the Smokies. Ethel M. Snow, our competent manager, has filled many orders to clubs and chapters this past year while at the same time local sales at the shop have been larger. She, and the Committee as well, appreciate the more business-like approach with orders and the prompter settlement of accounts. Some day perhaps all clubs and individuals will realize they must not demand greater credit leniency from Pi Beta Phi than from any other merchant with whom they trade and will awaken to the fact that a good credit rating in Pi Beta Phi is wise, too. From year to year usually the same clubs are -best sellers" but this year two things were proven: one, that a new untouched territory presents a great field and little sales resistance; two, that a small new club, with enthusiasm and effort can aspire to high sales rank. The Coos Bay, Oregon club, newly organized and small, sold .$1,916.Oo worth of Arrow_ craft products, standing second only to Champaign, Illinois, again first. Eleven clubs topped the one thou-sand dollar mark in sales: Portland, Oregon; Pitts-burgh, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Houston, Texas ; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Madison, Wisconsin; Eugene, Oregon and Northern New Jersey. Tina McMorran, weaving designer has given us some beautiful new designs, gorgeous in coloring, ready for the new price list. To picture all articles would make the price list prohibitive and much must be left to faith in past production. There have been steep advances in cotton and linen threads which will mean a change in some of the articles woven and such old stand-bys as the white under arm bag will be missing. However the new things such as party aprons with metallic threads, seamless bags, a new formal luncheon set, new stoles, new linen and other towels, a new wool dirndl, all will take their places most satisfyingly.. The wool dirndl skirts started a year ago now total more than six hundred-forty-three sold and are still in demand. Of interest to those who dislike taxes is the newly designed dressy bag with a woven-in-handle, which will be tax free. The quality of our weaving is above criticism at all times. But a recognition of it came this spring when we were asked by the Tennessee Educational Association to provide a small exhibit for Tennessee's room at the national meeting of the N. E. in San Francisco this summer, It is the only craft exhibit to be shown. We would give special mention to Mrs. McCutchan who handles the little shop in the Mountain View Hotel in Gatlinburg so ably, accommodating her time there to the convenience of her patrons, be the hour early or late. Also to one who has much to do with the success of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Eunice Cole without whose skill at figures both you and we would be in difficulty! Perhaps she would like it said here to those officers whose clubs have paid nothing on their Arrow-craft indebtedness that they ask them to explain the valid reason for such an oversight or investigate for themselves the reasons wherefore. We regretted losing Lura Owenby Porter, who had been with Arrowcraft for sixteen years, when she left to join her husband in Kentucky and also Hattie Trentham when she found family business interests required her resignation. Wanda Ogle from the sales department stepped into the position of assistant weaving designer under Tina and Mrs. Snow has takenon two new sales girls, Reba Owenby and Margaret Ogle. Edna Cook is now the Senior sales girl and assists Mrs. Snow in filling both mail orders and shop sales with discriminating care. Of interest is the fact that Margaret Ogle's mother was one of our faithful weavers for many years. During the year we lost another long-time weaver, Mollie Moore, when her family moved to a farm near Knoxville. She had been with Arrowcraft almost from the beginning and had woven only Whig Rose mats and runners for about sixteen years. For the first time in three years the Committee arranged its annual meeting to coincide with the Summer Workshop session and was immensely proud of what it saw. The few thousand dollars budgeted each year toward this particular craft development is one of our most necessary expenditures. For the seventh summer Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee have planned this Workshop in Weaving, Pottery, jewelry Making, Textile Decoration and Metal Work. The consensus of opinion was that this was the most successful session to date, and Miss Jessie W. Harris, head of U. T. College of Home Economics, who had not seen the Workshop for two years because of being in Europe was most enthusiastic on her visit this summer. Pi Beta Phi is fortunate that the University will lend Miss Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design each year to head the Workshop as she is exceedingly well liked and skilled. The school buildings are transformed to make way for the Workshop and all of our equipment and much from the University is in use. Twenty-six states were represented among the students and staff this summer. Some of the students remain fo? the full six weeks, others for three weeks only and some are studying for credit while others for recreation. There were six Pi Phis among this summer's students and many other Pi Phis could avail themselves of this opportunity. The enrollment of necessity is limited because of lack of enough housing facilities and the individual classes are also restricted for no instructor can do justice with a teaching overload. There is no age limitation and this summer there have been two bright young ninety and almost ninety year olds. Each term concludes with an Open House where the results of the three weeks' study are artistically displayed and each pupil demonstrates her particular craft. In addition to the work accomplished there is time for picnicking and other recreation and trips to nearby Craft centers are arranged. This year all went by bus to Asheville, North Carolina to attend the Craftsman's Fair, previously held on the Pi Phi Green in Gatlinburg but this year moved to North Carolina. The Fair was held in the Civic Auditorium and had an attendance of 8,600 for the four days. Pi Beta Phi sent over a loom, set up with a bag warp in bright colors upon which Tina McMorran and her assistant wove. They also took their warping bars for purposes of demonstration. There were exhibits of various craft making as well as a salesroom where all the crafts had their wares on hand for sale. In a smaller fashion there will be a local Crafts Fair on our grounds in late September when the forty-eight governors of the United States with those of Alaska, Guam and Hawaii convene for their annual conference. Each Governor is permitted to have a party of six and the Fair is just one event planned for their entertainment. Pi Beta Phi is hoping that many National Panhellenic members will be among the ladies in the group to whom can be shown the project about which they have so often heard our School. Again this year the Gateway Players under the 50 THE SEP m ki ER ARK() v. direction of Mr. John Richards of the New York Academy . of Dramatic Arts are making use of the school auditorium as a theatre. With an excellent cast of young players they are presenting leading plays as entertainment for vacation visitors. These players from New York are gaining experience for Broadway parts and at the same time enjoying a type of living in the mountains, far different than that to which they are accustomed. There is tremendous satisfaction in hearing that the general contributions of both alumnae clubs and active chapters to the Settlement School show an in-crease over the 1949-50 figures. Just as one's personal living costs have mounted, so must the Settlement School Committee provide for possible increasing expenses in its budget; therefore the added donations are particularly appreciated. The St. Louis club continues to give its receipts from the big summer fashion show and thereby, with its thousand dollar contribution, ranks first among alumnae club contributors. Then follow Philadelphia ($527.00); Cleveland East ($345.00); Milwaukee ($250.00); Pittsburgh ($225.00) ; Indianapolis ($210.00) ; Denver ($200.00). Among active chapters, honors go to: Maryland Alpha ($1,000.00 balance from its chapter treasury); Missouri Beta ($125.00) ; Nebraska Beta ($106.10) ; Texas Alpha ($100.00). Every contribution from one dollar upwards is important and valued for the spirit which prompted it; together, the ones and fives and seventy-fives make a good showing where much is needed. As interest increases, particularly among active chapters, so will our project broaden in scope. To have the clubs of four provinces and the chapters of seven, one hundred percent is good but not good enough. What a tribute, for the fortieth anniversary of the opening of the Settlement School next year to have every club and chapter a contributor ! The check from the Central Office Magazine Agency for $8,770.57 was happily received. Your continuance as informed Pi Phis through the reading of current magazines is urged along with your giving your own and your neighbors' subscriptions to those magazines to the Pi Beta Phi agency. For the second year the Franklin Magazine Agency returned as a gift to the school, the check sent them for the school magazine subscriptions. This came as an acknowledgement of the large business Pi Phi has given them through the years. This year we shall have a new printing of the Cook Book. It had been said that an entirely new book might be advisable but after considering the large amount of time, effort and expense involved in gathering new recipes, and the continued popularity of our present edition, it was decided to arrange for a re-print. The Memorial Fund provides a satisfying medium for an expression of sympathy in the loss of a friend or dear one. The donor may state where or how she wishes the money used or may leave its distribution to the wise discretion of the Committee. In the case of a bequest, the Settlement School Treasurer should be contacted for the proper legal form. The many boxes of toys, clothing, books, fruit and candy, in addition to the extra checks at Christmas time are always welcome. They provide a special gift of game or book for each grade school room and an individual gift to each child in our grade school and those of the three nearest rural schools. The staff, too, has enjoyed and appreciated the thoughtfulness of some clubs, chapters and single Pi Phis in sending them special remembrances. It is wonderful when Pi Phis remember those in Gatlinburg who work for Pi Phi objectives in Tennessee. There are Pi Phis who remain uncertain of the values to the fraternity in a continuation of our pro-gram in Tennessee. What would be our program if we did pull away? Where would the fraternity receive greater satisfaction in any undertaking (nor more recognition) than its health program, its continued encouragement of native arts and crafts and its supplemental help in education ? Because of the fast development of the tourist travel to Smoky Mountain National Park, the town has lost some of its natural charm; the residents themselves are concerned. One of our province officers after being in Gatlinburg for the first time wrote that she was not disappointed in the School but in the town. Not seeing anything of the mountains nor the mountaineers, it was a little hard, from the appearance of the main street, to under-stand the need for our School there. Fortunately for her peace of mind, her husband and her boys had time for some investigating and could explain what conditions were off the main street. For example, when one realizes that open ditches still carry sewage--and not far from our School and the main street, too--one knows that all the public health problems have not been solved. The same holds true for education. Some newcomers to the town fail to see the need for Pi Beta Phi in the school but they have not attempted nor succeeded in getting the necessary help from the County Court. County funds are not available for other construction in Gatlinburg now, though all should be proud of the modern new grade school building in use this year. There will be no County nurse next year which will make the load for our Health Center still heavier. As the County or city proves its ability to accomplish its own proper development, Pi Beta Phi will gladly step into other fields. Obviously the time is not yet. The Committee experienced very special pleasure during its annual meeting in having both the Grand Council and the Province officers in Gatlinburg for a part of the time. First hand visual education surpasses word description. Both from the comments at the time and correspondence since, we have learned that the officers really saw that our project is worthy of fraternity interest and support. At our Committee meeting we missed the presence and help of Harriet Rauch, detained at home because of her mother's illness. She will continue to handle the News of Little Pigeon and other publicity. Ethel Smith will again serve as Secretary and will be consultant on the school library. Nellis Gibson will handle the circulation of our films the new, the old, and the Workshop films are all available. The Treasurer's books for the School are again in the hands of Olivia Smith Moore. The work of the Committee is heavy and the distribution of some of the responsibility among four others lightens the load for the chairman. She is appreciative of all that each one does and all of us are grateful for the assistance from Grand Council, particularly the help of our contact member, Miss Onken. We also recognize the immeasurable help of the other officers in their contacts with each club and chapter. "Our shadow, our influence may fall where we may never be !" The Committee is conscious of this truth as it surveys the help of all the many alumnae and actives whose faith in the Settlement School is manifested in their constant support and their continued interest. A simple deed may mean a bettered life; a single act may mean greater happiness for some child; a contribution, large or small, can mean continued success and progress in Gatlinburg. RUTH BARRETT SMITH THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1951 51 THE PAST YEAR has been the busiest one that I have spent in Gatlinburg. After Nancy Holmes left the first of August, I had no help until February first when Lillian Hansen, Kansas 13, came to work at the school. She has been efficient. and helpful and has already made a place for herself in the school and in the town. Besides her work at the school she has undertaken the leadership of and Girl Scout Troop and is secretary of the P.T.A. and of the Episcopal Auxiliary. Community Building in this rapidly rowing, town never stops. The winter and bad weather conditions slow things down but with the first hint of spring a fever of activity breaks out in order to have accommodations ready for the opening of the season. The Baptist congregation razed their old church and are now building a new and much larger structure on the same site. It is built of Crab Orchard stone and wood and is rather modern in design. A small field stone church has been built up in the Airport field by the Episcopalians. It is attractive and will be more so when it is fully completed. .Some new furnishings and a pipe organ have been added to the new Methodist church which is now practically complete. Another improvement to the churches of the town has been at the Roaring Fork church where they have new pews and an acre of ground purchased for a parking lot. A site has been purchased for a Catholic church. The First National Bank of Gatlinburg opened March first. It is located in the Maples building and provides the town with up to date banking facilities. Numerous tourist businesses have been built and old ones changed and improved. The Mountain View has done some extensive interior remodeling and the Edgepark Inn has been enlarged and converted into a modern Motel. A coffee shop in the basement is one of the new eating places that have sprung up all over town. The Chamber of Commerce and tourist bureau have been merged. and Mr. Bart Leeper hired as the Secretary. He is bringing much advertising to the area in national magazines and papers and is organizing and promoting several conventions. Chief of these will be the annual Conference of the Governors which meets in Gatlinburg in late September, 1951. Union church services on Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter were held. The annual party for the benefit of the village library brought entertainment to, the local people and a sense of working together for a common good. School The school year has been marked by important beginnings and changes in several phases of the pro-gram. For the first time all grades were placed under the direction of one man. Mr. Walter Ogle did no teaching but served as principal of the high school and superintended the work in the elementary school. A business course was introduced and typing and bookkeeping taught to juniors and seniors. Two type-writers were given as a parting gift by last year's graduating class, the P.T.A. purchased eight and Sevier County the other ten. The boys in the wood working class constructed some of the necessary tables. Another first was the football team. The county hired a coach who organized and coached the first Pi Phi football team. A group of interested Gatlinburg citizens organized the Gatlinburg Athletic Associationand collected $1,100.00 for necessary uniforms and equipment. The boys really did very well. In their eight game schedule they won three games and lost five. The new elementary building, built by the County on land donated by us, was not ready for occupancy until November first. Until that time conditions through the school were very unsatisfactory and crowded but after the first four grades were moved into their lovely new quarters much confusion was eliminated. For the first time we participated in a program with the University of Tennessee Department of Education, whereby thirteen senior students did their practice teaching in our school system during the winter quarter. This group brought fresh enthusiasm and new ideas to the school. The University, the community and the school were well satisfied with results of the experiment. Since the first of October the high school building has served as headquarters for the Baptist congregation for Sunday and mid-week services while their new church is under construction. Up to the seventh grade the teaching has been well done and the school has run smoothly. An at-tempt was made to departmentalize the seventh and eighth grades but this did not work out. The teachers that had been hired were not certificated properly for the work; the seventh grade teacher was out of school almost a month on account of illness and was very weak in discipline. A substitute was hired to take his work while he was ill and was retained to teach half of the grade when it was decided necessary to divide the grade into two sections. The grade has been a problem all year and will take skillful handling next year. Kelly Huskey again taught the eighth grade. He did some nice work with the ;unior girls and boys basketball teams and contributed to their success in winning many games. In the high school there were several changes in the faculty. Mrs. Lighter was on leave of absence for one year from the English and library position and while the person who replaced her did her best, the school missed the stability and good judgement Mrs. Lighter has always contributed. Our coach of last year. Wm. J. Miracle, was recalled to army service just before school opened. We were able to secure the services of Mr. Hartford Granitz from the University of Chattanooga who has filled the position well. He assisted with the football program by helping Mr. Levelling with the back field coaching. His basketball season was not too successful, due to inexperienced players. Even with the changes and additions mentioned, the school has not been quite up to other years. Furnace failures and poor janitor services were unnecessary handicaps. The confusion resulting from the delayed completion of the new building,. poor discipline, and some poor teaching, have all contributed to this result. The usual Halloween Carnival came of and the junior and Senior classes gave plays. The big Christmas program was much curtailed on account of furnace failures prohibiting rehearsals. The younger children all had room parties where there were gift exchanges and in the lower grades, the presents that were sent by Pi Phi active and Alumnae Clubs. Mrs. Armstrong varied her custom of presenting the grade school children in an operetta by giving a Patriotic Pageant. While this did not use as many children it was colorful and timely. Both the basketball and football teams were feted at banquets and the juniors entertained the seniors at their annual affair. 52 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Several new pieces of equipment were added during the year: one electric sewing machine for the home economics department and a new mimeograph for the use of the teachers. After the new building was occupied, one of the vacant class rooms was fitted up for visual education and another room served for the Girl Scouts. Mr. Granitz .and his boys constructed a shed as an addition to the gymnasium dressing rooms from old materials secured from the Baptist Church. Some necessary repairs and painting were accomplished during the year by a cooperative effort of the Fraternity, which gave $200.00 to repairing the gym and hall with new plywood in the broken spots and labor for some painting. The County paid for the paint used and the students and teachers did some painting. At the Craft Shop there was a complete re-decorating of the Art room which was planned by Marilyn Jones and one of the student teachers. The girls enlisted the aid of their friends and worked long hours themselves. It has been quite the style to get the rooms freshened up. All of the class rooms and the hall in the elementary building were repainted and a number of the ones in the high school building. The roof of the old elementary building was finally painted after a wait of three years. For the second year the Franklin Square Magazine Agency returned the check that was sent to pay for the school magazine subscriptions. This check for $68.50 was a gift from them in recognition of the Pi Phi business during the years. Other gifts have been made by Alumnae Clubs and individuals in the form of books to the library. We have added several fine reference books which are memorials to Pi Phis. Commencement events went off well in the dignified manner that I think is a great credit to the school. First, for the Seniors, was their trip. This year the class and sponsors went to Florida on a circle tour for five days. It is always a highlight of the four years of school. We hold no exercises for the eighth grade but they did present a little play on Friday evening before the last week of school. Dr. Tames Wilder gave the Baccalaureate address in the Methodist Church. This was another first for the new pipe organ provided the instrumental music and was used to accompany the glee club girls when they sang. On Class night the alas and gowns were replaced with pretty formals for the girls and neat suits for the boys of the class of twenty-one. Before the Commencement pro-gram we entertained ten guests at the Dormitory at dinner. This is an annual courtesy that we extend to the sneaker of the evening, the, class sponsor, principal, the County Superintendent and this year our local school board member, Mr. Fred Ingle, and their wives. Rev. Roy Reece of the Methodist Church in Sevierville gave the address, and Mr. Seaton presented the diplomas. Awards were given the outstanding students by the American Legion, the P.T.A. and the Director of the school. P.T.A. The revenue from Bingo games was not as much as in former years so the organization has operated on a curtailed budget. Additional revenue came from three rummage sales that brought in three hundred and forty dollars. One hundred of this amount was used for the elementary school library. The other main project has been the operation of the school lunch room. The old coal range was replaced with an electric one. The Lions and Rotary Clubs each gave a hundred dollars towards this project. In order to qualify for federal and state funds the lunch room had to be enlarged and improved. This involved turning.1 store room into a dining room and the building of storage shelves in the kitchen. Where so many children ride the school bus, leaving home at an early hour and sometimes not getting home until late, the hot lunch program is a great asset to a school. We are fortunate in having a group of interested people who will spend the time and energy to carry on a hot lunch programsuccessfully. Many free Iwslches are given during the year to children who cannot afford the daily twenty-five cent cost. The last payment was made on the large Hobart electric mixer that was purchased last year. City water was turned into the system in the fall. Dormitory We started the school year with three new girls and four boys. The boys were like the ten little Indians for now we have none ! Two found that they had to work at home, one enlisted in the air corps and the fourth one I had to send home since he would not obey rules. The number of girls increased to five during the year. I chaperoned them at Stuart until Lillian came in February. Most of the girls could not have a high school education if they did not live at the school. They are learning many things from working under Miss Hodgen and from their association with Lillian. Last winter, Arlie and Neal painted the interior of Stuart. Tina designed some new curtains for the house, Miss Hodgen wove the yardage and Mrs. Jones made them up. We bought new bedspreads and think the house is most attractive. The school family has been smaller than usual this year. We were glad to have Mr. Granitz board with us until his wife could be released from her position and they established their home in an apartment up in the Assembly grounds. Mr. Schoolfield, one of the student teachers, lived at the school for the six weeks that his group was in town. Two piano teachers have used Stuart as a piano studio. Their private pupils came over from school during school hours for their lessons. Health Center The year has been a busy one with the health center having been put to many uses. Many lives have been touched and helped by the services offered by our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, and the facilities of our health program. The State Mobile T.B. Unit used the Health Center for three clinics held during the year. Last summer two pre-school clinics were held in the building. One of these was for the rural children who were brought in for their examinations in the school bus. Some of the mothers came along when the children were shy. After days in school, when the nurse is found to be a friend in need this shyness wears off and all their cuts and bruises are taken to the nurse as a matter of course. Three rural schools are serviced by our nurse as well as the five hundred children in the school here. On Friday afternoon there is a well baby and pre-natal clinic for anyone interested. Marjorie has been active in plans for Civilian Defense and Community Health in case of bombings. Gatlinburg is not thought to be a likely target but might be used as a center to care for wounded from other areas such as Oak Ridge or Alcoa. Marjorie was chosen to represent Sevier County at a short course given by the Knoxville Red Cross Chapter in nursing in atomic cases. She has held classes in First Aid for 'Girl Scouts and now has a weekly class for some of the American Legion Auxiliary members. We have again been helped in our work by Sigma Phi Gamma International Sorority. Their national organization gave us $87.00 and several chapters have added THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 to that with gifts of money and supplies. The Ponca City, Oklahoma chapter sent ten dollars that Marjorie used for necessary x-rays for a needy boy. Other than that the money sent was used for eye corrections and helped to pay for glasses for a number of children who could not otherwise have afforded them. Seattle and Pendleton, Oregon, chapters sent gifts of $25.00 each. Among our own chapters and clubs, a check for $14.00 from May L. Keller Alumni Club of Richmond was sent for pictures to show dental care. New eye and ear charts were purchased from a five dollar check that Mrs. T. C. Bowles from Glendale, California, sent in memory of Louise Spalding Malin. The Westchester Alumnx Club have made layettes for us, a very much appreciated gift. Babies are a never failing crop in the mountains! The farmer is always at the mercy of the weather. We can do nothing about it but prepare for sudden changes and make the best of conditions. Our new modern chicken houses paid off well during an especially cold winter. We were about the only people around who had any eggs and commanded excellent prices from the Mountain View Hotel and Carl's Market as well as having all we needed for the kitchen. We keep a few pigs and still have our two old mules. They are useful for getting wood down from the hills and are rented out to local people who want small plowing jobs done. Richard Watson cares for our livestock and garden. He takes pride in having fine chickens, eggs, and vegetables for our table as well as flowers to deck the shop. On Sunday he is the minister in the little Glades Church. Arrow Craft Shop Business at Arrow Craft has gone along as usual. Mrs. Snow filled larger orders and more of them for alumnae clubs and active chapters than ever before. Mrs. McCutchan operated the shop in the Mountain View Hotel, suiting her hours for keeping open to the time that most of the guests would be in the lobby. Two important changes in personnel have occurred during the year. The first one was when Lura Owenby Porter left on January first to establish her home in Kentucky with her doctor husband. She had been with the shop for 16 years and knew the weavers and their families very well. They all co-operated with Mrs. McMorran and the girls in the shop to make the annual Christmas party of the Weavers a memorable farewell one for her. It was held at Stuart with refreshments served at Pollard. A lovely electric mixer was the gift that was presented to her by the group. Wanda Ogle moved from the selling end to production and has worked out well as a helper for Mrs. McMorran. The second change came June first when Hattie Trentham left the shop to devote her time to the operation of her tourist facilities. She was greatly missed but Margaret Ogle, a graduate of the school and daughter of Mertie who was our laundress for years, took that position. Tina has worked out some lovely new designs that will be in the next price list. These include a mother and daughter apron set, a party apron with metallic threads, several new towels in colored linen and a pure white one, seamless bags, a formal luncheon set in white and silver, wool dirndl skirts and some new scarfs. A recognition of the quality of the weavings produced and sold by the shop came recently when the Tennessee Education Association asked us to supply them with a small exhibit for the Tennessee headquarters room at the National Education Association to be held in San Francisco this summer. Since this is the only craft exhibit to be shown, we feel honored that our school was chosen to represent the state at this important meeting. Other Uses for Our Buildings and Grounds In addition to the school being used for church services, several other outside events made use of our facilities. Our own Workshop in Crafts should not be called "outside" for it is sponsored jointly by us and the University of Tennessee. All of our equipment, plus much from the University, is used to make that project a success. Last summer marked the sixth annual Workshop. Students came from twenty-five states, including quite a number from Tennessee. New Mexico was the most remote but ,Texas also was rep-resented. The class of work done by the students was exceptionally high. Two Open House evenings were held, one at the close of each half session. Over three hundred guests came at the last evening, to watch the demonstrations ' and to see the lovely pieces of jewelry, metal work, pottery and weaving that had been made during .the Workshop. We were glad to have a Pi Phi weaving teacher and two graduate assistants as well as several Pi Phi representatives among the students. For the third consecutive year the Craftsman's Fair of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild was held on our grounds. Financially, it was the most successful one ever held for instead of being in the red there was a profit of $4,000.00. Seventy-eight individuals and centers were represented in the exhibits which were beautifully displayed in the high school building. There were 103 demonstrators working at 22 different crafts. The folk dancing and ballad singing exhibitions were always well attended and when there was audience participation the stage was taxed to accommodate the crowds. Demonstrators and Dancers were housed in our Workshop dormitories. Another activity of the summer was that of the Gateway Stock Company engagement. Mr. Richards brought young students from the N. Y. Academy of Dramatic Arts and gave a repertoire of plays five nights a week. Our Auditorium serves as the theater and a class room is used for dressing rooms by making a division in the center of it. This does not work too well, especially in wet weather for there is no inside passageway. On Friday nights the P.T.A. sponsored their Bingo games. In November a Folk Festival sponsored by the Council of Southern Mountain Workers was held at the school. This marked quite an advance in that the School Board voted to allow the dancing to be held in a school that receives County funds. Reviewing the events of this busy year, I am again mindful of the wonderful cooperation that I have received from the local staff, Grand Council, and the members of the Settlement School Committee. I wish to express appreciation and thanks to our members who have sent gifts to the school for they help to bring pleasure to so many and give us the joy of representing them in giving. The contacts with visiting Pi Phis have been pleasant.

        50 THE SEP m ki ER ARK() v. direction of Mr. John Richards of the New York Academy . of Dramatic Arts are making use of the school auditorium as a theatre. With an excellent cast of young players they are presenting leading plays as entertainment for vacation visitors. These players from New York are gaining experience for Broadway parts and at the same time enjoying a type of living in the mountains, far different than that to which they are accustomed. There is tremendous satisfaction in hearing that the general contributions of both alumnae clubs and active chapters to the Settlement School show an in-crease over the 1949-50 figures. Just as one's personal living costs have mounted, so must the Settlement School Committee provide for possible increasing expenses in its budget; therefore the added donations are particularly appreciated. The St. Louis club continues to give its receipts from the big summer fashion show and thereby, with its thousand dollar contribution, ranks first among alumnae club contributors. Then follow Philadelphia ($527.00); Cleveland East ($345.00); Milwaukee ($250.00); Pittsburgh ($225.00) ; Indianapolis ($210.00) ; Denver ($200.00). Among active chapters, honors go to: Maryland Alpha ($1,000.00 balance from its chapter treasury); Missouri Beta ($125.00) ; Nebraska Beta ($106.10) ; Texas Alpha ($100.00). Every contribution from one dollar upwards is important and valued for the spirit which prompted it; together, the ones and fives and seventy-fives make a good showing where much is needed. As interest increases, particularly among active chapters, so will our project broaden in scope. To have the clubs of four provinces and the chapters of seven, one hundred percent is good but not good enough. What a tribute, for the fortieth anniversary of the opening of the Settlement School next year to have every club and chapter a contributor ! The check from the Central Office Magazine Agency for $8,770.57 was happily received. Your continuance as informed Pi Phis through the reading of current magazines is urged along with your giving your own and your neighbors' subscriptions to those magazines to the Pi Beta Phi agency. For the second year the Franklin Magazine Agency returned as a gift to the school, the check sent them for the school magazine subscriptions. This came as an acknowledgement of the large business Pi Phi has given them through the years. This year we shall have a new printing of the Cook Book. It had been said that an entirely new book might be advisable but after considering the large amount of time, effort and expense involved in gathering new recipes, and the continued popularity of our present edition, it was decided to arrange for a re-print. The Memorial Fund provides a satisfying medium for an expression of sympathy in the loss of a friend or dear one. The donor may state where or how she wishes the money used or may leave its distribution to the wise discretion of the Committee. In the case of a bequest, the Settlement School Treasurer should be contacted for the proper legal form. The many boxes of toys, clothing, books, fruit and candy, in addition to the extra checks at Christmas time are always welcome. They provide a special gift of game or book for each grade school room and an individual gift to each child in our grade school and those of the three nearest rural schools. The staff, too, has enjoyed and appreciated the thoughtfulness of some clubs, chapters and single Pi Phis in sending them special remembrances. It is wonderful when Pi Phis remember those in Gatlinburg who work for Pi Phi objectives in Tennessee. There are Pi Phis who remain uncertain of the values to the fraternity in a continuation of our pro-gram in Tennessee. What would be our program if we did pull away? Where would the fraternity receive greater satisfaction in any undertaking (nor more recognition) than its health program, its continued encouragement of native arts and crafts and its supplemental help in education ? Because of the fast development of the tourist travel to Smoky Mountain National Park, the town has lost some of its natural charm; the residents themselves are concerned. One of our province officers after being in Gatlinburg for the first time wrote that she was not disappointed in the School but in the town. Not seeing anything of the mountains nor the mountaineers, it was a little hard, from the appearance of the main street, to under-stand the need for our School there. Fortunately for her peace of mind, her husband and her boys had time for some investigating and could explain what conditions were off the main street. For example, when one realizes that open ditches still carry sewage--and not far from our School and the main street, too--one knows that all the public health problems have not been solved. The same holds true for education. Some newcomers to the town fail to see the need for Pi Beta Phi in the school but they have not attempted nor succeeded in getting the necessary help from the County Court. County funds are not available for other construction in Gatlinburg now, though all should be proud of the modern new grade school building in use this year. There will be no County nurse next year which will make the load for our Health Center still heavier. As the County or city proves its ability to accomplish its own proper development, Pi Beta Phi will gladly step into other fields. Obviously the time is not yet. The Committee experienced very special pleasure during its annual meeting in having both the Grand Council and the Province officers in Gatlinburg for a part of the time. First hand visual education surpasses word description. Both from the comments at the time and correspondence since, we have learned that the officers really saw that our project is worthy of fraternity interest and support. At our Committee meeting we missed the presence and help of Harriet Rauch, detained at home because of her mother's illness. She will continue to handle the News of Little Pigeon and other publicity. Ethel Smith will again serve as Secretary and will be consultant on the school library. Nellis Gibson will handle the circulation of our films the new, the old, and the Workshop films are all available. The Treasurer's books for the School are again in the hands of Olivia Smith Moore. The work of the Committee is heavy and the distribution of some of the responsibility among four others lightens the load for the chairman. She is appreciative of all that each one does and all of us are grateful for the assistance from Grand Council, particularly the help of our contact member, Miss Onken. We also recognize the immeasurable help of the other officers in their contacts with each club and chapter. "Our shadow, our influence may fall where we may never be !" The Committee is conscious of this truth as it surveys the help of all the many alumnae and actives whose faith in the Settlement School is manifested in their constant support and their continued interest. A simple deed may mean a bettered life; a single act may mean greater happiness for some child; a contribution, large or small, can mean continued success and progress in Gatlinburg. RUTH BARRETT SMITH THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1951 51 THE PAST YEAR has been the busiest one that I have spent in Gatlinburg. After Nancy Holmes left the first of August, I had no help until February first when Lillian Hansen, Kansas 13, came to work at the school. She has been efficient. and helpful and has already made a place for herself in the school and in the town. Besides her work at the school she has undertaken the leadership of and Girl Scout Troop and is secretary of the P.T.A. and of the Episcopal Auxiliary. Community Building in this rapidly rowing, town never stops. The winter and bad weather conditions slow things down but with the first hint of spring a fever of activity breaks out in order to have accommodations ready for the opening of the season. The Baptist congregation razed their old church and are now building a new and much larger structure on the same site. It is built of Crab Orchard stone and wood and is rather modern in design. A small field stone church has been built up in the Airport field by the Episcopalians. It is attractive and will be more so when it is fully completed. .Some new furnishings and a pipe organ have been added to the new Methodist church which is now practically complete. Another improvement to the churches of the town has been at the Roaring Fork church where they have new pews and an acre of ground purchased for a parking lot. A site has been purchased for a Catholic church. The First National Bank of Gatlinburg opened March first. It is located in the Maples building and provides the town with up to date banking facilities. Numerous tourist businesses have been built and old ones changed and improved. The Mountain View has done some extensive interior remodeling and the Edgepark Inn has been enlarged and converted into a modern Motel. A coffee shop in the basement is one of the new eating places that have sprung up all over town. The Chamber of Commerce and tourist bureau have been merged. and Mr. Bart Leeper hired as the Secretary. He is bringing much advertising to the area in national magazines and papers and is organizing and promoting several conventions. Chief of these will be the annual Conference of the Governors which meets in Gatlinburg in late September, 1951. Union church services on Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter were held. The annual party for the benefit of the village library brought entertainment to, the local people and a sense of working together for a common good. School The school year has been marked by important beginnings and changes in several phases of the pro-gram. For the first time all grades were placed under the direction of one man. Mr. Walter Ogle did no teaching but served as principal of the high school and superintended the work in the elementary school. A business course was introduced and typing and bookkeeping taught to juniors and seniors. Two type-writers were given as a parting gift by last year's graduating class, the P.T.A. purchased eight and Sevier County the other ten. The boys in the wood working class constructed some of the necessary tables. Another first was the football team. The county hired a coach who organized and coached the first Pi Phi football team. A group of interested Gatlinburg citizens organized the Gatlinburg Athletic Associationand collected $1,100.00 for necessary uniforms and equipment. The boys really did very well. In their eight game schedule they won three games and lost five. The new elementary building, built by the County on land donated by us, was not ready for occupancy until November first. Until that time conditions through the school were very unsatisfactory and crowded but after the first four grades were moved into their lovely new quarters much confusion was eliminated. For the first time we participated in a program with the University of Tennessee Department of Education, whereby thirteen senior students did their practice teaching in our school system during the winter quarter. This group brought fresh enthusiasm and new ideas to the school. The University, the community and the school were well satisfied with results of the experiment. Since the first of October the high school building has served as headquarters for the Baptist congregation for Sunday and mid-week services while their new church is under construction. Up to the seventh grade the teaching has been well done and the school has run smoothly. An at-tempt was made to departmentalize the seventh and eighth grades but this did not work out. The teachers that had been hired were not certificated properly for the work; the seventh grade teacher was out of school almost a month on account of illness and was very weak in discipline. A substitute was hired to take his work while he was ill and was retained to teach half of the grade when it was decided necessary to divide the grade into two sections. The grade has been a problem all year and will take skillful handling next year. Kelly Huskey again taught the eighth grade. He did some nice work with the ;unior girls and boys basketball teams and contributed to their success in winning many games. In the high school there were several changes in the faculty. Mrs. Lighter was on leave of absence for one year from the English and library position and while the person who replaced her did her best, the school missed the stability and good judgement Mrs. Lighter has always contributed. Our coach of last year. Wm. J. Miracle, was recalled to army service just before school opened. We were able to secure the services of Mr. Hartford Granitz from the University of Chattanooga who has filled the position well. He assisted with the football program by helping Mr. Levelling with the back field coaching. His basketball season was not too successful, due to inexperienced players. Even with the changes and additions mentioned, the school has not been quite up to other years. Furnace failures and poor janitor services were unnecessary handicaps. The confusion resulting from the delayed completion of the new building,. poor discipline, and some poor teaching, have all contributed to this result. The usual Halloween Carnival came of and the junior and Senior classes gave plays. The big Christmas program was much curtailed on account of furnace failures prohibiting rehearsals. The younger children all had room parties where there were gift exchanges and in the lower grades, the presents that were sent by Pi Phi active and Alumnae Clubs. Mrs. Armstrong varied her custom of presenting the grade school children in an operetta by giving a Patriotic Pageant. While this did not use as many children it was colorful and timely. Both the basketball and football teams were feted at banquets and the juniors entertained the seniors at their annual affair. 52 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Several new pieces of equipment were added during the year: one electric sewing machine for the home economics department and a new mimeograph for the use of the teachers. After the new building was occupied, one of the vacant class rooms was fitted up for visual education and another room served for the Girl Scouts. Mr. Granitz .and his boys constructed a shed as an addition to the gymnasium dressing rooms from old materials secured from the Baptist Church. Some necessary repairs and painting were accomplished during the year by a cooperative effort of the Fraternity, which gave $200.00 to repairing the gym and hall with new plywood in the broken spots and labor for some painting. The County paid for the paint used and the students and teachers did some painting. At the Craft Shop there was a complete re-decorating of the Art room which was planned by Marilyn Jones and one of the student teachers. The girls enlisted the aid of their friends and worked long hours themselves. It has been quite the style to get the rooms freshened up. All of the class rooms and the hall in the elementary building were repainted and a number of the ones in the high school building. The roof of the old elementary building was finally painted after a wait of three years. For the second year the Franklin Square Magazine Agency returned the check that was sent to pay for the school magazine subscriptions. This check for $68.50 was a gift from them in recognition of the Pi Phi business during the years. Other gifts have been made by Alumnae Clubs and individuals in the form of books to the library. We have added several fine reference books which are memorials to Pi Phis. Commencement events went off well in the dignified manner that I think is a great credit to the school. First, for the Seniors, was their trip. This year the class and sponsors went to Florida on a circle tour for five days. It is always a highlight of the four years of school. We hold no exercises for the eighth grade but they did present a little play on Friday evening before the last week of school. Dr. Tames Wilder gave the Baccalaureate address in the Methodist Church. This was another first for the new pipe organ provided the instrumental music and was used to accompany the glee club girls when they sang. On Class night the alas and gowns were replaced with pretty formals for the girls and neat suits for the boys of the class of twenty-one. Before the Commencement pro-gram we entertained ten guests at the Dormitory at dinner. This is an annual courtesy that we extend to the sneaker of the evening, the, class sponsor, principal, the County Superintendent and this year our local school board member, Mr. Fred Ingle, and their wives. Rev. Roy Reece of the Methodist Church in Sevierville gave the address, and Mr. Seaton presented the diplomas. Awards were given the outstanding students by the American Legion, the P.T.A. and the Director of the school. P.T.A. The revenue from Bingo games was not as much as in former years so the organization has operated on a curtailed budget. Additional revenue came from three rummage sales that brought in three hundred and forty dollars. One hundred of this amount was used for the elementary school library. The other main project has been the operation of the school lunch room. The old coal range was replaced with an electric one. The Lions and Rotary Clubs each gave a hundred dollars towards this project. In order to qualify for federal and state funds the lunch room had to be enlarged and improved. This involved turning.1 store room into a dining room and the building of storage shelves in the kitchen. Where so many children ride the school bus, leaving home at an early hour and sometimes not getting home until late, the hot lunch program is a great asset to a school. We are fortunate in having a group of interested people who will spend the time and energy to carry on a hot lunch programsuccessfully. Many free Iwslches are given during the year to children who cannot afford the daily twenty-five cent cost. The last payment was made on the large Hobart electric mixer that was purchased last year. City water was turned into the system in the fall. Dormitory We started the school year with three new girls and four boys. The boys were like the ten little Indians for now we have none ! Two found that they had to work at home, one enlisted in the air corps and the fourth one I had to send home since he would not obey rules. The number of girls increased to five during the year. I chaperoned them at Stuart until Lillian came in February. Most of the girls could not have a high school education if they did not live at the school. They are learning many things from working under Miss Hodgen and from their association with Lillian. Last winter, Arlie and Neal painted the interior of Stuart. Tina designed some new curtains for the house, Miss Hodgen wove the yardage and Mrs. Jones made them up. We bought new bedspreads and think the house is most attractive. The school family has been smaller than usual this year. We were glad to have Mr. Granitz board with us until his wife could be released from her position and they established their home in an apartment up in the Assembly grounds. Mr. Schoolfield, one of the student teachers, lived at the school for the six weeks that his group was in town. Two piano teachers have used Stuart as a piano studio. Their private pupils came over from school during school hours for their lessons. Health Center The year has been a busy one with the health center having been put to many uses. Many lives have been touched and helped by the services offered by our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, and the facilities of our health program. The State Mobile T.B. Unit used the Health Center for three clinics held during the year. Last summer two pre-school clinics were held in the building. One of these was for the rural children who were brought in for their examinations in the school bus. Some of the mothers came along when the children were shy. After days in school, when the nurse is found to be a friend in need this shyness wears off and all their cuts and bruises are taken to the nurse as a matter of course. Three rural schools are serviced by our nurse as well as the five hundred children in the school here. On Friday afternoon there is a well baby and pre-natal clinic for anyone interested. Marjorie has been active in plans for Civilian Defense and Community Health in case of bombings. Gatlinburg is not thought to be a likely target but might be used as a center to care for wounded from other areas such as Oak Ridge or Alcoa. Marjorie was chosen to represent Sevier County at a short course given by the Knoxville Red Cross Chapter in nursing in atomic cases. She has held classes in First Aid for 'Girl Scouts and now has a weekly class for some of the American Legion Auxiliary members. We have again been helped in our work by Sigma Phi Gamma International Sorority. Their national organization gave us $87.00 and several chapters have added THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 to that with gifts of money and supplies. The Ponca City, Oklahoma chapter sent ten dollars that Marjorie used for necessary x-rays for a needy boy. Other than that the money sent was used for eye corrections and helped to pay for glasses for a number of children who could not otherwise have afforded them. Seattle and Pendleton, Oregon, chapters sent gifts of $25.00 each. Among our own chapters and clubs, a check for $14.00 from May L. Keller Alumni Club of Richmond was sent for pictures to show dental care. New eye and ear charts were purchased from a five dollar check that Mrs. T. C. Bowles from Glendale, California, sent in memory of Louise Spalding Malin. The Westchester Alumnx Club have made layettes for us, a very much appreciated gift. Babies are a never failing crop in the mountains! The farmer is always at the mercy of the weather. We can do nothing about it but prepare for sudden changes and make the best of conditions. Our new modern chicken houses paid off well during an especially cold winter. We were about the only people around who had any eggs and commanded excellent prices from the Mountain View Hotel and Carl's Market as well as having all we needed for the kitchen. We keep a few pigs and still have our two old mules. They are useful for getting wood down from the hills and are rented out to local people who want small plowing jobs done. Richard Watson cares for our livestock and garden. He takes pride in having fine chickens, eggs, and vegetables for our table as well as flowers to deck the shop. On Sunday he is the minister in the little Glades Church. Arrow Craft Shop Business at Arrow Craft has gone along as usual. Mrs. Snow filled larger orders and more of them for alumnae clubs and active chapters than ever before. Mrs. McCutchan operated the shop in the Mountain View Hotel, suiting her hours for keeping open to the time that most of the guests would be in the lobby. Two important changes in personnel have occurred during the year. The first one was when Lura Owenby Porter left on January first to establish her home in Kentucky with her doctor husband. She had been with the shop for 16 years and knew the weavers and their families very well. They all co-operated with Mrs. McMorran and the girls in the shop to make the annual Christmas party of the Weavers a memorable farewell one for her. It was held at Stuart with refreshments served at Pollard. A lovely electric mixer was the gift that was presented to her by the group. Wanda Ogle moved from the selling end to production and has worked out well as a helper for Mrs. McMorran. The second change came June first when Hattie Trentham left the shop to devote her time to the operation of her tourist facilities. She was greatly missed but Margaret Ogle, a graduate of the school and daughter of Mertie who was our laundress for years, took that position. Tina has worked out some lovely new designs that will be in the next price list. These include a mother and daughter apron set, a party apron with metallic threads, several new towels in colored linen and a pure white one, seamless bags, a formal luncheon set in white and silver, wool dirndl skirts and some new scarfs. A recognition of the quality of the weavings produced and sold by the shop came recently when the Tennessee Education Association asked us to supply them with a small exhibit for the Tennessee headquarters room at the National Education Association to be held in San Francisco this summer. Since this is the only craft exhibit to be shown, we feel honored that our school was chosen to represent the state at this important meeting. Other Uses for Our Buildings and Grounds In addition to the school being used for church services, several other outside events made use of our facilities. Our own Workshop in Crafts should not be called "outside" for it is sponsored jointly by us and the University of Tennessee. All of our equipment, plus much from the University, is used to make that project a success. Last summer marked the sixth annual Workshop. Students came from twenty-five states, including quite a number from Tennessee. New Mexico was the most remote but ,Texas also was rep-resented. The class of work done by the students was exceptionally high. Two Open House evenings were held, one at the close of each half session. Over three hundred guests came at the last evening, to watch the demonstrations ' and to see the lovely pieces of jewelry, metal work, pottery and weaving that had been made during .the Workshop. We were glad to have a Pi Phi weaving teacher and two graduate assistants as well as several Pi Phi representatives among the students. For the third consecutive year the Craftsman's Fair of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild was held on our grounds. Financially, it was the most successful one ever held for instead of being in the red there was a profit of $4,000.00. Seventy-eight individuals and centers were represented in the exhibits which were beautifully displayed in the high school building. There were 103 demonstrators working at 22 different crafts. The folk dancing and ballad singing exhibitions were always well attended and when there was audience participation the stage was taxed to accommodate the crowds. Demonstrators and Dancers were housed in our Workshop dormitories. Another activity of the summer was that of the Gateway Stock Company engagement. Mr. Richards brought young students from the N. Y. Academy of Dramatic Arts and gave a repertoire of plays five nights a week. Our Auditorium serves as the theater and a class room is used for dressing rooms by making a division in the center of it. This does not work too well, especially in wet weather for there is no inside passageway. On Friday nights the P.T.A. sponsored their Bingo games. In November a Folk Festival sponsored by the Council of Southern Mountain Workers was held at the school. This marked quite an advance in that the School Board voted to allow the dancing to be held in a school that receives County funds. Reviewing the events of this busy year, I am again mindful of the wonderful cooperation that I have received from the local staff, Grand Council, and the members of the Settlement School Committee. I wish to express appreciation and thanks to our members who have sent gifts to the school for they help to bring pleasure to so many and give us the joy of representing them in giving.

        52 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Several new pieces of equipment were added during the year: one electric sewing machine for the home economics department and a new mimeograph for the use of the teachers. After the new building was occupied, one of the vacant class rooms was fitted up for visual education and another room served for the Girl Scouts. Mr. Granitz .and his boys constructed a shed as an addition to the gymnasium dressing rooms from old materials secured from the Baptist Church. Some necessary repairs and painting were accomplished during the year by a cooperative effort of the Fraternity, which gave $200.00 to repairing the gym and hall with new plywood in the broken spots and labor for some painting. The County paid for the paint used and the students and teachers did some painting. At the Craft Shop there was a complete re-decorating of the Art room which was planned by Marilyn Jones and one of the student teachers. The girls enlisted the aid of their friends and worked long hours themselves. It has been quite the style to get the rooms freshened up. All of the class rooms and the hall in the elementary building were repainted and a number of the ones in the high school building. The roof of the old elementary building was finally painted after a wait of three years. For the second year the Franklin Square Magazine Agency returned the check that was sent to pay for the school magazine subscriptions. This check for $68.50 was a gift from them in recognition of the Pi Phi business during the years. Other gifts have been made by Alumnae Clubs and individuals in the form of books to the library. We have added several fine reference books which are memorials to Pi Phis. Commencement events went off well in the dignified manner that I think is a great credit to the school. First, for the Seniors, was their trip. This year the class and sponsors went to Florida on a circle tour for five days. It is always a highlight of the four years of school. We hold no exercises for the eighth grade but they did present a little play on Friday evening before the last week of school. Dr. Tames Wilder gave the Baccalaureate address in the Methodist Church. This was another first for the new pipe organ provided the instrumental music and was used to accompany the glee club girls when they sang. On Class night the alas and gowns were replaced with pretty formals for the girls and neat suits for the boys of the class of twenty-one. Before the Commencement pro-gram we entertained ten guests at the Dormitory at dinner. This is an annual courtesy that we extend to the sneaker of the evening, the, class sponsor, principal, the County Superintendent and this year our local school board member, Mr. Fred Ingle, and their wives. Rev. Roy Reece of the Methodist Church in Sevierville gave the address, and Mr. Seaton presented the diplomas. Awards were given the outstanding students by the American Legion, the P.T.A. and the Director of the school. P.T.A. The revenue from Bingo games was not as much as in former years so the organization has operated on a curtailed budget. Additional revenue came from three rummage sales that brought in three hundred and forty dollars. One hundred of this amount was used for the elementary school library. The other main project has been the operation of the school lunch room. The old coal range was replaced with an electric one. The Lions and Rotary Clubs each gave a hundred dollars towards this project. In order to qualify for federal and state funds the lunch room had to be enlarged and improved. This involved turning.1 store room into a dining room and the building of storage shelves in the kitchen. Where so many children ride the school bus, leaving home at an early hour and sometimes not getting home until late, the hot lunch program is a great asset to a school. We are fortunate in having a group of interested people who will spend the time and energy to carry on a hot lunch programsuccessfully. Many free Iwslches are given during the year to children who cannot afford the daily twenty-five cent cost. The last payment was made on the large Hobart electric mixer that was purchased last year. City water was turned into the system in the fall. Dormitory We started the school year with three new girls and four boys. The boys were like the ten little Indians for now we have none ! Two found that they had to work at home, one enlisted in the air corps and the fourth one I had to send home since he would not obey rules. The number of girls increased to five during the year. I chaperoned them at Stuart until Lillian came in February. Most of the girls could not have a high school education if they did not live at the school. They are learning many things from working under Miss Hodgen and from their association with Lillian. Last winter, Arlie and Neal painted the interior of Stuart. Tina designed some new curtains for the house, Miss Hodgen wove the yardage and Mrs. Jones made them up. We bought new bedspreads and think the house is most attractive. The school family has been smaller than usual this year. We were glad to have Mr. Granitz board with us until his wife could be released from her position and they established their home in an apartment up in the Assembly grounds. Mr. Schoolfield, one of the student teachers, lived at the school for the six weeks that his group was in town. Two piano teachers have used Stuart as a piano studio. Their private pupils came over from school during school hours for their lessons. Health Center The year has been a busy one with the health center having been put to many uses. Many lives have been touched and helped by the services offered by our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, and the facilities of our health program. The State Mobile T.B. Unit used the Health Center for three clinics held during the year. Last summer two pre-school clinics were held in the building. One of these was for the rural children who were brought in for their examinations in the school bus. Some of the mothers came along when the children were shy. After days in school, when the nurse is found to be a friend in need this shyness wears off and all their cuts and bruises are taken to the nurse as a matter of course. Three rural schools are serviced by our nurse as well as the five hundred children in the school here. On Friday afternoon there is a well baby and pre-natal clinic for anyone interested. Marjorie has been active in plans for Civilian Defense and Community Health in case of bombings. Gatlinburg is not thought to be a likely target but might be used as a center to care for wounded from other areas such as Oak Ridge or Alcoa. Marjorie was chosen to represent Sevier County at a short course given by the Knoxville Red Cross Chapter in nursing in atomic cases. She has held classes in First Aid for 'Girl Scouts and now has a weekly class for some of the American Legion Auxiliary members. We have again been helped in our work by Sigma Phi Gamma International Sorority. Their national organization gave us $87.00 and several chapters have added THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 to that with gifts of money and supplies. The Ponca City, Oklahoma chapter sent ten dollars that Marjorie used for necessary x-rays for a needy boy. Other than that the money sent was used for eye corrections and helped to pay for glasses for a number of children who could not otherwise have afforded them. Seattle and Pendleton, Oregon, chapters sent gifts of $25.00 each. Among our own chapters and clubs, a check for $14.00 from May L. Keller Alumni Club of Richmond was sent for pictures to show dental care. New eye and ear charts were purchased from a five dollar check that Mrs. T. C. Bowles from Glendale, California, sent in memory of Louise Spalding Malin. The Westchester Alumnx Club have made layettes for us, a very much appreciated gift. Babies are a never failing crop in the mountains! The farmer is always at the mercy of the weather. We can do nothing about it but prepare for sudden changes and make the best of conditions. Our new modern chicken houses paid off well during an especially cold winter. We were about the only people around who had any eggs and commanded excellent prices from the Mountain View Hotel and Carl's Market as well as having all we needed for the kitchen. We keep a few pigs and still have our two old mules. They are useful for getting wood down from the hills and are rented out to local people who want small plowing jobs done. Richard Watson cares for our livestock and garden. He takes pride in having fine chickens, eggs, and vegetables for our table as well as flowers to deck the shop. On Sunday he is the minister in the little Glades Church. Arrow Craft Shop Business at Arrow Craft has gone along as usual. Mrs. Snow filled larger orders and more of them for alumnae clubs and active chapters than ever before. Mrs. McCutchan operated the shop in the Mountain View Hotel, suiting her hours for keeping open to the time that most of the guests would be in the lobby. Two important changes in personnel have occurred during the year. The first one was when Lura Owenby Porter left on January first to establish her home in Kentucky with her doctor husband. She had been with the shop for 16 years and knew the weavers and their families very well. They all co-operated with Mrs. McMorran and the girls in the shop to make the annual Christmas party of the Weavers a memorable farewell one for her. It was held at Stuart with refreshments served at Pollard. A lovely electric mixer was the gift that was presented to her by the group. Wanda Ogle moved from the selling end to production and has worked out well as a helper for Mrs. McMorran. The second change came June first when Hattie Trentham left the shop to devote her time to the operation of her tourist facilities. She was greatly missed but Margaret Ogle, a graduate of the school and daughter of Mertie who was our laundress for years, took that position. Tina has worked out some lovely new designs that will be in the next price list. These include a mother and daughter apron set, a party apron with metallic threads, several new towels in colored linen and a pure white one, seamless bags, a formal luncheon set in white and silver, wool dirndl skirts and some new scarfs. A recognition of the quality of the weavings produced and sold by the shop came recently when the Tennessee Education Association asked us to supply them with a small exhibit for the Tennessee headquarters room at the National Education Association to be held in San Francisco this summer. Since this is the only craft exhibit to be shown, we feel honored that our school was chosen to represent the state at this important meeting. Other Uses for Our Buildings and Grounds In addition to the school being used for church services, several other outside events made use of our facilities. Our own Workshop in Crafts should not be called "outside" for it is sponsored jointly by us and the University of Tennessee. All of our equipment, plus much from the University, is used to make that project a success. Last summer marked the sixth annual Workshop. Students came from twenty-five states, including quite a number from Tennessee. New Mexico was the most remote but ,Texas also was rep-resented. The class of work done by the students was exceptionally high. Two Open House evenings were held, one at the close of each half session. Over three hundred guests came at the last evening, to watch the demonstrations ' and to see the lovely pieces of jewelry, metal work, pottery and weaving that had been made during .the Workshop. We were glad to have a Pi Phi weaving teacher and two graduate assistants as well as several Pi Phi representatives among the students. For the third consecutive year the Craftsman's Fair of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild was held on our grounds. Financially, it was the most successful one ever held for instead of being in the red there was a profit of $4,000.00. Seventy-eight individuals and centers were represented in the exhibits which were beautifully displayed in the high school building. There were 103 demonstrators working at 22 different crafts. The folk dancing and ballad singing exhibitions were always well attended and when there was audience participation the stage was taxed to accommodate the crowds. Demonstrators and Dancers were housed in our Workshop dormitories. Another activity of the summer was that of the Gateway Stock Company engagement. Mr. Richards brought young students from the N. Y. Academy of Dramatic Arts and gave a repertoire of plays five nights a week. Our Auditorium serves as the theater and a class room is used for dressing rooms by making a division in the center of it. This does not work too well, especially in wet weather for there is no inside passageway. On Friday nights the P.T.A. sponsored their Bingo games. In November a Folk Festival sponsored by the Council of Southern Mountain Workers was held at the school. This marked quite an advance in that the School Board voted to allow the dancing to be held in a school that receives County funds. Reviewing the events of this busy year, I am again mindful of the wonderful cooperation that I have received from the local staff, Grand Council, and the members of the Settlement School Committee. I wish to express appreciation and thanks to our members who have sent gifts to the school for they help to bring pleasure to so many and give us the joy of representing them in giving. The contacts with visiting Pi Phis have been pleasant.

MERRITT, Phi Mu, University of Mi, m Coral Gables In "Fraternity Month" Is your chapter library one in name only a spot so designated because your National Council has decreed that a library is an essential part of a chapter room or lodge or house? Is it a dark corner not suitable for any purpose, but it can house a few books, and you can say you have a library? Are the books in it mostly discarded textbooks and poorly chosen "gift" books which the recipient wished to discard? If your library resembles the one described above, it is time you were doing something about it. First, choose a quiet room or alcove or pleasant corner in which simple, attractive bookshelves can be built and paint them to harmonize with the other furnishings. A few comfortable chairs, good lights, and enticing books will do the rest. A card index file should be made of all books and a simple system of borrowing and returning set up. Your sorority bookplate will add to the attractiveness of any book and will make it easier to find if some thoughtless reader keeps it out too long. After all, the librarian needs some duties to make her feel important. Come to Convention Shamrock Hotel, Houston, Texas July 7-13, 1952. Settle ent School ep0t'tS CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE HE GREATNESS of a nation and the greatness of Tan organization lie in the number of its members who are willing to assume non-enforceable responsibilities." This quotation applies well to Pi Beta Phi whose members voluntarily assume duties, interests, and responsibilities for love of the fraternity and its projects. The Settlement School, in its years of existence, with the careful planning of the few and the noble support of the many certainly is the result of the willing spirit above mentioned. Individually and in groups Pi Beta Phis have rallied to the maintenance of their project in Tennessee. . Originally, the purpose was basic in fact rudimentary education. With passing years the community of Gatlinburg and Sevier County, Tennessee have been able to assume some of the burden, Now fraternity interest has widened to include other fields of endeavor and to lend support more especially to a large health program and the development of crafts in that area. The fraternity leases our school buildings and playgrounds to the County for a nominal fee. The County provides maintenance and pays all teachers' salaries save four. In order to assist in making the Pi Beta Phi School fully accredited, Pi Beta Phi assumed the hiring and the salary of the Physical Education and Health teacher some years ago. To develop the physical well-being of youth seemed a most Important phase of our Health program. Then, to improve and expand the natural talents, music and craft instruction were added. This coming year Mr. Walter Ogle will again be School Superintendent and principal of the high school with Mrs. Ann Lighter serving as assistant principal. Mr. Ogle felt that the past school year did not run as smoothly as other years; in the fall the fine new County grade school building was not ready for several months and this caused an overcrowded condition with resulting uncertainty and unhappiness for the teachers. This coming year the County will strive toward the 6 6 3 plan of education and prospects are brighter. We find Mr. Ogle, Mr. Ingle, local County school board member and the County Superintendent, Mr. Seaton all cooperative in consulting Pi Beta Phi about the hiring of new teachers. Mr. Hartford Granitz, graduate of the University of Chattanooga, has been the instructor in Physical Education and Health this year. His major coaching was in basketball where, due to inexperienced players, the boys' team won only fourteen games of the twenty-four scheduled. The girls won ten and lost twelve. In the tourney, the boys went to the semi-finals and placed one boy on the all-tourney team. In addition to basketball other sports, tumbling, gymnastics, touchball, badminton, swimming, tennis, volley ball, soft ball and shuffle board, were introduced, varying according to the weather. Need for a larger gymnasium and more gymnasium equipment sorely handicaps the program. Mr. Ogle praised Mr. Granitz' work and influence.very highly. Marilyn Jones, a member of Pi Beta Phi, has ably handled the Arts and Crafts department and we regret that she will not be able to return. To quote Marilyn's own report gives a little idea of what she found in Gatlinburg: "The interest, abilities and background of the students have made my job one of great pleasure, for here in the Smokies, creating through self-expression is an inherent ability." Her aim, throughart, was to encourage independent thinking and the ability to work with others. Planning with the teachers made possible art work integrated with their regular grade school studies. For example, in the study of Gatlinburg, one group made for display pottery in local clay, hand weaving, and carved soap to typify the wood carvers; another, a map of the town, an over life-size papier-mache bear and a scrap book. The fifth grade worked out ten different marionette shows, all participating in the writing, designing, planning, and creating of their. own marionettes. As the sixth grade studied Greek history they wrote and gave their own Greek play in assembly; the backdrops, costumes, properties, Greek masks, statuary, all were original. In addition to these group studies individual art expression was made possible in all grades. In the high school students learned principles of basic design, fine arts, the use of water colors and oil and became familiar with the outstanding painters of all time. Craft work continued even after school hours when some of the students learned of enameling, pottery, candle making, weaving and book-binding. Re-quests even came from adults for special classes. Mr. Carl Huskey, with only a part time school day to give instruction because of his own shop work, gave fine help in wood-working to the high school boys. The coming year some replacements in machinery will make possible larger classes and more precise results. The County Superintendent feels this subject most important for there are so many woodworking shops in those hills where talented boys can secure employment. In music, Mrs. Aletha Armstrong aspires to greater melody and harmony and to inspiring more students to make use of their voices. For the first time this year eight boys have been added to the glee club of thirty-two and appeared on final programs something unheard of. Also for the first time a choir has been used in the assemblies, thus stimulating general musical appreciation. In the grade school, regular instruction was given all year with various smaller groups appearing in public from time to time. An original Christmas play using rare and seldom heard carols was given and the finale for the year was a patriotic pageant. For both of these the Art department lent full sup-port in creating backgrounds and striking scenes. During the summer visit of the province officers, Mrs. Armstrong spoke of the great contribution Pi Phi makes to the young people by bringing to them a real appreciation for finer music with the best in records and by offering an opportunity for proper development of their voices. At the same time, Mrs. Ann Lighter who, during her supervision of the Grace Coolidge Library at the school, has received books, magazines and furniture as gifts for the library thanked the officers and through them all Pi Phis for their generosity. So convincingly did these two ex-press their appreciation and the further need for assistance the officers, on their departure from Gatlin-burg, left thirty dollars as their own contribution to further the music program and to add to the library of the Pi Beta Phi School. In a cooperative scheme for improving the appearance of the school this spring in order to raise its state classification, Pi Beta Phi gave two hundred dollars which repaired the gymnasium walls and provided the labor for their painting. The County paid 47 4. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW for the paint and both teachers and students volunteered their services in the cause of beautification. A special mention goes to the P.T.A. for its leader-ship in the best interests of the school. Sufficient funds were raised to enlarge and continue. the operation of the school lunch room where, with government aid, hot lunches are offered daily. These are particularly important to the youngsters who arrive by bus at such early hours. Some of them deposit the youngsters on the school grounds before seven in the morning. The P.T.A. also contributed toward the improvement of the elementary school library. Pi Beta Phi is proud of its staff and the effort each makes for the school and the community. One teacher sponsors the Beta club (two drove a group to the state convention at Nashville this spring) ; another is a Girl Scout leader; others are class sponsors; others are helpful in transportation of teams for sport events or in case of illness. Each makes her personal contribution to her, or his, church as well as to community developments. The demands upon their time some-times seem out of proportion. Miss Dyer is doing a very competent work as Director. Since February we have enjoyed having Lillian Hansen, Kansas Beta, as Assistant to the Director and she has stepped nicely into her new responsibilities. She chaperons the dormitory girls in Stuart Cottage as one of her duties. Last year all our girls finished high school and we have had five new girls learning a great deal under the tutelage of Miss Hodgen, our House Manager. There have been no school boys staying with us this year but already the applications of several are at hand. The dormitory system provides girls and boys who live far away or beyond the bus line, a chance for education with less difficulty and gives us the benefit of their help a few hours a week in part payment for their board and room. We could not maintain our school through fair or foul weather were it not for our Maintenance man, Arlie Watson who needs no introduction after his recent feature in the ARROW. His son Neal ably assists him as does Preacher Richard Watson when the Pi Phi farm is not requiring his attention. Our live stock, namely the pigs, two old mules and the chickens, are the responsibility of Richard and he takes great pride in the abundance of fresh eggs, chickens and the vegetables served at our table. This past year Teachers' Cottage was brightened with lovely new living room drapes, designed and hand-woven by Tina McMorran, our weaving de-signer. In like manner the bedrooms of Stuart Cottage were made more attractive with new curtains de-signed by Tina, woven by Miss Hodgen, made by Mrs. Jones the cook and with the addition of new spreads. Stuart and Pollard were lightened with some interior painting and during the coming year Stuart, Pollard, Teachers' Cottage and the Red Barn all will require exterior coats of paint. As announced at the 1950 Convention, plans for a new Staff House move steadily forward but not too swiftly. At present the architect is working on the detail drawings and specifications and we hope it will be started in the early fall. This building will give more comfortable quarters for the all-year staff and will provide additional housing for the Summer Workshop, a very important factor in future plans. Closely linked with the school program and vital to the community through health education is our Jennie Nicol Health Center presided over by Marjorie Chalmers, R.N. This year like all others has been a busy one. Perhaps the simplest means of showing the activity is a list of the type of work done these past twelve months. ' '84 Field Visits Office Calls 22 11 First Aid 1928 Diphtheria Immunizations 232 Small Pox Vaccinations :268384 Total Typhoid Inoculations 799 Completed Typhoid Series . . . . Total Pertussis Inoculations 108 Completed Pertussis Series 38 Therapeutic Inoculations . . 175 Health Talks Pupil Inspections and Examinations . . . 3786 113 Newspaper Articles . . . 55 Chest X-Rays 724 Pupil inspections and examinotions eomprise the greatest number of calls. Pre-school clinics were held with the cooperation of the local doctors and the path between grade school and Health Center is well worn by visits for various ailtnents, poison ivy being the greatest, or for first aid in case of minor accidents. Friday afternoons are given to a well baby or pre-natal clinic where the shy babies, sometimes brought by an older sister, are comforted after a shot by a toy sup-plied from the Pi Phi gifts sent there. In addition to our own school, the health cif the rural school children is also looked after, both through their visits to the Health Center and by Marjorie in regular calls at the school-houses, weather permitting. From the Division of Tuberculosis Control, the mobile trucks came to our Center several times this year. Some stops were for regular check-ups and others for food handlers and public survey. A total of 1,425 were x-rayed. Three children were sent to the Crippled Children's Clinic in Knoxville, two to be re-fitted with braces and the other, victim of spastic paralysis, received a light wheel chair, purchased with contributions from neighbors and friends. Marjorie has assisted the Scouts by holding First Aid classes and assisting in examinations and inocula--tions before the exodus to caitisps. She was chosen to represent Sevier County at a short course in nursing atomic cases given by the Knoxville chapter of the Red Cross. She has also aided the local doctors and the Citizens' Council in planning for Civilian Defense and Community Health in case of bombings. Outside the general line of duty our nurse has faithfully written a gratuitous health column for the weekly newspaper wherein she gives many good precautionary hints and sage health advice to the reading public. Her frequent invitations to talk before outside organizations speaks well for her place in the nursing profession. Her faith in the part our Health Center plays in the better health of school and community spurs her on to greater deeds. We appreciate the continued interest of Sigma Phi Gamma, International Sorority, which through its "service for mountain children" fund has .made possible both x-ray and eye correction with new glasses for those unable to pay. Several of the separate chapters have become interested and have sent supplies or special funds whereby new strip films and slides for educational purposes could be purchased. The Pi Phi Richmond, Virginia alumina club sent fourteen dollars with which pictures to show dental care were bought and five dollars sent by Mrs. T. C. Bowles in memory of Louise Spalding Malin were used for new ear and eye charts. The layettes provided by the Westchester Alum= Club are so very welcome as are the separate donations to the loan closet. Arrowcraft is another very important part of the Pi Beta Phi School. Through their orders to Arrowcraft SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 Pi Phis everywhere are in direct touch with the School and if they visit the shop, want to hear all about the rest of our development. The visual evidences of the beautiful products cannot fail to make them cognizant of our crafts relations in the Smokies. Ethel M. Snow, our competent manager, has filled many orders to clubs and chapters this past year while at the same time local sales at the shop have been larger. She, and the Committee as well, appreciate the more business-like approach with orders and the prompter settlement of accounts. Some day perhaps all clubs and individuals will realize they must not demand greater credit leniency from Pi Beta Phi than from any other merchant with whom they trade and will awaken to the fact that a good credit rating in Pi Beta Phi is wise, too. From year to year usually the same clubs are -best sellers" but this year two things were proven: one, that a new untouched territory presents a great field and little sales resistance; two, that a small new club, with enthusiasm and effort can aspire to high sales rank. The Coos Bay, Oregon club, newly organized and small, sold .$1,916.Oo worth of Arrow_ craft products, standing second only to Champaign, Illinois, again first. Eleven clubs topped the one thou-sand dollar mark in sales: Portland, Oregon; Pitts-burgh, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Houston, Texas ; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Madison, Wisconsin; Eugene, Oregon and Northern New Jersey. Tina McMorran, weaving designer has given us some beautiful new designs, gorgeous in coloring, ready for the new price list. To picture all articles would make the price list prohibitive and much must be left to faith in past production. There have been steep advances in cotton and linen threads which will mean a change in some of the articles woven and such old stand-bys as the white under arm bag will be missing. However the new things such as party aprons with metallic threads, seamless bags, a new formal luncheon set, new stoles, new linen and other towels, a new wool dirndl, all will take their places most satisfyingly.. The wool dirndl skirts started a year ago now total more than six hundred-forty-three sold and are still in demand. Of interest to those who dislike taxes is the newly designed dressy bag with a woven-in-handle, which will be tax free. The quality of our weaving is above criticism at all times. But a recognition of it came this spring when we were asked by the Tennessee Educational Association to provide a small exhibit for Tennessee's room at the national meeting of the N. E. in San Francisco this summer, It is the only craft exhibit to be shown. We would give special mention to Mrs. McCutchan who handles the little shop in the Mountain View Hotel in Gatlinburg so ably, accommodating her time there to the convenience of her patrons, be the hour early or late. Also to one who has much to do with the success of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Eunice Cole without whose skill at figures both you and we would be in difficulty! Perhaps she would like it said here to those officers whose clubs have paid nothing on their Arrow-craft indebtedness that they ask them to explain the valid reason for such an oversight or investigate for themselves the reasons wherefore. We regretted losing Lura Owenby Porter, who had been with Arrowcraft for sixteen years, when she left to join her husband in Kentucky and also Hattie Trentham when she found family business interests required her resignation. Wanda Ogle from the sales department stepped into the position of assistant weaving designer under Tina and Mrs. Snow has takenon two new sales girls, Reba Owenby and Margaret Ogle. Edna Cook is now the Senior sales girl and assists Mrs. Snow in filling both mail orders and shop sales with discriminating care. Of interest is the fact that Margaret Ogle's mother was one of our faithful weavers for many years. During the year we lost another long-time weaver, Mollie Moore, when her family moved to a farm near Knoxville. She had been with Arrowcraft almost from the beginning and had woven only Whig Rose mats and runners for about sixteen years. For the first time in three years the Committee arranged its annual meeting to coincide with the Summer Workshop session and was immensely proud of what it saw. The few thousand dollars budgeted each year toward this particular craft development is one of our most necessary expenditures. For the seventh summer Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee have planned this Workshop in Weaving, Pottery, jewelry Making, Textile Decoration and Metal Work. The consensus of opinion was that this was the most successful session to date, and Miss Jessie W. Harris, head of U. T. College of Home Economics, who had not seen the Workshop for two years because of being in Europe was most enthusiastic on her visit this summer. Pi Beta Phi is fortunate that the University will lend Miss Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design each year to head the Workshop as she is exceedingly well liked and skilled. The school buildings are transformed to make way for the Workshop and all of our equipment and much from the University is in use. Twenty-six states were represented among the students and staff this summer. Some of the students remain fo? the full six weeks, others for three weeks only and some are studying for credit while others for recreation. There were six Pi Phis among this summer's students and many other Pi Phis could avail themselves of this opportunity. The enrollment of necessity is limited because of lack of enough housing facilities and the individual classes are also restricted for no instructor can do justice with a teaching overload. There is no age limitation and this summer there have been two bright young ninety and almost ninety year olds. Each term concludes with an Open House where the results of the three weeks' study are artistically displayed and each pupil demonstrates her particular craft. In addition to the work accomplished there is time for picnicking and other recreation and trips to nearby Craft centers are arranged. This year all went by bus to Asheville, North Carolina to attend the Craftsman's Fair, previously held on the Pi Phi Green in Gatlinburg but this year moved to North Carolina. The Fair was held in the Civic Auditorium and had an attendance of 8,600 for the four days. Pi Beta Phi sent over a loom, set up with a bag warp in bright colors upon which Tina McMorran and her assistant wove. They also took their warping bars for purposes of demonstration. There were exhibits of various craft making as well as a salesroom where all the crafts had their wares on hand for sale. In a smaller fashion there will be a local Crafts Fair on our grounds in late September when the forty-eight governors of the United States with those of Alaska, Guam and Hawaii convene for their annual conference. Each Governor is permitted to have a party of six and the Fair is just one event planned for their entertainment. Pi Beta Phi is hoping that many National Panhellenic members will be among the ladies in the group to whom can be shown the project about which they have so often heard our School. Again this year the Gateway Players under the 50 THE SEP m ki ER ARK() v. direction of Mr. John Richards of the New York Academy . of Dramatic Arts are making use of the school auditorium as a theatre. With an excellent cast of young players they are presenting leading plays as entertainment for vacation visitors. These players from New York are gaining experience for Broadway parts and at the same time enjoying a type of living in the mountains, far different than that to which they are accustomed. There is tremendous satisfaction in hearing that the general contributions of both alumnae clubs and active chapters to the Settlement School show an in-crease over the 1949-50 figures. Just as one's personal living costs have mounted, so must the Settlement School Committee provide for possible increasing expenses in its budget; therefore the added donations are particularly appreciated. The St. Louis club continues to give its receipts from the big summer fashion show and thereby, with its thousand dollar contribution, ranks first among alumnae club contributors. Then follow Philadelphia ($527.00); Cleveland East ($345.00); Milwaukee ($250.00); Pittsburgh ($225.00) ; Indianapolis ($210.00) ; Denver ($200.00). Among active chapters, honors go to: Maryland Alpha ($1,000.00 balance from its chapter treasury); Missouri Beta ($125.00) ; Nebraska Beta ($106.10) ; Texas Alpha ($100.00). Every contribution from one dollar upwards is important and valued for the spirit which prompted it; together, the ones and fives and seventy-fives make a good showing where much is needed. As interest increases, particularly among active chapters, so will our project broaden in scope. To have the clubs of four provinces and the chapters of seven, one hundred percent is good but not good enough. What a tribute, for the fortieth anniversary of the opening of the Settlement School next year to have every club and chapter a contributor ! The check from the Central Office Magazine Agency for $8,770.57 was happily received. Your continuance as informed Pi Phis through the reading of current magazines is urged along with your giving your own and your neighbors' subscriptions to those magazines to the Pi Beta Phi agency. For the second year the Franklin Magazine Agency returned as a gift to the school, the check sent them for the school magazine subscriptions. This came as an acknowledgement of the large business Pi Phi has given them through the years. This year we shall have a new printing of the Cook Book. It had been said that an entirely new book might be advisable but after considering the large amount of time, effort and expense involved in gathering new recipes, and the continued popularity of our present edition, it was decided to arrange for a re-print. The Memorial Fund provides a satisfying medium for an expression of sympathy in the loss of a friend or dear one. The donor may state where or how she wishes the money used or may leave its distribution to the wise discretion of the Committee. In the case of a bequest, the Settlement School Treasurer should be contacted for the proper legal form. The many boxes of toys, clothing, books, fruit and candy, in addition to the extra checks at Christmas time are always welcome. They provide a special gift of game or book for each grade school room and an individual gift to each child in our grade school and those of the three nearest rural schools. The staff, too, has enjoyed and appreciated the thoughtfulness of some clubs, chapters and single Pi Phis in sending them special remembrances. It is wonderful when Pi Phis remember those in Gatlinburg who work for Pi Phi objectives in Tennessee. There are Pi Phis who remain uncertain of the values to the fraternity in a continuation of our pro-gram in Tennessee. What would be our program if we did pull away? Where would the fraternity receive greater satisfaction in any undertaking (nor more recognition) than its health program, its continued encouragement of native arts and crafts and its supplemental help in education ? Because of the fast development of the tourist travel to Smoky Mountain National Park, the town has lost some of its natural charm; the residents themselves are concerned. One of our province officers after being in Gatlinburg for the first time wrote that she was not disappointed in the School but in the town. Not seeing anything of the mountains nor the mountaineers, it was a little hard, from the appearance of the main street, to under-stand the need for our School there. Fortunately for her peace of mind, her husband and her boys had time for some investigating and could explain what conditions were off the main street. For example, when one realizes that open ditches still carry sewage--and not far from our School and the main street, too--one knows that all the public health problems have not been solved. The same holds true for education. Some newcomers to the town fail to see the need for Pi Beta Phi in the school but they have not attempted nor succeeded in getting the necessary help from the County Court. County funds are not available for other construction in Gatlinburg now, though all should be proud of the modern new grade school building in use this year. There will be no County nurse next year which will make the load for our Health Center still heavier. As the County or city proves its ability to accomplish its own proper development, Pi Beta Phi will gladly step into other fields. Obviously the time is not yet. The Committee experienced very special pleasure during its annual meeting in having both the Grand Council and the Province officers in Gatlinburg for a part of the time. First hand visual education surpasses word description. Both from the comments at the time and correspondence since, we have learned that the officers really saw that our project is worthy of fraternity interest and support. At our Committee meeting we missed the presence and help of Harriet Rauch, detained at home because of her mother's illness. She will continue to handle the News of Little Pigeon and other publicity. Ethel Smith will again serve as Secretary and will be consultant on the school library. Nellis Gibson will handle the circulation of our films the new, the old, and the Workshop films are all available. The Treasurer's books for the School are again in the hands of Olivia Smith Moore. The work of the Committee is heavy and the distribution of some of the responsibility among four others lightens the load for the chairman. She is appreciative of all that each one does and all of us are grateful for the assistance from Grand Council, particularly the help of our contact member, Miss Onken. We also recognize the immeasurable help of the other officers in their contacts with each club and chapter. "Our shadow, our influence may fall where we may never be !" The Committee is conscious of this truth as it surveys the help of all the many alumnae and actives whose faith in the Settlement School is manifested in their constant support and their continued interest. A simple deed may mean a bettered life; a single act may mean greater happiness for some child; a contribution, large or small, can mean continued success and progress in Gatlinburg. RUTH BARRETT SMITH THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1951 51 THE PAST YEAR has been the busiest one that I have spent in Gatlinburg. After Nancy Holmes left the first of August, I had no help until February first when Lillian Hansen, Kansas 13, came to work at the school. She has been efficient. and helpful and has already made a place for herself in the school and in the town. Besides her work at the school she has undertaken the leadership of and Girl Scout Troop and is secretary of the P.T.A. and of the Episcopal Auxiliary. Community Building in this rapidly rowing, town never stops. The winter and bad weather conditions slow things down but with the first hint of spring a fever of activity breaks out in order to have accommodations ready for the opening of the season. The Baptist congregation razed their old church and are now building a new and much larger structure on the same site. It is built of Crab Orchard stone and wood and is rather modern in design. A small field stone church has been built up in the Airport field by the Episcopalians. It is attractive and will be more so when it is fully completed. .Some new furnishings and a pipe organ have been added to the new Methodist church which is now practically complete. Another improvement to the churches of the town has been at the Roaring Fork church where they have new pews and an acre of ground purchased for a parking lot. A site has been purchased for a Catholic church. The First National Bank of Gatlinburg opened March first. It is located in the Maples building and provides the town with up to date banking facilities. Numerous tourist businesses have been built and old ones changed and improved. The Mountain View has done some extensive interior remodeling and the Edgepark Inn has been enlarged and converted into a modern Motel. A coffee shop in the basement is one of the new eating places that have sprung up all over town. The Chamber of Commerce and tourist bureau have been merged. and Mr. Bart Leeper hired as the Secretary. He is bringing much advertising to the area in national magazines and papers and is organizing and promoting several conventions. Chief of these will be the annual Conference of the Governors which meets in Gatlinburg in late September, 1951. Union church services on Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter were held. The annual party for the benefit of the village library brought entertainment to, the local people and a sense of working together for a common good. School The school year has been marked by important beginnings and changes in several phases of the pro-gram. For the first time all grades were placed under the direction of one man. Mr. Walter Ogle did no teaching but served as principal of the high school and superintended the work in the elementary school. A business course was introduced and typing and bookkeeping taught to juniors and seniors. Two type-writers were given as a parting gift by last year's graduating class, the P.T.A. purchased eight and Sevier County the other ten. The boys in the wood working class constructed some of the necessary tables. Another first was the football team. The county hired a coach who organized and coached the first Pi Phi football team. A group of interested Gatlinburg citizens organized the Gatlinburg Athletic Associationand collected $1,100.00 for necessary uniforms and equipment. The boys really did very well. In their eight game schedule they won three games and lost five. The new elementary building, built by the County on land donated by us, was not ready for occupancy until November first. Until that time conditions through the school were very unsatisfactory and crowded but after the first four grades were moved into their lovely new quarters much confusion was eliminated. For the first time we participated in a program with the University of Tennessee Department of Education, whereby thirteen senior students did their practice teaching in our school system during the winter quarter. This group brought fresh enthusiasm and new ideas to the school. The University, the community and the school were well satisfied with results of the experiment. Since the first of October the high school building has served as headquarters for the Baptist congregation for Sunday and mid-week services while their new church is under construction. Up to the seventh grade the teaching has been well done and the school has run smoothly. An at-tempt was made to departmentalize the seventh and eighth grades but this did not work out. The teachers that had been hired were not certificated properly for the work; the seventh grade teacher was out of school almost a month on account of illness and was very weak in discipline. A substitute was hired to take his work while he was ill and was retained to teach half of the grade when it was decided necessary to divide the grade into two sections. The grade has been a problem all year and will take skillful handling next year. Kelly Huskey again taught the eighth grade. He did some nice work with the ;unior girls and boys basketball teams and contributed to their success in winning many games. In the high school there were several changes in the faculty. Mrs. Lighter was on leave of absence for one year from the English and library position and while the person who replaced her did her best, the school missed the stability and good judgement Mrs. Lighter has always contributed. Our coach of last year. Wm. J. Miracle, was recalled to army service just before school opened. We were able to secure the services of Mr. Hartford Granitz from the University of Chattanooga who has filled the position well. He assisted with the football program by helping Mr. Levelling with the back field coaching. His basketball season was not too successful, due to inexperienced players. Even with the changes and additions mentioned, the school has not been quite up to other years. Furnace failures and poor janitor services were unnecessary handicaps. The confusion resulting from the delayed completion of the new building,. poor discipline, and some poor teaching, have all contributed to this result. The usual Halloween Carnival came of and the junior and Senior classes gave plays. The big Christmas program was much curtailed on account of furnace failures prohibiting rehearsals. The younger children all had room parties where there were gift exchanges and in the lower grades, the presents that were sent by Pi Phi active and Alumnae Clubs. Mrs. Armstrong varied her custom of presenting the grade school children in an operetta by giving a Patriotic Pageant. While this did not use as many children it was colorful and timely. Both the basketball and football teams were feted at banquets and the juniors entertained the seniors at their annual affair. 52 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Several new pieces of equipment were added during the year: one electric sewing machine for the home economics department and a new mimeograph for the use of the teachers. After the new building was occupied, one of the vacant class rooms was fitted up for visual education and another room served for the Girl Scouts. Mr. Granitz .and his boys constructed a shed as an addition to the gymnasium dressing rooms from old materials secured from the Baptist Church. Some necessary repairs and painting were accomplished during the year by a cooperative effort of the Fraternity, which gave $200.00 to repairing the gym and hall with new plywood in the broken spots and labor for some painting. The County paid for the paint used and the students and teachers did some painting. At the Craft Shop there was a complete re-decorating of the Art room which was planned by Marilyn Jones and one of the student teachers. The girls enlisted the aid of their friends and worked long hours themselves. It has been quite the style to get the rooms freshened up. All of the class rooms and the hall in the elementary building were repainted and a number of the ones in the high school building. The roof of the old elementary building was finally painted after a wait of three years. For the second year the Franklin Square Magazine Agency returned the check that was sent to pay for the school magazine subscriptions. This check for $68.50 was a gift from them in recognition of the Pi Phi business during the years. Other gifts have been made by Alumnae Clubs and individuals in the form of books to the library. We have added several fine reference books which are memorials to Pi Phis. Commencement events went off well in the dignified manner that I think is a great credit to the school. First, for the Seniors, was their trip. This year the class and sponsors went to Florida on a circle tour for five days. It is always a highlight of the four years of school. We hold no exercises for the eighth grade but they did present a little play on Friday evening before the last week of school. Dr. Tames Wilder gave the Baccalaureate address in the Methodist Church. This was another first for the new pipe organ provided the instrumental music and was used to accompany the glee club girls when they sang. On Class night the alas and gowns were replaced with pretty formals for the girls and neat suits for the boys of the class of twenty-one. Before the Commencement pro-gram we entertained ten guests at the Dormitory at dinner. This is an annual courtesy that we extend to the sneaker of the evening, the, class sponsor, principal, the County Superintendent and this year our local school board member, Mr. Fred Ingle, and their wives. Rev. Roy Reece of the Methodist Church in Sevierville gave the address, and Mr. Seaton presented the diplomas. Awards were given the outstanding students by the American Legion, the P.T.A. and the Director of the school. P.T.A. The revenue from Bingo games was not as much as in former years so the organization has operated on a curtailed budget. Additional revenue came from three rummage sales that brought in three hundred and forty dollars. One hundred of this amount was used for the elementary school library. The other main project has been the operation of the school lunch room. The old coal range was replaced with an electric one. The Lions and Rotary Clubs each gave a hundred dollars towards this project. In order to qualify for federal and state funds the lunch room had to be enlarged and improved. This involved turning.1 store room into a dining room and the building of storage shelves in the kitchen. Where so many children ride the school bus, leaving home at an early hour and sometimes not getting home until late, the hot lunch program is a great asset to a school. We are fortunate in having a group of interested people who will spend the time and energy to carry on a hot lunch programsuccessfully. Many free Iwslches are given during the year to children who cannot afford the daily twenty-five cent cost. The last payment was made on the large Hobart electric mixer that was purchased last year. City water was turned into the system in the fall. Dormitory We started the school year with three new girls and four boys. The boys were like the ten little Indians for now we have none ! Two found that they had to work at home, one enlisted in the air corps and the fourth one I had to send home since he would not obey rules. The number of girls increased to five during the year. I chaperoned them at Stuart until Lillian came in February. Most of the girls could not have a high school education if they did not live at the school. They are learning many things from working under Miss Hodgen and from their association with Lillian. Last winter, Arlie and Neal painted the interior of Stuart. Tina designed some new curtains for the house, Miss Hodgen wove the yardage and Mrs. Jones made them up. We bought new bedspreads and think the house is most attractive. The school family has been smaller than usual this year. We were glad to have Mr. Granitz board with us until his wife could be released from her position and they established their home in an apartment up in the Assembly grounds. Mr. Schoolfield, one of the student teachers, lived at the school for the six weeks that his group was in town. Two piano teachers have used Stuart as a piano studio. Their private pupils came over from school during school hours for their lessons. Health Center The year has been a busy one with the health center having been put to many uses. Many lives have been touched and helped by the services offered by our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, and the facilities of our health program. The State Mobile T.B. Unit used the Health Center for three clinics held during the year. Last summer two pre-school clinics were held in the building. One of these was for the rural children who were brought in for their examinations in the school bus. Some of the mothers came along when the children were shy. After days in school, when the nurse is found to be a friend in need this shyness wears off and all their cuts and bruises are taken to the nurse as a matter of course. Three rural schools are serviced by our nurse as well as the five hundred children in the school here. On Friday afternoon there is a well baby and pre-natal clinic for anyone interested. Marjorie has been active in plans for Civilian Defense and Community Health in case of bombings. Gatlinburg is not thought to be a likely target but might be used as a center to care for wounded from other areas such as Oak Ridge or Alcoa. Marjorie was chosen to represent Sevier County at a short course given by the Knoxville Red Cross Chapter in nursing in atomic cases. She has held classes in First Aid for 'Girl Scouts and now has a weekly class for some of the American Legion Auxiliary members. We have again been helped in our work by Sigma Phi Gamma International Sorority. Their national organization gave us $87.00 and several chapters have added THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 to that with gifts of money and supplies. The Ponca City, Oklahoma chapter sent ten dollars that Marjorie used for necessary x-rays for a needy boy. Other than that the money sent was used for eye corrections and helped to pay for glasses for a number of children who could not otherwise have afforded them. Seattle and Pendleton, Oregon, chapters sent gifts of $25.00 each. Among our own chapters and clubs, a check for $14.00 from May L. Keller Alumni Club of Richmond was sent for pictures to show dental care. New eye and ear charts were purchased from a five dollar check that Mrs. T. C. Bowles from Glendale, California, sent in memory of Louise Spalding Malin. The Westchester Alumnx Club have made layettes for us, a very much appreciated gift. Babies are a never failing crop in the mountains! The farmer is always at the mercy of the weather. We can do nothing about it but prepare for sudden changes and make the best of conditions. Our new modern chicken houses paid off well during an especially cold winter. We were about the only people around who had any eggs and commanded excellent prices from the Mountain View Hotel and Carl's Market as well as having all we needed for the kitchen. We keep a few pigs and still have our two old mules. They are useful for getting wood down from the hills and are rented out to local people who want small plowing jobs done. Richard Watson cares for our livestock and garden. He takes pride in having fine chickens, eggs, and vegetables for our table as well as flowers to deck the shop. On Sunday he is the minister in the little Glades Church. Arrow Craft Shop Business at Arrow Craft has gone along as usual. Mrs. Snow filled larger orders and more of them for alumnae clubs and active chapters than ever before. Mrs. McCutchan operated the shop in the Mountain View Hotel, suiting her hours for keeping open to the time that most of the guests would be in the lobby. Two important changes in personnel have occurred during the year. The first one was when Lura Owenby Porter left on January first to establish her home in Kentucky with her doctor husband. She had been with the shop for 16 years and knew the weavers and their families very well. They all co-operated with Mrs. McMorran and the girls in the shop to make the annual Christmas party of the Weavers a memorable farewell one for her. It was held at Stuart with refreshments served at Pollard. A lovely electric mixer was the gift that was presented to her by the group. Wanda Ogle moved from the selling end to production and has worked out well as a helper for Mrs. McMorran. The second change came June first when Hattie Trentham left the shop to devote her time to the operation of her tourist facilities. She was greatly missed but Margaret Ogle, a graduate of the school and daughter of Mertie who was our laundress for years, took that position. Tina has worked out some lovely new designs that will be in the next price list. These include a mother and daughter apron set, a party apron with metallic threads, several new towels in colored linen and a pure white one, seamless bags, a formal luncheon set in white and silver, wool dirndl skirts and some new scarfs. A recognition of the quality of the weavings produced and sold by the shop came recently when the Tennessee Education Association asked us to supply them with a small exhibit for the Tennessee headquarters room at the National Education Association to be held in San Francisco this summer. Since this is the only craft exhibit to be shown, we feel honored that our school was chosen to represent the state at this important meeting. Other Uses for Our Buildings and Grounds In addition to the school being used for church services, several other outside events made use of our facilities. Our own Workshop in Crafts should not be called "outside" for it is sponsored jointly by us and the University of Tennessee. All of our equipment, plus much from the University, is used to make that project a success. Last summer marked the sixth annual Workshop. Students came from twenty-five states, including quite a number from Tennessee. New Mexico was the most remote but ,Texas also was rep-resented. The class of work done by the students was exceptionally high. Two Open House evenings were held, one at the close of each half session. Over three hundred guests came at the last evening, to watch the demonstrations ' and to see the lovely pieces of jewelry, metal work, pottery and weaving that had been made during .the Workshop. We were glad to have a Pi Phi weaving teacher and two graduate assistants as well as several Pi Phi representatives among the students. For the third consecutive year the Craftsman's Fair of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild was held on our grounds. Financially, it was the most successful one ever held for instead of being in the red there was a profit of $4,000.00. Seventy-eight individuals and centers were represented in the exhibits which were beautifully displayed in the high school building. There were 103 demonstrators working at 22 different crafts. The folk dancing and ballad singing exhibitions were always well attended and when there was audience participation the stage was taxed to accommodate the crowds. Demonstrators and Dancers were housed in our Workshop dormitories. Another activity of the summer was that of the Gateway Stock Company engagement. Mr. Richards brought young students from the N. Y. Academy of Dramatic Arts and gave a repertoire of plays five nights a week. Our Auditorium serves as the theater and a class room is used for dressing rooms by making a division in the center of it. This does not work too well, especially in wet weather for there is no inside passageway. On Friday nights the P.T.A. sponsored their Bingo games. In November a Folk Festival sponsored by the Council of Southern Mountain Workers was held at the school. This marked quite an advance in that the School Board voted to allow the dancing to be held in a school that receives County funds. Reviewing the events of this busy year, I am again mindful of the wonderful cooperation that I have received from the local staff, Grand Council, and the members of the Settlement School Committee. I wish to express appreciation and thanks to our members who have sent gifts to the school for they help to bring pleasure to so many and give us the joy of representing them in giving. The contacts with visiting Pi Phis have been pleasant.
