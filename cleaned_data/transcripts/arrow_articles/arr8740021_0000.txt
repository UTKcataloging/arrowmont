Sing Holds Phi Beta Kappa Is Exciting Moments Chartered At Purdue by ROBIN COLBY, Indiana Beta Indiana Delta hosted a luncheon on February 23, 1971, at the chartering of Purdue University's Phi Beta Kappa chapter. Three Purdue faculty members received honorary membership in the new organization on campus. One of the Purdue alumni up for an honorary membership is Patricia Graham, an associate professor of history of education at Colur*a University. She was graduated from Purdue with highest distinction in 1955, and received her master's degree in history in 1958. Patricia Graham was an especially honored guest at the Pi Phi luncheon, since she was a Pi Beta Phi herself while at Purdue. The chapter also had the distinction of having the most members initiated into Phi Beta Kappa. Three collegiate Pi Phis were accepted into member-ship: Sheryl Brenner, Bettina Marshall, and Lee Stone. One of the most exciting events held on the Indiana University campus is the annual I.U. Sing. Starting practice in January, the members of Indiana Beta and the men of Theta Xi pre-pared their performance of "If the People Only Knew." It was performed before a panel of judges and several hundred people. The entry was in the production category since it included choreography as well as singing. Winners in this group were judged on choreography, creativity, appearance, and musician-ship. The girls were dressed in white jump-suits with full black sleeves, while the boys wore black jump-suits with white full sleeves. Climax of the production came when various members of the group spelled the words, "People Please Peace." Highlight of the evening came when the en-try was announced as third place winner. 20 News of Edited by MARIANTHA JAMES WILLIAMS' Board of Governors Midge Gleeson, left, a student from Knoxville, Tenn., chats with Linda Buerge, a graduate assistant from Palos Verdes Peninsula, Calif., during the summer session, 1970.

C., began work as full-time Coordinator for the Arch-diocese of Cincinnati School System. In that capacity she serves the elementary school teachers who need much help in art teaching, and encourages a good program of art in the secondary schools, most of which do have art programs. Sister Elizabeth attended the 1970 summer session at Arrowmont. She has over 30 years experience in teaching arts and crafts on the high school and college levels. "The tremendous craftsmanship," said Sister Elizabeth, "which is evident in every part of Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts has served to inspire me to reach for the very ultimate in any art endeavor which I make. The love for the arts breathes in every part of the school and in all the faculty and students. I shall try to carry a spark of this enthusiasm into my work with our teachers." With a M.A. in art from the University of Notre Dame, she was well qualified to serve nine years as vice president and president of the Detroit Archdiocese Art Teachers Association, and four years as voluntary art consultant from Detroit Catholic Schools. Arch Gregory, his mother, Mrs. Tom Gregory, center, and Mrs. Arch Gregory, all enjoyed a textile design class together last summer. Mr. and Mrs. Arch Gregory are teachers in Long Island, and Mrs. Tom Gregory teaches crafts to adults in Chattanooga, Tenn. Many relatives and friends come from different parts of the country to be together while taking courses at Arrowmont. "As a beginning student in weaving," she says, "I have become more aware of the trials and the joys of a student first learning a craft. This is good. For a long while now I have been on the teaching end. Arrowmont has offered the opportunity for me to be a student again. "Among the student body there were many excellent teachers who enjoyed a time to be taught. Mingling with those fine teachers was a most inspiring and educative experience. "My own teaching should improve and I should have more to offer the teachers in our school system after having spent this time at Arrowmont." Mrs. Thora L. Gatwood, recreational director of Grove-port, Ohio, was scholarship recipient of the Columbus, Ohio, Alumnae Club last summer. A few months ago she was selected Outstanding Leathercrafter of Ohio for 1970, earning over three times as many points as her nearest competitor. Recently she was put in charge of the craft program for all six senior citizens' centers of Columbus. She will attend Arrowmont again this summer, receiving another scholarship from the Columbus club.

Martin, Arrowmont scholarship recipient last summer from the St. Louis Junior Alumnae Club, was responsible for setting up the arts and crafts program for the St. Louis County Juvenile Court about three years ago. He works with children from 9 to 16 years of age, with never more than seven to a class. The aim of the program is to give these children a freedom of expression through their creativity in individual projects. The freedom of expression is something they have never had before. Since the classes are held twice a day, afternoon and evening, the teacher almost becomes a psychiatrist. He finds that hostility in the children often prevents true accomplishments. An art major at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Mo., Mr. Martin had had experience in many areas. However, learning macrame and cloisonne at Arrowmont were particularly interesting to him. In writing of his Arrowmont stay, Mr. Mar-tin says, "Experience is skill or knowledge gained by actually doing, feeling or finding out a thing. Two weeks at Arrowmont meant all of these to me. Up until the day that I arrived, I had long forgotten just what it meant to experience total expression. My job as Art and Crafts instructor is interesting and challenging work. But Arrowmont gave me a chance to express myself fully, and to work with others doing the same. "The physical plant and beautiful grounds were truly inspirational. The knowledge gained in the varied arts and crafts seemed to stimulate everyone to produce, not only because it was expected, but because it became a part of you to Joseph Martin at potter's wheel. grasp all that was within reach. "It was an experience to work with all ages, and not recognize the age only recognizing different people willing to share something beautiful. "My job allows me to express myself, but my expression sometimes limits the student. Experience at Arrowmont reminded me that all who are involved with arts and crafts must be al-lowed to express themselves teacher and student alike. This expression that Arrowmont al-lows is an experience that has given me new perspective in the arts and crafts." Miss Helen Potter, in front of the new Emma Harper Turner Classroom Building of Arrowmont, holds a frame for her silk screen print. After spending twelve years in the summer workshops at Gatlinburg, she was thrilled with the beautiful new facilities. 23
