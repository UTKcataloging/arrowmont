NEWS F OM LITTLE PIGEON Ilt Edited by HARRIET GOODSELL RAUCH, 1OWa B Summer Workshop, 1950 Facing the door of the Home Economics room in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School building, is a large map of the United States which is dotted with colored thumb tacks. Above it, a neatly lettered strip says, "Where We Live." The tacks mark the towns and cities represented by the faculty and students enrolled in the Summer Workshop in Crafts and Community Recreation, held annually by the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and the University of Tennessee. This past summer the 69 dots were scattered over twenty-five states, with New Mexico the farthest from the concentration of dots around Knoxville and Gatlinburg. For six weeks the people represented by these colored dots, teachers, students, Home Demonstration Agents, physiotherapists and home craft devotees, lived, worked, and played together enjoying a unique educational experience. At the close of regular school we change over to the Workshop set-up. By utilizing every avail-able space in our three residence houses plus the converted Grade School Dormitory, we are able to house and feed the Workshop faculty and most of the students. Four University of Tennessee Home Economics Majors prepare the meals under the direction of a dietitian. At meel time the line forms army style and tables in three rooms and on the screened porch at Pollard Cottage are quickly filled. This free and easy companionship gives an opportunity for a widened acquaintance and exchange of ideas among the members of the group. Old friend-ships are renewed and new ones formed. Another transformation takes place in our high school building and in the little Emma Harper Turner Craft House as workrooms are arranged for the summer program, the buildings lending themselves very well to the Work-shop idea. The Home Economics room becomes the lounge or central meeting place for the group. Informal parties, stunt nights and movies are held here. One corner houses the office of the Director and in another corner is the library of craft books and magazines. Exhibits of out-standing crafts are displayed here. Last summer an Exhibition of Anni Albers' Textiles, on loan from the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, decorated the walls. The Sciencelaboratory is converted into a pottery studio and the Grace Coolidge Library is transformed into a lecture hall and exhibit room for the use of Mr. Allen Eaton. The beautiful examples of rural arts and crafts decorating the room coupled with the delightful personality of Mr. Eaton make this room a mecca for everyone. Across the .hall is the Recreational Class room and the Weaving studios occupy the music room and several other class rooms. The Jewelry and Metals classes are taught in the Craft house. Tables and benches under the trees pro-vide extra space for hammering and outdoor work for these classes. Last summer, these classrooms were presided over by a very able staff of instructors. Miss Marian Heard, Professor of Craft Design, at the University of Tennessee, again directed the Workshop and taught Advanced Jewelry. Miss Jane Glass who completed work on a master's degree at Columbia University last June taught the class in Metal Work and Advanced Recreational Crafts. A third University of Tennessee professor, Miss Helen Watson, taught the Recreation classes and had charge of the recreational activities for the whole group. Mrs. Barbara McDonald, Artist-Craftsman of McDonald Pottery, here in Gatlinburg, gave the Pottery instruction. Two outstanding weavers handled the different courses in Weaving. They were Berta Frey of New York City and our own Mary Elizabeth Starr Sullivan, Washington A. Allen Eaton, author of Handicrafts of the Southern Highlands and noted authority on Crafts, lectured on Craft Design. Miss Marguerite Horn,, Assistant Professor of Hotel Administration at Pennsylvania State College was the Dietitian. We had three graduate assistants Miss Wilbur Armistead who served as House Director for the Grade School Dormitory, Helen Becker and Marilyn Jones. The latter two were both Iowa State graduates and members of Iowa Gamma. WORK is the keynote of the whole experience but when it is done in pleasant surroundings, in the company of others who are vitally interested in the same things, it seems like play. Even with the workrooms being kept open three nights a week, there was a call for more time to WORK. One unusual and popular fea 163 ARROW Lms that were going on.
