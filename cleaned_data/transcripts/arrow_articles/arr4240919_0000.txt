        918 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI UNUSUAL WINTER SCENES IN TENNESSEE 919 NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by AGNES MILLER TURNER (MT'S. J. R.), 458 Rodney Ave., Portland, Ore. fl T has often been said that there are some things in this world that.go on forever, or at least are shining examples of perpetual motion. After eight months at the helm of the weaving at Gatlinburg, I am inclined to think that it is one of the things spoken of so favorably, or unfavorably, as you will. The march of the weavers toward the Teachers' Cottage be-gins almost before dawn in the winter, when the clays are short, and ends when darkness falls. If the women can't come them selves, they send their children with the demand, "Tell the weaving teacher mama is having trouble with her loom and to please come and help her." Such requests take me a mile up this creek, two miles up another creek to little crude two and three room houses, where the loom is as much a part of the furniture of the living room as the bed is, and where I am greeted by the thump, thump of the loom and a cheerful "take a cheear and set by the fire." Winter is the weaving time as soon as spring comes and it is time to put in the "crap," the women have to help plant and then later to hoe the corn and potatoes, the chief farm products raised around here. A mountain woman's life is a hard one with each day and hour filled to overflowing with ,work. It is not at all uncommon for a woman who has from four to seven children to care for to weave three and sometimes five guest towels in a day. One tired, sad looking little woman and her young daughter came to see me early one cold morning this winter. They had walked five miles with their hopes high to learn to weave. The woman's errand was told to me in these words. "I've worked hard all my life. I started to hoe corn and 'caters when I was a little 'un and I been hoeing ever since. I've had nine children, seven are WEAVERS AT LITTLE PIGEON Girl who makes pillow tops.

I've lived in, the same holler for twenty years sometimes I. think I'd like a sight. to change. When I heerd of this weaving I just thought I'd quit working in the field and let the young 'un do hit. I'm forty-four year old and I'm tired, so I aim to work inside now." About three o'clock in the afternoon after she had made her first forty yard warp, she turned to her daughter and said "Sally, hand me a chaw of 'baccer. I haint had nary all day." Then to me, "I jist caint get along without hit. I had dyspepsy onct and the doctor told me baccer was good for hit. I been chawing ever since I could walk." For some women like this one weaving is emancipation from tending the crop ; for others the money it brings means new shoes, a new dress for one of the children, a poke of meal for the family or a new and coveted piece of furniture. One energetic woman has built an attractive modern home with the proceeds from her weaving. An industry of such economic value to the community at large needs recognition and support. At present there are thirty homes in and around Gatlinburg where there are looms, with some homes having two and three. There would be many more if we could guarantee a market for their weaving the past year we have only taken a part of what they would have been able to do. This means, of course, that an enormous amount of weaving is brought for us to buy, besides what they sell through other agencies. When one considers that they weave a forty or sixty yard warp at one time and each woman *eaves from two to five warps in a winter, it is no wonder that our supply of towels, to say nothing of our other things, just grows, like "Topsy" did. On the days when the cooking and sewing class for the women is held we are always busy as they all bring a little. newspaper-wrapped bundle of weaving, six towels in one lot, a dozen in an-other one, their work since the last meeting. They are eager for new patterns and easier ways of doing things and are very responsive to any suggestions for improvement. It is a rare privilege and pleasure to work with them. To the school girls weaving is not a subject of such vital importance. It is a bit difficult and takes rather more patience than 92') THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the average adolescent girl is willing to expend. Sometimes a responsive chord is struck, as in the case of a bright fourteenyear-old girl in the class when she finished weaving her first guest towel. She said to me with great pride, "I paid for this with my own money and I am going to put it in a little trunk where I am keeping the things I .make all by myself. I have a little bag in it and now this towel." The community and the school are not the only places by any means where weaving is popular. The teachers and workers are smitten by the same strange malady. The bigger the better, is their motto. They certainly are ambitious. Looms grace their bed rooms and when all the extra space in them was taken up one loom was put in the attic of the Stuart Cottage. They are individual, too. Miss Evelyn has made a pink and white blanket for her adored niece's bed. Mrs. Dowell specializes in scarfs ; Helen Barret and Marion Folsom made dresses for themselves, Barbara Dewell is making sixteen yards of linen material a yard wide. Maggie White is the exception that proves the rule for nothing can induce her to weave. Neither has Mr. Mattil escaped the furore. He makes shuttles for his co-workers and even is drafted into the service of setting up looms. So it goes scarfs, towels and dresses are dashed up in an evening and each claims that she thoroughly enjoys doing it, even after teaching all day. No, I haven't a loom here. I never have time to weave. It is interesting to weave at a loom, as I do occasionally in one home, and have the girl at the other loom in the room sing ballads for me. It is interesting, too, to teach the father of the family to weave so he can employ his time to advantage when it is too rainy to carpenter. It is interesting to talk over local history or ask "How is the baby today" and, "Have you planted your flower seeds yet." It is a satisfaction to like your work. I think I can truthfully, and with a loud voice, say that weaving has been the most popular indoor sport in Gatlinburg this winter. WINOGENE REDDING NEWS FROM LnrtE, Picro.N 923, A CLASS FOR NURSES One of the outstanding characteristics of the people living in the Southern Mountains, (among many other very admirable traits), is a deep love of children. It's never a hardship for the children to take, care of younger brothers and sisters, in fact, they are usually want ing a new baby; and it's no trouble to the grown-ups to have big families, consequently the obstetrical problem is one that faces most Rural nurses. The worst phases of this problem are: the difficulty of obtaining doctors, who are scarce and overworked, and the inaccessibility of many of the homes. Fortunately the roads are improving every year ; though, on the other hand, the country doctor is getting scarcer. Under these circumstances, the women depend for the most part on "Granny women," or neighbors who have been "catched" in several instances, thus gradually acquiring some experience through being called on by the next friend in trouble, or possibly a mother, or grandmother with a grown-up family who feels the need of preparing herself to care for her immediate kin, consequently from experience, and "doctor books," is more fitted than others. Sometimes one of these women becomes quite expert, and teachers her daughter, and so on, but for the most part they don't seem to be following the profession from choice or calling, but rather from force or pressure of circumstances. For several years it seemed as though the active "granny wom MIDWIFE CLASS 924 THE ARROW Or PI BETA P I en" were all over seventy, and the problem of just what to do to better the situation remained unsolved; then it was decided to try h avmg a resident course of nine lessons, covering a period of three day's for about half a dozen women,--if possible, one from each creek or Con'Imunity, and having them stay in the Girls' Dormitory which was then vacant. The two doctors concerned recommended several whom they considered young, active and intelligent enough to do good work, and they were visited. Most had some reason for not coming, and since it was a great innovation we made all preparations necessary without. the least idea that anyone would come. Monday morning was cold and rainy, and about the time we decided to do some other work, one very skeptical but determined woman came. Like the minister who went on with his sermon though his audience consisted of only one man, we proceeded with the day's pAgram, and though the pupil was not exactly satisfied she decided to stick it out another day. As we were proceeding with the second day's program, the weather having cleared, two sisters drove up, so we had a synopsis of the first day, and continued. Each doctor devoted an afternoon to lecturing on some plase of the work, and here the questions asked, and the interest shown, was evidence that they were beginning to feel it was worth while. Before leaving, late the third afternoon, they admitted that they had been advised not to come, as all their friends claimed there was some trap about it to catch them for having "waited on" some cases, but having been reassured by the doctor they knew, whom in each instance they had made a special trip to see, they decided to risk it, and all three assured us they considered it well worth coming for. . . All three women are unusually fine, outstanding in their particular community, with a calm dignity and intelligence that we all admired and envied. They were given the State certificate, which gives them a better standing, and we hope that this course can be a yearly event. Boox Noms 925 BOOK NOTES BY DOROTHY K. CLEAVELAND, NEw YORK State Teachers College, Tahlequah, Oklahoma. "Elizabeth's Tower," by Margaret Weymouth Jackson, Michigan A, is just off the press of Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis. In this charming novel Mrs. Jackson has clone for North Dakota what Owen Wister did for Wyoming in writing "The Virginian." She has skillfully woven a story of character building and romance into an historical background and with an artist's touch has painted vivid pictures of life in North Dakota in the early nineties. After reading the sketch of Margaret Jackson's life which appears elsewhere in this issue of THE ARROW, the reader is able more fully to appreciate the story .of Elizabeth with the realization that the author herself loved the great wheat fields, the big stretches of prairie and the great out of doors described in "Elizabeth's Tower." The story concerns the life and adventures of a little orphan girl who made her home with an aunt and uncle on a wheat farm in North Dakota and later made her way in a small frontier town. With remarkable force of character she became "A tower of strength, the very embodiment of courage," with all the "weak and broken crawling to this tower, escaping from their enemies, running to her for strength." In this, her first novel, Margaret Jackson portrays a realism that appeals to the interest of the reader that carries her into the story and makes her experience the emotions of the characters. With a simple, direct style she forcefully portrays the cruelties of fate and the drab realities of life, but through it all there is a flush of romance, a glow of hope and courage reflected froin the tower built of "great blocks and masses of torn sunset"

I've lived in, the same holler for twenty years sometimes I. think I'd like a sight. to change. When I heerd of this weaving I just thought I'd quit working in the field and let the young 'un do hit. I'm forty-four year old and I'm tired, so I aim to work inside now." About three o'clock in the afternoon after she had made her first forty yard warp, she turned to her daughter and said "Sally, hand me a chaw of 'baccer. I haint had nary all day." Then to me, "I jist caint get along without hit. I had dyspepsy onct and the doctor told me baccer was good for hit. I been chawing ever since I could walk." For some women like this one weaving is emancipation from tending the crop ; for others the money it brings means new shoes, a new dress for one of the children, a poke of meal for the family or a new and coveted piece of furniture. One energetic woman has built an attractive modern home with the proceeds from her weaving. An industry of such economic value to the community at large needs recognition and support. At present there are thirty homes in and around Gatlinburg where there are looms, with some homes having two and three. There would be many more if we could guarantee a market for their weaving the past year we have only taken a part of what they would have been able to do. This means, of course, that an enormous amount of weaving is brought for us to buy, besides what they sell through other agencies. When one considers that they weave a forty or sixty yard warp at one time and each woman *eaves from two to five warps in a winter, it is no wonder that our supply of towels, to say nothing of our other things, just grows, like "Topsy" did. On the days when the cooking and sewing class for the women is held we are always busy as they all bring a little. newspaper-wrapped bundle of weaving, six towels in one lot, a dozen in an-other one, their work since the last meeting. They are eager for new patterns and easier ways of doing things and are very responsive to any suggestions for improvement. It is a rare privilege and pleasure to work with them. To the school girls weaving is not a subject of such vital importance. It is a bit difficult and takes rather more patience than 92') THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the average adolescent girl is willing to expend. Sometimes a responsive chord is struck, as in the case of a bright fourteenyear-old girl in the class when she finished weaving her first guest towel. She said to me with great pride, "I paid for this with my own money and I am going to put it in a little trunk where I am keeping the things I .make all by myself. I have a little bag in it and now this towel." The community and the school are not the only places by any means where weaving is popular. The teachers and workers are smitten by the same strange malady. The bigger the better, is their motto. They certainly are ambitious. Looms grace their bed rooms and when all the extra space in them was taken up one loom was put in the attic of the Stuart Cottage. They are individual, too. Miss Evelyn has made a pink and white blanket for her adored niece's bed. Mrs. Dowell specializes in scarfs ; Helen Barret and Marion Folsom made dresses for themselves, Barbara Dewell is making sixteen yards of linen material a yard wide. Maggie White is the exception that proves the rule for nothing can induce her to weave. Neither has Mr. Mattil escaped the furore. He makes shuttles for his co-workers and even is drafted into the service of setting up looms. So it goes scarfs, towels and dresses are dashed up in an evening and each claims that she thoroughly enjoys doing it, even after teaching all day. No, I haven't a loom here. I never have time to weave. It is interesting to weave at a loom, as I do occasionally in one home, and have the girl at the other loom in the room sing ballads for me. It is interesting, too, to teach the father of the family to weave so he can employ his time to advantage when it is too rainy to carpenter. It is interesting to talk over local history or ask "How is the baby today" and, "Have you planted your flower seeds yet." It is a satisfaction to like your work. I think I can truthfully, and with a loud voice, say that weaving has been the most popular indoor sport in Gatlinburg this winter. WINOGENE REDDING NEWS FROM LnrtE, Picro.N 923, A CLASS FOR NURSES One of the outstanding characteristics of the people living in the Southern Mountains, (among many other very admirable traits), is a deep love of children. It's never a hardship for the children to take, care of younger brothers and sisters, in fact, they are usually want ing a new baby; and it's no trouble to the grown-ups to have big families, consequently the obstetrical problem is one that faces most Rural nurses. The worst phases of this problem are: the difficulty of obtaining doctors, who are scarce and overworked, and the inaccessibility of many of the homes. Fortunately the roads are improving every year ; though, on the other hand, the country doctor is getting scarcer. Under these circumstances, the women depend for the most part on "Granny women," or neighbors who have been "catched" in several instances, thus gradually acquiring some experience through being called on by the next friend in trouble, or possibly a mother, or grandmother with a grown-up family who feels the need of preparing herself to care for her immediate kin, consequently from experience, and "doctor books," is more fitted than others. Sometimes one of these women becomes quite expert, and teachers her daughter, and so on, but for the most part they don't seem to be following the profession from choice or calling, but rather from force or pressure of circumstances. For several years it seemed as though the active "granny wom MIDWIFE CLASS 924 THE ARROW Or PI BETA P I en" were all over seventy, and the problem of just what to do to better the situation remained unsolved; then it was decided to try h avmg a resident course of nine lessons, covering a period of three day's for about half a dozen women,--if possible, one from each creek or Con'Imunity, and having them stay in the Girls' Dormitory which was then vacant. The two doctors concerned recommended several whom they considered young, active and intelligent enough to do good work, and they were visited. Most had some reason for not coming, and since it was a great innovation we made all preparations necessary without. the least idea that anyone would come. Monday morning was cold and rainy, and about the time we decided to do some other work, one very skeptical but determined woman came. Like the minister who went on with his sermon though his audience consisted of only one man, we proceeded with the day's pAgram, and though the pupil was not exactly satisfied she decided to stick it out another day. As we were proceeding with the second day's program, the weather having cleared, two sisters drove up, so we had a synopsis of the first day, and continued. Each doctor devoted an afternoon to lecturing on some plase of the work, and here the questions asked, and the interest shown, was evidence that they were beginning to feel it was worth while. Before leaving, late the third afternoon, they admitted that they had been advised not to come, as all their friends claimed there was some trap about it to catch them for having "waited on" some cases, but having been reassured by the doctor they knew, whom in each instance they had made a special trip to see, they decided to risk it, and all three assured us they considered it well worth coming for. . . All three women are unusually fine, outstanding in their particular community, with a calm dignity and intelligence that we all admired and envied. They were given the State certificate, which gives them a better standing, and we hope that this course can be a yearly event. Boox Noms 925 BOOK NOTES BY DOROTHY K. CLEAVELAND, NEw YORK State Teachers College, Tahlequah, Oklahoma. "Elizabeth's Tower," by Margaret Weymouth Jackson, Michigan A, is just off the press of Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis. In this charming novel Mrs. Jackson has clone for North Dakota what Owen Wister did for Wyoming in writing "The Virginian." She has skillfully woven a story of character building and romance into an historical background and with an artist's touch has painted vivid pictures of life in North Dakota in the early nineties. After reading the sketch of Margaret Jackson's life which appears elsewhere in this issue of THE ARROW, the reader is able more fully to appreciate the story .of Elizabeth with the realization that the author herself loved the great wheat fields, the big stretches of prairie and the great out of doors described in "Elizabeth's Tower." The story concerns the life and adventures of a little orphan girl who made her home with an aunt and uncle on a wheat farm in North Dakota and later made her way in a small frontier town. With remarkable force of character she became "A tower of strength, the very embodiment of courage," with all the "weak and broken crawling to this tower, escaping from their enemies, running to her for strength." In this, her first novel, Margaret Jackson portrays a realism that appeals to the interest of the reader that carries her into the story and makes her experience the emotions of the characters. With a simple, direct style she forcefully portrays the cruelties of fate and the drab realities of life, but through it all there is a flush of romance, a glow of hope and courage reflected froin the tower built of "great blocks and masses of torn sunset"
