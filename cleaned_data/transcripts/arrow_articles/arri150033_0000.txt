        Settfemen,t School CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE The Settlement School Committee exists for the purpose f carrying on, for Beta Phi Fraternity, the management f its Settlement School. It is responsible to the fraternity s a whole, under the direct supervision of Grand Council. is purpose is three-fold: 1. To stimulate interest, throughout the fraternity, in a :nowledge of the School, and to stimulate interest in makng contributions to the School. The resource areas pro-'ided by voluntary contributions from Active Chapters, alumnae 'Clubs, and individuals. 2. To budget, dispense, and account for the moneys [sed in maintaining the School. 3. To formulate the general educational and social poliies of the School. What is Settlement School today? It is .n Art and Crafts Center consisting of three Projects: 1. Arrowcraft Shop, which was started in 1925, revived n interest in the art of weaving and in native crafts. roday, Arrowcraft Shop ships handwoven articles and )then crafts to every state in America. 2. Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, which was started in 1945, is an outrowth of the interest in the promotion of handcrafts. Craft Workshop has proven its worth and has a valuable reputaion. It is well known and established nationally. 3. Other workshops have been offered for several years n the spring and fall to local citizens and craftsmen, and lave been most successful. Settlement School today is the oundation upon which the Centennial Fund Project will )e established. This project will be a Craft Workshop )rogram expanded to a year round program. Settlement school Committee therefore has a responsibility to keep he present program up to the high standards associated with the name of Pi Beta Phi. The committee cannot wait o improve the present program, it must be started this rear and this means that Settlement School must have continued support from 'Clubs and Chapters. iere are the reasons why Settlement School needs more upport from the fraternity: 1. There is immediate need for better housing for older ;tudents who wish to attend Craft Workshop. Pollard, an Ad farm house, is only a makeshift dormitory, it no long-!r serves the need, it does not meet the standards of adeluate housing. 2. There is immediate need for building of the Ceramic Wing to house the pottery classes. Each year at the close )f the Elementary School year in June, the maintenance nen race to install the equipment for the pottery classes in he Old High School building. This requires the installa-:ion of two large sinks, transporting the heavy kilns and )they equipment from the old barns where they are all stored during the winter. All of this has to be dismantled at :he end of 'Craft Workshop and placed in storage again. This has been the practice for 21 years. 3. All Craft Workshop equipment is getting old and )bsolete, it must be replaced to provide the best for stulents who do the best kind of craft work. 4. The original Craft Workshop program was equipped with army surplus furniture and supplies, and with sec-Dnd-hand equipment from the University of Tennessee. These articles have served the program well and have made it possible to grow into the present successful pro-gram. But all of these things have been used for 21 years, and are showing signs of hard wear. 5. Salaries have to be increased to meet present day stanlards. 6. Scholarships must be provided for six Assistants to :raft Workshop. 7. There is need to increase Advertising of Craft Work-shop. 8. Maintenance of property includes: insurance, up-keep of buildings and grounds, utilities: lights, heat, water and telephone, and furnishings. 9. Salaries for special teachers provided by Pi Beta Phi to improve the rating of the Pi Beta Phi Elementary School in Music and Art and Crafts, Marion Heard, Di-rector of Summer Craft Workshop, told the .t.ettlement School 'Committee that the need for up-dating Craft Workshop is now Pi Beta Phi cannot put it off for two years or more. Members of Phi Beta Phi, won't you support this nationally established project, now under the name of Settlement School, with increased contributions starting in the fall of 1965? The May L. Keller Award for the outstanding program on Settlement School was given to Iowa Gamma for a skit called "Jist Sittin'." It is written in verse and cleverly covers craft workshop as the Centennial Fund Project. Contributions for 1964-65, I am sorry to report, were down. Total contributions for clubs and chapters $13,690.43 Active Chapter contributions 3,279.87 Alumnae Club contributions 10,440.56 The Settlement School Committee appreciates the loyal support of 97 chapters and 289 Alumnae clubs for their generous contributions. Please accept our deepest gratitude. In a small way, we show this gratitude to the chapters and clubs making the highest contributions by awarding Little Pigeons, hand carved walnut pins.

Chapters Clubs Both Gamma Alpha Pi Delta Pi North Epsilon Pi South Zeta Iota Mu Nu Xi Pi Arrowcraft Shop The Settlement School Committee extends its appreciation to all clubs and chapters for their continued support of Arrowcraft Shop by providing a market through sales. Sales of weaving articles continue to drop sales of crafts increase. Total sales for Arrowcraft Shop for 1964-65 have dropped about $7000.00. Arrowcraft Shop manager Maria Tate works constantly trying to find new attractive crafts that will sell. Our Weaving Designer conscientiiusly tries to offer new items and patterns in woven articles. Cost of threads has risen and there is the problem of keeping articles at prices that will sell. Many clubs had very successful sales this year and we send them our sincere thanks. Arrowcraft Shop needs the support of all Chapters and Clubs. We have an outstanding high quality of merchandise to offer people in all communities. Many new items have been added to the 1965-66 Price List. The new attractive Price List will be in the mails in August. Let's have an order from every Chapter and Club in 1965-66! We are proud to say that 37 clubs purchased and paid for $1000.00 and over of Arrowcraft articles and crafts, during the last fiscal year, May 31, 1964-May 31, 1965. Little Pigeon Awards of hand carved pins will be sent to the following ten Chapters in the fall for the highest remittances for purchases from Arrowcraft Shop. Michigan A $492.05 Main A $118.15 Maryland B 385.76 Vermont A 97.49 North Carolina B 281.24 Pennsylvania B 97.43 Alabama r 254.14 Massachusetts B 82.21 New York A 167.05 Connecticut A 73.89 Little Pigeon Awards of handcarved pins will be sent to the following clubs for the highest paid-for purchases.

The reward to these clubs is gratitude for helping to keep Pi Phi well known and recognized because of its wonderful Arrowcraft Shop project.

Support of Arrowcraft can be increased if every member of Pi Beta Phi through clubs or directly through Arrow-craft Shop would order gifts for any of the following occasions; anniversaries, weddings, birthdays, Christmas, Mother's Day, new babies and any other occasion when a beatuiful hand woven article is just right. Arrowcraft Shop Staff Maria Hutchins Tate, Florida Beta, has a a tremendous job as manager of Arrowcraft Shop but the says that she loves her work. As Manager, she keeps up the inventory, corresponds with Chapters and Clubs, supervises orders, work, with Weaving Designer and manages the Shop. We are grateful to her for the many long hours she works and for her concern for the success of Arrowcraft Shop. Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma, enjoys her work as manager of the Mountain View Shop. Faye Cook is head of shipping and is happy when the orders are large. Nella Cook is assistant to the Weaving De-signer and keeps the cost-accounting books up to date. She also keeps a file of all weaving patterns that are used by the weavers. Jean Hembree assists Faye Cook in shipping and is a sales girl in the shop. Other sales girls are June Parrott and 'Ruby Watson. Mrs. Grace Patterson, the book-keeper, is very efficient with figures. Pi Beta Phi is indebted to this wonderful staff for their loyalty and interest in making Arrowcraft Shop the successful project that it is. Craft Workshops Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, remains a unique association of a university and fraternity. Pi Beta Phi is indeed fortunate to be a part of the vanguard of the trend in the promotion of handcrafts. Craft Workshops serve a growing need in our society. Pi Beta Phi is making an outstanding contribution to higher education through offering opportunities for creative expression. Talented instructors give students the skills and techniques that can be used to help others develop their individual resources towards a useful life. The new folder and publicity in Holiday and Craft Horizons magazines were responsible for an increased enrollment at summer Craft Workshop. Marion Heard, Pi Beta Phi, Professor of Craft Design, the Director is an inspiring leader in the field of crafts and an excellent di-rector. Betty Street, M.S. Assistant Professor, University of Illinois, contributes to the success of the program through her ability as a craftsmen and as an administrator. Under the instruction of a talented faculty the following courses are offered: Jewelry, Weaving, Textile Design, Enameling, Recreational Crafts, Pottery, 'Craft Design and Vegetable Dyeing. Assistantship Scholarships were givgn to Actives, Joann Hansen, Texas Gamma, and Louise Bandy, Georgia Alpha. A graduate assistantship scholarship was given to Patricia Crowley, New Mexico Alpha. An Assistantship Scholar-ship was given to the daughter of a Pi Phi, Mary Elizabeth Sullivan from Berkeley, California. Two Graduate Assistantship Scholarships were given to non-Pi Phis. We are proud to announce: This year three Alumnae Clubs gave scholarships to students from their areas. Albuquerque club has given a scholarship for several years. This is the first year for the Buffalo Club and the Chicago West Sub-urban Club. We hope that there will be many more clubs presenting scholarships in the future, if clubs are interested in doing so, please, write to Marion Mueller, Director of Settlement School. Other Craft Workshops were held this spring in Weaving, Pottery, Jewelry, Design and Stitchery. Students were very happy with their work, many wish to continue next year. This is a valuable contribution to the cultural heritage of the Gatlinburg area. Dormitory Program was accepted by a number of boy! and girls over the year, varying from 11 to 16. They reTHE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI eived help and guidance when needed, encouragement to nish the school year, and the opportunity to participate in haracter building activities after school. Through the in-.'I.rest of Marion Mueller and Ruth Spelman, Illinois Epsi-Dn and housemother to the girls, guidance and counciling re given to each student. Students who are accepted to five in the dormitory are recommended by the public school taff and come on a voluntary basis. The lasting effect of his kind of an experience in the lives of these boys and iris cannot be measured. Health Center The same services were offered this ear, even though the nurse, Nancy Shilling became Mrs. ,ingerfelt. She served as nurse from July 1964 to May 965 when our dear Marjorie 'Chalmers, Illinois Beta-)elta, once again stepped in to fill the gap with her same ,rofession efficiency that has served Health Center for 30 ears. We are indeed grateful to her. The summary of the work covered for the past fiscal ear is as follows: Class of Work 'field Visits 111 )ffice Calls 3,194 ervice given 2,673 'otal triple vaccine: Dipththeria, Whooping Cough, Tetanus 39'5 ompleted series and boosters 291 olio prevention 249 'etanus Toxoid 237 mall Pox vaccinations 176 herapeutic inoculations 183 "uberculin tests 542 hest X-rays 446 hysical Examinations 313 Ludiometer tests 177 rision Tests 535 'eacher-nurse conferences 65 amily conferences 95 reschool round-ups two years 104 'otal Typhoid inoculations 412 Special Teachers provided by Pi Beta Phi to improve he public school rating of Pi Beta Phi Elementary School were for music and art and crafts. Two very fine teachers )rovided the children with rich experiences in these subects. Miss Nancy Thomas was the music teacher, Mrs. oan Oakley was the Art and Craft teacher. Both teachers vill return for the year 1965-66. Red Barn besides providing a dormitory for 32 stulents during Summer Craft Workshop, is in demand by roups for week-end retreats, spring and fall. The Red 3arn facilities are offered to religious, philanthropic and !ducational groups, and to Pi Beta Phi Chapters. There is t nominal rental fee to cover maintenance. Gifts and Legacies A check for $520.00 as a bequest rom the Ruth K. Shoudy Estate Santa Ana, California was .eceived in April 1965. This generous contribution was Ised to help pay for the new dishwasher which was instaled in Staff House to be used for Summer Craft Work-hop when 80 to 90 people are served each meal. An anonymous gift of $505.00 was sent to Settlement school to used toward the salary for an outstanding craft nstructor, a so-called "big-name instructor." This contribution made it possible to bring Charles Bartley Jeffery, Director of Art Education, Shaker Heights Schools, Cleve-and, Ohio, for a course in advanced enameling during the ;pedal Short Session of 'Craft Workshop, July 19 to July l3, 1965. Because of the demand for this course, enrollnent had to be closed. It is the hope of the Settlement school Committee that other members of Pi Beta Phi will vant to make gifts to be used to bring more leading :raftsmen to teach those students who wish to benefit rom the opportunity of studying under specialists in rafts. Being able to offer courses by "big-name" craftsnen enhances the reputation of our Craft Workshop, nationally. The Pasadena Club, through the generosity of a mem-)er who wishes to remain anonymous, presented Staff =louse with a beautiful pair of three branch silver candelaira to be used with the silver urn which was given in1954. Pi Phis can look into the lovely dining room at Staff House with pride, because the silver gifts honoring Edith Hoyer Rankin, the gifts from the Pasadena Club and the gifts from Ruth Spelman create an environment of dignity and beauty. This environment is enjoyed and appreciated by the students who come from all over the United States and from foreign countries. It is not possible to mention all the lovely gifts that have been sent to Settlement School during the year 1964-65, they have all been gratefully acknowledged and put to the best possible use. The Memorial Fund gifts totaled $321.79. Green Stamps are needed to purchase towels and sheets for the Summer Workshop students use. Please send them to Marion Mueller, Settlement School. General Information Maintenance of Settlement School buildings and property is kept to a high standard. There is always need for improvements and replacements. The three maintenance men, Neal Watson, Zanley Watson and Richard Watson take great pride in their responsibility of maintenance. The Fraternity is indebted to Marion Mueller, Indiana Gamma, for her loyal and devoted service as Director of Settlement School. A great deal of the success of Summer 'Craft Workshop is due to her work as registrar, to supervising the preparations that are necessary to its operation and, especially, her faith in its future. The other Work-shops held spring or fall are completely organized and ad-ministered by Marion. She gives many and long hours to keeping the Settlement School the most respected and valuable fraternity philanthrophy. Committee Members: Treasurer Salley Bosman Schneiter, Indiana Alpha, does a terrific job of keeping our financial business in order and recorded. We are grateful to her and her husband for a job well done. Secretary Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha, is doing a loyal job of recording our minutes and acknowledging contributions. She will continue as Secretary and also be in charge of publicity aand pictures for publicity. Editor of Little Pigeon News Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin Alpha, has done a wonderful job of keeping Pi Phis informed about Settlement School today, she will continue to send the news to Little Pigeon News. Movies and Slides Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, distributed films and slides to 85 chapters aand clubs during the year. We are happy to have this service so well received. Only Mrs. Rankin can handle the scheduling of slides and films. If clubs and chapters will follow the direction sent to them concerning mailing to the next group to receive the material, there will be no errors. Two clubs missed the opportunity of seeing a program because of negligence. Please, read the directions carefully and correspond with Mrs. Rankin when not received in time. Grand Council Contact member Evelyn Peters Kyle, Illinois Alpha, Grand Vice-President of Philanthropies became an active member of the committee when she at-tended the Annual meeting, held in Gatlinburg, June 24 to June 30'th. It is a pleasure to work with her keeping the greatest of all fraternity philanthropies, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, as a contribution to our American Heritage. It continues to be a rewarding and enjoyable experience for me to serve as Chairman of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee. I am deeply grateful for this opportu nity to be of service to the Fraternity. My wish is that every member of Pi Beta Phi might have the pleasure of visiting with the students who attend Summer Craft Workshop to her them praise this wonderful philanthropy and to see what an exhilarating spirit prevails. To continue to offer this cultural advantage, will require increased support now, for the next two years. Please reconsider the present needs of Settlement School as outlined in the opening of this report and make every contribution larger, in the year 1965-66. DOROTHY COLEMAN THORMAN THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT-1965 35 Those who were at Convention 1954 doubtless recall the presentation to Grand Council of the replicas of our Pi Beta Phi Founders. Since then these charming figurines have been at Settlement School where visiting Pi Phis could view them. As our Craft Workshop closed for the summer of 1965 my thoughts kept turning to our twelve Founders who pioneered, preserved, and succeeded in establishing a worth-while sorority with high ideals. Our history tells us how shocked the gentlemen of Monmouth College were when the ladies" first appeared in chapel wearing their Arrows. However, our twelve Founders were undaunted! Why do my thoughts turn to our Founders at this time? Because I have been bursting with pride at our successful craft workshop development. It seems so fitting that Pi Beta Phi should continue development of this program at Settlement School our memorial to our Founders. Our twenty-first Workshop with the University of Tennessee, figuratively speaking, was bursting out at the seams our largest one to date. Almost all classes had capacity enrollment, all beds were occupied most of the time, and our dining room required constant checking in order to assure the required service. The Open House, where the crafts were displayed most attractively, was the best ever and I am not exaggerating. The workmanship was out-standing due to the excellent calibre of the teachers under the guidance of Marian Heard, director. Many annual visitors literally were enraptured. Having seen thirteen Open Houses it is amazing to me how the quantity and quality have improved. Yes, our roots are deep with this summer project in the Smokies. However, until there are more facilities, we cannot expand. Anyone who follows the craft programs would realize there is growing competition in this field. Hence, we have to continue raising standards to teaching, housing, equipment, and all other facilities. With our present physical setup being shared with the .public school system, there is much shifting to do before and after any work shop, with the resulting expense of labor and wasted time. If we had a more permanent setup the efforts of shifting could be channeled to better advantage. There are two much-needed units a dormitory to replace Pollard which was a farmhouse when Pi Phi bought the land, and a pottery wing for the Loom House. With large classes it has required firing of the kilns all night and day for about two weeks. That requires close attention, hence is very wearing. So, a larger kiln is a much needed item when there is a permanent place for it. The personnel of summer workshop was most interesting with twenty-eight states and four foreign countries represented. There were numerous professions, too, among them teachers from all levels; several art instructors; an engineering student; a dentist who evidently is looking forward to retirement; a director of recreation for the blind; an occupational therapist; an extension specialist in home furnishings; a housewife who writes garden articles and lectures; an architect; a weaving designer; a librarian; several professional craftsmen; three high school students; college students both undergraduate and graduate. Of course, a few were retired, and there were several housewives. The resulting mingling was amazing. Almost all the students were highly pleased with their experience at workshop. The six assistants were outstanding girls Louise Bandy (Pi Beta Phi) from Georgia, Trish Crowly (Pi Beta Phi) from Albuquerque, Jo Hansen (Pi Beta Phi) from Texas, Ruth Lerud (who just completed her Masters Degree) from Minnesota, Ronene Prior from Ames, Iowa, and Elizabeth Sullivan, a Pi Phi daughter from California. The scholarships given by Alumnae Clubs Albuquerque, Chicago West Suburban, and Buffalo, New York, certainly boosted enrollment and set a good example for other Clubs. That is a wonderful way to spread first-hand information of workshop. One of our students who came for the first session onlywas a cripple who used two crutches. However, she found so much satisfaction in her work that she stayed for five weeks. In 1964 there was a student who had an amputated leg because of a progressive disease, her other leg was amputated this winter. After the amputation she had a slight stroke, however, she replied to my get-well note ". . . I wish I could have had another session with Miss Smith on the weaving. .. . I'm using the weaving as therapy now." During late winter and early spring there were five adult classes with an enrollment of fifty-two on our cam-pus. Here, too, there was a mingling of varied interests among the personnel. There were classes in design, stitch-cry, pottery, and weaving. I noticed many students remarking about what they wanted to do next year. When one pottery student was somewhat disappointed with her piece she said "if nothing else, it makes one appreciate crafts more." There is a certain satisfaction in creativity. Arrowcraft is an outlet for crafts from the Southern Highlands, and for weaving of approximately fifty weavers within a twelve mile area. We appreciate the response of Clubs and Active Chapters. In our Settlement school chair-man's report there will be more statistics; however, each sale (big or small) helps the grand total. Each Club should receive information from Manager Maria Tate (Florida Beta) , also, each Chapter. Constant effort is made to improve sales. Even though Arrowcraft has two sales-rooms, the Clubs are the nucleus of the business. The Dormitory program was again a challenge. Many facts could be given; also many stories of happenings. This is an immeasureable service that Pi Phi has given through the years. There were two dormitory boys and two girls who graduated from high school this year. One mother came in with tears in her eyes to pay the balance of her son's account and said "I shall be eternally grateful." One of the senior girls was an outstanding basketball player. Two years ago her mother had a heart attack while Linda was playing in the final tournament and only lived two hours. After graduation Linda wrote a note of appreciation to us. That was unusual. We know they are frequently appreciative, however, we can only tell it by the glint in their eyes. Two teachers were provided last year in the elementary grades. Joan Oakley taught Art and Crafts, and Nancy Thomas music. Both are teaching during 1965-1966. Considerable interest is shown by Civic groups in improving the public school. However, since the school is under County supervision, the local school probably will have only repair on the agenda even though as whole new building is needed. Naturally with the community growing Pi Phi will eventually discontinue all "missionary work." Over six hundred rooms were added to motel units in the area this year, so Gatlinburg can accommodate approximately thirteen thousand individuals even though the population is a mere twenty-three hundred. Two bypasses are being constructed around Gatlinburg. This will undoubtedly affect the tourist trade to a degree. Maintenance is a continuous business with thirteen buildings. With the Settlement School in the center of town I am sure all Pi Phis would agree we must have a well-kept appearance. Elopements with our housemaids seem to be an annual event that happening this summer and in 1964. The two nurses who succeeded Marjorie Chalmers (re-tired 1962) have both changed their names (each has married). Hence Marjorie was called in again May first to finish out the school year and to get all in readiness for the beginning of school. Because the County haS a new hospital and local doctor has a clinic, there seems to be less need for our school nurse. Hence, that service doubt-less will be taken care of by the County in the near future. Our Red Barn serves as dormitory for craft workshops, and also for retreats for educational religious or philanthropic groups. We closed during mid-winter to conserve on expense. The Red Barn has become well-known among 36 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI such groups, and has occupants from Texas to Maryland, and the Carolinas to Memphis. This report is very brief, yet if you would read between the lines you could see that we are never actually looking for something to do, it is a case of what to do next. To each Pi Phi or group who has contributed to Settlement School recognition has been given. However, again I wish to express appreciation because it encourages our morale to know that many members from afar are not for-getting. In conclusion it seems fitting to quote these lines from our Fifty Year History by Virginia Brackett Green: "It is with the calm reflection of things past that we set proper courses for the future. Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." MARION W. MUELLER PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE May 31, 1965 Accountants' Report Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We have examined the balance sheet of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as of May 31, 1965, and the related statements of income and expenses and fund balances for the year then ended. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

        THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI eived help and guidance when needed, encouragement to nish the school year, and the opportunity to participate in haracter building activities after school. Through the in-.'I.rest of Marion Mueller and Ruth Spelman, Illinois Epsi-Dn and housemother to the girls, guidance and counciling re given to each student. Students who are accepted to five in the dormitory are recommended by the public school taff and come on a voluntary basis. The lasting effect of his kind of an experience in the lives of these boys and iris cannot be measured. Health Center The same services were offered this ear, even though the nurse, Nancy Shilling became Mrs. ,ingerfelt. She served as nurse from July 1964 to May 965 when our dear Marjorie 'Chalmers, Illinois Beta-)elta, once again stepped in to fill the gap with her same ,rofession efficiency that has served Health Center for 30 ears. We are indeed grateful to her. The summary of the work covered for the past fiscal ear is as follows: Class of Work 'field Visits 111 )ffice Calls 3,194 ervice given 2,673 'otal triple vaccine: Dipththeria, Whooping Cough, Tetanus 39'5 ompleted series and boosters 291 olio prevention 249 'etanus Toxoid 237 mall Pox vaccinations 176 herapeutic inoculations 183 "uberculin tests 542 hest X-rays 446 hysical Examinations 313 Ludiometer tests 177 rision Tests 535 'eacher-nurse conferences 65 amily conferences 95 reschool round-ups two years 104 'otal Typhoid inoculations 412 Special Teachers provided by Pi Beta Phi to improve he public school rating of Pi Beta Phi Elementary School were for music and art and crafts. Two very fine teachers )rovided the children with rich experiences in these subects. Miss Nancy Thomas was the music teacher, Mrs. oan Oakley was the Art and Craft teacher. Both teachers vill return for the year 1965-66. Red Barn besides providing a dormitory for 32 stulents during Summer Craft Workshop, is in demand by roups for week-end retreats, spring and fall. The Red 3arn facilities are offered to religious, philanthropic and !ducational groups, and to Pi Beta Phi Chapters. There is t nominal rental fee to cover maintenance. Gifts and Legacies A check for $520.00 as a bequest rom the Ruth K. Shoudy Estate Santa Ana, California was .eceived in April 1965. This generous contribution was Ised to help pay for the new dishwasher which was instaled in Staff House to be used for Summer Craft Work-hop when 80 to 90 people are served each meal. An anonymous gift of $505.00 was sent to Settlement school to used toward the salary for an outstanding craft nstructor, a so-called "big-name instructor." This contribution made it possible to bring Charles Bartley Jeffery, Director of Art Education, Shaker Heights Schools, Cleve-and, Ohio, for a course in advanced enameling during the ;pedal Short Session of 'Craft Workshop, July 19 to July l3, 1965. Because of the demand for this course, enrollnent had to be closed. It is the hope of the Settlement school Committee that other members of Pi Beta Phi will vant to make gifts to be used to bring more leading :raftsmen to teach those students who wish to benefit rom the opportunity of studying under specialists in rafts. Being able to offer courses by "big-name" craftsnen enhances the reputation of our Craft Workshop, nationally. The Pasadena Club, through the generosity of a mem-)er who wishes to remain anonymous, presented Staff =louse with a beautiful pair of three branch silver candelaira to be used with the silver urn which was given in1954. Pi Phis can look into the lovely dining room at Staff House with pride, because the silver gifts honoring Edith Hoyer Rankin, the gifts from the Pasadena Club and the gifts from Ruth Spelman create an environment of dignity and beauty. This environment is enjoyed and appreciated by the students who come from all over the United States and from foreign countries. It is not possible to mention all the lovely gifts that have been sent to Settlement School during the year 1964-65, they have all been gratefully acknowledged and put to the best possible use. The Memorial Fund gifts totaled $321.79. Green Stamps are needed to purchase towels and sheets for the Summer Workshop students use. Please send them to Marion Mueller, Settlement School. General Information Maintenance of Settlement School buildings and property is kept to a high standard. There is always need for improvements and replacements. The three maintenance men, Neal Watson, Zanley Watson and Richard Watson take great pride in their responsibility of maintenance. The Fraternity is indebted to Marion Mueller, Indiana Gamma, for her loyal and devoted service as Director of Settlement School. A great deal of the success of Summer 'Craft Workshop is due to her work as registrar, to supervising the preparations that are necessary to its operation and, especially, her faith in its future. The other Work-shops held spring or fall are completely organized and ad-ministered by Marion. She gives many and long hours to keeping the Settlement School the most respected and valuable fraternity philanthrophy. Committee Members: Treasurer Salley Bosman Schneiter, Indiana Alpha, does a terrific job of keeping our financial business in order and recorded. We are grateful to her and her husband for a job well done. Secretary Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha, is doing a loyal job of recording our minutes and acknowledging contributions. She will continue as Secretary and also be in charge of publicity aand pictures for publicity. Editor of Little Pigeon News Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin Alpha, has done a wonderful job of keeping Pi Phis informed about Settlement School today, she will continue to send the news to Little Pigeon News. Movies and Slides Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, distributed films and slides to 85 chapters aand clubs during the year. We are happy to have this service so well received. Only Mrs. Rankin can handle the scheduling of slides and films. If clubs and chapters will follow the direction sent to them concerning mailing to the next group to receive the material, there will be no errors. Two clubs missed the opportunity of seeing a program because of negligence. Please, read the directions carefully and correspond with Mrs. Rankin when not received in time. Grand Council Contact member Evelyn Peters Kyle, Illinois Alpha, Grand Vice-President of Philanthropies became an active member of the committee when she at-tended the Annual meeting, held in Gatlinburg, June 24 to June 30'th. It is a pleasure to work with her keeping the greatest of all fraternity philanthropies, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, as a contribution to our American Heritage. It continues to be a rewarding and enjoyable experience for me to serve as Chairman of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee. I am deeply grateful for this opportu nity to be of service to the Fraternity. My wish is that every member of Pi Beta Phi might have the pleasure of visiting with the students who attend Summer Craft Workshop to her them praise this wonderful philanthropy and to see what an exhilarating spirit prevails. To continue to offer this cultural advantage, will require increased support now, for the next two years. Please reconsider the present needs of Settlement School as outlined in the opening of this report and make every contribution larger, in the year 1965-66. DOROTHY COLEMAN THORMAN THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT-1965 35 Those who were at Convention 1954 doubtless recall the presentation to Grand Council of the replicas of our Pi Beta Phi Founders. Since then these charming figurines have been at Settlement School where visiting Pi Phis could view them. As our Craft Workshop closed for the summer of 1965 my thoughts kept turning to our twelve Founders who pioneered, preserved, and succeeded in establishing a worth-while sorority with high ideals. Our history tells us how shocked the gentlemen of Monmouth College were when the ladies" first appeared in chapel wearing their Arrows. However, our twelve Founders were undaunted! Why do my thoughts turn to our Founders at this time? Because I have been bursting with pride at our successful craft workshop development. It seems so fitting that Pi Beta Phi should continue development of this program at Settlement School our memorial to our Founders. Our twenty-first Workshop with the University of Tennessee, figuratively speaking, was bursting out at the seams our largest one to date. Almost all classes had capacity enrollment, all beds were occupied most of the time, and our dining room required constant checking in order to assure the required service. The Open House, where the crafts were displayed most attractively, was the best ever and I am not exaggerating. The workmanship was out-standing due to the excellent calibre of the teachers under the guidance of Marian Heard, director. Many annual visitors literally were enraptured. Having seen thirteen Open Houses it is amazing to me how the quantity and quality have improved. Yes, our roots are deep with this summer project in the Smokies. However, until there are more facilities, we cannot expand. Anyone who follows the craft programs would realize there is growing competition in this field. Hence, we have to continue raising standards to teaching, housing, equipment, and all other facilities. With our present physical setup being shared with the .public school system, there is much shifting to do before and after any work shop, with the resulting expense of labor and wasted time. If we had a more permanent setup the efforts of shifting could be channeled to better advantage. There are two much-needed units a dormitory to replace Pollard which was a farmhouse when Pi Phi bought the land, and a pottery wing for the Loom House. With large classes it has required firing of the kilns all night and day for about two weeks. That requires close attention, hence is very wearing. So, a larger kiln is a much needed item when there is a permanent place for it. The personnel of summer workshop was most interesting with twenty-eight states and four foreign countries represented. There were numerous professions, too, among them teachers from all levels; several art instructors; an engineering student; a dentist who evidently is looking forward to retirement; a director of recreation for the blind; an occupational therapist; an extension specialist in home furnishings; a housewife who writes garden articles and lectures; an architect; a weaving designer; a librarian; several professional craftsmen; three high school students; college students both undergraduate and graduate. Of course, a few were retired, and there were several housewives. The resulting mingling was amazing. Almost all the students were highly pleased with their experience at workshop. The six assistants were outstanding girls Louise Bandy (Pi Beta Phi) from Georgia, Trish Crowly (Pi Beta Phi) from Albuquerque, Jo Hansen (Pi Beta Phi) from Texas, Ruth Lerud (who just completed her Masters Degree) from Minnesota, Ronene Prior from Ames, Iowa, and Elizabeth Sullivan, a Pi Phi daughter from California. The scholarships given by Alumnae Clubs Albuquerque, Chicago West Suburban, and Buffalo, New York, certainly boosted enrollment and set a good example for other Clubs. That is a wonderful way to spread first-hand information of workshop. One of our students who came for the first session onlywas a cripple who used two crutches. However, she found so much satisfaction in her work that she stayed for five weeks. In 1964 there was a student who had an amputated leg because of a progressive disease, her other leg was amputated this winter. After the amputation she had a slight stroke, however, she replied to my get-well note ". . . I wish I could have had another session with Miss Smith on the weaving. .. . I'm using the weaving as therapy now." During late winter and early spring there were five adult classes with an enrollment of fifty-two on our cam-pus. Here, too, there was a mingling of varied interests among the personnel. There were classes in design, stitch-cry, pottery, and weaving. I noticed many students remarking about what they wanted to do next year. When one pottery student was somewhat disappointed with her piece she said "if nothing else, it makes one appreciate crafts more." There is a certain satisfaction in creativity. Arrowcraft is an outlet for crafts from the Southern Highlands, and for weaving of approximately fifty weavers within a twelve mile area. We appreciate the response of Clubs and Active Chapters. In our Settlement school chair-man's report there will be more statistics; however, each sale (big or small) helps the grand total. Each Club should receive information from Manager Maria Tate (Florida Beta) , also, each Chapter. Constant effort is made to improve sales. Even though Arrowcraft has two sales-rooms, the Clubs are the nucleus of the business. The Dormitory program was again a challenge. Many facts could be given; also many stories of happenings. This is an immeasureable service that Pi Phi has given through the years. There were two dormitory boys and two girls who graduated from high school this year. One mother came in with tears in her eyes to pay the balance of her son's account and said "I shall be eternally grateful." One of the senior girls was an outstanding basketball player. Two years ago her mother had a heart attack while Linda was playing in the final tournament and only lived two hours. After graduation Linda wrote a note of appreciation to us. That was unusual. We know they are frequently appreciative, however, we can only tell it by the glint in their eyes. Two teachers were provided last year in the elementary grades. Joan Oakley taught Art and Crafts, and Nancy Thomas music. Both are teaching during 1965-1966. Considerable interest is shown by Civic groups in improving the public school. However, since the school is under County supervision, the local school probably will have only repair on the agenda even though as whole new building is needed. Naturally with the community growing Pi Phi will eventually discontinue all "missionary work." Over six hundred rooms were added to motel units in the area this year, so Gatlinburg can accommodate approximately thirteen thousand individuals even though the population is a mere twenty-three hundred. Two bypasses are being constructed around Gatlinburg. This will undoubtedly affect the tourist trade to a degree. Maintenance is a continuous business with thirteen buildings. With the Settlement School in the center of town I am sure all Pi Phis would agree we must have a well-kept appearance. Elopements with our housemaids seem to be an annual event that happening this summer and in 1964. The two nurses who succeeded Marjorie Chalmers (re-tired 1962) have both changed their names (each has married). Hence Marjorie was called in again May first to finish out the school year and to get all in readiness for the beginning of school. Because the County haS a new hospital and local doctor has a clinic, there seems to be less need for our school nurse. Hence, that service doubt-less will be taken care of by the County in the near future. Our Red Barn serves as dormitory for craft workshops, and also for retreats for educational religious or philanthropic groups. We closed during mid-winter to conserve on expense. The Red Barn has become well-known among 36 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI such groups, and has occupants from Texas to Maryland, and the Carolinas to Memphis. This report is very brief, yet if you would read between the lines you could see that we are never actually looking for something to do, it is a case of what to do next. To each Pi Phi or group who has contributed to Settlement School recognition has been given. However, again I wish to express appreciation because it encourages our morale to know that many members from afar are not for-getting. In conclusion it seems fitting to quote these lines from our Fifty Year History by Virginia Brackett Green: "It is with the calm reflection of things past that we set proper courses for the future. Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." MARION W.

It is responsible to the fraternity s a whole, under the direct supervision of Grand Council. is purpose is three-fold: 1. To stimulate interest, throughout the fraternity, in a :nowledge of the School, and to stimulate interest in makng contributions to the School. The resource areas pro-'ided by voluntary contributions from Active Chapters, alumnae 'Clubs, and individuals. 2. To budget, dispense, and account for the moneys [sed in maintaining the School. 3. To formulate the general educational and social poliies of the School. What is Settlement School today? It is .n Art and Crafts Center consisting of three Projects: 1. Arrowcraft Shop, which was started in 1925, revived n interest in the art of weaving and in native crafts. roday, Arrowcraft Shop ships handwoven articles and )then crafts to every state in America. 2. Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, which was started in 1945, is an outrowth of the interest in the promotion of handcrafts. Craft Workshop has proven its worth and has a valuable reputaion. It is well known and established nationally. 3. Other workshops have been offered for several years n the spring and fall to local citizens and craftsmen, and lave been most successful. Settlement School today is the oundation upon which the Centennial Fund Project will )e established. This project will be a Craft Workshop )rogram expanded to a year round program. Settlement school Committee therefore has a responsibility to keep he present program up to the high standards associated with the name of Pi Beta Phi. The committee cannot wait o improve the present program, it must be started this rear and this means that Settlement School must have continued support from 'Clubs and Chapters. iere are the reasons why Settlement School needs more upport from the fraternity: 1. There is immediate need for better housing for older ;tudents who wish to attend Craft Workshop. Pollard, an Ad farm house, is only a makeshift dormitory, it no long-!r serves the need, it does not meet the standards of adeluate housing. 2. There is immediate need for building of the Ceramic Wing to house the pottery classes. Each year at the close )f the Elementary School year in June, the maintenance nen race to install the equipment for the pottery classes in he Old High School building. This requires the installa-:ion of two large sinks, transporting the heavy kilns and )they equipment from the old barns where they are all stored during the winter. All of this has to be dismantled at :he end of 'Craft Workshop and placed in storage again. This has been the practice for 21 years. 3. All Craft Workshop equipment is getting old and )bsolete, it must be replaced to provide the best for stulents who do the best kind of craft work. 4. The original Craft Workshop program was equipped with army surplus furniture and supplies, and with sec-Dnd-hand equipment from the University of Tennessee. These articles have served the program well and have made it possible to grow into the present successful pro-gram. But all of these things have been used for 21 years, and are showing signs of hard wear. 5. Salaries have to be increased to meet present day stanlards. 6. Scholarships must be provided for six Assistants to :raft Workshop. 7. There is need to increase Advertising of Craft Work-shop. 8. Maintenance of property includes: insurance, up-keep of buildings and grounds, utilities: lights, heat, water and telephone, and furnishings. 9. Salaries for special teachers provided by Pi Beta Phi to improve the rating of the Pi Beta Phi Elementary School in Music and Art and Crafts, Marion Heard, Di-rector of Summer Craft Workshop, told the .t.ettlement School 'Committee that the need for up-dating Craft Workshop is now Pi Beta Phi cannot put it off for two years or more. Members of Phi Beta Phi, won't you support this nationally established project, now under the name of Settlement School, with increased contributions starting in the fall of 1965? The May L. Keller Award for the outstanding program on Settlement School was given to Iowa Gamma for a skit called "Jist Sittin'." It is written in verse and cleverly covers craft workshop as the Centennial Fund Project. Contributions for 1964-65, I am sorry to report, were down. Total contributions for clubs and chapters $13,690.43 Active Chapter contributions 3,279.87 Alumnae Club contributions 10,440.56 The Settlement School Committee appreciates the loyal support of 97 chapters and 289 Alumnae clubs for their generous contributions. Please accept our deepest gratitude. In a small way, we show this gratitude to the chapters and clubs making the highest contributions by awarding Little Pigeons, hand carved walnut pins. The 10 highest contributions were made by the following chapter. (The number in the bracket indicates the number of years of giving over $100.00 ,consecutively.)

Chapters Clubs Both Gamma Alpha Pi Delta Pi North Epsilon Pi South Zeta Iota Mu Nu Xi Pi Arrowcraft Shop The Settlement School Committee extends its appreciation to all clubs and chapters for their continued support of Arrowcraft Shop by providing a market through sales. Sales of weaving articles continue to drop sales of crafts increase. Total sales for Arrowcraft Shop for 1964-65 have dropped about $7000.00. Arrowcraft Shop manager Maria Tate works constantly trying to find new attractive crafts that will sell. Our Weaving Designer conscientiiusly tries to offer new items and patterns in woven articles. Cost of threads has risen and there is the problem of keeping articles at prices that will sell. Many clubs had very successful sales this year and we send them our sincere thanks. Arrowcraft Shop needs the support of all Chapters and Clubs. We have an outstanding high quality of merchandise to offer people in all communities. Many new items have been added to the 1965-66 Price List. The new attractive Price List will be in the mails in August. Let's have an order from every Chapter and Club in 1965-66! We are proud to say that 37 clubs purchased and paid for $1000.00 and over of Arrowcraft articles and crafts, during the last fiscal year, May 31, 1964-May 31, 1965. Little Pigeon Awards of hand carved pins will be sent to the following ten Chapters in the fall for the highest remittances for purchases from Arrowcraft Shop.

Support of Arrowcraft can be increased if every member of Pi Beta Phi through clubs or directly through Arrow-craft Shop would order gifts for any of the following occasions; anniversaries, weddings, birthdays, Christmas, Mother's Day, new babies and any other occasion when a beatuiful hand woven article is just right. Arrowcraft Shop Staff Maria Hutchins Tate, Florida Beta, has a a tremendous job as manager of Arrowcraft Shop but the says that she loves her work. As Manager, she keeps up the inventory, corresponds with Chapters and Clubs, supervises orders, work, with Weaving Designer and manages the Shop. We are grateful to her for the many long hours she works and for her concern for the success of Arrowcraft Shop. Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma, enjoys her work as manager of the Mountain View Shop. Faye Cook is head of shipping and is happy when the orders are large. Nella Cook is assistant to the Weaving De-signer and keeps the cost-accounting books up to date. She also keeps a file of all weaving patterns that are used by the weavers. Jean Hembree assists Faye Cook in shipping and is a sales girl in the shop. Other sales girls are June Parrott and 'Ruby Watson. Mrs. Grace Patterson, the book-keeper, is very efficient with figures. Pi Beta Phi is indebted to this wonderful staff for their loyalty and interest in making Arrowcraft Shop the successful project that it is. Craft Workshops Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, remains a unique association of a university and fraternity. Pi Beta Phi is indeed fortunate to be a part of the vanguard of the trend in the promotion of handcrafts. Craft Workshops serve a growing need in our society. Pi Beta Phi is making an outstanding contribution to higher education through offering opportunities for creative expression. Talented instructors give students the skills and techniques that can be used to help others develop their individual resources towards a useful life. The new folder and publicity in Holiday and Craft Horizons magazines were responsible for an increased enrollment at summer Craft Workshop. Marion Heard, Pi Beta Phi, Professor of Craft Design, the Director is an inspiring leader in the field of crafts and an excellent di-rector. Betty Street, M.S. Assistant Professor, University of Illinois, contributes to the success of the program through her ability as a craftsmen and as an administrator. Under the instruction of a talented faculty the following courses are offered: Jewelry, Weaving, Textile Design, Enameling, Recreational Crafts, Pottery, 'Craft Design and Vegetable Dyeing. Assistantship Scholarships were givgn to Actives, Joann Hansen, Texas Gamma, and Louise Bandy, Georgia Alpha. A graduate assistantship scholarship was given to Patricia Crowley, New Mexico Alpha. An Assistantship Scholar-ship was given to the daughter of a Pi Phi, Mary Elizabeth Sullivan from Berkeley, California. Two Graduate Assistantship Scholarships were given to non-Pi Phis. We are proud to announce: This year three Alumnae Clubs gave scholarships to students from their areas. Albuquerque club has given a scholarship for several years. This is the first year for the Buffalo Club and the Chicago West Sub-urban Club. We hope that there will be many more clubs presenting scholarships in the future, if clubs are interested in doing so, please, write to Marion Mueller, Director of Settlement School. Other Craft Workshops were held this spring in Weaving, Pottery, Jewelry, Design and Stitchery. Students were very happy with their work, many wish to continue next year. This is a valuable contribution to the cultural heritage of the Gatlinburg area. Dormitory Program was accepted by a number of boy! and girls over the year, varying from 11 to 16. They reTHE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI eived help and guidance when needed, encouragement to nish the school year, and the opportunity to participate in haracter building activities after school. Through the in-.'I.rest of Marion Mueller and Ruth Spelman, Illinois Epsi-Dn and housemother to the girls, guidance and counciling re given to each student. Students who are accepted to five in the dormitory are recommended by the public school taff and come on a voluntary basis. The lasting effect of his kind of an experience in the lives of these boys and iris cannot be measured. Health Center The same services were offered this ear, even though the nurse, Nancy Shilling became Mrs. ,ingerfelt. She served as nurse from July 1964 to May 965 when our dear Marjorie 'Chalmers, Illinois Beta-)elta, once again stepped in to fill the gap with her same ,rofession efficiency that has served Health Center for 30 ears. We are indeed grateful to her. The summary of the work covered for the past fiscal ear is as follows: Class of Work 'field Visits 111 )ffice Calls 3,194 ervice given 2,673 'otal triple vaccine: Dipththeria, Whooping Cough, Tetanus 39'5 ompleted series and boosters 291 olio prevention 249 'etanus Toxoid 237 mall Pox vaccinations 176 herapeutic inoculations 183 "uberculin tests 542 hest X-rays 446 hysical Examinations 313 Ludiometer tests 177 rision Tests 535 'eacher-nurse conferences 65 amily conferences 95 reschool round-ups two years 104 'otal Typhoid inoculations 412 Special Teachers provided by Pi Beta Phi to improve he public school rating of Pi Beta Phi Elementary School were for music and art and crafts. Two very fine teachers )rovided the children with rich experiences in these subects. Miss Nancy Thomas was the music teacher, Mrs. oan Oakley was the Art and Craft teacher. Both teachers vill return for the year 1965-66. Red Barn besides providing a dormitory for 32 stulents during Summer Craft Workshop, is in demand by roups for week-end retreats, spring and fall. The Red 3arn facilities are offered to religious, philanthropic and !ducational groups, and to Pi Beta Phi Chapters. There is t nominal rental fee to cover maintenance. Gifts and Legacies A check for $520.00 as a bequest rom the Ruth K. Shoudy Estate Santa Ana, California was .eceived in April 1965. This generous contribution was Ised to help pay for the new dishwasher which was instaled in Staff House to be used for Summer Craft Work-hop when 80 to 90 people are served each meal. An anonymous gift of $505.00 was sent to Settlement school to used toward the salary for an outstanding craft nstructor, a so-called "big-name instructor." This contribution made it possible to bring Charles Bartley Jeffery, Director of Art Education, Shaker Heights Schools, Cleve-and, Ohio, for a course in advanced enameling during the ;pedal Short Session of 'Craft Workshop, July 19 to July l3, 1965. Because of the demand for this course, enrollnent had to be closed. It is the hope of the Settlement school Committee that other members of Pi Beta Phi will vant to make gifts to be used to bring more leading :raftsmen to teach those students who wish to benefit rom the opportunity of studying under specialists in rafts. Being able to offer courses by "big-name" craftsnen enhances the reputation of our Craft Workshop, nationally. The Pasadena Club, through the generosity of a mem-)er who wishes to remain anonymous, presented Staff =louse with a beautiful pair of three branch silver candelaira to be used with the silver urn which was given in1954. Pi Phis can look into the lovely dining room at Staff House with pride, because the silver gifts honoring Edith Hoyer Rankin, the gifts from the Pasadena Club and the gifts from Ruth Spelman create an environment of dignity and beauty. This environment is enjoyed and appreciated by the students who come from all over the United States and from foreign countries. It is not possible to mention all the lovely gifts that have been sent to Settlement School during the year 1964-65, they have all been gratefully acknowledged and put to the best possible use. The Memorial Fund gifts totaled $321.79. Green Stamps are needed to purchase towels and sheets for the Summer Workshop students use. Please send them to Marion Mueller, Settlement School. General Information Maintenance of Settlement School buildings and property is kept to a high standard. There is always need for improvements and replacements. The three maintenance men, Neal Watson, Zanley Watson and Richard Watson take great pride in their responsibility of maintenance. The Fraternity is indebted to Marion Mueller, Indiana Gamma, for her loyal and devoted service as Director of Settlement School. A great deal of the success of Summer 'Craft Workshop is due to her work as registrar, to supervising the preparations that are necessary to its operation and, especially, her faith in its future. The other Work-shops held spring or fall are completely organized and ad-ministered by Marion. She gives many and long hours to keeping the Settlement School the most respected and valuable fraternity philanthrophy. Committee Members: Treasurer Salley Bosman Schneiter, Indiana Alpha, does a terrific job of keeping our financial business in order and recorded. We are grateful to her and her husband for a job well done. Secretary Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha, is doing a loyal job of recording our minutes and acknowledging contributions. She will continue as Secretary and also be in charge of publicity aand pictures for publicity. Editor of Little Pigeon News Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin Alpha, has done a wonderful job of keeping Pi Phis informed about Settlement School today, she will continue to send the news to Little Pigeon News. Movies and Slides Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, distributed films and slides to 85 chapters aand clubs during the year. We are happy to have this service so well received. Only Mrs. Rankin can handle the scheduling of slides and films. If clubs and chapters will follow the direction sent to them concerning mailing to the next group to receive the material, there will be no errors. Two clubs missed the opportunity of seeing a program because of negligence. Please, read the directions carefully and correspond with Mrs. Rankin when not received in time. Grand Council Contact member Evelyn Peters Kyle, Illinois Alpha, Grand Vice-President of Philanthropies became an active member of the committee when she at-tended the Annual meeting, held in Gatlinburg, June 24 to June 30'th. It is a pleasure to work with her keeping the greatest of all fraternity philanthropies, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, as a contribution to our American Heritage. It continues to be a rewarding and enjoyable experience for me to serve as Chairman of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee. I am deeply grateful for this opportu nity to be of service to the Fraternity. My wish is that every member of Pi Beta Phi might have the pleasure of visiting with the students who attend Summer Craft Workshop to her them praise this wonderful philanthropy and to see what an exhilarating spirit prevails. To continue to offer this cultural advantage, will require increased support now, for the next two years. Please reconsider the present needs of Settlement School as outlined in the opening of this report and make every contribution larger, in the year 1965-66. DOROTHY COLEMAN THORMAN THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT-1965 35 Those who were at Convention 1954 doubtless recall the presentation to Grand Council of the replicas of our Pi Beta Phi Founders. Since then these charming figurines have been at Settlement School where visiting Pi Phis could view them. As our Craft Workshop closed for the summer of 1965 my thoughts kept turning to our twelve Founders who pioneered, preserved, and succeeded in establishing a worth-while sorority with high ideals. Our history tells us how shocked the gentlemen of Monmouth College were when the ladies" first appeared in chapel wearing their Arrows. However, our twelve Founders were undaunted! Why do my thoughts turn to our Founders at this time? Because I have been bursting with pride at our successful craft workshop development. It seems so fitting that Pi Beta Phi should continue development of this program at Settlement School our memorial to our Founders. Our twenty-first Workshop with the University of Tennessee, figuratively speaking, was bursting out at the seams our largest one to date. Almost all classes had capacity enrollment, all beds were occupied most of the time, and our dining room required constant checking in order to assure the required service. The Open House, where the crafts were displayed most attractively, was the best ever and I am not exaggerating. The workmanship was out-standing due to the excellent calibre of the teachers under the guidance of Marian Heard, director. Many annual visitors literally were enraptured. Having seen thirteen Open Houses it is amazing to me how the quantity and quality have improved. Yes, our roots are deep with this summer project in the Smokies. However, until there are more facilities, we cannot expand. Anyone who follows the craft programs would realize there is growing competition in this field. Hence, we have to continue raising standards to teaching, housing, equipment, and all other facilities. With our present physical setup being shared with the .public school system, there is much shifting to do before and after any work shop, with the resulting expense of labor and wasted time. If we had a more permanent setup the efforts of shifting could be channeled to better advantage. There are two much-needed units a dormitory to replace Pollard which was a farmhouse when Pi Phi bought the land, and a pottery wing for the Loom House. With large classes it has required firing of the kilns all night and day for about two weeks. That requires close attention, hence is very wearing. So, a larger kiln is a much needed item when there is a permanent place for it. The personnel of summer workshop was most interesting with twenty-eight states and four foreign countries represented. There were numerous professions, too, among them teachers from all levels; several art instructors; an engineering student; a dentist who evidently is looking forward to retirement; a director of recreation for the blind; an occupational therapist; an extension specialist in home furnishings; a housewife who writes garden articles and lectures; an architect; a weaving designer; a librarian; several professional craftsmen; three high school students; college students both undergraduate and graduate. Of course, a few were retired, and there were several housewives. The resulting mingling was amazing. Almost all the students were highly pleased with their experience at workshop. The six assistants were outstanding girls Louise Bandy (Pi Beta Phi) from Georgia, Trish Crowly (Pi Beta Phi) from Albuquerque, Jo Hansen (Pi Beta Phi) from Texas, Ruth Lerud (who just completed her Masters Degree) from Minnesota, Ronene Prior from Ames, Iowa, and Elizabeth Sullivan, a Pi Phi daughter from California. The scholarships given by Alumnae Clubs Albuquerque, Chicago West Suburban, and Buffalo, New York, certainly boosted enrollment and set a good example for other Clubs. That is a wonderful way to spread first-hand information of workshop. One of our students who came for the first session onlywas a cripple who used two crutches. However, she found so much satisfaction in her work that she stayed for five weeks. In 1964 there was a student who had an amputated leg because of a progressive disease, her other leg was amputated this winter. After the amputation she had a slight stroke, however, she replied to my get-well note ". . . I wish I could have had another session with Miss Smith on the weaving. .. . I'm using the weaving as therapy now." During late winter and early spring there were five adult classes with an enrollment of fifty-two on our cam-pus. Here, too, there was a mingling of varied interests among the personnel. There were classes in design, stitch-cry, pottery, and weaving. I noticed many students remarking about what they wanted to do next year. When one pottery student was somewhat disappointed with her piece she said "if nothing else, it makes one appreciate crafts more." There is a certain satisfaction in creativity. Arrowcraft is an outlet for crafts from the Southern Highlands, and for weaving of approximately fifty weavers within a twelve mile area. We appreciate the response of Clubs and Active Chapters. In our Settlement school chair-man's report there will be more statistics; however, each sale (big or small) helps the grand total. Each Club should receive information from Manager Maria Tate (Florida Beta) , also, each Chapter. Constant effort is made to improve sales. Even though Arrowcraft has two sales-rooms, the Clubs are the nucleus of the business. The Dormitory program was again a challenge. Many facts could be given; also many stories of happenings. This is an immeasureable service that Pi Phi has given through the years. There were two dormitory boys and two girls who graduated from high school this year. One mother came in with tears in her eyes to pay the balance of her son's account and said "I shall be eternally grateful." One of the senior girls was an outstanding basketball player. Two years ago her mother had a heart attack while Linda was playing in the final tournament and only lived two hours. After graduation Linda wrote a note of appreciation to us. That was unusual. We know they are frequently appreciative, however, we can only tell it by the glint in their eyes. Two teachers were provided last year in the elementary grades. Joan Oakley taught Art and Crafts, and Nancy Thomas music. Both are teaching during 1965-1966. Considerable interest is shown by Civic groups in improving the public school. However, since the school is under County supervision, the local school probably will have only repair on the agenda even though as whole new building is needed. Naturally with the community growing Pi Phi will eventually discontinue all "missionary work." Over six hundred rooms were added to motel units in the area this year, so Gatlinburg can accommodate approximately thirteen thousand individuals even though the population is a mere twenty-three hundred. Two bypasses are being constructed around Gatlinburg. This will undoubtedly affect the tourist trade to a degree. Maintenance is a continuous business with thirteen buildings. With the Settlement School in the center of town I am sure all Pi Phis would agree we must have a well-kept appearance. Elopements with our housemaids seem to be an annual event that happening this summer and in 1964. The two nurses who succeeded Marjorie Chalmers (re-tired 1962) have both changed their names (each has married). Hence Marjorie was called in again May first to finish out the school year and to get all in readiness for the beginning of school. Because the County haS a new hospital and local doctor has a clinic, there seems to be less need for our school nurse. Hence, that service doubt-less will be taken care of by the County in the near future. Our Red Barn serves as dormitory for craft workshops, and also for retreats for educational religious or philanthropic groups. We closed during mid-winter to conserve on expense. The Red Barn has become well-known among 36 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI such groups, and has occupants from Texas to Maryland, and the Carolinas to Memphis. This report is very brief, yet if you would read between the lines you could see that we are never actually looking for something to do, it is a case of what to do next. To each Pi Phi or group who has contributed to Settlement School recognition has been given. However, again I wish to express appreciation because it encourages our morale to know that many members from afar are not for-getting. In conclusion it seems fitting to quote these lines from our Fifty Year History by Virginia Brackett Green: "It is with the calm reflection of things past that we set proper courses for the future. Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." MARION W. MUELLER PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE May 31, 1965 Accountants' Report Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We have examined the balance sheet of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as of May 31, 1965, and the related statements of income and expenses and fund balances for the year then ended.
