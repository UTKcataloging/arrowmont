T OF THE I ECTO Community LKE OTHER places in the nation, Gatlinburg feels the impact of the war. Many homes in town display a service flag. The defense plants in the area draw a number of the men. Especially during the summer, when the tourists still come, almost every person in the village is working at something. High school children wait on tables at the hotels or help maintain the cabins. The necessity of keeping things going leaves little time for anything but work. The Red Cross uses a room in our Voorhies building for surgical dressing work. The town did well in their Red Cross and Loan quotas. The P. T. A. held rummage sales in our Crafts building. A number of librarians from the seven valley states serviced by the T. V. A. used the high school for a conference in May. The village library board sponsored a Pet Show for the benefit of the library at the school. The smaller animals were shown in the gymnasium and the show ring for the dog show set up on the lawn. The village library has a new children's room with pastel painted chairs, a mural that was done by a visiting artist and a gay table. Old-Timers' Day was celebrated the last Saturday in June with the usual program of speeches, old harp singing, and contests in the gymnasium. Each year a smaller number of the real old-timers appear but the children and grandchildren keep alive this interesting and colorful event. At noon we served dinner to a number of old friends, with members of Grand Council and the Committee who were still here, helping to augment the staff in their duties as hostesses. School Harmonious relations have prevailed during the year between the Fraternity and the County School Board. Our local member, Mr. Arthur Oakley, the County Superintendent, Mr. Theron Hodges, and the other members have tried to cooperate with us for the best interests of the school. For the first time a full time janitor was provided for the two buildings. He proved to be very good but left at the end of April to ,assume a better position with the University of Tennessee at their experimental farm in Knoxville. For the last month of the high school year Ben Fleming, the Superintendent, carried the janitor load with his other work. He had some help from high school boys. This summer the County has provided a man who has kept the lawns and shrubbery in fine condition. The P. T. A. under the presidency of Mrs. Stupka, wife of the Park Naturalist, has done some good work for the school in their special reading project for the lower grades. They purchased a number of supplementary readers and supervised the reading of these extra books by hearing the children read aloud from them after school hours. Along the same line was a program presented at morning assembly by the third grade pupils. It was in the nature of a radio broad-cast called "In Bookland." The youthful announcer was quite professional with a real microphone and loud speaker system. Some of the children were in costume representing favorite characters from story book land. As a result of these efforts the village library is experiencing a great increase in the circula Lion of juvenile books. The children of the Elementary School every one with a very unusual program or in April.

Advice on diet and other physical needs has resulted in a number of children being sent to various outside agencies. Forty or fifty children were sent to an oculist and five others were patients of crippled children's clinics. Five were referred to specialists in tuberculosis. There were: 1193 field visits during the past year; 2394 office calls; 4129 individual inspections; 873 typhoid inoculations given. Sigma Phi Gamma again gave the school $50.00. One of their chapters at Kenton, Ohio, sent us a box of hospital supplies and a box of worn clothing to be given away. Arrowcraft During the past year the shop has been in a rather unusual position. Instead of trying to find new outlets and make more contacts for our products it has been impossible to supply the demand. The superior quality of our weaving, the loss of foreign markets and their very reasonable price sell Arrow-craft products without effort. Alumni clubs and active chapters have been faithful in marketing our wares. An exhibit of Arrowcraft goods was sent to Brooks Memorial Art Gallery in Memphis, Tennessee, and several articles were included in a traveling exhibit assembled by Lou Tate of Louisville, Kentucky. Both of these received very favorable comment from the public and the press. Some materials are getting hard to procure and some of the most loved designs have had to be discontinued in an effort to stretch the available threads and colors over greater production. All linen weavings will be very limited. Linen towels will have but one colored border. Due to the inability to secure proper yarns, baby items will be very limited. Even if we had the largest inventory of weaving supplies in the history of the program and are unable to replenish them we will have to reduce the program in 1945 if the present weaving program is continued. Clubs and chapters have been generous in their gifts to the school during the year. Our Christmas treat lacked the usual oranges but red apples and a gift for each child in the elementary school was provided. Some clubs and individuals have contributed books for the school library. We thank each one of you for your thought of us and wish that you might see how very much such gifts are appreciated by the children. May we ask for your continued loyal sup-port to the Pi Phi Settlement School in the Smokies? Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER AI MAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE FIE WALL of a church in Leicestershire, Engd, is a tablet which reads: "In the year 1653 [ things sacred were, throughout the nation, emolished or profaned, Sir Robert Shirley, founded this church, whose singular praise 'e done the best things in the worst times and hoped them in the most calamitous." nilar tablet might well be engraved for Pi for throughout the periods of war and de-and particularly now when for a second the history of the Settlement School, the art of the world is an inferno of war, and of the world is gearing its every effort to ing of that war, the active and alumnae mem-Pi Beta Phi ,are . continuing their splendid support of its project in the Smokies--a project which is in truth one of the "defenses" on our American home front. Beginning with practically no help from the community, Pi Beta Phi, through the years, has built a lasting place in the hearts of the mountain people, besides the tangible "edifice" evidenced by a complete grade and high school, a Health Center serving a large area surrounding Gatlinburg, and vocational guidance which has taken a most practical turn in the development of Arrowcraft. The mountain people have relied upon Pi Beta Phi to bring them health, education, and the opportunity for economic improvement. And Pi Beta Phi has done these "best things" even in the worst times. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 39 But the community has not expected the, Fraternity to carry the entire load. As soon as conditions permitted they, through their County School Board, have assisted, first by paying salaries for a few teachers, increasing this until the culmination of one period of Settlement School history which came last spring as a successful conclusion to Ethel Copp's splendid chairmanship of the Settlement School Committee the acceptance by the Sevier County Court of the financial responsibility for a basic program in both grade and high schools, to be on a par with that provided in other regular county schools. In this first year under the Pi Beta Phi-County agreement, the necessary adjustments have been made with complete cooperation from the County Superintendent, Mr. Theron Hodges, and an assumption of obligations by the County Court which augurs well for a most satisfactory continuance of an amicable and workable arrangement implementing the agreement. As you will remember, the proposal accepted by the Sevier County Court allowed the County use of our high school building and playground for a rental of one dollar a year, in exchange for which Pi Beta Phi retained its privilege of supervising the curricula and having equal voice with the County in the selection of teachers, fifty per cent of whom may be members of Pi Beta Phi. A secondary agreement with the County School Board gave them the use of our grade school building until eighteen months after conditions allow them to build a new elementary school on land to be purchased by them adjoining our Pi Beta Phi property. Two lists of eqUipment were made for each school one to be considered covered by the terms of the agreement, by which the County would maintain and replace that equipment during the twenty-five year period of the lease. Equipment on the other list remains the property of Pi Beta Phi, to be used at our discretion by the County in their operation of the schools, to be replaced, in all probability, by Pi Beta Phi. During the year, Sevier County has purchased a tract of land, one hundred by three hundred feet, situated so that the new grade school, when built, will be just back and between our present grade and high school buildings. It will face our property, al-though there will also be access to their building from a road behind it and paralleling the highway which runs in front of the Pi Beta Phi property. The County has paid the salaries of all teachers except the Arts and Crafts, has assumed operating expenses of the buildings, including janitor service, has furnished the same supplies and equipment as is furnished the other county schools. Since these are less than is necessary to maintain the previous standards of the school, Pi Beta Phi has allowed the use of all equipment still held by the Fraternity and has supplemented the supply budget by a small amount. Last summer considerable minor repairs were made in both school buildings, and the outside of the elementary school was painted, so that the buildings, when released to the County, were ready for school occupancy this past fall. Such repairs are the responsibility of the County this summer. Schools The Chairman has made. two trips to the School this past year the regular fall one being made the last of September and the first of October in order to coincide with the annualmeeting of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild held in Asheville, and a second trip seeming advisable, she returned the lastof December to bring information to the new Director. On both occasions she visited the schools, and found activities and classes maintaining previous levels, thanks to the interest and careful planning of Superintendent Ben Fleming and his staff of teachers. Ben Fleming's loyalty to Pi Beta Phi has been a source of much satisfaction during this year of transition from Pi Beta Phi to County direction of the schools. A man from the Bureau of Investigation who visited the school commented on his pleasure in meeting Mr. Fleming, saying, "He is interested in his work and the welfare of his students. Oh, how many teachers and principals I meet whose -work is only a job!" Some three hundred elementary school students were cared for by eight teachers, which might have been a sufficiency had it not been for the great pre-dominance of students in the lower grades. As a result it was necessary to redistribute the pupil-load, making most teachers work with two class-levels. The twenty-six eighth graders graduating this spring have all indicated their intention to return for High School. About one hundred were enrolled in the High School. Here again the number of teachers might seem adequate for the number of students, but it was necessary for each to teach several subjects in order that the students might have a well-rounded High School course, handicapped as they were by the lack of agriculture and Spanish teachers. One of the few County schools to have a full staff of teachers, albeit another grade school teacher and an agriculture teacher were much sought after but not secured the Pi Beta Phi school completed the year with the eight grade school and five High School teachers engaged at the opening of school, with the exception of one grade, the third, where a series of substitutes carried on until December when a teacher was secured. All have been reengaged for the coming year except this third grade teacher who resigned to teach elsewhere, but whose place has already been filled. Barring resignations during the summer, the schools will open next fall with the same size staff as this past year. Our regret in regard to the teaching stafffor last year or the coming year is that it includes no members of Pi Beta Phi on its roll. Athletic competitions between Gatlinburg and neighboring schools were discontinued, because of the drafting of the older high school boys and gasoline rationing and travel problems. Military drill and basketball came in for their fair share of interest locally. The addition of an outdoor basketball court, equipment for which was given by Pi Beta Phi, in-creased the facilities for practice greatly. Pi Beta Phi contributed other inexpensive athletic equipment, and it was found that discarded mattresses from the dormitories made excellent "bumpers" for use in the gymnasium. The addition of a folk-dancing class by Lois Fenn, High School teacher, who has studied at the Camp-bell School of Folk Dancing, was greatly enjoyed by the high school girls. The boys even joined in the fun when this was added to the Friday evening entertainments for High School students sponsored jointly by the school and interested members of the community. Unfortunately local sentiment against "dancing" caused the cancellation of the class for the last two months of school, but it will be introduced next fall as a part of the physical education program. A gift from the estate of Anna Mally De Castello of the Cedar Rapids Alumnae Club made possible the presentation of a new stage curtain for the High School auditorium. Funds were added from our 40 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW budget to supply a cyclorama for the back walls of the stage, and curtains for the doorways at each side of the stage curtain. The installation of these this summer will satisfy a long-wished-for desire on the part of the school students and staff. Committee The Settlement School Committee has consisted this year of the Chairman and four lovely Pi Phis busy with home or school responsibilities who have taken time to carry on a tremendous correspondence discus-sing in detail the many matters which must be decided in the interim of annual meetings. For their devotion to the work of Pi Beta Phi at Gatlinburg, and their splendid support and advice at all times, the Settlement School chairman is deeply indebted. One matter of considerable importance to the future of the School and of concern for the Commit-tee was that of securing a Director to serve after the resignation last spring of Elizabeth Peck. Through-out the spring and summer our capable and efficient Arrowcraft Manager, Ethel Snow, added to her al-ready. heavy schedule many of the duties of the Di-rector. Because of her loyal assistance and willingness to serve during an emergency, the necessary preparations for fall were completed in fine fashion. Beginning September first for two months, Agnes Wright Spring, former ARROW Editor and Historian, served as Acting Director. She brought to her office a thorough understanding of the history of the School and by virtue of having served recently on the Settlement School Committee a vision of their hopes for the future. gut personal duties prevented her from remaining. New Director The Committee was indeed fortunate in being able to secure as Director Miss Ruth Dyer, an Iowa I' Pi Phi, with a charming personality and a broad background including educational, farm, and antique shop experience, who however could not assume her duties before December 20. Eunice Weaver, who served so capably as Director in the past, was prevailed upon to take .charge during the interim. Thanks to her graciousness the School was not left without a Director during that busy season. Since her installation as Director, Miss Dyer has handled the many problems arising at the School, augmented though they were by conditions due to the war and its effect on the community, with an under-standing and efficiency that has borne out our original belief that she is ideally fitted for her present position at Gatlinburg. Editor Each member of the Settlement School Committee, besides conferring on general matters, has undertaken a certain specific duty as her individual responsibiltiy. Beth Le Roy, in charge of publicity, has kept our ARROW readers in touch with the School by means of interesting . news and human-interest stories and has published a monthly letter to province presidents and vice-presidents that gave them a wealth of in-formation to pass on to active chapters and alumnae clubs during their visits or in regular correspondence. A reprint of "Who? What? How? Why?" has been circulated widely among Pi Phis, but fulfills its primary purpose when given to tourists visiting the Arrowcraft Shop. Library and Films Emma Woerner has been the Committee memberserving as adviser for the schools and the library, for which she is peculiarly well fitted by actual experience in rural schools and her present position as Principal of the Atherton High School in Louisville, Kentucky. Sevier County and the State of Tennessee contributed $80.00 to the school library, which together with $25.00 from the Chicago North Alumnae Club and 42.00 collected from library fees, added 122 volumes to our Grace Coolidge Library shelves. The total of 1401 volumes is splendid, and yet more books, especially in the fields of sociology, fine arts and nature study, are badly needed. Miss Woerner has also had charge of the Settlement School films, sending them to eleven alumnae clubs, three active chapters, and at their request, to the Extension Division of the Department of Agri-culture, Washington, and a Melrose, Massachusetts, High School group. Requests from two active chapters and three alumnae clubs had to be refused because the films were being used elsewhere at the time desired. Treasurer The Treasurer, Lolita. Prouty, has been a very busy person, gratefully sending receipts for contributions to our loyal alumnae clubs and active chapters who remembered our "first in importance" Pi Phi project, even though the calls from other worthy projects were numerous. Introduced this year was our Memorial Fund, to which members or non-members may send contributions in memory of loved ones, an attractive engraved card announcing this gift being sent to the one whose loss is thus re-membered. Supervising the budget is not so pleasant a task, but this also falls to the lot of the Treasurer. This year, besides including the regular operating expenses, salaries of staff members, and minor repairs, two major improvements were added. A retaining wall was built back of Stuart Cottage to prevent hillside moisture from seeping into the back wall and floor, a condition which if continued might cause consider-able damage to our fine new dormitory building. A new water pump was installed when the original pump gave indications it could not last. The new one includes an automatic float so that no longer will residents of Teachers Cottage awaken to find no water available because a leaking faucet has drained the reservoir during the night. Out of this year's budget also comes the expenses of a survey of the property, including a blue print and the placement of permanent markers alone the boundary lines a necessity now as the time approaches when neighboring tracts may pass from the original owners who are familiar with the uneven line of our property and who have always been friends of the Settlement School. Arts and Crafts Secretary Anne Munn not only produces exact minutes of our meetings for our reference, but acts as advisor for Arts and Crafts, where her own abilities and interests in this field make her ideas of great value to the Arts and Crafts department of the School and in Arrowcraft. The Arts and Crafts department is Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the school system as we bear all expenses for supplies, maintenance and operation of the Arts and Crafts building, and salary of the teacher. For the first time this year, definite art classes were held in the grade school under the direction of a supervisor. Miss Elizabeth Petrie supplemented the THE SEPTEMBER ARROW projects of the various grades by correlating the art work to them, introducing Indian coloring and motifs into a study of that race, and the making of portfolios to contain the clippings for an eighth grade class. Believing that art for the children should show them the possibilities within their meager budgets she had them make their own Christmas tree decorations, and inexpensive articles for the home. Finger painting was popular with grade students, while High School girls made braided rugs and the boys refinished furniture and made simple wooden puzzles. A class of Girl Scouts continued Arts and Crafts classes during June, making puppets and learning to weave. The weaving done by grade school members showed the value of such instruction as insurance for the future continuance of Arrowcraft. During the past year Winogene Redding, of the Arrowcraft staff, has been President of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild, an organization composed of individual craftsmen and producing centers to which the Pi Beta Phi School belongs. By virtue of her office, she served on a Joint Committee from the Guild and the Southern Highlanders, a marketing organization owning two shops, one in Radio City, New York, and the other at Norris Dam, Tennessee, some of whose stock is held by Pi Beta Phi. This Committee presented a program for handicrafts to the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, who accepted the proposed plan and granted a fund to the two organizations for a one year exploratory survey to be made by Miss Marion Heard of the University of Tennessee and one of three Arts and Crafts Advisors for our Pi Beta Phi Arts and Crafts program. The Settlement School is being included in this survey, at the conclusion of which a second program will be presented to the General Education Board for their consideration, which if accepted would include a further grant for assistance with the Craft program of all Guild members. Arrowcraft "1943-44 the best in history" became the surprise slogan for this year at Arrowcraft as nearly one hundred weavers produced more and alumnae clubs sold more than ever before. Although tourists were fewer in numbers those who came stayed longer and patronized Arrowcraft more. Faced withh a rapid turnover in weavers because of husbands leaving for service, war work, or the coming of babies, and the difficulty of redesigning articles because of inability to secure duplicate materials, Gene Redding has maintained production at its highest level, some three times as much as the previous year. In line with general trends, it became necessary to raise our buying prices for articles made by the weavers, which together with the increase in cost of materials when replaced, made prices correspondingly higher on Arrowcraft articles. Ethel Snow, Arrowcraft Manager, who continues to operate the Shop with efficiency, supervising local sales as well as filling mail orders, has had a problem also of apportioning the available articles to alumnae clubs who this year could have sold so much more than she could possibly supply. Indicative of this, besides the splendid financial report of Arrowcraft included in this Information ARRow is the fact that only $100 worth of Arrowcraft goods was returned unsold in March 1944 as against $800 worth in March 1943. Mrs. Georgie Duffield has managed the shop at the Mountain View Hotel. keeping it open mornings and evenings, and spending her afternoons weaving her lovely afghans, orders for which keep her alwaysbehind, although this year she topped her rec twenty-two completed afghans. The regular craft staff of Bess, Lura, and Dorothy has b mented this summer by Lois Nichols, Pi Phi, and Mae McCarter, a this spring's of our High School. The work of the bookkc been augmented by the increased sales and the twenty percent federal tax on all jew purses, effective April first. Arrowcraft is the clubs and chapters greatly by collecting making the remittances to the Commissioner nal Revenue for them. Health Center Health education remains one of the ern' the Health Center.

The subsidiary records of the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, were not included in our audit. The report concerning those records rendered by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants of Knoxville, Tennessee, was accepted by us without further verification, Combining the data furnished by Homer K. Jones and Company and the information taken from the Treasurer's books, we have prepared the attached financial and operating statements. August 4, 1944 In our opinion, subject to the following comments, the accompanying balance sheet and operating statements together with related schedules fairly reflect the financial condition of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30: 1944, and the result of the fiscal year's operations. The exact cash balance in the Royal Bank of Canada could not be determined' for reasons set forth by us in the report for the previous year. On July 1, 1943, the high school building was leased to the Sevier County Board of Education for a period of twenty-five years at a nominal fee of $1.00 per year. The grade school building which in former years was rented to the Sevier County Board of Education for $1,000.00 per year, was loaned to them from July 1, 1943, until such time as the new County grade school will be finished. Maintenance and repair expenses, water rent, and insurance for both school buildings are paid for by the Sevier County Board of Education. Respectfully submitted, BALLIN, MILSTEIN AND FEINSTEIN 42 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW have been unable to attend High School without this accommodation. These work ninety-six, hours a month, and pay only $5.00 a month for room and board. Healthful and inviting meals were served to these students and the staff members and teachers residing at the School. Future Greatness Although shortage of labor had handicapped the Director and her staff considerably, the Settlement School has carried on a splendid program of activities, education, and handicraft. To all who have so ably assisted at Gatlinburg, giving, to the best of their ability, in spite of difficulties and problems which the best effort of the Settlement School Committee seemed unable to remove, go our heartfelt thanks. To the members of 'Grand Council, and especially to the contact member, our Grand President, goes the deepest appreciation of the Settlement School Committee for the inestimable assistance and encouragement given us. And to our host of friends in and out of Pi Beta Phi who have supported the Settlement School by purchase of Arrowcraft goods, by subscrip-tions ordered through our Magazine Agency, or by financial contributions, we extend our thanks for your interest and assistance. "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." Pi Beta Phi has achieved very definitely a high place not only among fraternities but among other organizations as well, even including some whose sole and specific purpose is altruism, for the splendid history of its Settlement School in the heart of the Smokies. Realizing that Pi Beta Phi has an obligation to its own brilliant record of the past in Gatlinburg, we of the Settlement School Committee, despite the difficulties of present war conditions, with the continued assistance of loyal Pi Beta Phis, will pick up the torch lighted by our thirty-two years of service and carry on, pledging for the future our continued endeavor to promote the best interest of Pi Beta Phi and the Mountain people of Gatlinburg in our administration of the affairs of the Settlement School.

There were: 1193 field visits during the past year; 2394 office calls; 4129 individual inspections; 873 typhoid inoculations given. Sigma Phi Gamma again gave the school $50.00. One of their chapters at Kenton, Ohio, sent us a box of hospital supplies and a box of worn clothing to be given away. Arrowcraft During the past year the shop has been in a rather unusual position. Instead of trying to find new outlets and make more contacts for our products it has been impossible to supply the demand. The superior quality of our weaving, the loss of foreign markets and their very reasonable price sell Arrow-craft products without effort. Alumni clubs and active chapters have been faithful in marketing our wares. An exhibit of Arrowcraft goods was sent to Brooks Memorial Art Gallery in Memphis, Tennessee, and several articles were included in a traveling exhibit assembled by Lou Tate of Louisville, Kentucky. Both of these received very favorable comment from the public and the press. Some materials are getting hard to procure and some of the most loved designs have had to be discontinued in an effort to stretch the available threads and colors over greater production. All linen weavings will be very limited. Linen towels will have but one colored border. Due to the inability to secure proper yarns, baby items will be very limited. Even if we had the largest inventory of weaving supplies in the history of the program and are unable to replenish them we will have to reduce the program in 1945 if the present weaving program is continued. Clubs and chapters have been generous in their gifts to the school during the year. Our Christmas treat lacked the usual oranges but red apples and a gift for each child in the elementary school was provided. Some clubs and individuals have contributed books for the school library. We thank each one of you for your thought of us and wish that you might see how very much such gifts are appreciated by the children. May we ask for your continued loyal sup-port to the Pi Phi Settlement School in the Smokies? Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER AI MAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE FIE WALL of a church in Leicestershire, Engd, is a tablet which reads: "In the year 1653 [ things sacred were, throughout the nation, emolished or profaned, Sir Robert Shirley, founded this church, whose singular praise 'e done the best things in the worst times and hoped them in the most calamitous." nilar tablet might well be engraved for Pi for throughout the periods of war and de-and particularly now when for a second the history of the Settlement School, the art of the world is an inferno of war, and of the world is gearing its every effort to ing of that war, the active and alumnae mem-Pi Beta Phi ,are . continuing their splendid support of its project in the Smokies--a project which is in truth one of the "defenses" on our American home front. Beginning with practically no help from the community, Pi Beta Phi, through the years, has built a lasting place in the hearts of the mountain people, besides the tangible "edifice" evidenced by a complete grade and high school, a Health Center serving a large area surrounding Gatlinburg, and vocational guidance which has taken a most practical turn in the development of Arrowcraft. The mountain people have relied upon Pi Beta Phi to bring them health, education, and the opportunity for economic improvement. And Pi Beta Phi has done these "best things" even in the worst times. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 39 But the community has not expected the, Fraternity to carry the entire load. As soon as conditions permitted they, through their County School Board, have assisted, first by paying salaries for a few teachers, increasing this until the culmination of one period of Settlement School history which came last spring as a successful conclusion to Ethel Copp's splendid chairmanship of the Settlement School Committee the acceptance by the Sevier County Court of the financial responsibility for a basic program in both grade and high schools, to be on a par with that provided in other regular county schools. In this first year under the Pi Beta Phi-County agreement, the necessary adjustments have been made with complete cooperation from the County Superintendent, Mr. Theron Hodges, and an assumption of obligations by the County Court which augurs well for a most satisfactory continuance of an amicable and workable arrangement implementing the agreement. As you will remember, the proposal accepted by the Sevier County Court allowed the County use of our high school building and playground for a rental of one dollar a year, in exchange for which Pi Beta Phi retained its privilege of supervising the curricula and having equal voice with the County in the selection of teachers, fifty per cent of whom may be members of Pi Beta Phi. A secondary agreement with the County School Board gave them the use of our grade school building until eighteen months after conditions allow them to build a new elementary school on land to be purchased by them adjoining our Pi Beta Phi property. Two lists of eqUipment were made for each school one to be considered covered by the terms of the agreement, by which the County would maintain and replace that equipment during the twenty-five year period of the lease. Equipment on the other list remains the property of Pi Beta Phi, to be used at our discretion by the County in their operation of the schools, to be replaced, in all probability, by Pi Beta Phi. During the year, Sevier County has purchased a tract of land, one hundred by three hundred feet, situated so that the new grade school, when built, will be just back and between our present grade and high school buildings. It will face our property, al-though there will also be access to their building from a road behind it and paralleling the highway which runs in front of the Pi Beta Phi property. The County has paid the salaries of all teachers except the Arts and Crafts, has assumed operating expenses of the buildings, including janitor service, has furnished the same supplies and equipment as is furnished the other county schools. Since these are less than is necessary to maintain the previous standards of the school, Pi Beta Phi has allowed the use of all equipment still held by the Fraternity and has supplemented the supply budget by a small amount. Last summer considerable minor repairs were made in both school buildings, and the outside of the elementary school was painted, so that the buildings, when released to the County, were ready for school occupancy this past fall. Such repairs are the responsibility of the County this summer. Schools The Chairman has made. two trips to the School this past year the regular fall one being made the last of September and the first of October in order to coincide with the annualmeeting of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild held in Asheville, and a second trip seeming advisable, she returned the lastof December to bring information to the new Director. On both occasions she visited the schools, and found activities and classes maintaining previous levels, thanks to the interest and careful planning of Superintendent Ben Fleming and his staff of teachers. Ben Fleming's loyalty to Pi Beta Phi has been a source of much satisfaction during this year of transition from Pi Beta Phi to County direction of the schools. A man from the Bureau of Investigation who visited the school commented on his pleasure in meeting Mr. Fleming, saying, "He is interested in his work and the welfare of his students. Oh, how many teachers and principals I meet whose -work is only a job!" Some three hundred elementary school students were cared for by eight teachers, which might have been a sufficiency had it not been for the great pre-dominance of students in the lower grades. As a result it was necessary to redistribute the pupil-load, making most teachers work with two class-levels. The twenty-six eighth graders graduating this spring have all indicated their intention to return for High School. About one hundred were enrolled in the High School. Here again the number of teachers might seem adequate for the number of students, but it was necessary for each to teach several subjects in order that the students might have a well-rounded High School course, handicapped as they were by the lack of agriculture and Spanish teachers. One of the few County schools to have a full staff of teachers, albeit another grade school teacher and an agriculture teacher were much sought after but not secured the Pi Beta Phi school completed the year with the eight grade school and five High School teachers engaged at the opening of school, with the exception of one grade, the third, where a series of substitutes carried on until December when a teacher was secured. All have been reengaged for the coming year except this third grade teacher who resigned to teach elsewhere, but whose place has already been filled. Barring resignations during the summer, the schools will open next fall with the same size staff as this past year. Our regret in regard to the teaching stafffor last year or the coming year is that it includes no members of Pi Beta Phi on its roll. Athletic competitions between Gatlinburg and neighboring schools were discontinued, because of the drafting of the older high school boys and gasoline rationing and travel problems. Military drill and basketball came in for their fair share of interest locally. The addition of an outdoor basketball court, equipment for which was given by Pi Beta Phi, in-creased the facilities for practice greatly. Pi Beta Phi contributed other inexpensive athletic equipment, and it was found that discarded mattresses from the dormitories made excellent "bumpers" for use in the gymnasium. The addition of a folk-dancing class by Lois Fenn, High School teacher, who has studied at the Camp-bell School of Folk Dancing, was greatly enjoyed by the high school girls. The boys even joined in the fun when this was added to the Friday evening entertainments for High School students sponsored jointly by the school and interested members of the community. Unfortunately local sentiment against "dancing" caused the cancellation of the class for the last two months of school, but it will be introduced next fall as a part of the physical education program. A gift from the estate of Anna Mally De Castello of the Cedar Rapids Alumnae Club made possible the presentation of a new stage curtain for the High School auditorium. Funds were added from our 40 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW budget to supply a cyclorama for the back walls of the stage, and curtains for the doorways at each side of the stage curtain. The installation of these this summer will satisfy a long-wished-for desire on the part of the school students and staff. Committee The Settlement School Committee has consisted this year of the Chairman and four lovely Pi Phis busy with home or school responsibilities who have taken time to carry on a tremendous correspondence discus-sing in detail the many matters which must be decided in the interim of annual meetings. For their devotion to the work of Pi Beta Phi at Gatlinburg, and their splendid support and advice at all times, the Settlement School chairman is deeply indebted. One matter of considerable importance to the future of the School and of concern for the Commit-tee was that of securing a Director to serve after the resignation last spring of Elizabeth Peck. Through-out the spring and summer our capable and efficient Arrowcraft Manager, Ethel Snow, added to her al-ready. heavy schedule many of the duties of the Di-rector. Because of her loyal assistance and willingness to serve during an emergency, the necessary preparations for fall were completed in fine fashion. Beginning September first for two months, Agnes Wright Spring, former ARROW Editor and Historian, served as Acting Director. She brought to her office a thorough understanding of the history of the School and by virtue of having served recently on the Settlement School Committee a vision of their hopes for the future. gut personal duties prevented her from remaining. New Director The Committee was indeed fortunate in being able to secure as Director Miss Ruth Dyer, an Iowa I' Pi Phi, with a charming personality and a broad background including educational, farm, and antique shop experience, who however could not assume her duties before December 20. Eunice Weaver, who served so capably as Director in the past, was prevailed upon to take .charge during the interim. Thanks to her graciousness the School was not left without a Director during that busy season. Since her installation as Director, Miss Dyer has handled the many problems arising at the School, augmented though they were by conditions due to the war and its effect on the community, with an under-standing and efficiency that has borne out our original belief that she is ideally fitted for her present position at Gatlinburg. Editor Each member of the Settlement School Committee, besides conferring on general matters, has undertaken a certain specific duty as her individual responsibiltiy. Beth Le Roy, in charge of publicity, has kept our ARROW readers in touch with the School by means of interesting . news and human-interest stories and has published a monthly letter to province presidents and vice-presidents that gave them a wealth of in-formation to pass on to active chapters and alumnae clubs during their visits or in regular correspondence. A reprint of "Who? What? How? Why?" has been circulated widely among Pi Phis, but fulfills its primary purpose when given to tourists visiting the Arrowcraft Shop. Library and Films Emma Woerner has been the Committee memberserving as adviser for the schools and the library, for which she is peculiarly well fitted by actual experience in rural schools and her present position as Principal of the Atherton High School in Louisville, Kentucky. Sevier County and the State of Tennessee contributed $80.00 to the school library, which together with $25.00 from the Chicago North Alumnae Club and 42.00 collected from library fees, added 122 volumes to our Grace Coolidge Library shelves. The total of 1401 volumes is splendid, and yet more books, especially in the fields of sociology, fine arts and nature study, are badly needed. Miss Woerner has also had charge of the Settlement School films, sending them to eleven alumnae clubs, three active chapters, and at their request, to the Extension Division of the Department of Agri-culture, Washington, and a Melrose, Massachusetts, High School group. Requests from two active chapters and three alumnae clubs had to be refused because the films were being used elsewhere at the time desired. Treasurer The Treasurer, Lolita. Prouty, has been a very busy person, gratefully sending receipts for contributions to our loyal alumnae clubs and active chapters who remembered our "first in importance" Pi Phi project, even though the calls from other worthy projects were numerous. Introduced this year was our Memorial Fund, to which members or non-members may send contributions in memory of loved ones, an attractive engraved card announcing this gift being sent to the one whose loss is thus re-membered. Supervising the budget is not so pleasant a task, but this also falls to the lot of the Treasurer. This year, besides including the regular operating expenses, salaries of staff members, and minor repairs, two major improvements were added. A retaining wall was built back of Stuart Cottage to prevent hillside moisture from seeping into the back wall and floor, a condition which if continued might cause consider-able damage to our fine new dormitory building. A new water pump was installed when the original pump gave indications it could not last. The new one includes an automatic float so that no longer will residents of Teachers Cottage awaken to find no water available because a leaking faucet has drained the reservoir during the night. Out of this year's budget also comes the expenses of a survey of the property, including a blue print and the placement of permanent markers alone the boundary lines a necessity now as the time approaches when neighboring tracts may pass from the original owners who are familiar with the uneven line of our property and who have always been friends of the Settlement School. Arts and Crafts Secretary Anne Munn not only produces exact minutes of our meetings for our reference, but acts as advisor for Arts and Crafts, where her own abilities and interests in this field make her ideas of great value to the Arts and Crafts department of the School and in Arrowcraft. The Arts and Crafts department is Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the school system as we bear all expenses for supplies, maintenance and operation of the Arts and Crafts building, and salary of the teacher. For the first time this year, definite art classes were held in the grade school under the direction of a supervisor. Miss Elizabeth Petrie supplemented the THE SEPTEMBER ARROW projects of the various grades by correlating the art work to them, introducing Indian coloring and motifs into a study of that race, and the making of portfolios to contain the clippings for an eighth grade class. Believing that art for the children should show them the possibilities within their meager budgets she had them make their own Christmas tree decorations, and inexpensive articles for the home. Finger painting was popular with grade students, while High School girls made braided rugs and the boys refinished furniture and made simple wooden puzzles. A class of Girl Scouts continued Arts and Crafts classes during June, making puppets and learning to weave. The weaving done by grade school members showed the value of such instruction as insurance for the future continuance of Arrowcraft. During the past year Winogene Redding, of the Arrowcraft staff, has been President of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild, an organization composed of individual craftsmen and producing centers to which the Pi Beta Phi School belongs. By virtue of her office, she served on a Joint Committee from the Guild and the Southern Highlanders, a marketing organization owning two shops, one in Radio City, New York, and the other at Norris Dam, Tennessee, some of whose stock is held by Pi Beta Phi. This Committee presented a program for handicrafts to the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, who accepted the proposed plan and granted a fund to the two organizations for a one year exploratory survey to be made by Miss Marion Heard of the University of Tennessee and one of three Arts and Crafts Advisors for our Pi Beta Phi Arts and Crafts program. The Settlement School is being included in this survey, at the conclusion of which a second program will be presented to the General Education Board for their consideration, which if accepted would include a further grant for assistance with the Craft program of all Guild members. Arrowcraft "1943-44 the best in history" became the surprise slogan for this year at Arrowcraft as nearly one hundred weavers produced more and alumnae clubs sold more than ever before. Although tourists were fewer in numbers those who came stayed longer and patronized Arrowcraft more. Faced withh a rapid turnover in weavers because of husbands leaving for service, war work, or the coming of babies, and the difficulty of redesigning articles because of inability to secure duplicate materials, Gene Redding has maintained production at its highest level, some three times as much as the previous year. In line with general trends, it became necessary to raise our buying prices for articles made by the weavers, which together with the increase in cost of materials when replaced, made prices correspondingly higher on Arrowcraft articles. Ethel Snow, Arrowcraft Manager, who continues to operate the Shop with efficiency, supervising local sales as well as filling mail orders, has had a problem also of apportioning the available articles to alumnae clubs who this year could have sold so much more than she could possibly supply. Indicative of this, besides the splendid financial report of Arrowcraft included in this Information ARRow is the fact that only $100 worth of Arrowcraft goods was returned unsold in March 1944 as against $800 worth in March 1943. Mrs. Georgie Duffield has managed the shop at the Mountain View Hotel. keeping it open mornings and evenings, and spending her afternoons weaving her lovely afghans, orders for which keep her alwaysbehind, although this year she topped her rec twenty-two completed afghans. The regular craft staff of Bess, Lura, and Dorothy has b mented this summer by Lois Nichols, Pi Phi, and Mae McCarter, a this spring's of our High School. The work of the bookkc been augmented by the increased sales and the twenty percent federal tax on all jew purses, effective April first. Arrowcraft is the clubs and chapters greatly by collecting making the remittances to the Commissioner nal Revenue for them. Health Center Health education remains one of the ern' the Health Center.

The subsidiary records of the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, were not included in our audit. The report concerning those records rendered by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants of Knoxville, Tennessee, was accepted by us without further verification, Combining the data furnished by Homer K. Jones and Company and the information taken from the Treasurer's books, we have prepared the attached financial and operating statements. August 4, 1944 In our opinion, subject to the following comments, the accompanying balance sheet and operating statements together with related schedules fairly reflect the financial condition of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30: 1944, and the result of the fiscal year's operations. The exact cash balance in the Royal Bank of Canada could not be determined' for reasons set forth by us in the report for the previous year. On July 1, 1943, the high school building was leased to the Sevier County Board of Education for a period of twenty-five years at a nominal fee of $1.00 per year. The grade school building which in former years was rented to the Sevier County Board of Education for $1,000.00 per year, was loaned to them from July 1, 1943, until such time as the new County grade school will be finished. Maintenance and repair expenses, water rent, and insurance for both school buildings are paid for by the Sevier County Board of Education. Respectfully submitted, BALLIN, MILSTEIN AND FEINSTEIN 42 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW have been unable to attend High School without this accommodation. These work ninety-six, hours a month, and pay only $5.00 a month for room and board. Healthful and inviting meals were served to these students and the staff members and teachers residing at the School. Future Greatness Although shortage of labor had handicapped the Director and her staff considerably, the Settlement School has carried on a splendid program of activities, education, and handicraft. To all who have so ably assisted at Gatlinburg, giving, to the best of their ability, in spite of difficulties and problems which the best effort of the Settlement School Committee seemed unable to remove, go our heartfelt thanks. To the members of 'Grand Council, and especially to the contact member, our Grand President, goes the deepest appreciation of the Settlement School Committee for the inestimable assistance and encouragement given us. And to our host of friends in and out of Pi Beta Phi who have supported the Settlement School by purchase of Arrowcraft goods, by subscrip-tions ordered through our Magazine Agency, or by financial contributions, we extend our thanks for your interest and assistance. "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." Pi Beta Phi has achieved very definitely a high place not only among fraternities but among other organizations as well, even including some whose sole and specific purpose is altruism, for the splendid history of its Settlement School in the heart of the Smokies. Realizing that Pi Beta Phi has an obligation to its own brilliant record of the past in Gatlinburg, we of the Settlement School Committee, despite the difficulties of present war conditions, with the continued assistance of loyal Pi Beta Phis, will pick up the torch lighted by our thirty-two years of service and carry on, pledging for the future our continued endeavor to promote the best interest of Pi Beta Phi and the Mountain people of Gatlinburg in our administration of the affairs of the Settlement School.

        40 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW budget to supply a cyclorama for the back walls of the stage, and curtains for the doorways at each side of the stage curtain. The installation of these this summer will satisfy a long-wished-for desire on the part of the school students and staff. Committee The Settlement School Committee has consisted this year of the Chairman and four lovely Pi Phis busy with home or school responsibilities who have taken time to carry on a tremendous correspondence discus-sing in detail the many matters which must be decided in the interim of annual meetings. For their devotion to the work of Pi Beta Phi at Gatlinburg, and their splendid support and advice at all times, the Settlement School chairman is deeply indebted. One matter of considerable importance to the future of the School and of concern for the Commit-tee was that of securing a Director to serve after the resignation last spring of Elizabeth Peck. Through-out the spring and summer our capable and efficient Arrowcraft Manager, Ethel Snow, added to her al-ready. heavy schedule many of the duties of the Di-rector. Because of her loyal assistance and willingness to serve during an emergency, the necessary preparations for fall were completed in fine fashion. Beginning September first for two months, Agnes Wright Spring, former ARROW Editor and Historian, served as Acting Director. She brought to her office a thorough understanding of the history of the School and by virtue of having served recently on the Settlement School Committee a vision of their hopes for the future. gut personal duties prevented her from remaining. New Director The Committee was indeed fortunate in being able to secure as Director Miss Ruth Dyer, an Iowa I' Pi Phi, with a charming personality and a broad background including educational, farm, and antique shop experience, who however could not assume her duties before December 20. Eunice Weaver, who served so capably as Director in the past, was prevailed upon to take .charge during the interim. Thanks to her graciousness the School was not left without a Director during that busy season. Since her installation as Director, Miss Dyer has handled the many problems arising at the School, augmented though they were by conditions due to the war and its effect on the community, with an under-standing and efficiency that has borne out our original belief that she is ideally fitted for her present position at Gatlinburg. Editor Each member of the Settlement School Committee, besides conferring on general matters, has undertaken a certain specific duty as her individual responsibiltiy. Beth Le Roy, in charge of publicity, has kept our ARROW readers in touch with the School by means of interesting . news and human-interest stories and has published a monthly letter to province presidents and vice-presidents that gave them a wealth of in-formation to pass on to active chapters and alumnae clubs during their visits or in regular correspondence. A reprint of "Who? What? How? Why?" has been circulated widely among Pi Phis, but fulfills its primary purpose when given to tourists visiting the Arrowcraft Shop. Library and Films Emma Woerner has been the Committee memberserving as adviser for the schools and the library, for which she is peculiarly well fitted by actual experience in rural schools and her present position as Principal of the Atherton High School in Louisville, Kentucky. Sevier County and the State of Tennessee contributed $80.00 to the school library, which together with $25.00 from the Chicago North Alumnae Club and 42.00 collected from library fees, added 122 volumes to our Grace Coolidge Library shelves. The total of 1401 volumes is splendid, and yet more books, especially in the fields of sociology, fine arts and nature study, are badly needed. Miss Woerner has also had charge of the Settlement School films, sending them to eleven alumnae clubs, three active chapters, and at their request, to the Extension Division of the Department of Agri-culture, Washington, and a Melrose, Massachusetts, High School group. Requests from two active chapters and three alumnae clubs had to be refused because the films were being used elsewhere at the time desired. Treasurer The Treasurer, Lolita. Prouty, has been a very busy person, gratefully sending receipts for contributions to our loyal alumnae clubs and active chapters who remembered our "first in importance" Pi Phi project, even though the calls from other worthy projects were numerous. Introduced this year was our Memorial Fund, to which members or non-members may send contributions in memory of loved ones, an attractive engraved card announcing this gift being sent to the one whose loss is thus re-membered. Supervising the budget is not so pleasant a task, but this also falls to the lot of the Treasurer. This year, besides including the regular operating expenses, salaries of staff members, and minor repairs, two major improvements were added. A retaining wall was built back of Stuart Cottage to prevent hillside moisture from seeping into the back wall and floor, a condition which if continued might cause consider-able damage to our fine new dormitory building. A new water pump was installed when the original pump gave indications it could not last. The new one includes an automatic float so that no longer will residents of Teachers Cottage awaken to find no water available because a leaking faucet has drained the reservoir during the night. Out of this year's budget also comes the expenses of a survey of the property, including a blue print and the placement of permanent markers alone the boundary lines a necessity now as the time approaches when neighboring tracts may pass from the original owners who are familiar with the uneven line of our property and who have always been friends of the Settlement School. Arts and Crafts Secretary Anne Munn not only produces exact minutes of our meetings for our reference, but acts as advisor for Arts and Crafts, where her own abilities and interests in this field make her ideas of great value to the Arts and Crafts department of the School and in Arrowcraft. The Arts and Crafts department is Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the school system as we bear all expenses for supplies, maintenance and operation of the Arts and Crafts building, and salary of the teacher. For the first time this year, definite art classes were held in the grade school under the direction of a supervisor. Miss Elizabeth Petrie supplemented the THE SEPTEMBER ARROW projects of the various grades by correlating the art work to them, introducing Indian coloring and motifs into a study of that race, and the making of portfolios to contain the clippings for an eighth grade class. Believing that art for the children should show them the possibilities within their meager budgets she had them make their own Christmas tree decorations, and inexpensive articles for the home. Finger painting was popular with grade students, while High School girls made braided rugs and the boys refinished furniture and made simple wooden puzzles. A class of Girl Scouts continued Arts and Crafts classes during June, making puppets and learning to weave. The weaving done by grade school members showed the value of such instruction as insurance for the future continuance of Arrowcraft. During the past year Winogene Redding, of the Arrowcraft staff, has been President of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild, an organization composed of individual craftsmen and producing centers to which the Pi Beta Phi School belongs. By virtue of her office, she served on a Joint Committee from the Guild and the Southern Highlanders, a marketing organization owning two shops, one in Radio City, New York, and the other at Norris Dam, Tennessee, some of whose stock is held by Pi Beta Phi. This Committee presented a program for handicrafts to the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, who accepted the proposed plan and granted a fund to the two organizations for a one year exploratory survey to be made by Miss Marion Heard of the University of Tennessee and one of three Arts and Crafts Advisors for our Pi Beta Phi Arts and Crafts program. The Settlement School is being included in this survey, at the conclusion of which a second program will be presented to the General Education Board for their consideration, which if accepted would include a further grant for assistance with the Craft program of all Guild members. Arrowcraft "1943-44 the best in history" became the surprise slogan for this year at Arrowcraft as nearly one hundred weavers produced more and alumnae clubs sold more than ever before. Although tourists were fewer in numbers those who came stayed longer and patronized Arrowcraft more. Faced withh a rapid turnover in weavers because of husbands leaving for service, war work, or the coming of babies, and the difficulty of redesigning articles because of inability to secure duplicate materials, Gene Redding has maintained production at its highest level, some three times as much as the previous year. In line with general trends, it became necessary to raise our buying prices for articles made by the weavers, which together with the increase in cost of materials when replaced, made prices correspondingly higher on Arrowcraft articles. Ethel Snow, Arrowcraft Manager, who continues to operate the Shop with efficiency, supervising local sales as well as filling mail orders, has had a problem also of apportioning the available articles to alumnae clubs who this year could have sold so much more than she could possibly supply. Indicative of this, besides the splendid financial report of Arrowcraft included in this Information ARRow is the fact that only $100 worth of Arrowcraft goods was returned unsold in March 1944 as against $800 worth in March 1943. Mrs. Georgie Duffield has managed the shop at the Mountain View Hotel. keeping it open mornings and evenings, and spending her afternoons weaving her lovely afghans, orders for which keep her alwaysbehind, although this year she topped her rec twenty-two completed afghans. The regular craft staff of Bess, Lura, and Dorothy has b mented this summer by Lois Nichols, Pi Phi, and Mae McCarter, a this spring's of our High School. The work of the bookkc been augmented by the increased sales and the twenty percent federal tax on all jew purses, effective April first. Arrowcraft is the clubs and chapters greatly by collecting making the remittances to the Commissioner nal Revenue for them. Health Center Health education remains one of the ern' the Health Center.

The subsidiary records of the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, were not included in our audit. The report concerning those records rendered by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants of Knoxville, Tennessee, was accepted by us without further verification, Combining the data furnished by Homer K. Jones and Company and the information taken from the Treasurer's books, we have prepared the attached financial and operating statements. August 4, 1944 In our opinion, subject to the following comments, the accompanying balance sheet and operating statements together with related schedules fairly reflect the financial condition of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30: 1944, and the result of the fiscal year's operations. The exact cash balance in the Royal Bank of Canada could not be determined' for reasons set forth by us in the report for the previous year. On July 1, 1943, the high school building was leased to the Sevier County Board of Education for a period of twenty-five years at a nominal fee of $1.00 per year. The grade school building which in former years was rented to the Sevier County Board of Education for $1,000.00 per year, was loaned to them from July 1, 1943, until such time as the new County grade school will be finished. Maintenance and repair expenses, water rent, and insurance for both school buildings are paid for by the Sevier County Board of Education. Respectfully submitted, BALLIN, MILSTEIN AND FEINSTEIN 42 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW have been unable to attend High School without this accommodation. These work ninety-six, hours a month, and pay only $5.00 a month for room and board. Healthful and inviting meals were served to these students and the staff members and teachers residing at the School. Future Greatness Although shortage of labor had handicapped the Director and her staff considerably, the Settlement School has carried on a splendid program of activities, education, and handicraft. To all who have so ably assisted at Gatlinburg, giving, to the best of their ability, in spite of difficulties and problems which the best effort of the Settlement School Committee seemed unable to remove, go our heartfelt thanks. To the members of 'Grand Council, and especially to the contact member, our Grand President, goes the deepest appreciation of the Settlement School Committee for the inestimable assistance and encouragement given us. And to our host of friends in and out of Pi Beta Phi who have supported the Settlement School by purchase of Arrowcraft goods, by subscrip-tions ordered through our Magazine Agency, or by financial contributions, we extend our thanks for your interest and assistance. "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." Pi Beta Phi has achieved very definitely a high place not only among fraternities but among other organizations as well, even including some whose sole and specific purpose is altruism, for the splendid history of its Settlement School in the heart of the Smokies. Realizing that Pi Beta Phi has an obligation to its own brilliant record of the past in Gatlinburg, we of the Settlement School Committee, despite the difficulties of present war conditions, with the continued assistance of loyal Pi Beta Phis, will pick up the torch lighted by our thirty-two years of service and carry on, pledging for the future our continued endeavor to promote the best interest of Pi Beta Phi and the Mountain people of Gatlinburg in our administration of the affairs of the Settlement School.

        To the Settlement School Committee Pi Beta Phi Fraternity Office of Settlement School Treasurer Denver, Colorado DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined and tested the books of account and records of the Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1944, to the extent deemed necessary by us for an adequate audit for balance sheet and profit and loss statement purposes. The subsidiary records of the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, were not included in our audit. The report concerning those records rendered by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants of Knoxville, Tennessee, was accepted by us without further verification, Combining the data furnished by Homer K. Jones and Company and the information taken from the Treasurer's books, we have prepared the attached financial and operating statements. August 4, 1944 In our opinion, subject to the following comments, the accompanying balance sheet and operating statements together with related schedules fairly reflect the financial condition of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30: 1944, and the result of the fiscal year's operations. The exact cash balance in the Royal Bank of Canada could not be determined' for reasons set forth by us in the report for the previous year. On July 1, 1943, the high school building was leased to the Sevier County Board of Education for a period of twenty-five years at a nominal fee of $1.00 per year. The grade school building which in former years was rented to the Sevier County Board of Education for $1,000.00 per year, was loaned to them from July 1, 1943, until such time as the new County grade school will be finished. Maintenance and repair expenses, water rent, and insurance for both school buildings are paid for by the Sevier County Board of Education. Respectfully submitted, BALLIN, MILSTEIN AND FEINSTEIN 42 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW have been unable to attend High School without this accommodation. These work ninety-six, hours a month, and pay only $5.00 a month for room and board. Healthful and inviting meals were served to these students and the staff members and teachers residing at the School. Future Greatness Although shortage of labor had handicapped the Director and her staff considerably, the Settlement School has carried on a splendid program of activities, education, and handicraft. To all who have so ably assisted at Gatlinburg, giving, to the best of their ability, in spite of difficulties and problems which the best effort of the Settlement School Committee seemed unable to remove, go our heartfelt thanks. To the members of 'Grand Council, and especially to the contact member, our Grand President, goes the deepest appreciation of the Settlement School Committee for the inestimable assistance and encouragement given us. And to our host of friends in and out of Pi Beta Phi who have supported the Settlement School by purchase of Arrowcraft goods, by subscrip-tions ordered through our Magazine Agency, or by financial contributions, we extend our thanks for your interest and assistance. "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." Pi Beta Phi has achieved very definitely a high place not only among fraternities but among other organizations as well, even including some whose sole and specific purpose is altruism, for the splendid history of its Settlement School in the heart of the Smokies. Realizing that Pi Beta Phi has an obligation to its own brilliant record of the past in Gatlinburg, we of the Settlement School Committee, despite the difficulties of present war conditions, with the continued assistance of loyal Pi Beta Phis, will pick up the torch lighted by our thirty-two years of service and carry on, pledging for the future our continued endeavor to promote the best interest of Pi Beta Phi and the Mountain people of Gatlinburg in our administration of the affairs of the Settlement School.

T OF THE I ECTO Community LKE OTHER places in the nation, Gatlinburg feels the impact of the war. Many homes in town display a service flag. The defense plants in the area draw a number of the men. Especially during the summer, when the tourists still come, almost every person in the village is working at something. High school children wait on tables at the hotels or help maintain the cabins. The necessity of keeping things going leaves little time for anything but work. The Red Cross uses a room in our Voorhies building for surgical dressing work. The town did well in their Red Cross and Loan quotas. The P. T. A. held rummage sales in our Crafts building. A number of librarians from the seven valley states serviced by the T. V. A. used the high school for a conference in May. The village library board sponsored a Pet Show for the benefit of the library at the school. The smaller animals were shown in the gymnasium and the show ring for the dog show set up on the lawn. The village library has a new children's room with pastel painted chairs, a mural that was done by a visiting artist and a gay table. Old-Timers' Day was celebrated the last Saturday in June with the usual program of speeches, old harp singing, and contests in the gymnasium. Each year a smaller number of the real old-timers appear but the children and grandchildren keep alive this interesting and colorful event. At noon we served dinner to a number of old friends, with members of Grand Council and the Committee who were still here, helping to augment the staff in their duties as hostesses. School Harmonious relations have prevailed during the year between the Fraternity and the County School Board. Our local member, Mr. Arthur Oakley, the County Superintendent, Mr. Theron Hodges, and the other members have tried to cooperate with us for the best interests of the school. For the first time a full time janitor was provided for the two buildings. He proved to be very good but left at the end of April to ,assume a better position with the University of Tennessee at their experimental farm in Knoxville. For the last month of the high school year Ben Fleming, the Superintendent, carried the janitor load with his other work. He had some help from high school boys. This summer the County has provided a man who has kept the lawns and shrubbery in fine condition. The P. T. A. under the presidency of Mrs. Stupka, wife of the Park Naturalist, has done some good work for the school in their special reading project for the lower grades. They purchased a number of supplementary readers and supervised the reading of these extra books by hearing the children read aloud from them after school hours. Along the same line was a program presented at morning assembly by the third grade pupils. It was in the nature of a radio broad-cast called "In Bookland." The youthful announcer was quite professional with a real microphone and loud speaker system. Some of the children were in costume representing favorite characters from story book land. As a result of these efforts the village library is experiencing a great increase in the circula Lion of juvenile books. The children of the Elementary School every one with a very unusual program or in April. Drills, exercises and songs accost Miss Evelyn Bishop on the piano, many of t in charming paper costumes, made up the ment.

Advice on diet and other physical needs has resulted in a number of children being sent to various outside agencies. Forty or fifty children were sent to an oculist and five others were patients of crippled children's clinics. Five were referred to specialists in tuberculosis. There were: 1193 field visits during the past year; 2394 office calls; 4129 individual inspections; 873 typhoid inoculations given. Sigma Phi Gamma again gave the school $50.00. One of their chapters at Kenton, Ohio, sent us a box of hospital supplies and a box of worn clothing to be given away. Arrowcraft During the past year the shop has been in a rather unusual position. Instead of trying to find new outlets and make more contacts for our products it has been impossible to supply the demand. The superior quality of our weaving, the loss of foreign markets and their very reasonable price sell Arrow-craft products without effort. Alumni clubs and active chapters have been faithful in marketing our wares. An exhibit of Arrowcraft goods was sent to Brooks Memorial Art Gallery in Memphis, Tennessee, and several articles were included in a traveling exhibit assembled by Lou Tate of Louisville, Kentucky. Both of these received very favorable comment from the public and the press. Some materials are getting hard to procure and some of the most loved designs have had to be discontinued in an effort to stretch the available threads and colors over greater production. All linen weavings will be very limited. Linen towels will have but one colored border. Due to the inability to secure proper yarns, baby items will be very limited. Even if we had the largest inventory of weaving supplies in the history of the program and are unable to replenish them we will have to reduce the program in 1945 if the present weaving program is continued. Clubs and chapters have been generous in their gifts to the school during the year. Our Christmas treat lacked the usual oranges but red apples and a gift for each child in the elementary school was provided. Some clubs and individuals have contributed books for the school library. We thank each one of you for your thought of us and wish that you might see how very much such gifts are appreciated by the children. May we ask for your continued loyal sup-port to the Pi Phi Settlement School in the Smokies? Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER AI MAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE FIE WALL of a church in Leicestershire, Engd, is a tablet which reads: "In the year 1653 [ things sacred were, throughout the nation, emolished or profaned, Sir Robert Shirley, founded this church, whose singular praise 'e done the best things in the worst times and hoped them in the most calamitous." nilar tablet might well be engraved for Pi for throughout the periods of war and de-and particularly now when for a second the history of the Settlement School, the art of the world is an inferno of war, and of the world is gearing its every effort to ing of that war, the active and alumnae mem-Pi Beta Phi ,are . continuing their splendid support of its project in the Smokies--a project which is in truth one of the "defenses" on our American home front. Beginning with practically no help from the community, Pi Beta Phi, through the years, has built a lasting place in the hearts of the mountain people, besides the tangible "edifice" evidenced by a complete grade and high school, a Health Center serving a large area surrounding Gatlinburg, and vocational guidance which has taken a most practical turn in the development of Arrowcraft. The mountain people have relied upon Pi Beta Phi to bring them health, education, and the opportunity for economic improvement. And Pi Beta Phi has done these "best things" even in the worst times. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 39 But the community has not expected the, Fraternity to carry the entire load. As soon as conditions permitted they, through their County School Board, have assisted, first by paying salaries for a few teachers, increasing this until the culmination of one period of Settlement School history which came last spring as a successful conclusion to Ethel Copp's splendid chairmanship of the Settlement School Committee the acceptance by the Sevier County Court of the financial responsibility for a basic program in both grade and high schools, to be on a par with that provided in other regular county schools. In this first year under the Pi Beta Phi-County agreement, the necessary adjustments have been made with complete cooperation from the County Superintendent, Mr. Theron Hodges, and an assumption of obligations by the County Court which augurs well for a most satisfactory continuance of an amicable and workable arrangement implementing the agreement. As you will remember, the proposal accepted by the Sevier County Court allowed the County use of our high school building and playground for a rental of one dollar a year, in exchange for which Pi Beta Phi retained its privilege of supervising the curricula and having equal voice with the County in the selection of teachers, fifty per cent of whom may be members of Pi Beta Phi. A secondary agreement with the County School Board gave them the use of our grade school building until eighteen months after conditions allow them to build a new elementary school on land to be purchased by them adjoining our Pi Beta Phi property. Two lists of eqUipment were made for each school one to be considered covered by the terms of the agreement, by which the County would maintain and replace that equipment during the twenty-five year period of the lease. Equipment on the other list remains the property of Pi Beta Phi, to be used at our discretion by the County in their operation of the schools, to be replaced, in all probability, by Pi Beta Phi. During the year, Sevier County has purchased a tract of land, one hundred by three hundred feet, situated so that the new grade school, when built, will be just back and between our present grade and high school buildings. It will face our property, al-though there will also be access to their building from a road behind it and paralleling the highway which runs in front of the Pi Beta Phi property. The County has paid the salaries of all teachers except the Arts and Crafts, has assumed operating expenses of the buildings, including janitor service, has furnished the same supplies and equipment as is furnished the other county schools. Since these are less than is necessary to maintain the previous standards of the school, Pi Beta Phi has allowed the use of all equipment still held by the Fraternity and has supplemented the supply budget by a small amount. Last summer considerable minor repairs were made in both school buildings, and the outside of the elementary school was painted, so that the buildings, when released to the County, were ready for school occupancy this past fall. Such repairs are the responsibility of the County this summer. Schools The Chairman has made. two trips to the School this past year the regular fall one being made the last of September and the first of October in order to coincide with the annualmeeting of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild held in Asheville, and a second trip seeming advisable, she returned the lastof December to bring information to the new Director. On both occasions she visited the schools, and found activities and classes maintaining previous levels, thanks to the interest and careful planning of Superintendent Ben Fleming and his staff of teachers. Ben Fleming's loyalty to Pi Beta Phi has been a source of much satisfaction during this year of transition from Pi Beta Phi to County direction of the schools. A man from the Bureau of Investigation who visited the school commented on his pleasure in meeting Mr. Fleming, saying, "He is interested in his work and the welfare of his students. Oh, how many teachers and principals I meet whose -work is only a job!" Some three hundred elementary school students were cared for by eight teachers, which might have been a sufficiency had it not been for the great pre-dominance of students in the lower grades. As a result it was necessary to redistribute the pupil-load, making most teachers work with two class-levels. The twenty-six eighth graders graduating this spring have all indicated their intention to return for High School. About one hundred were enrolled in the High School. Here again the number of teachers might seem adequate for the number of students, but it was necessary for each to teach several subjects in order that the students might have a well-rounded High School course, handicapped as they were by the lack of agriculture and Spanish teachers. One of the few County schools to have a full staff of teachers, albeit another grade school teacher and an agriculture teacher were much sought after but not secured the Pi Beta Phi school completed the year with the eight grade school and five High School teachers engaged at the opening of school, with the exception of one grade, the third, where a series of substitutes carried on until December when a teacher was secured. All have been reengaged for the coming year except this third grade teacher who resigned to teach elsewhere, but whose place has already been filled. Barring resignations during the summer, the schools will open next fall with the same size staff as this past year. Our regret in regard to the teaching stafffor last year or the coming year is that it includes no members of Pi Beta Phi on its roll. Athletic competitions between Gatlinburg and neighboring schools were discontinued, because of the drafting of the older high school boys and gasoline rationing and travel problems. Military drill and basketball came in for their fair share of interest locally. The addition of an outdoor basketball court, equipment for which was given by Pi Beta Phi, in-creased the facilities for practice greatly. Pi Beta Phi contributed other inexpensive athletic equipment, and it was found that discarded mattresses from the dormitories made excellent "bumpers" for use in the gymnasium. The addition of a folk-dancing class by Lois Fenn, High School teacher, who has studied at the Camp-bell School of Folk Dancing, was greatly enjoyed by the high school girls. The boys even joined in the fun when this was added to the Friday evening entertainments for High School students sponsored jointly by the school and interested members of the community. Unfortunately local sentiment against "dancing" caused the cancellation of the class for the last two months of school, but it will be introduced next fall as a part of the physical education program. A gift from the estate of Anna Mally De Castello of the Cedar Rapids Alumnae Club made possible the presentation of a new stage curtain for the High School auditorium. Funds were added from our 40 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW budget to supply a cyclorama for the back walls of the stage, and curtains for the doorways at each side of the stage curtain. The installation of these this summer will satisfy a long-wished-for desire on the part of the school students and staff. Committee The Settlement School Committee has consisted this year of the Chairman and four lovely Pi Phis busy with home or school responsibilities who have taken time to carry on a tremendous correspondence discus-sing in detail the many matters which must be decided in the interim of annual meetings. For their devotion to the work of Pi Beta Phi at Gatlinburg, and their splendid support and advice at all times, the Settlement School chairman is deeply indebted. One matter of considerable importance to the future of the School and of concern for the Commit-tee was that of securing a Director to serve after the resignation last spring of Elizabeth Peck. Through-out the spring and summer our capable and efficient Arrowcraft Manager, Ethel Snow, added to her al-ready. heavy schedule many of the duties of the Di-rector. Because of her loyal assistance and willingness to serve during an emergency, the necessary preparations for fall were completed in fine fashion. Beginning September first for two months, Agnes Wright Spring, former ARROW Editor and Historian, served as Acting Director. She brought to her office a thorough understanding of the history of the School and by virtue of having served recently on the Settlement School Committee a vision of their hopes for the future. gut personal duties prevented her from remaining. New Director The Committee was indeed fortunate in being able to secure as Director Miss Ruth Dyer, an Iowa I' Pi Phi, with a charming personality and a broad background including educational, farm, and antique shop experience, who however could not assume her duties before December 20. Eunice Weaver, who served so capably as Director in the past, was prevailed upon to take .charge during the interim. Thanks to her graciousness the School was not left without a Director during that busy season. Since her installation as Director, Miss Dyer has handled the many problems arising at the School, augmented though they were by conditions due to the war and its effect on the community, with an under-standing and efficiency that has borne out our original belief that she is ideally fitted for her present position at Gatlinburg. Editor Each member of the Settlement School Committee, besides conferring on general matters, has undertaken a certain specific duty as her individual responsibiltiy. Beth Le Roy, in charge of publicity, has kept our ARROW readers in touch with the School by means of interesting . news and human-interest stories and has published a monthly letter to province presidents and vice-presidents that gave them a wealth of in-formation to pass on to active chapters and alumnae clubs during their visits or in regular correspondence. A reprint of "Who? What? How? Why?" has been circulated widely among Pi Phis, but fulfills its primary purpose when given to tourists visiting the Arrowcraft Shop. Library and Films Emma Woerner has been the Committee memberserving as adviser for the schools and the library, for which she is peculiarly well fitted by actual experience in rural schools and her present position as Principal of the Atherton High School in Louisville, Kentucky. Sevier County and the State of Tennessee contributed $80.00 to the school library, which together with $25.00 from the Chicago North Alumnae Club and 42.00 collected from library fees, added 122 volumes to our Grace Coolidge Library shelves. The total of 1401 volumes is splendid, and yet more books, especially in the fields of sociology, fine arts and nature study, are badly needed. Miss Woerner has also had charge of the Settlement School films, sending them to eleven alumnae clubs, three active chapters, and at their request, to the Extension Division of the Department of Agri-culture, Washington, and a Melrose, Massachusetts, High School group. Requests from two active chapters and three alumnae clubs had to be refused because the films were being used elsewhere at the time desired. Treasurer The Treasurer, Lolita. Prouty, has been a very busy person, gratefully sending receipts for contributions to our loyal alumnae clubs and active chapters who remembered our "first in importance" Pi Phi project, even though the calls from other worthy projects were numerous. Introduced this year was our Memorial Fund, to which members or non-members may send contributions in memory of loved ones, an attractive engraved card announcing this gift being sent to the one whose loss is thus re-membered. Supervising the budget is not so pleasant a task, but this also falls to the lot of the Treasurer. This year, besides including the regular operating expenses, salaries of staff members, and minor repairs, two major improvements were added. A retaining wall was built back of Stuart Cottage to prevent hillside moisture from seeping into the back wall and floor, a condition which if continued might cause consider-able damage to our fine new dormitory building. A new water pump was installed when the original pump gave indications it could not last. The new one includes an automatic float so that no longer will residents of Teachers Cottage awaken to find no water available because a leaking faucet has drained the reservoir during the night. Out of this year's budget also comes the expenses of a survey of the property, including a blue print and the placement of permanent markers alone the boundary lines a necessity now as the time approaches when neighboring tracts may pass from the original owners who are familiar with the uneven line of our property and who have always been friends of the Settlement School. Arts and Crafts Secretary Anne Munn not only produces exact minutes of our meetings for our reference, but acts as advisor for Arts and Crafts, where her own abilities and interests in this field make her ideas of great value to the Arts and Crafts department of the School and in Arrowcraft. The Arts and Crafts department is Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the school system as we bear all expenses for supplies, maintenance and operation of the Arts and Crafts building, and salary of the teacher. For the first time this year, definite art classes were held in the grade school under the direction of a supervisor. Miss Elizabeth Petrie supplemented the THE SEPTEMBER ARROW projects of the various grades by correlating the art work to them, introducing Indian coloring and motifs into a study of that race, and the making of portfolios to contain the clippings for an eighth grade class. Believing that art for the children should show them the possibilities within their meager budgets she had them make their own Christmas tree decorations, and inexpensive articles for the home. Finger painting was popular with grade students, while High School girls made braided rugs and the boys refinished furniture and made simple wooden puzzles. A class of Girl Scouts continued Arts and Crafts classes during June, making puppets and learning to weave. The weaving done by grade school members showed the value of such instruction as insurance for the future continuance of Arrowcraft. During the past year Winogene Redding, of the Arrowcraft staff, has been President of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild, an organization composed of individual craftsmen and producing centers to which the Pi Beta Phi School belongs. By virtue of her office, she served on a Joint Committee from the Guild and the Southern Highlanders, a marketing organization owning two shops, one in Radio City, New York, and the other at Norris Dam, Tennessee, some of whose stock is held by Pi Beta Phi. This Committee presented a program for handicrafts to the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, who accepted the proposed plan and granted a fund to the two organizations for a one year exploratory survey to be made by Miss Marion Heard of the University of Tennessee and one of three Arts and Crafts Advisors for our Pi Beta Phi Arts and Crafts program. The Settlement School is being included in this survey, at the conclusion of which a second program will be presented to the General Education Board for their consideration, which if accepted would include a further grant for assistance with the Craft program of all Guild members. Arrowcraft "1943-44 the best in history" became the surprise slogan for this year at Arrowcraft as nearly one hundred weavers produced more and alumnae clubs sold more than ever before. Although tourists were fewer in numbers those who came stayed longer and patronized Arrowcraft more. Faced withh a rapid turnover in weavers because of husbands leaving for service, war work, or the coming of babies, and the difficulty of redesigning articles because of inability to secure duplicate materials, Gene Redding has maintained production at its highest level, some three times as much as the previous year. In line with general trends, it became necessary to raise our buying prices for articles made by the weavers, which together with the increase in cost of materials when replaced, made prices correspondingly higher on Arrowcraft articles. Ethel Snow, Arrowcraft Manager, who continues to operate the Shop with efficiency, supervising local sales as well as filling mail orders, has had a problem also of apportioning the available articles to alumnae clubs who this year could have sold so much more than she could possibly supply. Indicative of this, besides the splendid financial report of Arrowcraft included in this Information ARRow is the fact that only $100 worth of Arrowcraft goods was returned unsold in March 1944 as against $800 worth in March 1943. Mrs. Georgie Duffield has managed the shop at the Mountain View Hotel. keeping it open mornings and evenings, and spending her afternoons weaving her lovely afghans, orders for which keep her alwaysbehind, although this year she topped her rec twenty-two completed afghans. The regular craft staff of Bess, Lura, and Dorothy has b mented this summer by Lois Nichols, Pi Phi, and Mae McCarter, a this spring's of our High School. The work of the bookkc been augmented by the increased sales and the twenty percent federal tax on all jew purses, effective April first. Arrowcraft is the clubs and chapters greatly by collecting making the remittances to the Commissioner nal Revenue for them. Health Center Health education remains one of the ern' the Health Center.

There still being no County Health doc Chalmers has undertaken regular examinatio elementary school children in seven outlyi schools besides her examinations, first aid, al lations at Gatlinburg. Well baby clinics remE lar, and a source of much gratification as tl of the future generation is insured through t] tion of mothers, many of whom have attei Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. The nurse, in looking back over her eighl Gatlinburg, feels that there has been a de vancement, "that education, advice, and p having lasting and increasing effect on the the people . . . it is not the spectacular for are striving . . . but the sane and steady b in human affairs; a safer community, more homes, and normal, happy children." Her report as submitted to the County Health do shows that Pi Beta Phi is making an envial for the betterment of health conditions in tf burg area. House, Farm and Maintenance On the school demonstration farm, Car] Pi Beta Phi School graduate and student o ture at Berea College, has had full responsib the Director, in the absence of any agricultu. in the schools. It was estimated that $85.21 vegetables were sold at wholesale prices to t kitchen, and $190.21 worth to the hotels a Besides supplying the kitchen with eggs, cream, 900 baby chicks were raised, most were sold as fryers to the hotel as well as the dozen eggs a week which layers supplied di of the year.

The subsidiary records of the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, were not included in our audit. The report concerning those records rendered by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants of Knoxville, Tennessee, was accepted by us without further verification, Combining the data furnished by Homer K. Jones and Company and the information taken from the Treasurer's books, we have prepared the attached financial and operating statements. August 4, 1944 In our opinion, subject to the following comments, the accompanying balance sheet and operating statements together with related schedules fairly reflect the financial condition of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30: 1944, and the result of the fiscal year's operations. The exact cash balance in the Royal Bank of Canada could not be determined' for reasons set forth by us in the report for the previous year. On July 1, 1943, the high school building was leased to the Sevier County Board of Education for a period of twenty-five years at a nominal fee of $1.00 per year. The grade school building which in former years was rented to the Sevier County Board of Education for $1,000.00 per year, was loaned to them from July 1, 1943, until such time as the new County grade school will be finished. Maintenance and repair expenses, water rent, and insurance for both school buildings are paid for by the Sevier County Board of Education. Respectfully submitted, BALLIN, MILSTEIN AND FEINSTEIN 42 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW have been unable to attend High School without this accommodation. These work ninety-six, hours a month, and pay only $5.00 a month for room and board. Healthful and inviting meals were served to these students and the staff members and teachers residing at the School. Future Greatness Although shortage of labor had handicapped the Director and her staff considerably, the Settlement School has carried on a splendid program of activities, education, and handicraft. To all who have so ably assisted at Gatlinburg, giving, to the best of their ability, in spite of difficulties and problems which the best effort of the Settlement School Committee seemed unable to remove, go our heartfelt thanks. To the members of 'Grand Council, and especially to the contact member, our Grand President, goes the deepest appreciation of the Settlement School Committee for the inestimable assistance and encouragement given us. And to our host of friends in and out of Pi Beta Phi who have supported the Settlement School by purchase of Arrowcraft goods, by subscrip-tions ordered through our Magazine Agency, or by financial contributions, we extend our thanks for your interest and assistance. "Past greatness will be future greatness only if we pick up the torch and carry on." Pi Beta Phi has achieved very definitely a high place not only among fraternities but among other organizations as well, even including some whose sole and specific purpose is altruism, for the splendid history of its Settlement School in the heart of the Smokies. Realizing that Pi Beta Phi has an obligation to its own brilliant record of the past in Gatlinburg, we of the Settlement School Committee, despite the difficulties of present war conditions, with the continued assistance of loyal Pi Beta Phis, will pick up the torch lighted by our thirty-two years of service and carry on, pledging for the future our continued endeavor to promote the best interest of Pi Beta Phi and the Mountain people of Gatlinburg in our administration of the affairs of the Settlement School.
