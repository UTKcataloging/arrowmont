        Committee Ieepots SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE In 1912, Pi Beta Phi traveled up a creek bed to isolated Gatlinburg and opened mountain roads to Education, Health, and Crafts. As is true with all roads, the original ones have been improved, widened and even slightly changed in direction in order to reach the desired destinations more safely. This is a progress report for the year 1958-1959 covering this ambitious project almost fifty years later. One of the important "throughways for life" is the one marked Education and this was where Pi Phi started first. Usually there is more than one road to a town; so after the fraternity relinquished the complete supervision of the schools in 1943, it pursued other ways to bring Education to the Burg. I. Last year the County continued to use the three Pi Phi School buildings for a token fee plus the obligation to keep up the maintenance, repairs, and insurance. 2. There was fine co-operation between the Di-rector of the Settlement School, Mrs. Marion Mueller, the school principal, the local member of the Board of Education, and the Sevier County Superintendent of Education. The County, governed by the average daily attendance, provided teachers for the basic subjects necessary for an accredited school. It seemed unfortunate that this particular area should lack instruction in Crafts, Music, and Woodworking; so the fraternity again furnished teachers and materials for those classes. In addition, Sharon Dexter, the Assistant to the Director, taught the Journalism Class which published The .Mounatin Echo, the school paper. Sharon also was co-sponsor of the Student Council which gave her a valuable contact with the student body. 3. Al-though the County raised the teachers' salaries for two years, the salary scale is too low to attract and hold teachers from outside the immediate area. Lodging and food at a reasonable cost in the attractive Staff House was the deciding factor for some of the out-of-town teachers who otherwise could not have afforded too teach in Gatlinburg. There were four teachers who lived with the resident staff and contributed much to the group. 5. One of the gratifying ways of helping youth along the road to a high school education was via the dormitories for boys and girls. Approximately 50% of the children rode the school bus. They walked down mountain paths to wait along the concrete road for the school bus; how-ever, there were 18 who lived too far to commute daily by bus and it was those who profited from the experience in group living and supervised work. For $5.00 per month and certain work assignments, these teen-agers had the opportunity to seek a high school education because of the Pi Beta Phi dormitories, Stuart Cottage and Helmick House. Mrs. Mueller had the difficult task of refusing five girls this chance. Not enough Pi Phis realize that when they made a contribution to Settlement School, they under-write this educational privilege for youth since the small fee requested could not cover the entire expense. Nevertheless the sum was a large one for a family with several children in school. One girl washed dishes for the Summer Craft Workshop last summer to earn her money for school. Ruth Spelman, Illinois Epsilon, chaperoned the girls, assisted wtih study table or sewing projects, and was ready to give requested advice. The Assistant to the Director aided with study table, helped with special parties, and conducted a weekly discussion period on good grooming an'd other topics of interest to growing girls. Mrs. Mueller gave much attention to the dormitory children and drove many to the school sport events. The greatest compliment to the dormitory program came from the member of the Board of Education who expressed the wish that all of the students could live in the Pi Beta Phi dorms. Thesepeople received more in their high school education than the academic classwork. 6. The Brendal legacy supplied funds for scholarships for children in school. The Alspaugh Scholarship Fund had a sum available for graduates of the Pi Beta Phi School. It is expected that during the summer one or two may apply. Last summer one of the dormitory graduates received assistance on her tuition for further training. 7. Fifteen years ago, the fraternity extended the educational opportunities to include instruction on the college level. The Summer Craft Workshop, jointly sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee, again used the Settlement School plant after the close of the school year. Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamma and Director of the Workshop, assembled a fine staff of instructors which attracted students from twenty-five states and three foreign countries. Two young Pi Phis served as Graduate Assistants and another one was sent by the Southern California Area Council on a scholarship. The "temporary" plan for fourteen years required the annual conversion of the 44 year old elementary school building into dormitory accommodations for additional low cost housing, This became more difficult each year until, as a pioneer among summer workshops, Committee felt that Pi Phi should push, pull or get off of the right of way, unless it could maintain the highest of standards for workshop lodging. Lincoln once said, "I will get ready and perhaps my chance will come." That good advice was followed for immediately after the June 1958 meeting, contacts were made and plans started for remodeling the conveniently located Red Barn if and when the chance came. With the receipt of the Marion Stoner Huey legacy and the settlement of the Joanna Hempstead estate, the chance came and all was ready to spring into action. As a result the new dormitory was finished for the 1959 Workshop although the first students caught the staff adding the finishing touches when they walked into the building. In the presence of the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee, the Province Officers, Little Pigeon Alumna Club, and local friends, the Dedication on June 22 launched the Red Barn on a new career of service. Built in 1923, the model barn housed the Pi Beta Phi herd and furnished many practical demonstrations for proper farming methods. In 1923 Indianapolis Alumnae Club gave a motion picture machine to the School and there in the hayloft, the first movies were shown in Gatlinburg. Families walked miles in the dark to see this new form of visual education. Here in the hayloft the first basketball games were played in the Burg where in June the group gathered in the lovely, large lounge for the service. A most generous, extra gift from the Pasadena, California Club furnished the Owl's Nest Lounge in which the original rafters added a distinctive, decorative touch. With the multiple-use rooms, small intensive Workshops can be held during the seasons when the school buildings are in use. With these facilities, new, challenging vistas for future service appeared. The first chance came in late July when the Red Barn afforded additional housing to craftsmen participating in the Craftsman's Fair sponsored by the Southern Highland Guild of which Pi Beta Phi was a charter member. It meant a great deal to the people in the area to have the Fair back again in Gatlinburg; so the fraternity was glad to co-operate. The Fair will be welcomed back again in 1960 and 1961 and the Settlement School staff and facilities will support the project. Educators, craftsmen, and social workers have presented many stimulating suggestions as to possible avenues of endeavor which could be in session 'during spring, summer, and fall. Interestingly enough they all fall into the fields in 28 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 29 which Pi Phi has worked at Settlement School-Education, Health and Crafts. The following are a few mentioned: Workshops for local mountain weavers; Workshops, national in scope, to train occupational therapists, craft instructors in crippled children's hospitals, bedside craft instructors who go into the homes as volunteers for community service and craft instructors working with those who are mentally ill. With retirement at sixty-five years and miracle drugs to keep the senior citizens alive another twenty years, crafts have been suggested for both the old and the young. The attendance at the 1959 Workshop demonstrated the need for the above training for leadership and to this list should be added many more modern needs. Pi Phis wondered if nearby chapters might not find it a wonderful experience to have a Settlement School week-end in the Red Barn ? Mrs. Mueller, the Director, would be happy to work out details for one if consulted. Then, too, wouldn't a Pi Phi houseparty be fun held at Settlement School on a specific week-end? Naturally this could and should include alumna. We have come "a fur piece" down the road to education. To climb a steep hill required a slow pace at first but this year with the Red Barn/Dorm, we reached a high spot from which we view the possible roads ahead. Much credit goes to Marion Mueller's on-the-spot supervision and tireless energy during the remodeling project. The University of Tennessee staff's encouragement and the co-operation of Marian Heard during the selection of furnishings was much appreciated. The road to Health was opened up approximately thirty-nine years ago. A solid base was needed for this roadway; so a "superhighway" program was planned which combined the services of Public Health Visiting and School Nursing, Red Cross and Emergency Service. Carelessness could endanger the life of many; so in recent years education and preventive measures have been stressed by the resident, Pi Phi nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, R.N., who is in charge of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center. A few statistics show the ground covered last year. 1. The children in the Pi Beta Phi Schools and the last rural school in the vicinity received physical examinations, hearing tests, and inoculations. 2. A special examination clinic for football players was held with the co-operation of the local physician. Football practice brought calls for first aid. 3. No other school in Sevier County held the preschool round-up in the spring with a careful check in the summer to complete routine preventive inoculations. Preparation for such a clinic was complicated and required much desk work and records. 4. Glades, the last rural school with forty children in eight grades and one teacher, welcomed the films on nutrition, safety, good grooming, and dental health. One program featured pamphlets with song, games, and stories; each child had something special to take home. 5. Chest X Rays were given; however, a state pro-gram of transition from Chest X Rays to tuberculin testing is under way. This necessitates purchase of special equipment for auto claving needles and syringes for the testing. More than half of the money for the clave has been received thanks to gifts from several alumni clubs. 6. Well-Baby clinics were held each Friday afternoon. 7. Nearly every month medical meetings were held at Health Center. The nurse benefited from the conferences and films shown. 8. As a member of the Defense Council, the Pi Phi nurse was called to a meeting for the revision of notes pertaining to the Health Department vital to Civil Defense plans for Gatlinburg. 9. Emergency care and matters pertaining to health and safety took precedent over all else. The following statistics show the "traffic" over the highway to Health during 1958-59. Field visits 584 Office calls 3904 Service given 3427 Smallpox vaccinations Total typhoid inoculations' i215 g Completed typhoid series and boosters 2i3.4 Total triple vaccine 294Completed triple vaccine and boosters 183 Salk Vaccine 354 Influenza vaccine 8 Tetanus toxoid 22 Therapeutic inoculations 296 Health Talks 152 Family Conferences 130 Nurse-Teacher Conferences 167 Physical Examinations and Inspections 3501 Chesa X Rays 891 The road marked Crafts started first when mountain people beat a path to the door of the Settlement School with their handcrafts. Alumnie became interested; then Gene Redding was called to revive the diminishing interest in the art of weaving. Gradually better roads led back to the cabins in the beautiful Smokies and over them journeyed the natives seeking a dignified method to earn a livelihood through crafts. Thanks to the co-operation of alumni clubs, Pi Beta Phi has put into the hands of native craftsmen well over a HALF MILLION DOLLARS. Many members are unaware of this amazing fact and also that foreign visitors annually come to see how the Pi Phi cottage industry has been operated to bring security to the mountain people. Gene Redding reported that 75 weavers were used last year; 60 wove the entire year and the others averaged six months. She made 102 calls in the homes to supervise their work and to teach them to weave the new designs. Three of the weavers were in their middle seventies and going strong; the two youngest were juniors in high school who were weaving to earn money for their clothes and books. In addition to supervision of the weavers, Gene designed new articles for the 1959-60 Arrowcraft Price List. Included in the group are new skirts, men's ties, 2 place mats and a linen finger tip towel. It is hoped that chairmen will remember these when ordering this year. Elizabeth Rue, Arrowcraft Manager, was convinced that the Convention display brought increased orders for Arrow-craft. About seven-eighths of the clubs ordered Arrowcraft products and cook books. It was necessary to reorder the blue paper sacks with the wine trademark. These were used at a number of club sales and are available again in four sizes. They are attractive and silently advertise Arrowcraft. The note paper with the Settlement School etchings were ordered again for they were inexpensive, useful sale articles. It was advisable to order the third edition of the cook book in order to have a sufficient supply for the clubs during the pre-holiday sales. The Shop will be open during the summer at night to accommodate the tourists. Several of the staff have volunteered to be on duty during this night shift. There have been resignations and Christine Wilson and Jean Humbrey have joined the sales force. It was with regret that the resignation was accepted from Mrs. McCutchan who was in charge of the Mountain View Hotel Shop. Eva Hathway and Elizabeth Rue will manage temporarily until other plans are completed. There were 17 clubs which paid for $1000 or more of Arrowcraft products during the last fiscal year. They de-serve special commendation for such achievement does not happen accidently. Champiagn-Urbana .$3,829.12 Pittsburgh South $1,303.63 Hills Pittsburgh 2,177.19 Oklahoma City 1,917.52 Indianapolis 1,284.45 Arlington Heights 1,791.58 Milwaukee 1,138.22 Kansas City, Mo. 1,694.69 Warren-Mahoney 1,093.87 South Bend 1,483.74 Maria County 1,086.22 Philadelphia .1,452.34 Cleveland East 1,067.42 Portland, Ore. 1,310.05 Santa Barbara 1,055.57 Tulsa 1,304.15 Toledo 1,013.46 One chapter rated membership in the $1000 Club. Vermont Alpha $1,169.71 Without the other clubs, which also worked hard, the Arrowcraft project could not have succeeded; so they, too, deserve a word of praise. It is still urged that groups pay Arrowcraft accounts promptly instead of sending one sum at the close of the fiscal year; all accounts are cleared by 30 May 31. Arrowcraft bills for salaries, threads, supplies, and utilities must be met each month; so this request can be easily understood. Located in a craft area where Pi Phi has pioneered to encourage the native talents, the Settlement School is strategically placed to develop the mountain craftsmen and to give training in craft skills to those who seek the Work-shops. The CRAFT road is one of beauty and opportunity, There have been no "toll roads" in connection with the Settlement School philanthropy. All gifts and support were contributed voluntarily without assessments. It was encouraging to note the increase in giving for last year. The alumnee clubs sent $11,170.91, a gain of $1806.46. How-ever when it is realized that Pasadena's special $1000 gift was in this sum, it would seem in this day of inflation, this extra amount just maintained the purchasing power of the dollars which 'do not go as far as they once did but make up for it in speed. A bit of research revealed the fact that 48 of the clubs in existence 10 years ago gave the same sum this year as they did a decade ago. Think how the dollar's buying power has decreased during those ten years ! Reliable statistics reveal that it takes $120 to equal the $100 contributed in 1949. The challenge to the membership is that their gifts should keep pace with inflation. Few realized how honest the government was a few years back when they reduced the size of the dollar bills. The Clubs in the following eleven Provinces were 100% in contributions to Settlement School. Alpha Zeta Lambda Beta Theta Xi Gamma Iota Pi Epsilon Kappa There were 14 Clubs which contributed $150 or more towards the maintenance of the project. Pasadena $1,350.00 Arlington Heights ,Ill. $200.00 St. Louis 800.00 Milwaukee 200.00 Kansas City, Kan 600.00 North Shore, Jr 200.00 North Shore, 500.00 Philadelphia 200.00 Los Angeles 432.50 Denver, Sr. and Jr. 165.00 Sabine District, Tex. 250.00 Everett, Wash 150.00 Indianapolis . 220.00 Wichita, Kan 150.00 If there were room, it would be appropriate to list the 45 Clubs which made some increase in their giving over that of 1957-58. The Active Chapters gave $2,718.18 which was $155.65 more than the previous year. Unfortunately some checks were received too late to be included in the report. The following 13 Provinces were 100% in Chapter contributions to Settlement School. Alpha Zeta Lambda Beta Eta Mu Gamma Iota Nu Epsilon Kappa Omicron Pi Another Chapter joined the ranks of those sending $100 or more; this makes five groups in the $100 club. Texas A $150.00 Montana A $125.00 Texas 1' 150.00 Missouri B 100.00 Texas B $100.00 Great praise is deserved by the many Pi Phis who did a magnificent job in selling magazines to meet budget requirements. Earned commissions resulted in a check from the Magazine Agency amounting to $ 10,060.41 which surpassed the previous year by $1,012.23. Their work brought success, however, all know Success is nothing more than a good idea coupled with hard work. Here are some who achieved. Club Chapter Highest Commissions St. Louis $756.30 Texas B $305.58 Highest per capita Valley of the Moon 6.91 Texas B 4.13 A new way the Clubs gave assistance this year was through the trading stamp project. The goal was for each Club to send a book of SH or Top Value Stamps to the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Director of Settlement School in Gatlinburg. Approximately 51 books were received; however that did not represent the number of clubs for one sent 9 books. It was a method which did not put extra strain on Club treasury. In the Director's report will be found a list of articles which were secured. It was suggested that this "share Some Stamps" become an annual project. A stamp chairman could be on hand at each meeting to receive donations an'd most members would be glad to give a few. The new dorm could use some new blankets for cool evenings ! It was only because of the legacies left to Settlement School that many of the buildings now stand on the grounds. Without them, the program would be curtailed drastically. It is hoped others will wish to follow the ex-ample of these loyal Pi Phis. All highways need maintenance and the Pi Phi "roads" were no exception. A narrow walk was put in back of Health Center; now the children coming to the Nurse from school do not get damp feet nor track in dirt. The first furnace in Gatlinburg, which served faithfully since 1916, must be replaced. With so much grass to cut, it was necessary to purchase a power mower this summer. The trim on Arrowcraft, Staff House, and Health Center needs painting. The front walk and porch should be repaired in the interest of safety at the latter place. The Staff House is due for some interior painting and according to schedule, Pollard should be painted this year. Each year one building is painted in order to save the strain on the budget that comes from doing all of the buildings at once. At some future date, the Pi Phi Lane should be finished with the black-top continued from Stuart Cottage to Staff House. High on the Wishing List is a dishwasher which would add to the efficiency of the kitchen during Workshops. Also included is a station wagon to replace the School car which is at least eight years old. This gives an idea of how the money should or could be spent. A famous Pi Phi husband, Calvin Coolidge said, "We can't do everything at once but we can do something at once." It is 'hoped that all groups will at once plan a good Settlement School program which will give its membership up-to-date information. Former members of the Settlement School Committee as well as present Committee members and Workshop students should be invited to talk. Use should be made of program material which has been sent out. This year Suzanne Walker, West Virginia Alpha, with her program won the May L. Keller award for the best Chapter Settlement School program. It will be in the fall mailing. The Arrowcraft sale offers little current information and members would be more enthusiastic boosters of the Arrowcraft project if supplied with up-to-date facts. If you know, you care, if you care, you share. This leads to another "something" which can be done at once. Each group can rethink its contribution to the unique, Pi Phi philanthropy in relation to economic trends. They call it legal tender That green and crispy stuff. It's tender when you 'have it, But when you don't, it's tough. Engineers are needed for the planning and supervising of road construction. The Settlement School Committee stands in this relationship to the building and maintenance of the Settlement School "roads." Two new members came on the Committee this June. Annie Laurie Keys Whipple (Mrs. Sidney H.), Tennessee Alpha, has served the fraternity as a capable Province President an'd will assume the duties of secretary which were relinquished by Edna Archibald upon the expiration of her term of office. Edna's advice and concern will be missed at the meetings 'but her support will continue in Baltimore. The second newcomer to Committee was Lois Overstreet Summers (Mrs. C. H.), Florida Beta, formerly an efficient Province Vice-President. She will be in charge of slide distributions. Last year 30 Clubs and 41 Chapters used the slide program. The set of slides with THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the script furnished a compact, comprehensive view of the project. All pledges especially should see this program. Helen Moffett Russell (Mrs. Robert), Illinois Eta, becomes the new Committee Chairman. Helen brings to the appointment a fine background of fraternity experience as a Province President, a member of a Chapter Advisory Board and the Chairman of the Committee on Chaperons. Lois Snyder Finger (Mrs. Raymond) continues as Publicity Chairman and will assist with publicity for Arrowcraft sales as well as other types of Settlement School publicity. Zoe Saunders James (Mrs. Richard) continues as the able treasurer. Before I end my last annual report to the fraternity membership, I wish to express my pleasure in the close 31 association with the Settlement School. I have appreciated the opportunity to become acquainted with loyal Pi Phis throughout the country. I have been grateful for the co-operation and support of Grand Council and Committee. But, especially, it has been a privilege to have a tiny part in this unrivaled philanthropy which has contributed so much to American culture. Sometimes the road was hard but everything worthwhile is upgrade at times. Besides there were always worthy ends in sight. Future opportunities at Settlement School thrill my imagination. One can never tell what lies beyond the hilltop! VIRGINIA BRACKETT GREEN, Chairman SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR Welcome Aboard for SPECIAL FLIGHT to Gatlinburg, Tennessee home of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. This is an imaginary flight because the nearest airport is forty miles away. You will note super highways leading to this Burg nestled in the foothills of the "Land of the Great Smoke," better known as the Great Smokies. Scattered throughout the Smokies are scores of mountains, valleys, and streams that in their names tell stories of the way of pioneer life among them is Gatlinburg on Little Pigeon River. Tourists and crafts vie with each other for priority in the area. Yes, there are many ultra modern motels and a convention hall, but in contrast and within close range there are many remnants of the past. Gatlinburg is unique with its mixture of the past and the present. We are now looking at the Settlement School grounds approximately seventy-eight acres with the school in the heart of town. Arrowcraft Shop and Health Center are on the highway (also the main street) immediately back of these is our original log cabin school which houses the high school woodcraft classes, and arts and crafts classes in winter, jewelry in summer workshop. The field-stone building you see is the junior and senior high school used by Pi Beta Phi in summer. The four houses along the hillside house staff and dormitory students in winter and summer. The old log cabin is Pi Beta Phi museum of pioneer items. Yes, you see a large red barn! That is the new barn/dormitory which houses workshop students and/or educational groups. It is planned for multi-purpose use. Various size groups may be accommodated. Thirty to forty can sleep there the younger girls in Little Pigeon Loft. The Owl's Nest (lounge) accommodates seventy-five or more for group meetings. June 22nd this was the scene of the Barn/Dorm Dedication the culmination of a dream come true for many. Chanticleer's lounge (entrance lounge) accommodates smaller groups. Yes, we like our barn very much and are very grateful for the cooperation of Council and Committee in helping this dream come true. Arrowcraft Shop ships all over the United States. Over two hundred Pi Beta Phi Clubs ordered this last year. Eighteen groups paid one thousand dollars or more to Arrowcraft for merchandise. With the attractive new items this fall doubtless more Clubs will surpass their previous records. Champaign-Urbana led in payments to Arrowcraft this last fiscal year. Eva Hathaway and Elizabeth Rue are operating the Mountain View Shop part time. Arrowcraft is a shop for which Pi Phi can be proud with the quality of excellent handcrafts weaving, woodcraft, baskets, brooms, pottery, jewelry and enameling leading in popularity. Many craftsmen claim Arrowcraft as their chief out-let for sales. It is a thrilling sight to see the crafts as they are brought in by their producers. This includes stacks upon stacks of beautiful weaving. We realize the important part our Clubs have in this project. My verbal thank you is inadequate, I know. My wish is that every Pi Phi might visit with us not only to see, but to realize the scope of this project. The school dormitory is a source of pride as well as a challenge to us. It is a challenge to help these children obtain an education, this is not .an easy matter for some. Several would have over a mile to walk on rural roads. Some do not have an aptitude for study. Eighteen boys and girls completed the year at Settlement School six of whom graduated. Ruth Spelman (Illinois Epsilon) served again quite capably as housemother and Sharon Dexter (Illinois Zeta) as assistant to the director. There were many projects during the year with the dormitory children hikes, trips to football and basketball games, crafts, grooming classes, study groups, Halloween, Christmas, Valentine parties, and picnics. All these events contributed toward a definite dormitory spirit. A waiting list for the dormitory served as an incentive to our dorm students. Each year our dormitory children participate in school activities more and more. This last year four boys participated in football, five in basketball, two in Student Council, six in Athletic Club, two in Beta Club, one each in senior and junior play and six on senior trip. Jim Brackins was co-captain of the football team, Shirley Wild Football Queen. Ella Mae received the Mathematics award, Gerry was outstanding athlete, Marjorie outstanding girl athlete, also outstanding Home Economics student and an officer in the Athletic Club. We can justly be proud of this record. Marjorie Chalmer's statistics at the Health Center prove that she has been quite busy. Practically all her work is now preventive and first aid, with baby clinic, inoculations, pre-school clinic, TB x-ray clinic, physical examinations and inspections in all the rooms and followups when necessary. There is one rural school where calls are made. One by one these schools are passing with the march of time. Anna Belle Lee is returning to Pi Phi to teach Arts and Crafts, Mrs. Enloe is teaching music again, and Carl Huskey is teaching two classes in Woodcraft. Orlie and Neal tend to our property, taking pride in preventing a run-down look on the premises. Orlie is starting his thirty-third year with Settlement School. Richard is busy farming during the week. His avocation is the ministry on Sundays and spare time. Mrs. Adams is starting her seventh year as cook. She apparently enjoys the jelly-making, pickling and preparation for the deep freeze. At least the hearty appetites en-courage her in her cuisine. Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee workshop was truly one of the best in number and quality. Again directed by Marian Heard from the University of Tennessee beautiful crafts were produced. There were many professional workers three who work with the blind, one in a correction home for girls, several university extension workers, a rehabilitation worker, several art teachers, craft teachers, elementary teachers, an architect, and a retired M.D. Some come just for fun, most to obtain credit, and many to pre-pare for a hobby. All these come from twenty-five states and three foreign countries Indonesia, Philippines, and Canada. Nine Pi Phis attended among them our new Settlement School Chairman, Helen Russell (Mrs. Robert). Rikki 3a THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Brockway came on the Southern California Area Council scholarship. The Southern Highland Handcraft Fair has been giving thousands of visitors a chance to see and talk with members demonstrating their crafts, watch folk dances, hear ballads, as well as purchase from the Craftsmen themselves. This is ideally situated in the Civic Auditorium. Experts in over forty crafts bring their displays and sales during the five-day period in late July. Of course, our Arrowcraft shop sells and exhibits. Good entertainment for the tourists was available during the summer. The last Saturday in June is the traditional day for the Old Timers. "Chucky jack" completed its fourth season in a nearby amphitheatre. This depicts the early history of Tennessee. ... The Gateway Stock Company returned for its thirteenth season. John Richards of New York Academy of Drama directs the plays a repertoire of five plays. The gift list is a long one. Many, many thanks to each donor. There were gifts for the dormitories, Health Center, Christmas gifts, clothing, books and many stamp books for the barn/dormitory. With stamps two card table and chair sets, a lamp, steam iron, sheets, coffee pot, tea kettle, mixing bowls, room divider, and waste basket were purchased. Our staff participates in many community projects. Sharon teaches a high school class in Journalism and sponsors the printing of the school paper. She also served last year as co-sponsor of the Student Council. . . . Gene Red-ding has designed several new items for Arrowcraft and all winter has been planning for the room exhibits at the Fair. . . . Marjorie Chalmers worked with the personnel for the Fair. . . . Marion Mueller served as president of the Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the local arrangements for the Fair. Various other offices have been held in church organizations, clubs, and P.T.A. It is a privilege to be at Settlement School to live with this memorial to our Founders. And how fortunate that Settlement School is located in this garden spot, considered by many to be one of America's greatest treasures withendless wonder and beauty. This concludes our flight. We hope you can come again soon. Happy landings ! Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER Little Rock, Arkansas July 16, 1959 Members of The Committee Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Gatlinburg, Tennessee DEAR LADIES: We have audited the books, records, and supporting data of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee, May 31, 1959, and present for your use the following Exhibits and Schedules prepared from our audit: Exhibit A Comparative Balance Sheets Exhibit B Comparative Statement of Operations Schedule 1 Summary of Club and Chapter Contributions Schedule 2 Club and Chapter Contributions.

        30 May 31. Arrowcraft bills for salaries, threads, supplies, and utilities must be met each month; so this request can be easily understood. Located in a craft area where Pi Phi has pioneered to encourage the native talents, the Settlement School is strategically placed to develop the mountain craftsmen and to give training in craft skills to those who seek the Work-shops. The CRAFT road is one of beauty and opportunity, There have been no "toll roads" in connection with the Settlement School philanthropy. All gifts and support were contributed voluntarily without assessments. It was encouraging to note the increase in giving for last year. The alumnee clubs sent $11,170.91, a gain of $1806.46. How-ever when it is realized that Pasadena's special $1000 gift was in this sum, it would seem in this day of inflation, this extra amount just maintained the purchasing power of the dollars which 'do not go as far as they once did but make up for it in speed. A bit of research revealed the fact that 48 of the clubs in existence 10 years ago gave the same sum this year as they did a decade ago. Think how the dollar's buying power has decreased during those ten years ! Reliable statistics reveal that it takes $120 to equal the $100 contributed in 1949. The challenge to the membership is that their gifts should keep pace with inflation. Few realized how honest the government was a few years back when they reduced the size of the dollar bills. The Clubs in the following eleven Provinces were 100% in contributions to Settlement School. Alpha Zeta Lambda Beta Theta Xi Gamma Iota Pi Epsilon Kappa There were 14 Clubs which contributed $150 or more towards the maintenance of the project.

The Active Chapters gave $2,718.18 which was $155.65 more than the previous year. Unfortunately some checks were received too late to be included in the report. The following 13 Provinces were 100% in Chapter contributions to Settlement School. Alpha Zeta Lambda Beta Eta Mu Gamma Iota Nu Epsilon Kappa Omicron Pi Another Chapter joined the ranks of those sending $100 or more; this makes five groups in the $100 club. Texas A $150.00 Montana A $125.00 Texas 1' 150.00 Missouri B 100.00 Texas B $100.00 Great praise is deserved by the many Pi Phis who did a magnificent job in selling magazines to meet budget requirements. Earned commissions resulted in a check from the Magazine Agency amounting to $ 10,060.41 which surpassed the previous year by $1,012.23. Their work brought success, however, all know Success is nothing more than a good idea coupled with hard work. Here are some who achieved. Club Chapter Highest Commissions St. Louis $756.30 Texas B $305.58 Highest per capita Valley of the Moon 6.91 Texas B 4.13 A new way the Clubs gave assistance this year was through the trading stamp project. The goal was for each Club to send a book of SH or Top Value Stamps to the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Director of Settlement School in Gatlinburg. Approximately 51 books were received; however that did not represent the number of clubs for one sent 9 books. It was a method which did not put extra strain on Club treasury. In the Director's report will be found a list of articles which were secured. It was suggested that this "share Some Stamps" become an annual project. A stamp chairman could be on hand at each meeting to receive donations an'd most members would be glad to give a few. The new dorm could use some new blankets for cool evenings ! It was only because of the legacies left to Settlement School that many of the buildings now stand on the grounds. Without them, the program would be curtailed drastically. It is hoped others will wish to follow the ex-ample of these loyal Pi Phis. All highways need maintenance and the Pi Phi "roads" were no exception. A narrow walk was put in back of Health Center; now the children coming to the Nurse from school do not get damp feet nor track in dirt. The first furnace in Gatlinburg, which served faithfully since 1916, must be replaced. With so much grass to cut, it was necessary to purchase a power mower this summer. The trim on Arrowcraft, Staff House, and Health Center needs painting. The front walk and porch should be repaired in the interest of safety at the latter place. The Staff House is due for some interior painting and according to schedule, Pollard should be painted this year. Each year one building is painted in order to save the strain on the budget that comes from doing all of the buildings at once. At some future date, the Pi Phi Lane should be finished with the black-top continued from Stuart Cottage to Staff House. High on the Wishing List is a dishwasher which would add to the efficiency of the kitchen during Workshops. Also included is a station wagon to replace the School car which is at least eight years old. This gives an idea of how the money should or could be spent. A famous Pi Phi husband, Calvin Coolidge said, "We can't do everything at once but we can do something at once." It is 'hoped that all groups will at once plan a good Settlement School program which will give its membership up-to-date information. Former members of the Settlement School Committee as well as present Committee members and Workshop students should be invited to talk. Use should be made of program material which has been sent out. This year Suzanne Walker, West Virginia Alpha, with her program won the May L. Keller award for the best Chapter Settlement School program. It will be in the fall mailing. The Arrowcraft sale offers little current information and members would be more enthusiastic boosters of the Arrowcraft project if supplied with up-to-date facts. If you know, you care, if you care, you share. This leads to another "something" which can be done at once. Each group can rethink its contribution to the unique, Pi Phi philanthropy in relation to economic trends. They call it legal tender That green and crispy stuff. It's tender when you 'have it, But when you don't, it's tough. Engineers are needed for the planning and supervising of road construction. The Settlement School Committee stands in this relationship to the building and maintenance of the Settlement School "roads." Two new members came on the Committee this June. Annie Laurie Keys Whipple (Mrs. Sidney H.), Tennessee Alpha, has served the fraternity as a capable Province President an'd will assume the duties of secretary which were relinquished by Edna Archibald upon the expiration of her term of office. Edna's advice and concern will be missed at the meetings 'but her support will continue in Baltimore. The second newcomer to Committee was Lois Overstreet Summers (Mrs. C. H.), Florida Beta, formerly an efficient Province Vice-President. She will be in charge of slide distributions. Last year 30 Clubs and 41 Chapters used the slide program. The set of slides with THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the script furnished a compact, comprehensive view of the project. All pledges especially should see this program. Helen Moffett Russell (Mrs. Robert), Illinois Eta, becomes the new Committee Chairman. Helen brings to the appointment a fine background of fraternity experience as a Province President, a member of a Chapter Advisory Board and the Chairman of the Committee on Chaperons. Lois Snyder Finger (Mrs. Raymond) continues as Publicity Chairman and will assist with publicity for Arrowcraft sales as well as other types of Settlement School publicity. Zoe Saunders James (Mrs. Richard) continues as the able treasurer. Before I end my last annual report to the fraternity membership, I wish to express my pleasure in the close 31 association with the Settlement School. I have appreciated the opportunity to become acquainted with loyal Pi Phis throughout the country. I have been grateful for the co-operation and support of Grand Council and Committee. But, especially, it has been a privilege to have a tiny part in this unrivaled philanthropy which has contributed so much to American culture. Sometimes the road was hard but everything worthwhile is upgrade at times. Besides there were always worthy ends in sight. Future opportunities at Settlement School thrill my imagination. One can never tell what lies beyond the hilltop! VIRGINIA BRACKETT GREEN, Chairman SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR Welcome Aboard for SPECIAL FLIGHT to Gatlinburg, Tennessee home of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. This is an imaginary flight because the nearest airport is forty miles away. You will note super highways leading to this Burg nestled in the foothills of the "Land of the Great Smoke," better known as the Great Smokies. Scattered throughout the Smokies are scores of mountains, valleys, and streams that in their names tell stories of the way of pioneer life among them is Gatlinburg on Little Pigeon River. Tourists and crafts vie with each other for priority in the area. Yes, there are many ultra modern motels and a convention hall, but in contrast and within close range there are many remnants of the past. Gatlinburg is unique with its mixture of the past and the present. We are now looking at the Settlement School grounds approximately seventy-eight acres with the school in the heart of town. Arrowcraft Shop and Health Center are on the highway (also the main street) immediately back of these is our original log cabin school which houses the high school woodcraft classes, and arts and crafts classes in winter, jewelry in summer workshop. The field-stone building you see is the junior and senior high school used by Pi Beta Phi in summer. The four houses along the hillside house staff and dormitory students in winter and summer. The old log cabin is Pi Beta Phi museum of pioneer items. Yes, you see a large red barn! That is the new barn/dormitory which houses workshop students and/or educational groups. It is planned for multi-purpose use. Various size groups may be accommodated. Thirty to forty can sleep there the younger girls in Little Pigeon Loft. The Owl's Nest (lounge) accommodates seventy-five or more for group meetings. June 22nd this was the scene of the Barn/Dorm Dedication the culmination of a dream come true for many. Chanticleer's lounge (entrance lounge) accommodates smaller groups. Yes, we like our barn very much and are very grateful for the cooperation of Council and Committee in helping this dream come true. Arrowcraft Shop ships all over the United States. Over two hundred Pi Beta Phi Clubs ordered this last year. Eighteen groups paid one thousand dollars or more to Arrowcraft for merchandise. With the attractive new items this fall doubtless more Clubs will surpass their previous records. Champaign-Urbana led in payments to Arrowcraft this last fiscal year. Eva Hathaway and Elizabeth Rue are operating the Mountain View Shop part time. Arrowcraft is a shop for which Pi Phi can be proud with the quality of excellent handcrafts weaving, woodcraft, baskets, brooms, pottery, jewelry and enameling leading in popularity. Many craftsmen claim Arrowcraft as their chief out-let for sales. It is a thrilling sight to see the crafts as they are brought in by their producers. This includes stacks upon stacks of beautiful weaving. We realize the important part our Clubs have in this project. My verbal thank you is inadequate, I know. My wish is that every Pi Phi might visit with us not only to see, but to realize the scope of this project. The school dormitory is a source of pride as well as a challenge to us. It is a challenge to help these children obtain an education, this is not .an easy matter for some. Several would have over a mile to walk on rural roads. Some do not have an aptitude for study. Eighteen boys and girls completed the year at Settlement School six of whom graduated. Ruth Spelman (Illinois Epsilon) served again quite capably as housemother and Sharon Dexter (Illinois Zeta) as assistant to the director. There were many projects during the year with the dormitory children hikes, trips to football and basketball games, crafts, grooming classes, study groups, Halloween, Christmas, Valentine parties, and picnics. All these events contributed toward a definite dormitory spirit. A waiting list for the dormitory served as an incentive to our dorm students. Each year our dormitory children participate in school activities more and more. This last year four boys participated in football, five in basketball, two in Student Council, six in Athletic Club, two in Beta Club, one each in senior and junior play and six on senior trip. Jim Brackins was co-captain of the football team, Shirley Wild Football Queen. Ella Mae received the Mathematics award, Gerry was outstanding athlete, Marjorie outstanding girl athlete, also outstanding Home Economics student and an officer in the Athletic Club. We can justly be proud of this record. Marjorie Chalmer's statistics at the Health Center prove that she has been quite busy. Practically all her work is now preventive and first aid, with baby clinic, inoculations, pre-school clinic, TB x-ray clinic, physical examinations and inspections in all the rooms and followups when necessary. There is one rural school where calls are made. One by one these schools are passing with the march of time. Anna Belle Lee is returning to Pi Phi to teach Arts and Crafts, Mrs. Enloe is teaching music again, and Carl Huskey is teaching two classes in Woodcraft. Orlie and Neal tend to our property, taking pride in preventing a run-down look on the premises. Orlie is starting his thirty-third year with Settlement School. Richard is busy farming during the week. His avocation is the ministry on Sundays and spare time. Mrs. Adams is starting her seventh year as cook. She apparently enjoys the jelly-making, pickling and preparation for the deep freeze. At least the hearty appetites en-courage her in her cuisine. Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee workshop was truly one of the best in number and quality. Again directed by Marian Heard from the University of Tennessee beautiful crafts were produced. There were many professional workers three who work with the blind, one in a correction home for girls, several university extension workers, a rehabilitation worker, several art teachers, craft teachers, elementary teachers, an architect, and a retired M.D. Some come just for fun, most to obtain credit, and many to pre-pare for a hobby. All these come from twenty-five states and three foreign countries Indonesia, Philippines, and Canada. Nine Pi Phis attended among them our new Settlement School Chairman, Helen Russell (Mrs. Robert). Rikki 3a THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Brockway came on the Southern California Area Council scholarship. The Southern Highland Handcraft Fair has been giving thousands of visitors a chance to see and talk with members demonstrating their crafts, watch folk dances, hear ballads, as well as purchase from the Craftsmen themselves. This is ideally situated in the Civic Auditorium. Experts in over forty crafts bring their displays and sales during the five-day period in late July. Of course, our Arrowcraft shop sells and exhibits. Good entertainment for the tourists was available during the summer. The last Saturday in June is the traditional day for the Old Timers. "Chucky jack" completed its fourth season in a nearby amphitheatre. This depicts the early history of Tennessee. ... The Gateway Stock Company returned for its thirteenth season. John Richards of New York Academy of Drama directs the plays a repertoire of five plays. The gift list is a long one. Many, many thanks to each donor. There were gifts for the dormitories, Health Center, Christmas gifts, clothing, books and many stamp books for the barn/dormitory. With stamps two card table and chair sets, a lamp, steam iron, sheets, coffee pot, tea kettle, mixing bowls, room divider, and waste basket were purchased. Our staff participates in many community projects. Sharon teaches a high school class in Journalism and sponsors the printing of the school paper. She also served last year as co-sponsor of the Student Council. . . . Gene Red-ding has designed several new items for Arrowcraft and all winter has been planning for the room exhibits at the Fair. . . . Marjorie Chalmers worked with the personnel for the Fair. . . . Marion Mueller served as president of the Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the local arrangements for the Fair. Various other offices have been held in church organizations, clubs, and P.T.A. It is a privilege to be at Settlement School to live with this memorial to our Founders. And how fortunate that Settlement School is located in this garden spot, considered by many to be one of America's greatest treasures withendless wonder and beauty. This concludes our flight. We hope you can come again soon. Happy landings ! Respectfully submitted, MARION W.

        3a THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Brockway came on the Southern California Area Council scholarship. The Southern Highland Handcraft Fair has been giving thousands of visitors a chance to see and talk with members demonstrating their crafts, watch folk dances, hear ballads, as well as purchase from the Craftsmen themselves. This is ideally situated in the Civic Auditorium. Experts in over forty crafts bring their displays and sales during the five-day period in late July. Of course, our Arrowcraft shop sells and exhibits. Good entertainment for the tourists was available during the summer. The last Saturday in June is the traditional day for the Old Timers. "Chucky jack" completed its fourth season in a nearby amphitheatre. This depicts the early history of Tennessee. ... The Gateway Stock Company returned for its thirteenth season. John Richards of New York Academy of Drama directs the plays a repertoire of five plays. The gift list is a long one. Many, many thanks to each donor. There were gifts for the dormitories, Health Center, Christmas gifts, clothing, books and many stamp books for the barn/dormitory. With stamps two card table and chair sets, a lamp, steam iron, sheets, coffee pot, tea kettle, mixing bowls, room divider, and waste basket were purchased. Our staff participates in many community projects. Sharon teaches a high school class in Journalism and sponsors the printing of the school paper. She also served last year as co-sponsor of the Student Council. . . . Gene Red-ding has designed several new items for Arrowcraft and all winter has been planning for the room exhibits at the Fair. . . . Marjorie Chalmers worked with the personnel for the Fair. . . . Marion Mueller served as president of the Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the local arrangements for the Fair. Various other offices have been held in church organizations, clubs, and P.T.A. It is a privilege to be at Settlement School to live with this memorial to our Founders. And how fortunate that Settlement School is located in this garden spot, considered by many to be one of America's greatest treasures withendless wonder and beauty. This concludes our flight. We hope you can come again soon. Happy landings ! Respectfully submitted, MARION W.

As is true with all roads, the original ones have been improved, widened and even slightly changed in direction in order to reach the desired destinations more safely. This is a progress report for the year 1958-1959 covering this ambitious project almost fifty years later. One of the important "throughways for life" is the one marked Education and this was where Pi Phi started first. Usually there is more than one road to a town; so after the fraternity relinquished the complete supervision of the schools in 1943, it pursued other ways to bring Education to the Burg. I. Last year the County continued to use the three Pi Phi School buildings for a token fee plus the obligation to keep up the maintenance, repairs, and insurance. 2. There was fine co-operation between the Di-rector of the Settlement School, Mrs. Marion Mueller, the school principal, the local member of the Board of Education, and the Sevier County Superintendent of Education. The County, governed by the average daily attendance, provided teachers for the basic subjects necessary for an accredited school. It seemed unfortunate that this particular area should lack instruction in Crafts, Music, and Woodworking; so the fraternity again furnished teachers and materials for those classes. In addition, Sharon Dexter, the Assistant to the Director, taught the Journalism Class which published The .Mounatin Echo, the school paper. Sharon also was co-sponsor of the Student Council which gave her a valuable contact with the student body. 3. Al-though the County raised the teachers' salaries for two years, the salary scale is too low to attract and hold teachers from outside the immediate area. Lodging and food at a reasonable cost in the attractive Staff House was the deciding factor for some of the out-of-town teachers who otherwise could not have afforded too teach in Gatlinburg. There were four teachers who lived with the resident staff and contributed much to the group. 5. One of the gratifying ways of helping youth along the road to a high school education was via the dormitories for boys and girls. Approximately 50% of the children rode the school bus. They walked down mountain paths to wait along the concrete road for the school bus; how-ever, there were 18 who lived too far to commute daily by bus and it was those who profited from the experience in group living and supervised work. For $5.00 per month and certain work assignments, these teen-agers had the opportunity to seek a high school education because of the Pi Beta Phi dormitories, Stuart Cottage and Helmick House. Mrs. Mueller had the difficult task of refusing five girls this chance. Not enough Pi Phis realize that when they made a contribution to Settlement School, they under-write this educational privilege for youth since the small fee requested could not cover the entire expense. Nevertheless the sum was a large one for a family with several children in school. One girl washed dishes for the Summer Craft Workshop last summer to earn her money for school. Ruth Spelman, Illinois Epsilon, chaperoned the girls, assisted wtih study table or sewing projects, and was ready to give requested advice. The Assistant to the Director aided with study table, helped with special parties, and conducted a weekly discussion period on good grooming an'd other topics of interest to growing girls. Mrs. Mueller gave much attention to the dormitory children and drove many to the school sport events. The greatest compliment to the dormitory program came from the member of the Board of Education who expressed the wish that all of the students could live in the Pi Beta Phi dorms. Thesepeople received more in their high school education than the academic classwork. 6. The Brendal legacy supplied funds for scholarships for children in school. The Alspaugh Scholarship Fund had a sum available for graduates of the Pi Beta Phi School. It is expected that during the summer one or two may apply. Last summer one of the dormitory graduates received assistance on her tuition for further training. 7. Fifteen years ago, the fraternity extended the educational opportunities to include instruction on the college level. The Summer Craft Workshop, jointly sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee, again used the Settlement School plant after the close of the school year. Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamma and Director of the Workshop, assembled a fine staff of instructors which attracted students from twenty-five states and three foreign countries. Two young Pi Phis served as Graduate Assistants and another one was sent by the Southern California Area Council on a scholarship. The "temporary" plan for fourteen years required the annual conversion of the 44 year old elementary school building into dormitory accommodations for additional low cost housing, This became more difficult each year until, as a pioneer among summer workshops, Committee felt that Pi Phi should push, pull or get off of the right of way, unless it could maintain the highest of standards for workshop lodging. Lincoln once said, "I will get ready and perhaps my chance will come." That good advice was followed for immediately after the June 1958 meeting, contacts were made and plans started for remodeling the conveniently located Red Barn if and when the chance came. With the receipt of the Marion Stoner Huey legacy and the settlement of the Joanna Hempstead estate, the chance came and all was ready to spring into action. As a result the new dormitory was finished for the 1959 Workshop although the first students caught the staff adding the finishing touches when they walked into the building. In the presence of the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee, the Province Officers, Little Pigeon Alumna Club, and local friends, the Dedication on June 22 launched the Red Barn on a new career of service. Built in 1923, the model barn housed the Pi Beta Phi herd and furnished many practical demonstrations for proper farming methods. In 1923 Indianapolis Alumnae Club gave a motion picture machine to the School and there in the hayloft, the first movies were shown in Gatlinburg. Families walked miles in the dark to see this new form of visual education. Here in the hayloft the first basketball games were played in the Burg where in June the group gathered in the lovely, large lounge for the service. A most generous, extra gift from the Pasadena, California Club furnished the Owl's Nest Lounge in which the original rafters added a distinctive, decorative touch. With the multiple-use rooms, small intensive Workshops can be held during the seasons when the school buildings are in use. With these facilities, new, challenging vistas for future service appeared. The first chance came in late July when the Red Barn afforded additional housing to craftsmen participating in the Craftsman's Fair sponsored by the Southern Highland Guild of which Pi Beta Phi was a charter member. It meant a great deal to the people in the area to have the Fair back again in Gatlinburg; so the fraternity was glad to co-operate. The Fair will be welcomed back again in 1960 and 1961 and the Settlement School staff and facilities will support the project. Educators, craftsmen, and social workers have presented many stimulating suggestions as to possible avenues of endeavor which could be in session 'during spring, summer, and fall. Interestingly enough they all fall into the fields in 28 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 29 which Pi Phi has worked at Settlement School-Education, Health and Crafts. The following are a few mentioned: Workshops for local mountain weavers; Workshops, national in scope, to train occupational therapists, craft instructors in crippled children's hospitals, bedside craft instructors who go into the homes as volunteers for community service and craft instructors working with those who are mentally ill. With retirement at sixty-five years and miracle drugs to keep the senior citizens alive another twenty years, crafts have been suggested for both the old and the young. The attendance at the 1959 Workshop demonstrated the need for the above training for leadership and to this list should be added many more modern needs. Pi Phis wondered if nearby chapters might not find it a wonderful experience to have a Settlement School week-end in the Red Barn ? Mrs. Mueller, the Director, would be happy to work out details for one if consulted. Then, too, wouldn't a Pi Phi houseparty be fun held at Settlement School on a specific week-end? Naturally this could and should include alumna. We have come "a fur piece" down the road to education. To climb a steep hill required a slow pace at first but this year with the Red Barn/Dorm, we reached a high spot from which we view the possible roads ahead. Much credit goes to Marion Mueller's on-the-spot supervision and tireless energy during the remodeling project. The University of Tennessee staff's encouragement and the co-operation of Marian Heard during the selection of furnishings was much appreciated. The road to Health was opened up approximately thirty-nine years ago. A solid base was needed for this roadway; so a "superhighway" program was planned which combined the services of Public Health Visiting and School Nursing, Red Cross and Emergency Service. Carelessness could endanger the life of many; so in recent years education and preventive measures have been stressed by the resident, Pi Phi nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, R.N., who is in charge of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center. A few statistics show the ground covered last year. 1. The children in the Pi Beta Phi Schools and the last rural school in the vicinity received physical examinations, hearing tests, and inoculations. 2. A special examination clinic for football players was held with the co-operation of the local physician. Football practice brought calls for first aid. 3. No other school in Sevier County held the preschool round-up in the spring with a careful check in the summer to complete routine preventive inoculations. Preparation for such a clinic was complicated and required much desk work and records. 4. Glades, the last rural school with forty children in eight grades and one teacher, welcomed the films on nutrition, safety, good grooming, and dental health. One program featured pamphlets with song, games, and stories; each child had something special to take home. 5. Chest X Rays were given; however, a state pro-gram of transition from Chest X Rays to tuberculin testing is under way. This necessitates purchase of special equipment for auto claving needles and syringes for the testing. More than half of the money for the clave has been received thanks to gifts from several alumni clubs. 6. Well-Baby clinics were held each Friday afternoon. 7. Nearly every month medical meetings were held at Health Center. The nurse benefited from the conferences and films shown. 8. As a member of the Defense Council, the Pi Phi nurse was called to a meeting for the revision of notes pertaining to the Health Department vital to Civil Defense plans for Gatlinburg. 9. Emergency care and matters pertaining to health and safety took precedent over all else. The following statistics show the "traffic" over the highway to Health during 1958-59. Field visits 584 Office calls 3904 Service given 3427 Smallpox vaccinations Total typhoid inoculations' i215 g Completed typhoid series and boosters 2i3.4 Total triple vaccine 294Completed triple vaccine and boosters 183 Salk Vaccine 354 Influenza vaccine 8 Tetanus toxoid 22 Therapeutic inoculations 296 Health Talks 152 Family Conferences 130 Nurse-Teacher Conferences 167 Physical Examinations and Inspections 3501 Chesa X Rays 891 The road marked Crafts started first when mountain people beat a path to the door of the Settlement School with their handcrafts. Alumnie became interested; then Gene Redding was called to revive the diminishing interest in the art of weaving. Gradually better roads led back to the cabins in the beautiful Smokies and over them journeyed the natives seeking a dignified method to earn a livelihood through crafts. Thanks to the co-operation of alumni clubs, Pi Beta Phi has put into the hands of native craftsmen well over a HALF MILLION DOLLARS. Many members are unaware of this amazing fact and also that foreign visitors annually come to see how the Pi Phi cottage industry has been operated to bring security to the mountain people. Gene Redding reported that 75 weavers were used last year; 60 wove the entire year and the others averaged six months. She made 102 calls in the homes to supervise their work and to teach them to weave the new designs. Three of the weavers were in their middle seventies and going strong; the two youngest were juniors in high school who were weaving to earn money for their clothes and books. In addition to supervision of the weavers, Gene designed new articles for the 1959-60 Arrowcraft Price List. Included in the group are new skirts, men's ties, 2 place mats and a linen finger tip towel. It is hoped that chairmen will remember these when ordering this year. Elizabeth Rue, Arrowcraft Manager, was convinced that the Convention display brought increased orders for Arrow-craft. About seven-eighths of the clubs ordered Arrowcraft products and cook books. It was necessary to reorder the blue paper sacks with the wine trademark. These were used at a number of club sales and are available again in four sizes. They are attractive and silently advertise Arrowcraft. The note paper with the Settlement School etchings were ordered again for they were inexpensive, useful sale articles. It was advisable to order the third edition of the cook book in order to have a sufficient supply for the clubs during the pre-holiday sales. The Shop will be open during the summer at night to accommodate the tourists. Several of the staff have volunteered to be on duty during this night shift. There have been resignations and Christine Wilson and Jean Humbrey have joined the sales force. It was with regret that the resignation was accepted from Mrs. McCutchan who was in charge of the Mountain View Hotel Shop. Eva Hathway and Elizabeth Rue will manage temporarily until other plans are completed. There were 17 clubs which paid for $1000 or more of Arrowcraft products during the last fiscal year. They de-serve special commendation for such achievement does not happen accidently. Champiagn-Urbana .$3,829.12 Pittsburgh South $1,303.63 Hills Pittsburgh 2,177.19 Oklahoma City 1,917.52 Indianapolis 1,284.45 Arlington Heights 1,791.58 Milwaukee 1,138.22 Kansas City, Mo. 1,694.69 Warren-Mahoney 1,093.87 South Bend 1,483.74 Maria County 1,086.22 Philadelphia .1,452.34 Cleveland East 1,067.42 Portland, Ore. 1,310.05 Santa Barbara 1,055.57 Tulsa 1,304.15 Toledo 1,013.46 One chapter rated membership in the $1000 Club. Vermont Alpha $1,169.71 Without the other clubs, which also worked hard, the Arrowcraft project could not have succeeded; so they, too, deserve a word of praise. It is still urged that groups pay Arrowcraft accounts promptly instead of sending one sum at the close of the fiscal year; all accounts are cleared by 30 May 31. Arrowcraft bills for salaries, threads, supplies, and utilities must be met each month; so this request can be easily understood. Located in a craft area where Pi Phi has pioneered to encourage the native talents, the Settlement School is strategically placed to develop the mountain craftsmen and to give training in craft skills to those who seek the Work-shops. The CRAFT road is one of beauty and opportunity, There have been no "toll roads" in connection with the Settlement School philanthropy. All gifts and support were contributed voluntarily without assessments. It was encouraging to note the increase in giving for last year. The alumnee clubs sent $11,170.91, a gain of $1806.46. How-ever when it is realized that Pasadena's special $1000 gift was in this sum, it would seem in this day of inflation, this extra amount just maintained the purchasing power of the dollars which 'do not go as far as they once did but make up for it in speed. A bit of research revealed the fact that 48 of the clubs in existence 10 years ago gave the same sum this year as they did a decade ago. Think how the dollar's buying power has decreased during those ten years ! Reliable statistics reveal that it takes $120 to equal the $100 contributed in 1949. The challenge to the membership is that their gifts should keep pace with inflation. Few realized how honest the government was a few years back when they reduced the size of the dollar bills. The Clubs in the following eleven Provinces were 100% in contributions to Settlement School. Alpha Zeta Lambda Beta Theta Xi Gamma Iota Pi Epsilon Kappa There were 14 Clubs which contributed $150 or more towards the maintenance of the project.

The Active Chapters gave $2,718.18 which was $155.65 more than the previous year. Unfortunately some checks were received too late to be included in the report. The following 13 Provinces were 100% in Chapter contributions to Settlement School. Alpha Zeta Lambda Beta Eta Mu Gamma Iota Nu Epsilon Kappa Omicron Pi Another Chapter joined the ranks of those sending $100 or more; this makes five groups in the $100 club. Texas A $150.00 Montana A $125.00 Texas 1' 150.00 Missouri B 100.00 Texas B $100.00 Great praise is deserved by the many Pi Phis who did a magnificent job in selling magazines to meet budget requirements. Earned commissions resulted in a check from the Magazine Agency amounting to $ 10,060.41 which surpassed the previous year by $1,012.23. Their work brought success, however, all know Success is nothing more than a good idea coupled with hard work. Here are some who achieved. Club Chapter Highest Commissions St. Louis $756.30 Texas B $305.58 Highest per capita Valley of the Moon 6.91 Texas B 4.13 A new way the Clubs gave assistance this year was through the trading stamp project. The goal was for each Club to send a book of SH or Top Value Stamps to the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Director of Settlement School in Gatlinburg. Approximately 51 books were received; however that did not represent the number of clubs for one sent 9 books. It was a method which did not put extra strain on Club treasury. In the Director's report will be found a list of articles which were secured. It was suggested that this "share Some Stamps" become an annual project. A stamp chairman could be on hand at each meeting to receive donations an'd most members would be glad to give a few. The new dorm could use some new blankets for cool evenings ! It was only because of the legacies left to Settlement School that many of the buildings now stand on the grounds. Without them, the program would be curtailed drastically. It is hoped others will wish to follow the ex-ample of these loyal Pi Phis. All highways need maintenance and the Pi Phi "roads" were no exception. A narrow walk was put in back of Health Center; now the children coming to the Nurse from school do not get damp feet nor track in dirt. The first furnace in Gatlinburg, which served faithfully since 1916, must be replaced. With so much grass to cut, it was necessary to purchase a power mower this summer. The trim on Arrowcraft, Staff House, and Health Center needs painting. The front walk and porch should be repaired in the interest of safety at the latter place. The Staff House is due for some interior painting and according to schedule, Pollard should be painted this year. Each year one building is painted in order to save the strain on the budget that comes from doing all of the buildings at once. At some future date, the Pi Phi Lane should be finished with the black-top continued from Stuart Cottage to Staff House. High on the Wishing List is a dishwasher which would add to the efficiency of the kitchen during Workshops. Also included is a station wagon to replace the School car which is at least eight years old. This gives an idea of how the money should or could be spent. A famous Pi Phi husband, Calvin Coolidge said, "We can't do everything at once but we can do something at once." It is 'hoped that all groups will at once plan a good Settlement School program which will give its membership up-to-date information. Former members of the Settlement School Committee as well as present Committee members and Workshop students should be invited to talk. Use should be made of program material which has been sent out. This year Suzanne Walker, West Virginia Alpha, with her program won the May L. Keller award for the best Chapter Settlement School program. It will be in the fall mailing. The Arrowcraft sale offers little current information and members would be more enthusiastic boosters of the Arrowcraft project if supplied with up-to-date facts. If you know, you care, if you care, you share. This leads to another "something" which can be done at once. Each group can rethink its contribution to the unique, Pi Phi philanthropy in relation to economic trends. They call it legal tender That green and crispy stuff. It's tender when you 'have it, But when you don't, it's tough. Engineers are needed for the planning and supervising of road construction. The Settlement School Committee stands in this relationship to the building and maintenance of the Settlement School "roads." Two new members came on the Committee this June. Annie Laurie Keys Whipple (Mrs. Sidney H.), Tennessee Alpha, has served the fraternity as a capable Province President an'd will assume the duties of secretary which were relinquished by Edna Archibald upon the expiration of her term of office. Edna's advice and concern will be missed at the meetings 'but her support will continue in Baltimore. The second newcomer to Committee was Lois Overstreet Summers (Mrs. C. H.), Florida Beta, formerly an efficient Province Vice-President. She will be in charge of slide distributions. Last year 30 Clubs and 41 Chapters used the slide program. The set of slides with THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the script furnished a compact, comprehensive view of the project. All pledges especially should see this program. Helen Moffett Russell (Mrs. Robert), Illinois Eta, becomes the new Committee Chairman. Helen brings to the appointment a fine background of fraternity experience as a Province President, a member of a Chapter Advisory Board and the Chairman of the Committee on Chaperons. Lois Snyder Finger (Mrs. Raymond) continues as Publicity Chairman and will assist with publicity for Arrowcraft sales as well as other types of Settlement School publicity. Zoe Saunders James (Mrs. Richard) continues as the able treasurer. Before I end my last annual report to the fraternity membership, I wish to express my pleasure in the close 31 association with the Settlement School. I have appreciated the opportunity to become acquainted with loyal Pi Phis throughout the country. I have been grateful for the co-operation and support of Grand Council and Committee. But, especially, it has been a privilege to have a tiny part in this unrivaled philanthropy which has contributed so much to American culture. Sometimes the road was hard but everything worthwhile is upgrade at times. Besides there were always worthy ends in sight. Future opportunities at Settlement School thrill my imagination. One can never tell what lies beyond the hilltop! VIRGINIA BRACKETT GREEN, Chairman SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR Welcome Aboard for SPECIAL FLIGHT to Gatlinburg, Tennessee home of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. This is an imaginary flight because the nearest airport is forty miles away. You will note super highways leading to this Burg nestled in the foothills of the "Land of the Great Smoke," better known as the Great Smokies. Scattered throughout the Smokies are scores of mountains, valleys, and streams that in their names tell stories of the way of pioneer life among them is Gatlinburg on Little Pigeon River. Tourists and crafts vie with each other for priority in the area. Yes, there are many ultra modern motels and a convention hall, but in contrast and within close range there are many remnants of the past. Gatlinburg is unique with its mixture of the past and the present. We are now looking at the Settlement School grounds approximately seventy-eight acres with the school in the heart of town. Arrowcraft Shop and Health Center are on the highway (also the main street) immediately back of these is our original log cabin school which houses the high school woodcraft classes, and arts and crafts classes in winter, jewelry in summer workshop. The field-stone building you see is the junior and senior high school used by Pi Beta Phi in summer. The four houses along the hillside house staff and dormitory students in winter and summer. The old log cabin is Pi Beta Phi museum of pioneer items. Yes, you see a large red barn! That is the new barn/dormitory which houses workshop students and/or educational groups. It is planned for multi-purpose use. Various size groups may be accommodated. Thirty to forty can sleep there the younger girls in Little Pigeon Loft. The Owl's Nest (lounge) accommodates seventy-five or more for group meetings. June 22nd this was the scene of the Barn/Dorm Dedication the culmination of a dream come true for many. Chanticleer's lounge (entrance lounge) accommodates smaller groups. Yes, we like our barn very much and are very grateful for the cooperation of Council and Committee in helping this dream come true. Arrowcraft Shop ships all over the United States. Over two hundred Pi Beta Phi Clubs ordered this last year. Eighteen groups paid one thousand dollars or more to Arrowcraft for merchandise. With the attractive new items this fall doubtless more Clubs will surpass their previous records. Champaign-Urbana led in payments to Arrowcraft this last fiscal year. Eva Hathaway and Elizabeth Rue are operating the Mountain View Shop part time. Arrowcraft is a shop for which Pi Phi can be proud with the quality of excellent handcrafts weaving, woodcraft, baskets, brooms, pottery, jewelry and enameling leading in popularity. Many craftsmen claim Arrowcraft as their chief out-let for sales. It is a thrilling sight to see the crafts as they are brought in by their producers. This includes stacks upon stacks of beautiful weaving. We realize the important part our Clubs have in this project. My verbal thank you is inadequate, I know. My wish is that every Pi Phi might visit with us not only to see, but to realize the scope of this project. The school dormitory is a source of pride as well as a challenge to us. It is a challenge to help these children obtain an education, this is not .an easy matter for some. Several would have over a mile to walk on rural roads. Some do not have an aptitude for study. Eighteen boys and girls completed the year at Settlement School six of whom graduated. Ruth Spelman (Illinois Epsilon) served again quite capably as housemother and Sharon Dexter (Illinois Zeta) as assistant to the director. There were many projects during the year with the dormitory children hikes, trips to football and basketball games, crafts, grooming classes, study groups, Halloween, Christmas, Valentine parties, and picnics. All these events contributed toward a definite dormitory spirit. A waiting list for the dormitory served as an incentive to our dorm students. Each year our dormitory children participate in school activities more and more. This last year four boys participated in football, five in basketball, two in Student Council, six in Athletic Club, two in Beta Club, one each in senior and junior play and six on senior trip. Jim Brackins was co-captain of the football team, Shirley Wild Football Queen. Ella Mae received the Mathematics award, Gerry was outstanding athlete, Marjorie outstanding girl athlete, also outstanding Home Economics student and an officer in the Athletic Club. We can justly be proud of this record. Marjorie Chalmer's statistics at the Health Center prove that she has been quite busy. Practically all her work is now preventive and first aid, with baby clinic, inoculations, pre-school clinic, TB x-ray clinic, physical examinations and inspections in all the rooms and followups when necessary. There is one rural school where calls are made. One by one these schools are passing with the march of time. Anna Belle Lee is returning to Pi Phi to teach Arts and Crafts, Mrs. Enloe is teaching music again, and Carl Huskey is teaching two classes in Woodcraft. Orlie and Neal tend to our property, taking pride in preventing a run-down look on the premises. Orlie is starting his thirty-third year with Settlement School. Richard is busy farming during the week. His avocation is the ministry on Sundays and spare time. Mrs. Adams is starting her seventh year as cook. She apparently enjoys the jelly-making, pickling and preparation for the deep freeze. At least the hearty appetites en-courage her in her cuisine. Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee workshop was truly one of the best in number and quality. Again directed by Marian Heard from the University of Tennessee beautiful crafts were produced. There were many professional workers three who work with the blind, one in a correction home for girls, several university extension workers, a rehabilitation worker, several art teachers, craft teachers, elementary teachers, an architect, and a retired M.D. Some come just for fun, most to obtain credit, and many to pre-pare for a hobby. All these come from twenty-five states and three foreign countries Indonesia, Philippines, and Canada. Nine Pi Phis attended among them our new Settlement School Chairman, Helen Russell (Mrs. Robert). Rikki 3a THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Brockway came on the Southern California Area Council scholarship. The Southern Highland Handcraft Fair has been giving thousands of visitors a chance to see and talk with members demonstrating their crafts, watch folk dances, hear ballads, as well as purchase from the Craftsmen themselves. This is ideally situated in the Civic Auditorium. Experts in over forty crafts bring their displays and sales during the five-day period in late July. Of course, our Arrowcraft shop sells and exhibits. Good entertainment for the tourists was available during the summer. The last Saturday in June is the traditional day for the Old Timers. "Chucky jack" completed its fourth season in a nearby amphitheatre. This depicts the early history of Tennessee. ... The Gateway Stock Company returned for its thirteenth season. John Richards of New York Academy of Drama directs the plays a repertoire of five plays. The gift list is a long one. Many, many thanks to each donor. There were gifts for the dormitories, Health Center, Christmas gifts, clothing, books and many stamp books for the barn/dormitory. With stamps two card table and chair sets, a lamp, steam iron, sheets, coffee pot, tea kettle, mixing bowls, room divider, and waste basket were purchased. Our staff participates in many community projects. Sharon teaches a high school class in Journalism and sponsors the printing of the school paper. She also served last year as co-sponsor of the Student Council. . . . Gene Red-ding has designed several new items for Arrowcraft and all winter has been planning for the room exhibits at the Fair. . . . Marjorie Chalmers worked with the personnel for the Fair. . . . Marion Mueller served as president of the Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the local arrangements for the Fair. Various other offices have been held in church organizations, clubs, and P.T.A. It is a privilege to be at Settlement School to live with this memorial to our Founders. And how fortunate that Settlement School is located in this garden spot, considered by many to be one of America's greatest treasures withendless wonder and beauty. This concludes our flight. We hope you can come again soon. Happy landings ! Respectfully submitted, MARION W.
