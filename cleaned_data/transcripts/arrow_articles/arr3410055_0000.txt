        54 THE ARR.OTV OF PI BETA PHI and of property interest is so great that state universities canont deal with this matter in a separate, distinct manner from that pursued by non-state schools. The consensus of opinion everywhere forces the state universities to recognize that they have a very potent and valuable agency in these secret societies which control the large property interests referred to, and which control very much larger values than those expressed by material property because they control so largely the general scholastic activities and the extra-scholastic activities such as athletics, social relations, debating, dramatic and literary activities of the institutions in which they have their residence. I believe there is great unanimity of opinion that any failure of fraternities to justify their existence in state universities must be shared both by the fraternity members and by the members of faculties. My own opinion is that fraternities are justifying their existence in a large majority of instances in our state universities, and I am convinced that most of the deficiencies that do exist may be eliminated by a closer affiliation of the national and chapter authorities of all fraternities with the administrative and teaching staff in the universities. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL BOARD Fort Sam Houston, Tex. June 1, 1917. To the Grand Council: The Chairman of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee makes the following annual report: School: The sixth session of the school opened on Monday, August 7, 1916, with Elva Plank, Helen Virginia Ikerd, Helen Weinberg, Margaret Brown, and Florence Helmick present for duty. Margaret Brown arrived ill, attended school one day, and was obliged to give up. After six weeks' rest she came back only to leave again permanently. Florence Helmick substituted for Julia Barksdale during the month of August, and on September 4 the latter assumed her duties. December 1 Mr. and Mrs. Norman R. Prickett took charge of the industrial work. Your chairman was present at the Settlement from June 29 to November 24. Miss Plank did not return to the school after the Christmas holidays until the latter part of January when, after nine days, she was called home by the illness of her mother and did not return. Helen Ikerd left the ninth of February to accept a position at her home for the balance of the year at a higher salary. The duties of Miss Plank and Miss Ikerd at the school were divided among the remaining workers and were very satisfactorily performed. The school closed March 30 with an enrollment of 131 pupils during the year 63 boys and 68 girls. Of these, 38 boys and 51 girls, or 89, satisfactorily completed their grades and were promoted. Our school has earned the distinction of being the best school in the county. REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL BOARD 55 Pupils have been sent to us from Sevierville I6 miles distance the parents boarding them in private families while attending school. Industrial Work: The first part of the year, the actual industrial work of the school suffered because of Miss Brown's illness. In December, Mr. and Mrs. Prickett arrived, and threw their best energies into the work with gratifying results. It is hoped the coming year will be productive of still greater attainments. The people made in their homes more baskets than in any previous year, and the money made from this fast increasing home industry made a showing in the appearance of our pupils. New Residence: Work on the new residence was begun on August 21, and from this time until November 2 (when I was forced to go to bed with an infected foot) I was daily with the workmen to see that the work was properly done and no shirking. It took twenty-four days to clear the land, dig the hillside away, and lay the foundation. On September 18 the carpenter's work began and on December 13 the teachers began to move in. The building stands about forty feet west of the cottage; the front door faces the driveway from the main road. Upon entering the main hall the large bright dining-room is in front of you; to the left is the large community room, and back of it the small kitchen, with the pantry between. On the right of the hall is the library, and in the southwest corner is the office, with the stairway and lavatory between them. Upstairs are five bedrooms and a bathroom, with closets in each room and two closets in the hall. The third floor is finished with a flooring only and affords storage room for trunks, etc. The basement is under half of the house and is of concrete. The heating plants, plumbing, and bath fixtures are the best to be had. The building cost approximately $4,748.43 which is $1,251.57 less than the lowest bidder by contract, and we have a better building and equipment than any contractor would have given us. Bungalow: Before beginning the teachers' residence I built for my own use at Gatlinburg a four-room bungalow, which later Anne and Melinda Stuart bought from me and gave to the school. This is a picturesque building built on the steep hillside east of the cottage. It is twelve feet from the ground in front and rests on the ground on the rear. It has a ten-foot piazza across its entire front, a large living-room with a rough rock chimney, two good-sized bedrooms and a small kitchen, each room furnished comfortably for camp life. A loft is over the entire building, with windows on three sides, well ventilated and usable, reached by a ladder-stairway which cart be raised when not in use and forms a panel in the ceiling. Improvements: While we had the workmen and materials on the ground, it was very easy to do many odd jobs which had been needed for a long time. (1) The two toilets built and used by the school were replaced by more sanitary and sightly ones. Lattice screens were built in front of them and vines will be trained to cover the latter. (2) The hot air furnace put in the school building in 1915 by the con-tractor never heated the rooms during cold winter weather. When bids were asked for plumbing and heating in the residence, prices were asked to include a steam heating outfit for the school building and by having it put in at the same time, the cost was reduced. The school now has a large steam heating plant which has proved entirely satisfactory during the most severe winter weather at a cost of approximately $900. (3) In the schoolhouse hall, library shelves were built to accommodate all our books, and Miss Weinberg, who had charge of the library, went care-fully through every book, numbering and reclassifying them and then catalogued them in a regular library catalogue book, furnished for that purpose. Near by was a small table, with the recording book, where each book was entered when taken out and when returned, and she tried to make the library an important factor in the school life. . 'IlE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI (4) The extra passage to the basement in the schoolhouse was floored and shelves built in from the floor to the ceiling making a most needed storeroom for school supplies. (5) A small floor was put down in the unfinished loft of the school building and the great accumulation of old books, magazines, etc., stored neatly here, and when the teachers went visiting they could always find reading or pictures to take with them. (6) A much needed barn or shed for the children's horses that came from afar was built west of the schoolhouse, near Baskins, and filled a long want. (7) The boys and men worked freely for weeks leveling and picking out the stones from the school's baseball ground and they have made one of the best baseball diamonds in the county. At one time it was estimated that three hundred persons watched a game. A grand stand was very much desired and the proposition was made that the men and boys would do the work if the school would pay for the materials, which was agreed to, and we now have a pavilion beside the baseball grounds which will seat three hundred. It cost the school $ 19.72. (8) Since Dell Gillette's time, the town has provided along its roads a one or two plank walk for the benefit of school children, but we had never had a walk of any kind from the main road to the schoolhouse. Here we built a four-foot walk from 2-inch plank on raised sleepers, and this soon became the favorite boulevard on fair Sunday afternoons and moonlight nights. This walk, where two persons could walk side by side, was a long stride in modernizing Gatlinburg. At recess, the older children and teachers got their exercise and recreation walking up and down the "board walk" arm in arm. (9) Swings were erected for the smaller children and the teachers took keen interest in encouraging healthful play and physical development. Hospital: The community needs a hospital. Last year we had many deaths from diphtheria. One nurse with experience might have saved many lives, for parents were helpless. In many cases when the child became ill the parents and neighbors for miles would crowd into a small, stuffy room and "set" by the patient's bedside, administering remedies thick and fast with harmful results. It was impossible to enforce a quarantine ; the only doctor who visited them refused to attempt it. We had to close school. Now, that the residence has been completed and money has been subscribed sufficiently to equip and meet the running expenses for the coming three years, it might be wise to allow the old cottage to be used temporarily by a Red Cross country nurse. With our Country's future so unsettled I do not recommend the establishment of a hospital with wards, operating room, etc., at the present time. While this move is separate from the school until provided for and and turned over to the Fraternity by the Founders, it has been developed in conjunction with the school. Social Life: The Grand Council today would see a marked change for the better in our people. Each year at Gatlinburg our life grows broader and more strenuous. Our people are developing fast. The year has been one of hard work for everyone connected with the school. The teachers "went avisiting" practically every afternoon, when the weather permitted ; entertainments were given often in the schoolhouse, also parties in the cottage, and many "sings" and suppers were given in return by the people. A new piano, ,a gift of the Boston Alumnae Club, opened a new field for cultivation, for other pianos were bought and piano lessons and singing became popular. Mr. Prickett is a Missionary Baptist with a strong leading voice. He seems to have won the respect and love of the people and has helped in the village life, especially with the young men. The church services, under Mr. Conner, the well-conducted Sunday School which includes nearly all who go to church, the popular and well-organized B.Y.P.U. of the younger children, and later in the evening of the older ones every Sunday evening, showing intelligent and FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 57 keen interest and research, with the much softened choir are very gratifying changes due entirely to the influence of our Pi Phi School's teachers. Future: I consider that we are now working under quite modern conditions in our schoolroom. The classes are regular. I would like to suggest to the Grand Council, for their consideration, the following: (a) That wetry to manage with one less teacher, that is, three beside Mr. and Mrs. Prickett. (b) That the Head Resident be principal of the school, and take part of the work of teaching. (c) That a housekeeper be hired for the necessary work. The cost per capita for educating our children compared with other mountain schools is too large. After five months' observation I do not consider it good business to pay a woman $50 a month and board and travel expenses for purely the school's business. The Head Resident can manage to do all the letter writing she is called upon to do, teach a class or more, and have time for all school business if she will systematize her work and give the school eight hours daily, if she has no cooking or housework. The Head Resident has heretofore written the Chairman of the Committee every week. She should also write the Grand Vice-president and other members of the Grand Council if they wish. She has duplicating conveniences; it would not be a bad idea for her to write during the year a letter or more to every alumnae club that they may know at first hand what is being done at Little Pigeon. Our Pi Phi teachers have been wonderfully fine workers and it is not so necessary that they be experienced if they have the other qualities for success. Our greatest need is for a permanent Head Resident who is wise, big minded, unselfish, and sincere. The duties are exceedingly trying at times ; the life, outside of the Settlement House, one of isolation and lacking in all that is dear to the heart of the cultured and refined. As the Head Resident is the leader, she can do little or much as her conscience or strength may prompt. The people are so thankful for everything that only we who have lived among them and know what can be accomplished are aware of the possibilities for the future. Our Little Pigeon is no legitimate field for the theorist, the dreamer, the invalid, or comfort-loving worker; it is hard, day after day, unromantic work. We must have young, bright, cheerful, and faithful workers; Pi Phis who can sing, who can find the sweet and joyous in the life from the hills and freedom and simplicity in their surroundings ; Pi Phis who can find a "silver lining" in the life before them ; who will treat our people as they would their friends at home and lift the people up and give them a part of their life. I feel that we have been very fortunate in having during our years of effort along the Little Pigeon such lovely characters, and this year has been only another added to our service to our Fraternity, our fellow-beings, our Country, and our God.

The Head Resident can manage to do all the letter writing she is called upon to do, teach a class or more, and have time for all school business if she will systematize her work and give the school eight hours daily, if she has no cooking or housework. The Head Resident has heretofore written the Chairman of the Committee every week. She should also write the Grand Vice-president and other members of the Grand Council if they wish. She has duplicating conveniences; it would not be a bad idea for her to write during the year a letter or more to every alumnae club that they may know at first hand what is being done at Little Pigeon. Our Pi Phi teachers have been wonderfully fine workers and it is not so necessary that they be experienced if they have the other qualities for success. Our greatest need is for a permanent Head Resident who is wise, big minded, unselfish, and sincere. The duties are exceedingly trying at times ; the life, outside of the Settlement House, one of isolation and lacking in all that is dear to the heart of the cultured and refined. As the Head Resident is the leader, she can do little or much as her conscience or strength may prompt. The people are so thankful for everything that only we who have lived among them and know what can be accomplished are aware of the possibilities for the future. Our Little Pigeon is no legitimate field for the theorist, the dreamer, the invalid, or comfort-loving worker; it is hard, day after day, unromantic work. We must have young, bright, cheerful, and faithful workers; Pi Phis who can sing, who can find the sweet and joyous in the life from the hills and freedom and simplicity in their surroundings ; Pi Phis who can find a "silver lining" in the life before them ; who will treat our people as they would their friends at home and lift the people up and give them a part of their life. I feel that we have been very fortunate in having during our years of effort along the Little Pigeon such lovely characters, and this year has been only another added to our service to our Fraternity, our fellow-beings, our Country, and our God.

HELm1cK, Treasurer. 54 THE ARR.OTV OF PI BETA PHI and of property interest is so great that state universities canont deal with this matter in a separate, distinct manner from that pursued by non-state schools. The consensus of opinion everywhere forces the state universities to recognize that they have a very potent and valuable agency in these secret societies which control the large property interests referred to, and which control very much larger values than those expressed by material property because they control so largely the general scholastic activities and the extra-scholastic activities such as athletics, social relations, debating, dramatic and literary activities of the institutions in which they have their residence. I believe there is great unanimity of opinion that any failure of fraternities to justify their existence in state universities must be shared both by the fraternity members and by the members of faculties. My own opinion is that fraternities are justifying their existence in a large majority of instances in our state universities, and I am convinced that most of the deficiencies that do exist may be eliminated by a closer affiliation of the national and chapter authorities of all fraternities with the administrative and teaching staff in the universities. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL BOARD Fort Sam Houston, Tex. June 1, 1917. To the Grand Council: The Chairman of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee makes the following annual report: School: The sixth session of the school opened on Monday, August 7, 1916, with Elva Plank, Helen Virginia Ikerd, Helen Weinberg, Margaret Brown, and Florence Helmick present for duty. Margaret Brown arrived ill, attended school one day, and was obliged to give up. After six weeks' rest she came back only to leave again permanently. Florence Helmick substituted for Julia Barksdale during the month of August, and on September 4 the latter assumed her duties. December 1 Mr. and Mrs. Norman R. Prickett took charge of the industrial work. Your chairman was present at the Settlement from June 29 to November 24. Miss Plank did not return to the school after the Christmas holidays until the latter part of January when, after nine days, she was called home by the illness of her mother and did not return. Helen Ikerd left the ninth of February to accept a position at her home for the balance of the year at a higher salary. The duties of Miss Plank and Miss Ikerd at the school were divided among the remaining workers and were very satisfactorily performed. The school closed March 30 with an enrollment of 131 pupils during the year 63 boys and 68 girls. Of these, 38 boys and 51 girls, or 89, satisfactorily completed their grades and were promoted. Our school has earned the distinction of being the best school in the county. REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL BOARD 55 Pupils have been sent to us from Sevierville I6 miles distance the parents boarding them in private families while attending school. Industrial Work: The first part of the year, the actual industrial work of the school suffered because of Miss Brown's illness. In December, Mr. and Mrs. Prickett arrived, and threw their best energies into the work with gratifying results. It is hoped the coming year will be productive of still greater attainments. The people made in their homes more baskets than in any previous year, and the money made from this fast increasing home industry made a showing in the appearance of our pupils. New Residence: Work on the new residence was begun on August 21, and from this time until November 2 (when I was forced to go to bed with an infected foot) I was daily with the workmen to see that the work was properly done and no shirking. It took twenty-four days to clear the land, dig the hillside away, and lay the foundation. On September 18 the carpenter's work began and on December 13 the teachers began to move in. The building stands about forty feet west of the cottage; the front door faces the driveway from the main road. Upon entering the main hall the large bright dining-room is in front of you; to the left is the large community room, and back of it the small kitchen, with the pantry between. On the right of the hall is the library, and in the southwest corner is the office, with the stairway and lavatory between them. Upstairs are five bedrooms and a bathroom, with closets in each room and two closets in the hall. The third floor is finished with a flooring only and affords storage room for trunks, etc. The basement is under half of the house and is of concrete. The heating plants, plumbing, and bath fixtures are the best to be had. The building cost approximately $4,748.43 which is $1,251.57 less than the lowest bidder by contract, and we have a better building and equipment than any contractor would have given us. Bungalow: Before beginning the teachers' residence I built for my own use at Gatlinburg a four-room bungalow, which later Anne and Melinda Stuart bought from me and gave to the school. This is a picturesque building built on the steep hillside east of the cottage. It is twelve feet from the ground in front and rests on the ground on the rear. It has a ten-foot piazza across its entire front, a large living-room with a rough rock chimney, two good-sized bedrooms and a small kitchen, each room furnished comfortably for camp life. A loft is over the entire building, with windows on three sides, well ventilated and usable, reached by a ladder-stairway which cart be raised when not in use and forms a panel in the ceiling. Improvements: While we had the workmen and materials on the ground, it was very easy to do many odd jobs which had been needed for a long time. (1) The two toilets built and used by the school were replaced by more sanitary and sightly ones. Lattice screens were built in front of them and vines will be trained to cover the latter. (2) The hot air furnace put in the school building in 1915 by the con-tractor never heated the rooms during cold winter weather. When bids were asked for plumbing and heating in the residence, prices were asked to include a steam heating outfit for the school building and by having it put in at the same time, the cost was reduced. The school now has a large steam heating plant which has proved entirely satisfactory during the most severe winter weather at a cost of approximately $900. (3) In the schoolhouse hall, library shelves were built to accommodate all our books, and Miss Weinberg, who had charge of the library, went care-fully through every book, numbering and reclassifying them and then catalogued them in a regular library catalogue book, furnished for that purpose. Near by was a small table, with the recording book, where each book was entered when taken out and when returned, and she tried to make the library an important factor in the school life. . 'IlE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI (4) The extra passage to the basement in the schoolhouse was floored and shelves built in from the floor to the ceiling making a most needed storeroom for school supplies. (5) A small floor was put down in the unfinished loft of the school building and the great accumulation of old books, magazines, etc., stored neatly here, and when the teachers went visiting they could always find reading or pictures to take with them. (6) A much needed barn or shed for the children's horses that came from afar was built west of the schoolhouse, near Baskins, and filled a long want. (7) The boys and men worked freely for weeks leveling and picking out the stones from the school's baseball ground and they have made one of the best baseball diamonds in the county. At one time it was estimated that three hundred persons watched a game. A grand stand was very much desired and the proposition was made that the men and boys would do the work if the school would pay for the materials, which was agreed to, and we now have a pavilion beside the baseball grounds which will seat three hundred. It cost the school $ 19.72. (8) Since Dell Gillette's time, the town has provided along its roads a one or two plank walk for the benefit of school children, but we had never had a walk of any kind from the main road to the schoolhouse. Here we built a four-foot walk from 2-inch plank on raised sleepers, and this soon became the favorite boulevard on fair Sunday afternoons and moonlight nights. This walk, where two persons could walk side by side, was a long stride in modernizing Gatlinburg. At recess, the older children and teachers got their exercise and recreation walking up and down the "board walk" arm in arm. (9) Swings were erected for the smaller children and the teachers took keen interest in encouraging healthful play and physical development. Hospital: The community needs a hospital. Last year we had many deaths from diphtheria. One nurse with experience might have saved many lives, for parents were helpless. In many cases when the child became ill the parents and neighbors for miles would crowd into a small, stuffy room and "set" by the patient's bedside, administering remedies thick and fast with harmful results. It was impossible to enforce a quarantine ; the only doctor who visited them refused to attempt it. We had to close school. Now, that the residence has been completed and money has been subscribed sufficiently to equip and meet the running expenses for the coming three years, it might be wise to allow the old cottage to be used temporarily by a Red Cross country nurse. With our Country's future so unsettled I do not recommend the establishment of a hospital with wards, operating room, etc., at the present time. While this move is separate from the school until provided for and and turned over to the Fraternity by the Founders, it has been developed in conjunction with the school. Social Life: The Grand Council today would see a marked change for the better in our people. Each year at Gatlinburg our life grows broader and more strenuous. Our people are developing fast. The year has been one of hard work for everyone connected with the school. The teachers "went avisiting" practically every afternoon, when the weather permitted ; entertainments were given often in the schoolhouse, also parties in the cottage, and many "sings" and suppers were given in return by the people. A new piano, ,a gift of the Boston Alumnae Club, opened a new field for cultivation, for other pianos were bought and piano lessons and singing became popular. Mr. Prickett is a Missionary Baptist with a strong leading voice. He seems to have won the respect and love of the people and has helped in the village life, especially with the young men. The church services, under Mr. Conner, the well-conducted Sunday School which includes nearly all who go to church, the popular and well-organized B.Y.P.U. of the younger children, and later in the evening of the older ones every Sunday evening, showing intelligent and FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 57 keen interest and research, with the much softened choir are very gratifying changes due entirely to the influence of our Pi Phi School's teachers. Future: I consider that we are now working under quite modern conditions in our schoolroom. The classes are regular. I would like to suggest to the Grand Council, for their consideration, the following: (a) That wetry to manage with one less teacher, that is, three beside Mr. and Mrs. Prickett. (b) That the Head Resident be principal of the school, and take part of the work of teaching. (c) That a housekeeper be hired for the necessary work. The cost per capita for educating our children compared with other mountain schools is too large. After five months' observation I do not consider it good business to pay a woman $50 a month and board and travel expenses for purely the school's business. The Head Resident can manage to do all the letter writing she is called upon to do, teach a class or more, and have time for all school business if she will systematize her work and give the school eight hours daily, if she has no cooking or housework. The Head Resident has heretofore written the Chairman of the Committee every week. She should also write the Grand Vice-president and other members of the Grand Council if they wish. She has duplicating conveniences; it would not be a bad idea for her to write during the year a letter or more to every alumnae club that they may know at first hand what is being done at Little Pigeon. Our Pi Phi teachers have been wonderfully fine workers and it is not so necessary that they be experienced if they have the other qualities for success. Our greatest need is for a permanent Head Resident who is wise, big minded, unselfish, and sincere. The duties are exceedingly trying at times ; the life, outside of the Settlement House, one of isolation and lacking in all that is dear to the heart of the cultured and refined. As the Head Resident is the leader, she can do little or much as her conscience or strength may prompt. The people are so thankful for everything that only we who have lived among them and know what can be accomplished are aware of the possibilities for the future. Our Little Pigeon is no legitimate field for the theorist, the dreamer, the invalid, or comfort-loving worker; it is hard, day after day, unromantic work. We must have young, bright, cheerful, and faithful workers; Pi Phis who can sing, who can find the sweet and joyous in the life from the hills and freedom and simplicity in their surroundings ; Pi Phis who can find a "silver lining" in the life before them ; who will treat our people as they would their friends at home and lift the people up and give them a part of their life. I feel that we have been very fortunate in having during our years of effort along the Little Pigeon such lovely characters, and this year has been only another added to our service to our Fraternity, our fellow-beings, our Country, and our God.
