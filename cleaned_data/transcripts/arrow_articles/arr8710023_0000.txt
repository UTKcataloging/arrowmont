        Pi (/meta ~hi ~ett~e~ne~ct School CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS, ARROWMONT A new Grand Vice President of Philanthropies, Sarah Hunt, (Mrs. Harold B.) met with us at our second conference of the Board of Governors, on October 16-19, '1969, in Gatlinburg, Tenn. She has special talents which will be of value to our meetings. The series of meetings were extraordinary this year, because we had the privilege of being with Grand Council part of the time. Its members planned their fall meeting to coincide with ours. There were serious working moments and fun moments, but most of all a sense of excellent ideas being communicated, to build, to promote and to enjoy being a part of the unique adventure of launching our school. And launch it we did, with a Cornerstone Laying in the crisp and sunny morning of October 18, standing in the roofless concrete second floor level court, Grand Council in shiny hard hats, to wield mortar with a trowel, to seal in the engraved cornerstone with accompaniment of prayers of thanksgiving and hope. The articles which were placed in the cornerstone were as follows: History of Settlement School Settlement School publicity pamphlets Whig Rose Book Mark 1969 Arrowcraft Catalogue and Arrowcraft Pamphlet 1969 Summer Craft Workshop Brochure The new Arrowmont Brochure Dean Odland's 10th Annual Letter to Alumnae and Friends A copy of the booklet "These Shining Things" compiled by Evelyn Peters Kyle. A copy of the booklet "They Stand Tall" compiled by Marianne Reid Wild and Ruth Williams Hanson. This is a biography of May L. Keller and Amy B. Onken Pages from the Information Arrow (1969) giving: Grand Council Members Board of Governors Members Staff of Settlement School Arrowmont Annual Report of Chairman, Elizabeth Y. Kingman Annual Report of Executive Coordinator, Lucile Woodworth The meetings of Grand Council and the Board of Governors continued jointly and separately as pre-arranged. A bonus was the preview of the Southern Highland Guild exhibits in the town auditorium on our last night. The committee work of the Board of Governors is mainly in the areas of communication and funding making the concept and work of Arrowmont understood, accepted, and inspiring. This is still an uphill job, of course, because of the need to replace the old idea of the grade school with the new idea of our unique Craft School. So, atpresent, our committees are as follows: Academic, Communication with Actives and Alumnae both in Canada and the U.S., Consultants, Cookbook sales, Objectives of the school, Personnel, Policies of the Governors. Program and Promotion, Property Advisory, Public Relations, Scholarships, Slide Programs, Ways and Means, and special gifts in the name of individuals or clubs. The committee work will in-crease and change as we progress in understanding our role and in attracting the interest of The Fraternity at large. The members of Grand Council have given wise advice at all times when asked. We are grateful for their view-points and support. We all appreciated, too, the individual meetings and rapport engendered. We feel fortunate to have as Executive Coordinator a dedicated Pi Phi, Lucile Woodworth. She has great ability in administration (staff, buildings, grounds), in merchandising (Arrowcraft Shop stocking and sales), and in public relations (she tries to be available to visit with all tourists from afar, and she keeps in touch with many alumnae) . She is civic-minded and is helping to foster a fine relationship between Gatlinburg and the Settlement School. Through her training and guidance the members of the very small staff are able to take on other tasks that arise with the growth of the number of visitors. Professor Marian Heard continues to be the valuable and respected academic director and craftsman that she has al-ways been. The 24 years of successful Summer Workshops on Pi Phi Hill attest to her stature and popularity in the craft world. We have a fine team in Lucile and Marian, working in accord. But their success and the projection for the future means that additional staff must be obtained very soon to maintain the momentum of the initial phase. Do I need to remind all Pi Phis that 1970 is our year of important "firsts"? We expect to inaugurate the school on a year round basis, so we shall have to have winter staffing for the first time. We shall have to prove that we can sup-port the challenge of this unique complex in Gatlinburg. It is an idea which has been long evolving through dedicated Pi Phis with vision, and it has been kept alive by faith, hard work and generosity. It can flower into significance if it is backed by the same Pi Phi attitudes of optimism and purposeful giving, expressed with increased awareness. Be-cause it fosters some of the most positive thinking and activity in the United States, who can predict where its influence will stop? Arrowmont is Pi Phi implementing itself in education and creativity. The training of the mind, eye, and the hand generates beauty and satisfaction. Thank you all for your continued and increasing philanthropic donations for Arrowmont to obtain its high goal. "A Pi Phi is an angel in disguise." ELIZABETH )(ELM KINGMAN EXECUTIVE COQRDINATOR, ARROWMONT AND ARROWCRAFT .ARROWMONT SCHOOL OF ARTS AND CRAFTS Beautiful new Arrowmont is completed. The donations you have made and the shingles you have bought have helped get the Centennial program underway. We have just started the new year-round program but 25 years of experience in this field and a reputation for excellence in arts and crafts will promote our growth and the results Will reach into every community of our country. This past year a slide program was made available for all of you and we hope this coming year that new slides showing our modern facilities in use will be viewed by every club and chapter. The Summer Workshops were doubled in length with outstanding teachers from many sections of our country participating. We would like for more Pi Phis to attend as students so they can better appreciate the work accomplished here and become ambassadors for Arrowmont . spreading the word as we will continue to need help in obtaining additional housing and other facilities. The Southern Highland Guild held their annual meeting at Arrowmont in April 1970. Each member was deeply impressed with our new building complex. Professor Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, was made a Life Member of the Guild. Her efforts and our affiliation with the University of Tennessee have been most instrumental in the progress we are making. It has been said that if in 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School had been programmed for the future, Arrowmont would have been the answer. 22 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 23 We can be truly proud of the support that every Pi Phi has given to our philanthropy through the past 58 years and now through the years to come. ARROWCRAFT SHOP Your Arrowcraft Shop has had its face lifted! Working conditions have been improved with additional shipping areas and enlarged storage space. The sales room was also updated. All this should make for more efficient operations. This past year was a banner year as clubs and chapters continued to hold those wonderful Settlement School sales. Visitors flocked to the door of Arrowcraft since it is recognized as the outstanding craft shop in the area. Our weaving is a big drawing card and the 62 weavers who weave for us are kept busy. It is hard to realize that over 20,000 Tote Bags and 15,0'00 Daisy Chain Mats were woven and sold this past year and that this is just a part of our weavers' production. In addition, we keep 70 other craftsmen busy producing other crafts. Pi Phi truly contributes to the craft economy of the Southern Highlands. With the constantly growing interest in crafts all over the country, Arrowcraft is called upon for numerous exhibits. One was the Cooperative Craft Exhibit held by the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. in October 1969. Arrowcraft was also honored with a request to vegetable dye yarn and weave material for a sofa at Gunston Hall in Lorton, Virginia, the historic home of George Mason. The original material was faded and worn and we successfully duplicated it. These are just two of our extra curricular activities of participation in the Craft World. In closing, I want to say that the work involved at Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts and the Arrowcraft Shop is handled by a very able staff management, supervisory, clerical and maintenance. It is their devotion and dedication to their responsibilities that deserve praise from all of us.

She has special talents which will be of value to our meetings. The series of meetings were extraordinary this year, because we had the privilege of being with Grand Council part of the time. Its members planned their fall meeting to coincide with ours. There were serious working moments and fun moments, but most of all a sense of excellent ideas being communicated, to build, to promote and to enjoy being a part of the unique adventure of launching our school. And launch it we did, with a Cornerstone Laying in the crisp and sunny morning of October 18, standing in the roofless concrete second floor level court, Grand Council in shiny hard hats, to wield mortar with a trowel, to seal in the engraved cornerstone with accompaniment of prayers of thanksgiving and hope. The articles which were placed in the cornerstone were as follows: History of Settlement School Settlement School publicity pamphlets Whig Rose Book Mark 1969 Arrowcraft Catalogue and Arrowcraft Pamphlet 1969 Summer Craft Workshop Brochure The new Arrowmont Brochure Dean Odland's 10th Annual Letter to Alumnae and Friends A copy of the booklet "These Shining Things" compiled by Evelyn Peters Kyle. A copy of the booklet "They Stand Tall" compiled by Marianne Reid Wild and Ruth Williams Hanson. This is a biography of May L. Keller and Amy B. Onken Pages from the Information Arrow (1969) giving: Grand Council Members Board of Governors Members Staff of Settlement School Arrowmont Annual Report of Chairman, Elizabeth Y. Kingman Annual Report of Executive Coordinator, Lucile Woodworth The meetings of Grand Council and the Board of Governors continued jointly and separately as pre-arranged. A bonus was the preview of the Southern Highland Guild exhibits in the town auditorium on our last night. The committee work of the Board of Governors is mainly in the areas of communication and funding making the concept and work of Arrowmont understood, accepted, and inspiring. This is still an uphill job, of course, because of the need to replace the old idea of the grade school with the new idea of our unique Craft School. So, atpresent, our committees are as follows: Academic, Communication with Actives and Alumnae both in Canada and the U.S., Consultants, Cookbook sales, Objectives of the school, Personnel, Policies of the Governors. Program and Promotion, Property Advisory, Public Relations, Scholarships, Slide Programs, Ways and Means, and special gifts in the name of individuals or clubs. The committee work will in-crease and change as we progress in understanding our role and in attracting the interest of The Fraternity at large. The members of Grand Council have given wise advice at all times when asked. We are grateful for their view-points and support. We all appreciated, too, the individual meetings and rapport engendered. We feel fortunate to have as Executive Coordinator a dedicated Pi Phi, Lucile Woodworth. She has great ability in administration (staff, buildings, grounds), in merchandising (Arrowcraft Shop stocking and sales), and in public relations (she tries to be available to visit with all tourists from afar, and she keeps in touch with many alumnae) . She is civic-minded and is helping to foster a fine relationship between Gatlinburg and the Settlement School. Through her training and guidance the members of the very small staff are able to take on other tasks that arise with the growth of the number of visitors. Professor Marian Heard continues to be the valuable and respected academic director and craftsman that she has al-ways been. The 24 years of successful Summer Workshops on Pi Phi Hill attest to her stature and popularity in the craft world. We have a fine team in Lucile and Marian, working in accord. But their success and the projection for the future means that additional staff must be obtained very soon to maintain the momentum of the initial phase. Do I need to remind all Pi Phis that 1970 is our year of important "firsts"? We expect to inaugurate the school on a year round basis, so we shall have to have winter staffing for the first time. We shall have to prove that we can sup-port the challenge of this unique complex in Gatlinburg. It is an idea which has been long evolving through dedicated Pi Phis with vision, and it has been kept alive by faith, hard work and generosity. It can flower into significance if it is backed by the same Pi Phi attitudes of optimism and purposeful giving, expressed with increased awareness. Be-cause it fosters some of the most positive thinking and activity in the United States, who can predict where its influence will stop? Arrowmont is Pi Phi implementing itself in education and creativity. The training of the mind, eye, and the hand generates beauty and satisfaction. Thank you all for your continued and increasing philanthropic donations for Arrowmont to obtain its high goal. "A Pi Phi is an angel in disguise." ELIZABETH )(ELM KINGMAN EXECUTIVE COQRDINATOR, ARROWMONT AND ARROWCRAFT .ARROWMONT SCHOOL OF ARTS AND CRAFTS Beautiful new Arrowmont is completed. The donations you have made and the shingles you have bought have helped get the Centennial program underway. We have just started the new year-round program but 25 years of experience in this field and a reputation for excellence in arts and crafts will promote our growth and the results Will reach into every community of our country. This past year a slide program was made available for all of you and we hope this coming year that new slides showing our modern facilities in use will be viewed by every club and chapter. The Summer Workshops were doubled in length with outstanding teachers from many sections of our country participating. We would like for more Pi Phis to attend as students so they can better appreciate the work accomplished here and become ambassadors for Arrowmont . spreading the word as we will continue to need help in obtaining additional housing and other facilities. The Southern Highland Guild held their annual meeting at Arrowmont in April 1970. Each member was deeply impressed with our new building complex. Professor Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, was made a Life Member of the Guild. Her efforts and our affiliation with the University of Tennessee have been most instrumental in the progress we are making. It has been said that if in 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School had been programmed for the future, Arrowmont would have been the answer. 22 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 23 We can be truly proud of the support that every Pi Phi has given to our philanthropy through the past 58 years and now through the years to come. ARROWCRAFT SHOP Your Arrowcraft Shop has had its face lifted! Working conditions have been improved with additional shipping areas and enlarged storage space. The sales room was also updated. All this should make for more efficient operations. This past year was a banner year as clubs and chapters continued to hold those wonderful Settlement School sales. Visitors flocked to the door of Arrowcraft since it is recognized as the outstanding craft shop in the area. Our weaving is a big drawing card and the 62 weavers who weave for us are kept busy. It is hard to realize that over 20,000 Tote Bags and 15,0'00 Daisy Chain Mats were woven and sold this past year and that this is just a part of our weavers' production. In addition, we keep 70 other craftsmen busy producing other crafts. Pi Phi truly contributes to the craft economy of the Southern Highlands. With the constantly growing interest in crafts all over the country, Arrowcraft is called upon for numerous exhibits. One was the Cooperative Craft Exhibit held by the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. in October 1969. Arrowcraft was also honored with a request to vegetable dye yarn and weave material for a sofa at Gunston Hall in Lorton, Virginia, the historic home of George Mason. The original material was faded and worn and we successfully duplicated it. These are just two of our extra curricular activities of participation in the Craft World. In closing, I want to say that the work involved at Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts and the Arrowcraft Shop is handled by a very able staff management, supervisory, clerical and maintenance. It is their devotion and dedication to their responsibilities that deserve praise from all of us.
