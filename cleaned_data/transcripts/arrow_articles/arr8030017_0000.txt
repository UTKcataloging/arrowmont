        News from Little Pigeon Edited by Sally Wild Gordon The Craft Workshop ADULT EDUCATION AND NEW HORIZONS The Craft Workshop, like the Settlement School, was a pioneering project. Pi Beta Phi is fortunate to have had University leadership guiding it since its beginning. Through joint sponsorship, the Fraternity has gained in several ways. It has been possible to offer adult education for college credit. Pi Phi has shared recognition for fostering high art and craft standards. It has also benefitted greatly from the excellent reputation the Work-shop has earned that of being one of the very best in the USA today! The Fraternity and the philanthropy have attained new status and esteem because of the excellence of the Craft Workshop. A tremendous upsurge of interest in arts and crafts has occurred since World War II. Active expressions of this interest are found in hospitals, industries, and in centers for the retired, the handicapped, youth in trouble, and those who need rehabilitation. Home craft shops have increased. More instruction and better craft facilities are being provided each year in elementary and secondary schools, in college art departments, in trade schools and in adult evening classes. Art museums have started retail shops featuring in part the work of local craftsmen. Several excellent craft exhibitions, held annually in various sections of the country, have gained national recognition. Quietly and constructively, the Craft workshop has been in the vanguard of this trend. It has served a growing need in our society for more individual creativity. A visitor at the Workshop readily notes that students are intensely interested in their work. Day and night, they may be seen busy with design, jewelry, metalwork, silk screen, stitchery, weaving, copper enameling, pottery, and various recreational crafts. Due to outstanding instructors who are sensitive to student needs and abilities, each course is a stimulating art experience for each student. The Workshop has wide appeal. Graduate students are usually in the majority; undergraduates and auditors are about equally divided. All represent many different occupations, backgrounds and ages (17-80). Both men and women attend. Many combine the workshop experience with a vacation. From 1945-1963 students have taken over 3,500 classes ; they have come from 42 different states, District of Columbia and Canada and 27 foreign (Continued in adjoining column) New Craft Workshop Schedule Announced The 1964 Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Workshop's two summer sessions, each two weeks, offer a maximum of 4 hours credit. A short post session of one week will offer one hour credit. Graduate or undergraduate credit is offered through the University of Tennessee. Courses may be non-credit. In previous years many have found it very difficult and sometimes impossible to enroll in the first session; hence, the starting date is later. Another advantage of a two week session is that the time is convenient for many people who have only two week vacations. Each session starts and ends on a weekend. Please note the dates. If you cannot attend, perhaps you can pass the word along regarding this opportunity to attend Craft Workshop in the Smokies. For further information write to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at Gatlinburg, Tenn. First Session June 22-July 3 Second Session July 6-July 18 Special Short Session July 20-July 25 students have come from 12 different countries. Each has taken back to his home community an influence from the Craft Workshop that will be shared, in various ways, with others. The Craft Workshop serves many people and many communities througE education. Jane Glass instructing two students in Jewelry Course at 1963 Craft Workshop. Attention: Craft or Art Majors Assistant Workshop scholarships are available for the Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Workshop in the Smokies. Tuition for one craft class, board and room offered to two, perhaps three lucky Pi Phis. For further information write: Mrs. Floyd Thorman, 1221 Elm Street, Winnetka, Illinois. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA COUNCIL OFFERS SCHOLARSHIP Ten years ago the Southern California Area Council of Pi Beta Phi established a scholarship fund for the purpose of offering scholarships to qualified active chapter members from the four Southern California campuses to attend the Summer Craft Workshop at Gatlinburg. This year the Area Council is announcing its decision that the Fund, known as the Area Council Craft Workshop Scholarship, is open to any member of Pi Beta Phi in good standing who presents her qualifications to the Scholarship Committee of the Area Council for its selection with preference given to members in the Southern California Area. The scholarship includes room, board tuition and partial transportation costs to attend the Summer Craft Workshop's full session in 1964. Information and application blanks may be obtained by writing to : MRS. V. BASIL KORIAGIN 1534 Raymond Avenue Glendale 1, California Applications should be filed by April 1. Arrowcraft Display Booth at "Christmas Village" The annual "Christmas Village," a Nashville, Tenn., civic undertaking, had Arrowcraft articles on display for the third straight year at its most recent show last November. Carolyn Gustaf son, who is chairman of the Nashville Alumni Club's Settlement School Committee and who was in charge of the Arrowcraft booth, reported a successful affair. Mrs. Gustafson combined a display of pictures of Arrowcraft at the U. S. Agricultural Exhibit in Cairo, Egypt, in April, 1961, and at the Smithsonian Institution Exhibit in Washington, D.C. in 1962 with pictures of the Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennnessee Craft Workshop in the Smokies. Al-most all of the Arrowcraft articles were sold and many orders were taken from some of the 4,000 Clyde Smith, 1963 Workshop student in Stitchery, studies an interesting project. who visited the "Village" which also features displays from local shops, department stores and individuals. Q. DOES THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL STILL NEED ALUMNAE SUPPORT? A. It Does . . . Dorothy Thorman, Settlement School Committee chairman, has made a breakdown of the Settlement School budget and need for continued alumnm support. The 1963-64 budget was approximately $74,000. Two-thirds of the budget depends on the support of clubs and chapters as the reader will note: 1/3 income from contributions from clubs and chapters and Magazine Agency. 1/3 income from Arrowcraft Shop and from club and chapter Arrowcraft sales. 1/3 income from Craft workshop, Endowment interest, legacies, etc. Because two-thirds of its income is from clubs and chapters, it is essential in terms of dollars and cents that the Settlement School budget be supported with increases, in order to meet rising costs. The Settlement School is a part of the very foundation upon which Pi Beta Phi exists and if this base is removed, it will result in great damage to the Fraternity in terms of prestige and welfare.
