        News from Little Pigeon Affectionate Appreciation by Marion Mueller, Settlement School Director Helen Russell, we salute you after five years of constant thought and endless hours devoted to Settlement School. Our staff at this Memorial to our Pi Beta Phi Founders knows that frequently it is a sacrifice of personal time to attend to "problems" which arise. Yes, to our past Chairman of Settlement School we likewise give much credit. With a national project such as this each chairman has her quota of achievements. Having worked with our recent past chairman in solving problems, dreaming, and accomplishing those dreams at Settlement School, I can only say "thank you, Helen, from the bottom of my heart." Speaking in terminology of alumni club and active chapter awards for excelling in Arrowcraft sales, magazine subscriptions, contributions to Settlement School, etc., Helen deserves not only a Soaring Pigeon but a Homing Pigeon one which will return again and again we hope. After a decade at Settlement School, I realize how dear this project is to many devoted Pi Phis and, Edited by Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin A mutually, they become dear to us. Best wishes, Helen, for years to come. We promise to fulfill those dreams to the best of our ability, so they will be a reality. A Hearty Welcome Mrs. Floyd M.
