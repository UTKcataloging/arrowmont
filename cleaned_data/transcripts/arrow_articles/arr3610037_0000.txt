        36 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE, JULY, 1918-JULY, 1919 The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee submits the following report to the Grand Council of Pi Beta Phi: School was opened on Monday, August 5, 1918, with eighty-nine pupils enrolled. Owing to the inability of your chairman to be present, Miss May Keller was there to provide the necessary dignity for the occasion. The teaching corps consisted of the following: Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A, whose home is in Sevierville, Tenn., as head resident; Mr. Norman R. Prickett, head of industrial department and teacher of manual training, Mrs. Stella Prickett teacher in the intermediate department and in charge of the sewing and cooking classes; Miss Emily Burton continued as head of the kindergarten. Several abnormal conditions interfered with the attendance during the fall months. First of all, the general unrest occasioned by the war was keenly felt by the older boys who were either awaiting a call to the army or were out on farms helping in an agricultural way. A number of the girls left' to do work in munition factories. Then the influenza made its appearance and while much less prevalent than in neighboring communities, continued so long that after Christmas vacation, when the weather was bad, school had to be discontinued for a period of ten days or two weeks. There were very few deaths due to influenza among our people, but when Mitchell Compton died last April, the school sustained a great loss for he was the principal maker of the oak split baskets so familiar to our friends. As we were able to maintain an average attendance of seventy per month for the year, we feel we were most successful in overcoming such unusual difficulties. To add to our troubles, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the schoolroom about the last of January and on February r, Mr. Prickett very unexpectedly tendered his resignation. We were very fortunate, however, in obtaining the services of Miss Abbie Runyon of Sevierville who taught the intermediate classes while Miss Bishop helped in the higher grades. Many of the older boys had dropped out so the manual training was discontinued for the remainder of the year. Too much praise cannot be given to the part Miss Bishop has taken in the year's work. She has proven herself so competent to meet every emergency that has arisen with such tact and common sense, that many a rough place has been smoothed out before it more than came to the surface. Then she has had such a wholesouled love and sympathy for these mountain people that she was able to go to their homes during hours of sickness and suffering, alleviating their troubles and endearing herself to them in ways not known to another in her position. During our recent visit we met on all sides extravagent accounts of deeds she had done for them when whole families had been afflicted with the "flu." The doctor told us of one case where she was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man injured in the mill, when he said her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. These facts are told 'that you may know how well fitted your head resident is for her work in this place. REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 37 When your chairman was in Gatlinburg this last May, she was most impressed with the spirit of cooperation existing between the people and the school. They spoke proudly of "our school" and all it had done and was doing for young and old. They were greatly desirous of seeing some new departures made and were eager to help. First they wanted a high school course added to the curriculum in order that the pupils who had completed the eighth grade might be enabled to continue their education at home rather than to go away to school. This we have assured them for the coming year. Another progressive step they proposed was the consolidation of the small county schools in neighboring districts with the Pi Phi School, in this way giving more mountain children the advantages of better teachers and equipment and giving us the added financial assistance from the county. At last accounts the school board had closed one of these schools and was considering others. In order to meet these additions to our number we will open dormitories for boys and girls, and have them do their own house work under the supervision of teachers. The past year the epidemic has made it very apparent that a visiting nurse would be a great comfort in caring for cases of sickness until reached by the doctors who go great distances to make their calls. During the winter months the bad conditions of the roads adding to the difficulties necessitates long delays. By uniting with the Red Cross Chapter in Sevierville we are in hopes of having a Pi Phi nurse, who has had army experience abroad, do this work for the coming year. To our corps of teachers we have added a Y. M. C. A. worker who is to have charge of social and industrial work among the men and boys. He will live with them in the boys' dormitory and supervise their study and working hours. Miss Bishop writes that it is pathetic to see from twelve to eighteen boys from the age of fifteen up, congregating on the ball grounds not knowing what to do and with no place to go. We are planning on meeting this condition in another practical way by establishing a furniture factory where boys of these ages can learn the cabinet trade in which they are particularly interested and to which they are peculiarly adapted. At the same time we will arrange for them to continue their education by giving them a night school. In this way we can have classes for the older boys who cannot read nor write but who will not enter regular school because of the embarrassment of competing with children much younger than themselves. This idea was most favorably accepted by the young men who had heard of it and we anticipate a large class this fall. This cabinet work will do away with the class in manual training which never has appealed to those practical people who have of necessity learned many of* the rudiments of the trade and have applied them to their household needs. The boys and girls who are returning from outside fields of labor and from war experiences will demand more of life than they have had offered in the little "burg" before they went away, and we hope to keep abreast of the times and to help the fathers and mothers solve these questions as they arise. In this way the community interests will grow and as the people attain a greater 38 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI unity we may be privileged to be counted as one of them if we succeed in leading them out of their difficulties into a broader life. The work of former years is beginning to show a fruition in a genuine awakening and reaching out to a bigger development. Respectfully submitted, WANETA B. RICHARDSON, Chairman.

That office was the office of the American Council of Education, the executive secretary directing the activity there was Dr. Robert L. Kelly, and the cause of all the agitation was the fact that about 130 young French women were to be sent to American colleges and universities. The general understanding with all institutions was that these young French women were to be cared for, not only as regards fees and tuition, but also as regards living expenses, extending over the summer vacation. It was a generous thought which promoted the plan, and the idea was generously received, but (as always in this life) we found that the big idea must have back of it a lot .of little ideas carefully worked out in order to make it succeed, and the French Visiting Students had no sooner landed at our various institutions than we began to be faced by a lot of little difficulties which could not be foreseen in inaugurating the plan. One great drawback to such a universal plan was that the conditions at various institutions differed so greatly. Some, such as state universities, which were under the necessity of submitting expense accounts to the close scrutiny of state officials, found it, impossible to grant legally more than the remission of tuition and fees, and, later, at least at the University of Minnesota, a scholarship of $150 each to two French women and three French men. Other institutions, FRENCH VISITING STUDENTS 43 privately owned, were able to grant immediately remission of fees and tuition and free residence in college dormitories. But in all the institutions money for incidental expenses, such as books, clothing, carfare, etc., had to be provided by private donations. Of course I know more about the situation in Minnesota than else-where. Hamline University had two French girls, as did also Macalester University, and these institutions were able to house their girls in the college dormitories. At the University of Minnesota a member of our faculty solved the difficulty of residence by inducing some of her friends to receive the French Visiting Students as guests; but the Dean of Women here and also at Hamline and Macalester felt the burden of providing spending money. Even though the French government began, later in the year, to send about $20 a month to each girl the amount was not sufficient to meet city expenses .and to buy the warm clothing needed for this severe climate. I judge that the other Deans of Women in this state lived from hand to mouth, as I did, getting a small donation here and another there, with as little publicity as possible. For example, one of our regents gave money to our two French young women to buy them warmer cloaks than they had brought with them from France, and the Faculty Women's Club supplied an emergency fund from which I drew enough to pay book-bills which I had guaranteed personally. The greatest need came when we were faced by the summer vacation and when we learned that neither Macalester nor Hamline would be able to take care of its girls at the dormitories during the summer. It was then that the War Fund of the Pi Beta Phi national fraternity proved a fine resource. The two French Visiting Students from Macalester received $50 each to help pay their expenses to summer camps, whence they send us reports of a delightful experience. The two young women from Hamline were given $50 each to help pay their expenses at the state university during the summer. One of our own girls, whose hostess had moved away from the city, received enough from the Fund to pay her board in an ordinary students' house until she could finish her year's work and go back to France. Our other girl, who is to return here next year, received $50 to help her during the summer. An itemized account of the expenditures has been sent to Miss May Keller, who now holds the residue of the fund. An opportunity should be given for other states to send in requests for assistance, for

Owing to the inability of your chairman to be present, Miss May Keller was there to provide the necessary dignity for the occasion. The teaching corps consisted of the following: Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A, whose home is in Sevierville, Tenn., as head resident; Mr. Norman R. Prickett, head of industrial department and teacher of manual training, Mrs. Stella Prickett teacher in the intermediate department and in charge of the sewing and cooking classes; Miss Emily Burton continued as head of the kindergarten. Several abnormal conditions interfered with the attendance during the fall months. First of all, the general unrest occasioned by the war was keenly felt by the older boys who were either awaiting a call to the army or were out on farms helping in an agricultural way. A number of the girls left' to do work in munition factories. Then the influenza made its appearance and while much less prevalent than in neighboring communities, continued so long that after Christmas vacation, when the weather was bad, school had to be discontinued for a period of ten days or two weeks. There were very few deaths due to influenza among our people, but when Mitchell Compton died last April, the school sustained a great loss for he was the principal maker of the oak split baskets so familiar to our friends. As we were able to maintain an average attendance of seventy per month for the year, we feel we were most successful in overcoming such unusual difficulties. To add to our troubles, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the schoolroom about the last of January and on February r, Mr. Prickett very unexpectedly tendered his resignation. We were very fortunate, however, in obtaining the services of Miss Abbie Runyon of Sevierville who taught the intermediate classes while Miss Bishop helped in the higher grades. Many of the older boys had dropped out so the manual training was discontinued for the remainder of the year. Too much praise cannot be given to the part Miss Bishop has taken in the year's work. She has proven herself so competent to meet every emergency that has arisen with such tact and common sense, that many a rough place has been smoothed out before it more than came to the surface. Then she has had such a wholesouled love and sympathy for these mountain people that she was able to go to their homes during hours of sickness and suffering, alleviating their troubles and endearing herself to them in ways not known to another in her position. During our recent visit we met on all sides extravagent accounts of deeds she had done for them when whole families had been afflicted with the "flu." The doctor told us of one case where she was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man injured in the mill, when he said her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. These facts are told 'that you may know how well fitted your head resident is for her work in this place. REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 37 When your chairman was in Gatlinburg this last May, she was most impressed with the spirit of cooperation existing between the people and the school. They spoke proudly of "our school" and all it had done and was doing for young and old. They were greatly desirous of seeing some new departures made and were eager to help. First they wanted a high school course added to the curriculum in order that the pupils who had completed the eighth grade might be enabled to continue their education at home rather than to go away to school. This we have assured them for the coming year. Another progressive step they proposed was the consolidation of the small county schools in neighboring districts with the Pi Phi School, in this way giving more mountain children the advantages of better teachers and equipment and giving us the added financial assistance from the county. At last accounts the school board had closed one of these schools and was considering others. In order to meet these additions to our number we will open dormitories for boys and girls, and have them do their own house work under the supervision of teachers. The past year the epidemic has made it very apparent that a visiting nurse would be a great comfort in caring for cases of sickness until reached by the doctors who go great distances to make their calls. During the winter months the bad conditions of the roads adding to the difficulties necessitates long delays. By uniting with the Red Cross Chapter in Sevierville we are in hopes of having a Pi Phi nurse, who has had army experience abroad, do this work for the coming year. To our corps of teachers we have added a Y. M. C. A. worker who is to have charge of social and industrial work among the men and boys. He will live with them in the boys' dormitory and supervise their study and working hours. Miss Bishop writes that it is pathetic to see from twelve to eighteen boys from the age of fifteen up, congregating on the ball grounds not knowing what to do and with no place to go. We are planning on meeting this condition in another practical way by establishing a furniture factory where boys of these ages can learn the cabinet trade in which they are particularly interested and to which they are peculiarly adapted. At the same time we will arrange for them to continue their education by giving them a night school. In this way we can have classes for the older boys who cannot read nor write but who will not enter regular school because of the embarrassment of competing with children much younger than themselves. This idea was most favorably accepted by the young men who had heard of it and we anticipate a large class this fall. This cabinet work will do away with the class in manual training which never has appealed to those practical people who have of necessity learned many of* the rudiments of the trade and have applied them to their household needs. The boys and girls who are returning from outside fields of labor and from war experiences will demand more of life than they have had offered in the little "burg" before they went away, and we hope to keep abreast of the times and to help the fathers and mothers solve these questions as they arise. In this way the community interests will grow and as the people attain a greater 38 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI unity we may be privileged to be counted as one of them if we succeed in leading them out of their difficulties into a broader life. The work of former years is beginning to show a fruition in a genuine awakening and reaching out to a bigger development. Respectfully submitted, WANETA B. RICHARDSON, Chairman.
