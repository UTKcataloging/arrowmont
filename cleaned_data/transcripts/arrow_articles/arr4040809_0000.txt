        SOS mow OF PI BETA PHI NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON ATHLETICS AT ATLIiV BURG By D. C. DENTON One of the greatest needs of the average mountain girl or boy at the present time is supervised play. The girls and boys of the mountain sections are denied many pleasures that the city boys and girls enjoy. As a general rule the mountain children have to work most of the time for the purpose o f helping support the family. The average family is large and it takes nearly all its time to keep the the wolf from the door. This being the condition in the mountains the boys and girls become stooped shouldered and out of proportion in many ways. Many are as old at eighteen as they should be at thirty. Now the best way to improve these conditions is by supervised play. The question is, how are we going to reach those who are not in school? Well, think I can show you that we have discovered the key to the situation. When I came to the Pi Beta Phi School to teach and have charge of the athletics, there had not been so very much stress put upon athletics. The boys had been playing base ball but they never had seen a game of basketball and very few of them knew there wa, a game of that name. So early in the season of 1922-23, at one of our Hi-Y meetings I took the opportunity to explain to them the game in its different phases and how it developed the body, so the boys decided they would like to play basketball. The following day we all met on the field, selected a suitable place for our court and began clearing away the rocks. Two or three of the boys went to the woods for poles to put our baskets on. Everything moved along nicely. I never have seen a bunch of boys more willing to work. I already had a new ball and the baskets so we were' in condition for playinwby the following noon recess. Here is where the fun came, trying to teach those young men a game they had never seen and did not know anything about. I will admit we got along slowly but they were willing to learn. The greatest trouble NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 809 I had with the boys was their wanting to play individual ball not being able to cooperate with the other players wanting to throw all the baskets. Selfishness is the characteristic of the boy who has never had supervised play. After we had practised two or three weeks the boys decided that they would like to play some outside school. I secured a game with one of the best teams in the county, Chilhowee, to be played on our court. My, but I wish you could have seen our boys coming out dressed in their new suits jerseys of the Pi Phi colors. Everything was excitement. A large number of the community people were there to see the first game of basketball. The result of the ganie was an overwhelming victory for the visiting team. The thing that I admired in our boys was that they played hard until the end, even though they were being defeated. We only won one game the entire season but they never for one time became discouraged. They would only say, "We shall beat that team just as soon as we get a little better teamwork." The season ended with every boy determined to be in school the next year. The boys were very eager to get into basketball this year, determined to win over the teams they had lost to the previous season. We were very much handicapped, however, by not having an indoor court. We began practicing early and played under these conditions until the new Pi Phi barn was completed. The boys helped work on the barn every chance they had so as to speed up its completion. Miss Evelyn gave us the privilege of using the loft for a gymnasium. We marked off the court which we made sixty-five feet long and thirty-nine feet wide and it was twenty-four feet to the roof so you see we had a spacious place to play. We put up new goals and oiled the floor. These things done we had one of the best courts in the county. I have never seen a bunch of boys better pleased with anything than they were with the new indoor court. The girls by this time decided they wanted to learn to play. Mr. Mattil consented to help me coach so we were able to begin regular practice periods for both boys and girls. I have never seen a team improve faster than those boys did. We played eight games slO THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI with the leading schools of the county, winning four. We won over Sevier County High School 8 to 24. We did not confine the . use of the court to the school alone but encouraged the boys oaf the community to use it when we could he there to supervise. They certainly did take advantage of the opportunity. The young men came for miles around to play and enjoyed it very niuch. They organized a team which they called' the Gatlinburg Tigers. The school often played the Tigers for practice and these games were more exciting than those played with visiting teams. I have never seen a bunch of boys improve as much physically as our boys have in the last two years and I believe I can say it was all due to playing basketball. Some of the boys smoked cigarettes at first but they found out at once they could not continue smoking and be able to endure as much as those who did not smoke so they quit. Another great advantage of basketball is that you can get the boys who are out of school interested and they will come to school, otherwise you would not be able to get them. We shall not be able to use the barn next year for a gym on account of putting feed in it so it will be impossible for us to go on with our present athletics without an indoor gym.
