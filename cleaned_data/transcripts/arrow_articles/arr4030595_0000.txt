        NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON (Caroline Lutz, Maryland A, Pi Beta Phi Fellow for 1915-16, who as a recent visitor at Gatlinburg has written the following splendid otter for THE ARROW. The Editor. Oak Crest, January, 1923. ry Dear Arrow Editor Here's the letter I promised you about "Little Pigeon." Ever nce I heard May L. Keller tell about her pioneer journey back to the mountains, I have scanned news from the School and NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 595 wanted to visit there. When a train behind schedule pulled into Knoxville one morning late in August, I begged the taxi man to dash with me over to the Sevierville train. He must have known I did not want to miss a half day at the Settlement School, for he splashed into, the mud beside the little car just as the whistle blew. Out we went across that interesting river with the university. on its bluffs. Just when I was about to register disappointment because of lack of mountains, waves of blue began to roll up on the horizon. Then the horn began to blow more often, a blast worthy of rocky curves. I liked that funny little train I wished I were a man so that I could peer under, too, and say what to do next to make her go on. I must confess I did not know my Tennessee history before I went, but when I landed in Sevierville I had been informed by a volume in that delightful Yale Chronicles of America, and Sevier was a vivid figure to me. Miss Evelyn had told me that there would be a car to meet the morning train into Sevierville there were several cars and many people.' I did not realize that "Little Pigeon" was in a region fast growing popular for summer resort spots. Nearly all cars were loaded before I called out questioningly, "Gatlinburg ?" and was packed into Amos's Ford. Yes, I was going to the School. No, I wasn't the new teacher, you see, they were short up at the School. But this reception made me feel much at home as we rode on beyond Pigeon Forge off the Pike and almost in at the door of the teacher's cottage. Miss Evelyn's welcome to the guest room was more than I had expected, and I really do not think the staff with its variety of responsibilities should be so cordial. There are two hotels there, bu't let's have a third, a Pi Phi tavern on top of Pi Phi hill, and the Pi Phis in charge can be the guides to all the corners of the Settlement School and the surrounding country. One morning you'll want to stroll up and down that long, new cement walk that leads from the road to the School buildings and talk with the children as they come in. When a little bleeding bare foot second reader tells you she only walks three miles to school, you'll want to follow her on over to the hospital and hear more about her journey while the nurse cleans and straps up the 596 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ash, the result of a fall on those stony roads as she hurried for fear she'd be tardy. You'll want to have time for a visit to every room. You'll wonder at Miss Emily's ability to manage those squirming kindergartners and three readers, all at once; you'll enjoy Miss Marion's older group working into real beginnings of history and literature; you'll admire Miss Helen's dignity which keeps everything moving in and out of class according to the fine standards of Little Pigeon. You must not let Mr. Denton know, but I did not need to visit his class ; I sat on the walk and heard his big voice roll out those mathematical explanations and heard the little voices try to do as well. And you must not tell Mr. Mattil, but I did not get a chance to visit his work in the old one room school, for always his boys were being hiked away to another task, with a voice behind calling "Hurry along there, you boys in front." Assembly brings Miss Evelyn over to play the piano and say a word to the children. Pi Phi is fortunate in having one who seems so thoroughly to understand the hearts of that community, both young and old. And at noon you must go down into the basement and see the lunch served to the little tots by the older girls, with Mrs. Roberts in charge. I'll never forget that picture of the rows and rows of little youngsters singing grace. The whole program of the day reveals so many contributions to the closed life of those houses tucked in the hills, that as I rode Dut over the country the Passion Flower, growing wild in profusion, seemed to symbolize the beauty of what Pi Phi is doing thru :his fortunate group. And those rides! I went up Roaring Fork on Miss Phyllis' Prince. Leading out from the open road in the valley is this exquisite climb, nearly all the way along the water-dashed rocks, low on a level with the spray in your face and then high above he musical roar. Every spot a picture calling for the artist's .ecord. I'd like a water color of a foot-log leading across to a [uiet cabin almost concealed by a sea of huge whorls of lavenderish ose Joe Pye weeds ; an oil of the house at the top and turn of he road where the sun peers in on a rustic porch bordered by a iot of dahlias and geraniums and two 'peaceful faced women owing up single file from the shadowy stepping stones with milk NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 597 and butter innumerable steps travelled three trips each day; a crayon of the wall of rock that confronts one, little trickles of water, huge waxy clusters of laurel leaves, a giant hemlock or two; and etchings of two bits of the community method of work a pair of huge oxen hitched to a log to prepare the road for winter travel and an old mill with its dam, race, and wheel to take care of the corn. And to think I almost missed that old mill. An unfamiliar sound in a shed at the water's edge caused me to, tie Prince to a rail fence.. In my strangeness to the country I did not know whether to open the door or not no spooks grabbed me as I peered in instead a half hour, of real exploration was store for me in investigating thel journey of the corn in the absence of any owner. Out in the dense foliage I prowled to locate the race from the dam, followed it down to the base again to enjoy the old wheel, and turned back again to see if I could chuck in those boards to stop the race. Such a fine plaything and such a contrast to the great water power of the largest corn mill in the country where I had been a short time before. You were very unwise in telling me that I could write as long a letter as I wished, for I could talk endlessly about the School and the surrounding country. My ride over to Webb Creek or Pitman Center was an experience to stretch the mind. That community church school was in a flutter over a church entertainment to be given that night, but the teachers were not too busy to show us about. The looms going after school hours made us wish the Pi Phi looms were not without a teacher. The valley there was very narrow and the school was literally bumping into mountains on . all sides. And over those mountains who had the school for the little ones? There was no school for long distances and here the Center sent out wagons to all directions for the gathering in. And who was the nurse for those distant regions ? The very same Webb Creek nurse. All the way home I was reminded of the journey of this little, young graduate nurse of Webb Creek, who had been taken seriously ill, had been visited by our Miss Higinbotham, had been brat covered-wagon style across the rocky roads to the Jennie Nichol Hospital with its efficient whiteness touched up with the 598 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI blue drapes. That spot surely is the passion flower in full bloom. If it could be possible that you ever were luke-warm in your Settlement School interest, picture the service in that corner,. the coming and going day and night, the long folding operating table that goes up the mountain when the patient is in too serious condition to move. While I was there a letter came from such a surgical patient who was visited by the nurse every day for a dressing, a letter to say that he'd never believed in the School much, but as soon as he was able to take a turn at the work, his boys would be in school. Everywhere now the spirit of the School is felt. When I went off on Prince or Spark Plug or Sam alone, Miss Evelyn told me to wear my pin. That was an introduction to the community. And so I found it, but that was nothing compared to the eagerness of greeting when accompanied by one of the staff. One evening after school Miss Helen said I might go with her up Sugarlands to deliver magazines. As we rode over the approach to the steeper trail, she told me something of her teaching up there in the one room school before the opening of Little Pigeon this year. And then of the schools around, some of them taught only by pupils who have finished the readers, as they say. We arrived too late, for school was out when we reached the great chestnuts. "If we can travel a good pace right along we might go to the Chimney Tops," said Miss Helen, and tho I did not know whether they were an ,old castle or whatnot, I had no trouble in holding my curiosity, for every minute there was a surprise. First it was two little girls in a luxurious flower garden, racing to the road the minute they saw Miss Helen to warn her that the water was high in the ford. Then it was the wildest spot of all and down to our left below a tumble ,of rocks that suggested lower regions or Indians and white men fighting from crag to crag and slipping off into black pools below. And yet around the bend the most beautiful city park-like bridle path you could imagine, needles and leaves below, laurel in high banks on both sides and here and there funnels of clear yellow fox glove. Out of this restful path again into the light and right onto a mountain home, we came; the family hurrying to milk the cows before the on NEW'S FROM LITTLE PIGEON 599 coming storm. Happy greetings were exchanged here, and once more we dipped into the shade, this time to come out upon a wall of stones bursting with ferns and across the top the purple flowering raspberry vine say the word softly with trilled r's and still you have not one bit of beauty compared with those rich large wild rose-like purplish blossoms. And on our left was the water's edge again this time with a border of blue cardinal flowers. By that time there were blues and grays and purples in all the atmosphere. The ford looked very dark, deep, and treacherous, but we had reached no Chimney Tops ; so we ventured, giving the horses every encouragement to select the way. Down and up and down they splashed and cracked against the rocks ; we had forgotten uneasiness, for up stream, across the foot log, beyond the tallest pines, we caught one glimpse of the Chimney Tops. We pulled up our horses after a short stretch of road and enjoyed the smoking of those mountain peak Chimney Tops. I had read about this pass up over the mountains in my recent history glimpse, and I wished there were no gathering clouds and that the morning might see us going up over the Indian trail to the Carolinas. Then a mountaineer came out from his cabin and warned us not to try the path farther without a guide. I praised his beautiful view of the peaks. He said he had never noticed any beauty in them. To have experienced moonlight in that setting would have been beyond any scene I could imagine. I heard it hinted moonshine of a different kind thrilled that region. Once wheeled about, we saw only streaking skies, the horses needed no urging homeward. Single file we sped along, scarcely hearing each other's calls. Too warm sweaters of the afternoon became thin, damp coverings. The last ford was crossed while there was still a ray of daylight. At the top of the bank the two little garden girls how long they must have waited ran to us with two gay bouquets. We wanted to visit, but the storm pulled us on. The school house chestnuts were now great silhouettes. Around that turn in the road we had callers again. This time it was a whole family, father, mother with a sweet baby in arms, and two little overall boys with their hands tucked into their bibs. Mother wanted to tell Miss Helen that she was ashamed she hadn't sent the New Testament' home before, but it was the only (300 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI one and they had been holding a Sunday School with it. Think of it, Pi Phis! I had asked Miss Helen before who was librarian and who took care to check in all the books in the big reception hall, and she told me they didn't try to call them in, for often a book kept was the only book in that house. So I was ready for her reply to keep the Testament and think no more of returning it. They asked us to stay all night, and if there had been a telephone to tell the School of our safety, we would have had a night in the real mountain home. From then on it was a-pushing to be out of the storm. Darkness was now solid, except for a lightning flash now and then down through the trees, welcome to horse and man in finding the road. Our sense of smell told us the land marks we were crossing the saw mill, and then the last damp, dark spot before the main road. Back in the distance a fiddler and his ballad singing broke the loneliness for a little. And then a thick blackness made it necessary to trust all to the horses. The roar of waters announced the last bridge that led to Gatlinburg city limits ; but we could see no trace of bridge. Steadily on the horses went a change in the tone of the thud, and the bridge was met and the bridge was crossed ; a few turns and the ride was over. And yet not over. I live it over and over again, and I think of that Pi Phi nurse travelling those mountain roads day time and night time, storm time and sun time, finding her way with only Prince and her saddle bags back into spots not visited before with her hand of relief in that Passion Flower country. Is it any wonder that when the School lights go on you haven't forgotten about the, School lights have you, when the School lights accidentally go on in the evening, little eager eyed boys and girls appear from all directions in order not to miss anything. It is disappointing to them to be turned away. Is it any wonder that these children when gathered together sing so well and can not sing enough? And I haven't said a word about Aunt Lizzie and her little trio of boys, about baskets, about Well, here's to "Little Pigeon !" Yours gratefully, CAROLINE S. LUTZ, Maryland A. CAMP PANHELLENIC 601 WINTER DAYS AT CAMP PANHELLENIC By GLADYS R. DIXON, Wisconsin A Somewhere within the portals of our imagination has come the desire to seek out the great quiet places to leave everything behind and blend our hurried, restless souls with that unhampered freedom which only primitive surroundings can give. Here on our snow-laden Island, surrounded by Michigan's sea of floating ice we have recaptured the thrills of pioneer days. We have swung the axe into the trunks of forest champions listened to the music of the cross saw as we lopped it into fire-wood lengths. We have cut holes in the ice for our water supply and fished later in the same hole. We have sheltered ourselves from the winter elements and have learned the real meaning of Physical Education; we need no artificial means of balancing muscular energy and neuro-experfditure. We have expanded spiritually by living close under the stars ; we have stood beneath the inverted bowl of Northern Lights and felt the touch of the Infinite; we have learned to know beauty by feasting our eyes on loveliness everywhere. The rugged coast line of our thirty mile circumference rockbound with towering ledges of pine; spruce and hemlock with intermittent patches of silvery birch. The island has been settled by Icelanders and Norwegians "who have likened the rugged shores unto those at home." They have followed the occupatior of their forefathers by reaping their wealth from the surrounding waters. They have' kept the island an almost primitive fishing settlement for there is not even a suggestion of a town. Camp Panhellenic's wooded acres are located on the north west point where Lake Michigan touches its bluffs on the east Green Bay on the north and on the west lies one of the few sande^ harbors, where fishing smacks seek shelter from the high wind$ PANHELLENIC SAILING ON SUMMER SEAS

The Editor. Oak Crest, January, 1923. ry Dear Arrow Editor Here's the letter I promised you about "Little Pigeon." Ever nce I heard May L. Keller tell about her pioneer journey back to the mountains, I have scanned news from the School and NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 595 wanted to visit there. When a train behind schedule pulled into Knoxville one morning late in August, I begged the taxi man to dash with me over to the Sevierville train. He must have known I did not want to miss a half day at the Settlement School, for he splashed into, the mud beside the little car just as the whistle blew. Out we went across that interesting river with the university. on its bluffs. Just when I was about to register disappointment because of lack of mountains, waves of blue began to roll up on the horizon. Then the horn began to blow more often, a blast worthy of rocky curves. I liked that funny little train I wished I were a man so that I could peer under, too, and say what to do next to make her go on. I must confess I did not know my Tennessee history before I went, but when I landed in Sevierville I had been informed by a volume in that delightful Yale Chronicles of America, and Sevier was a vivid figure to me. Miss Evelyn had told me that there would be a car to meet the morning train into Sevierville there were several cars and many people.' I did not realize that "Little Pigeon" was in a region fast growing popular for summer resort spots. Nearly all cars were loaded before I called out questioningly, "Gatlinburg ?" and was packed into Amos's Ford. Yes, I was going to the School. No, I wasn't the new teacher, you see, they were short up at the School. But this reception made me feel much at home as we rode on beyond Pigeon Forge off the Pike and almost in at the door of the teacher's cottage. Miss Evelyn's welcome to the guest room was more than I had expected, and I really do not think the staff with its variety of responsibilities should be so cordial. There are two hotels there, bu't let's have a third, a Pi Phi tavern on top of Pi Phi hill, and the Pi Phis in charge can be the guides to all the corners of the Settlement School and the surrounding country. One morning you'll want to stroll up and down that long, new cement walk that leads from the road to the School buildings and talk with the children as they come in. When a little bleeding bare foot second reader tells you she only walks three miles to school, you'll want to follow her on over to the hospital and hear more about her journey while the nurse cleans and straps up the 596 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ash, the result of a fall on those stony roads as she hurried for fear she'd be tardy. You'll want to have time for a visit to every room. You'll wonder at Miss Emily's ability to manage those squirming kindergartners and three readers, all at once; you'll enjoy Miss Marion's older group working into real beginnings of history and literature; you'll admire Miss Helen's dignity which keeps everything moving in and out of class according to the fine standards of Little Pigeon. You must not let Mr. Denton know, but I did not need to visit his class ; I sat on the walk and heard his big voice roll out those mathematical explanations and heard the little voices try to do as well. And you must not tell Mr. Mattil, but I did not get a chance to visit his work in the old one room school, for always his boys were being hiked away to another task, with a voice behind calling "Hurry along there, you boys in front." Assembly brings Miss Evelyn over to play the piano and say a word to the children. Pi Phi is fortunate in having one who seems so thoroughly to understand the hearts of that community, both young and old. And at noon you must go down into the basement and see the lunch served to the little tots by the older girls, with Mrs. Roberts in charge. I'll never forget that picture of the rows and rows of little youngsters singing grace. The whole program of the day reveals so many contributions to the closed life of those houses tucked in the hills, that as I rode Dut over the country the Passion Flower, growing wild in profusion, seemed to symbolize the beauty of what Pi Phi is doing thru :his fortunate group. And those rides! I went up Roaring Fork on Miss Phyllis' Prince. Leading out from the open road in the valley is this exquisite climb, nearly all the way along the water-dashed rocks, low on a level with the spray in your face and then high above he musical roar. Every spot a picture calling for the artist's .ecord. I'd like a water color of a foot-log leading across to a [uiet cabin almost concealed by a sea of huge whorls of lavenderish ose Joe Pye weeds ; an oil of the house at the top and turn of he road where the sun peers in on a rustic porch bordered by a iot of dahlias and geraniums and two 'peaceful faced women owing up single file from the shadowy stepping stones with milk NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 597 and butter innumerable steps travelled three trips each day; a crayon of the wall of rock that confronts one, little trickles of water, huge waxy clusters of laurel leaves, a giant hemlock or two; and etchings of two bits of the community method of work a pair of huge oxen hitched to a log to prepare the road for winter travel and an old mill with its dam, race, and wheel to take care of the corn. And to think I almost missed that old mill. An unfamiliar sound in a shed at the water's edge caused me to, tie Prince to a rail fence.. In my strangeness to the country I did not know whether to open the door or not no spooks grabbed me as I peered in instead a half hour, of real exploration was store for me in investigating thel journey of the corn in the absence of any owner. Out in the dense foliage I prowled to locate the race from the dam, followed it down to the base again to enjoy the old wheel, and turned back again to see if I could chuck in those boards to stop the race. Such a fine plaything and such a contrast to the great water power of the largest corn mill in the country where I had been a short time before. You were very unwise in telling me that I could write as long a letter as I wished, for I could talk endlessly about the School and the surrounding country. My ride over to Webb Creek or Pitman Center was an experience to stretch the mind. That community church school was in a flutter over a church entertainment to be given that night, but the teachers were not too busy to show us about. The looms going after school hours made us wish the Pi Phi looms were not without a teacher. The valley there was very narrow and the school was literally bumping into mountains on . all sides. And over those mountains who had the school for the little ones? There was no school for long distances and here the Center sent out wagons to all directions for the gathering in. And who was the nurse for those distant regions ? The very same Webb Creek nurse. All the way home I was reminded of the journey of this little, young graduate nurse of Webb Creek, who had been taken seriously ill, had been visited by our Miss Higinbotham, had been brat covered-wagon style across the rocky roads to the Jennie Nichol Hospital with its efficient whiteness touched up with the 598 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI blue drapes. That spot surely is the passion flower in full bloom. If it could be possible that you ever were luke-warm in your Settlement School interest, picture the service in that corner,. the coming and going day and night, the long folding operating table that goes up the mountain when the patient is in too serious condition to move. While I was there a letter came from such a surgical patient who was visited by the nurse every day for a dressing, a letter to say that he'd never believed in the School much, but as soon as he was able to take a turn at the work, his boys would be in school. Everywhere now the spirit of the School is felt. When I went off on Prince or Spark Plug or Sam alone, Miss Evelyn told me to wear my pin. That was an introduction to the community. And so I found it, but that was nothing compared to the eagerness of greeting when accompanied by one of the staff. One evening after school Miss Helen said I might go with her up Sugarlands to deliver magazines. As we rode over the approach to the steeper trail, she told me something of her teaching up there in the one room school before the opening of Little Pigeon this year. And then of the schools around, some of them taught only by pupils who have finished the readers, as they say. We arrived too late, for school was out when we reached the great chestnuts. "If we can travel a good pace right along we might go to the Chimney Tops," said Miss Helen, and tho I did not know whether they were an ,old castle or whatnot, I had no trouble in holding my curiosity, for every minute there was a surprise. First it was two little girls in a luxurious flower garden, racing to the road the minute they saw Miss Helen to warn her that the water was high in the ford. Then it was the wildest spot of all and down to our left below a tumble ,of rocks that suggested lower regions or Indians and white men fighting from crag to crag and slipping off into black pools below. And yet around the bend the most beautiful city park-like bridle path you could imagine, needles and leaves below, laurel in high banks on both sides and here and there funnels of clear yellow fox glove. Out of this restful path again into the light and right onto a mountain home, we came; the family hurrying to milk the cows before the on NEW'S FROM LITTLE PIGEON 599 coming storm. Happy greetings were exchanged here, and once more we dipped into the shade, this time to come out upon a wall of stones bursting with ferns and across the top the purple flowering raspberry vine say the word softly with trilled r's and still you have not one bit of beauty compared with those rich large wild rose-like purplish blossoms. And on our left was the water's edge again this time with a border of blue cardinal flowers. By that time there were blues and grays and purples in all the atmosphere. The ford looked very dark, deep, and treacherous, but we had reached no Chimney Tops ; so we ventured, giving the horses every encouragement to select the way. Down and up and down they splashed and cracked against the rocks ; we had forgotten uneasiness, for up stream, across the foot log, beyond the tallest pines, we caught one glimpse of the Chimney Tops. We pulled up our horses after a short stretch of road and enjoyed the smoking of those mountain peak Chimney Tops. I had read about this pass up over the mountains in my recent history glimpse, and I wished there were no gathering clouds and that the morning might see us going up over the Indian trail to the Carolinas. Then a mountaineer came out from his cabin and warned us not to try the path farther without a guide. I praised his beautiful view of the peaks. He said he had never noticed any beauty in them. To have experienced moonlight in that setting would have been beyond any scene I could imagine. I heard it hinted moonshine of a different kind thrilled that region. Once wheeled about, we saw only streaking skies, the horses needed no urging homeward. Single file we sped along, scarcely hearing each other's calls. Too warm sweaters of the afternoon became thin, damp coverings. The last ford was crossed while there was still a ray of daylight. At the top of the bank the two little garden girls how long they must have waited ran to us with two gay bouquets. We wanted to visit, but the storm pulled us on. The school house chestnuts were now great silhouettes. Around that turn in the road we had callers again. This time it was a whole family, father, mother with a sweet baby in arms, and two little overall boys with their hands tucked into their bibs. Mother wanted to tell Miss Helen that she was ashamed she hadn't sent the New Testament' home before, but it was the only (300 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI one and they had been holding a Sunday School with it. Think of it, Pi Phis! I had asked Miss Helen before who was librarian and who took care to check in all the books in the big reception hall, and she told me they didn't try to call them in, for often a book kept was the only book in that house.

They asked us to stay all night, and if there had been a telephone to tell the School of our safety, we would have had a night in the real mountain home. From then on it was a-pushing to be out of the storm. Darkness was now solid, except for a lightning flash now and then down through the trees, welcome to horse and man in finding the road. Our sense of smell told us the land marks we were crossing the saw mill, and then the last damp, dark spot before the main road. Back in the distance a fiddler and his ballad singing broke the loneliness for a little. And then a thick blackness made it necessary to trust all to the horses. The roar of waters announced the last bridge that led to Gatlinburg city limits ; but we could see no trace of bridge. Steadily on the horses went a change in the tone of the thud, and the bridge was met and the bridge was crossed ; a few turns and the ride was over. And yet not over. I live it over and over again, and I think of that Pi Phi nurse travelling those mountain roads day time and night time, storm time and sun time, finding her way with only Prince and her saddle bags back into spots not visited before with her hand of relief in that Passion Flower country.
