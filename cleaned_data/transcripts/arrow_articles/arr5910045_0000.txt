        lb\ EPO tdement School eports T OF THE CHAIII ' N OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE Member of Grand Council and of the Settlement School Committee: IT IS a very real privilege to report to you the current status of Settlement School affairs and to discuss with you our plans, hopes and dreams, fore-runners of future achievement. A survey of the past year's accomplishments brings to your Settlement School Chairman a realization of how dependent we are upon cooperation, faith, unity of purpose, and genuine sincerity. With this the hardest tasks are made easy, great problems solve themselves, and then "can't be done" is accomplished. I wish to acknowledge with grateful appreciation the generous spirit and unreserved support which has made my first year as Chairman an experience so lovely that I shall be indebted forever to II B .P. Because your fine spirit of generosity has added another year of constructive development in the lives and homes of many fine mountain people, it is a happy experience to re-view the results of the Pi Phis' united effort. As a prelude to these uncertain times, the joint meeting of Grand Council and Settlement School Committee at the School June 20-23, 1941, served to establish a fine understanding between these ten representatives of our national opinion. To talk freely, to vote frankly and honestly, to enjoy personal relationship, to exchange differences of opinion and proceed toward constructive agreement was a perfect foundation for real progress at a time when changes are obligatory. We of Committee wish to express to Grand Council our appreciation for their trust and confidence and belief in our sincerity which has been expressed continuously by their generous approval and constructive support throughout the past year. At the invitation of Committee, Miss Onken served as Grand Council contact member. Through her, the committee has maintained constant and close touch with our National Officers in the belief that only by complete understanding of conditions, of Committee decisions and policies can be served well the best interests of our vital project. Miss Onken's prompt attention to details, her conscientious cooperation, her wise counsel, based upon years of intimate experience in School and Fraternity affairs, her open-minded and generous spirit has contributed at all times immeasurably to the advancement of our program and been an inspiration to those who work with her. To each member of Grand Council we are greatly indebted for ever willing assistance and immediate personal response to our frequent requests for help, This report will summarize events and conditions from July, 1941 to July, 1942. At the conclusion of Marie Hagee's term of service June, 1941, I was appointed to serve as Chairman. From Lillian Holton and Marie Hagee, the previous chairmen under whom it was my pleasure to serve, came an example of wise administration and unselfish devotion to the service which they had pledged their best effort. The advantages of intel ligent planning and wise decisions brought to new leadership a sound business structure and forward looking policies. To keep the right direction, to hold fast to the ground gained, to advance consistently toward accomplishment, to be worthy of Pi Phi trust, to clarify new goals, all these desires have been shared by five very humble and privileged Pi Phis, your Settlement School Committee. Committee members present at the June, 1941 meeting were Irene Eldridge, Beth Brainard LeRoy, Lolita Snell Prouty, Agnes Wright Spring and Ethel Hogan Copp. The retiring chairman, Marie Bacon Hagee, was invited to be present at this meeting with Grand Council. She gave valued assistance in clarifying plans and outlining policies. We thank her again for this additional service. Irene Eldridge continued as the efficient treasurer to complete four years of faithful service July 1, 1942, with a balanced budget to prove her watchfulness. Professional duties forced her to withdraw before completing her five year term. Lolita Prouty has accepted the appointment to the treasurer's position, having served as secretary during her first year on the committee. Indicative of her sincerity and serious sense of obligation to this Fraternity responsibility, Mrs. Prouty took a course in bookkeeping and typing in order to better execute her duties. With the background of a mathematics major in college and a fine record of achievement in Club, Civic and College circles, you can understand Committee's confidence in our new financial advisor. Beth LeRoy completes her third year on the Committee by earning honorable mention in the field of public relations. She distributes the films and sends out information upon request. We wish that every Club and Chapter could be inspired by Mrs. LeRoy's sincere enthusiasm. With deep human sympathy and inspired vision, she faithfully unfolds her three fold plan for Pi Phi's service to humanity through Settlement School channels. Proud we are that Mrs. LeRoy has been invited to tell the story of Settlement School not only to Pi Phis but to various church groups Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Catholic to Woman's Clubs and over the radio! It would delight any Pi Phi to know the enthusiasm of "outside" admirers. Mrs. LeRoy's inspiration and devotion to furthering Pi Phi interests was largely responsible for the outstanding success of the sale of Arrowcraft products at the New England Flower Show last October. To sell over $2,000.00 worth of Arrowcraft is in itself noteworthy. But the Fraternity and the Settlement School Committee is indebted for all time to the large group of Boston area Pi Phis whose spontaneous response to a sudden call to hard labor deserves honorable mention along with our gratitude. To the satisfaction which all Pi Phis will feel because of this national recognition of the quality and high standards of our Settlement School service, will be added the even greater joy occasioned by the complete unselfish cooperation of Boston Pi 44 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 4 Phis in their enthusiastic effort to do justice to a wonderful opportunity. In January because of ill health it became necessary for Agnes Wright Spring, Wyoming A, to resign from the committee, having served only from summer 1941. Mildred Odell Sale accepted the appointment to take Mrs. Spring's place, assuming the duties of Editor of News from Little Pigeon. In addition she will coordinate the effort to develop our library and its services. Mrs. Spring's article in the December ARROW proved so delightful a story of Settlement School that Grand Council has arranged to have it printed in booklet form to distribute to pledges. We appreciate Mrs. Spring's fine abilities and unselfish effort. We hope that re-stored good health soon will permit her again to share her talents with the Fraternity. It is good fortune indeed that brings us Mildred Sale's editorial experience, creative writing ability, and executive talents, combined with a delightful personality and alert sound judgment. The appointment of Ann Leichliter Munn, Iowa I', to fill the vacancy created by Irene Eldridge's resignation completes the fortunate group of five who will serve together for the coming year. Ann Munn's radiant charm won for her an instant place in the hearts of Committee, Staff and community. With her special training in Arts and Crafts, she brings understanding assistance to the current emphasis toward growth and expansion in this field. I have appreciated the perfect cooperation from Committee and the Director in the matter of communications, a most important part of our duties. By use of carbon copies, a duplicate of each letter is sent to each member of Committee, to the con-tact member from Grand Council and to the Grand Vice-President. This enables us to execute promptly the administration of School affairs. Always there are monthly reports, weekly letters, and frequently daily contact by letter or telegraph. In addition to normal committee correspondence, I have sent car-bon copies of all important outside correspondence to each member in order that each have the ad-vantage of first impressions. Following the 1941 summer decision of Committee to take advantage of the best possible professional opinions to clarify our plans and guide our course, a survey was made by Dr. William S. Taylor, Dean of Education of the University of Kentucky, and his associate, Professor Seay. Their evaluation of our project was given to you in the December ARROW. Subsequent detailed helpful suggestions and working plans have been submitted by Dr. Taylor, as we move toward a wider field of service. In addition to his own offer of continued service, Dr. Taylor is alert and generous in bringing to us national recognition and help in many fields of specialized service. As an example we feel now that our long needed advancement in library service is assured. May K. Duncan, Librarian at University of Kentucky, has already completed book lists for our Elementary and High Schools. Soon we hope to report the reality of an extended package library service. Several Clubs and individuals have shown enthusiastic approval of our effort to improve our library by sending selected books or money. Chicago Alumnae Club South's recent gift of fifty new books from Miss Duncan's list was substantial proof to Committee that generous Pi Phis are eager to cooperate when we make the needs known. To get a clear vision of Settlement School, w think of our one hundred acres and our thirteei buildings in the beautiful valley, so deep in th, heart of the Smokies. We think of our service ii education through our High School and our Ele mentary School. Through the conscientious effol of eight teachers in each school, half Pi Phis, hal County, our program has been most satisfactor this year. Ben Fleming has completed his secon, year as Superintendent, having advanced from firs grade through our school out to college an, back to teach. His sincerity, loyalty, and lug] ideals have combined to bring about the fine spirit of teaching cooperation that has ever bee, enjoyed at the School. Much appreciation is du his wife, Josephine Fleming, who unselfishly an, generously gives of her time and varied abilitie whenever a need presents itself. Mr. Fleming' program is made doubly full by his teaching c mathematics. Mr. Pern Price as Principal has continued to and velop the Elementary School, insure its grade . rating and increase our field of service. Mr. Prh is energetic, a fine and progressive teacher, an alert to community need. Participation in the al nual National School Week Program in the Fa brought convincing evidence of the advanced an broad trends of our educational program. Gre enthusiasm and interest was shown by both paren and pupils alike, as huge crowds gathered o "Open House Night" to inspect the School an view the results of the year's activities. Mention of the teaching staff cannot be mac without bringing to mind a picture of happy grow living which impressed your Chairman during hl first winter visit to the School. In conformani with Fraternity requirement, I went to the Scho, for a two weeks' visit in late October. This vis gives opportunity to observe and study the proje in its season of full activity. At this time the Chai man assists the Director and Staff in every possib way to carry out the plans of the administratic and the wishes of the Fraternity. It is her priN lege, as well, to further community understandir of the policies and plans and assist in maintainir a balanced and happy relationship of responsibilit An after dinner glimpse into Teacher's Cotta. living room brought surprised delight on an C tober evening.

It is an opportuni Sharing in a joyous group living which offers n opportunity for experiencing soul satisfying serv. develops womanly qualities which are highly  sirable. This is just another yardstick by which to me ure the dividends which return to Pi Phis becai of service rendered. We are not enjoying f benefits if we fail to acquaint young Pi Phi teach, with the enriching experience that may be theirs. The curriculum is being strengthened constan and changed to meet community need and progr 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW sive educational demands. Several years in advance of the State decision to make Physical Education and a Health Education course compulsory in Tennessee Schools after 1942, Pi Phi School has offered this training. Our satisfaction this year in securing a part time music teacher through W.P.A. funds was short lived. However, we will strive to make music possible in some other way since a soul satisfying educational program is incomplete without music. We will never be satisfied until we are able to fill this great lack. However, it is nice to be able to tell you that Community Sings will be held in our Auditorium or on our grounds during the coming year. Most noteworthy this year is the development of and interest in the Craft courses under John Moore. If you will read back through the reports of several Chairmen you will be reminded that the need for encouragement and education in the field of Crafts was long ago considered of real importance. The progress this year has been very satisfying. Committee is delighted to report to the Fraternity at large that a qualified group has accepted the responsibility of advising and directing the Craft program. You will remember Miss Jessie Harris, convention initiate at Ashville in 1938. Miss Harris was chosen for this Pi Phi distinction because, as Director of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee, she had won national recognition in her field and because she had rendered invaluable service to our Settlement School project over a period of years. It is now your good fortune to have the advice of Miss Harris, as well as that of her Pi Phi friend and associate, Miss Ida Anders, Iowa r, and Miss Hurd, University of Tennessee's Craft Director. These three constitute our new Craft Advisory Committee. Not only in the field of Craft, but in every field of advancement will the continuity of their vision and direction be felt. They have professional experience, national viewpoint, broad understanding of our mountain people to combine with loyalty and belief in our project. Long felt has been the need for a connecting link to prevent delay, to keep visions clear, to keep straight the path toward a greater service. With changing committee members, staff and directors, much inspirational leadership has been lost. We do welcome sincerely their generous response to our invitation to serve officially and anticipate constructive progress. Arrowcraft again brings us great distinction and clears a net profit of over $11,000.00. The amazing national merchandising achievement of Pi Phi Alumna Clubs in disposing of Arrowcraft products is primarily responsible for Arrowcraft be-coming a profitable business. Not to be overlooked, however, is the sound business ability of our Arrowcraft Director, Ethel Snow, Iowa r. Her strict attention to the safeguarding of Pi Phi interests, her excellent judgment in the merchandising, her untiring patience and promptness in dealing with our willing, but ofttimes inexperienced Alumna Chairmen, have combined fortunately to increase our Arrowcraft business. Only a small bit of concentrated effort regularly on the part of each Pi Phi is all that it will take to keep Arrow-craft a paying department and give sole means of support to many mountain families. This again reminds us of that' vast untouched field for craft endeavor which can result in a national center so worthy and so great as to be the source of untold pride and satisfaction to new generations of Pi Phis. But that is in itself a long and fascinating story a dream that can come true if Pi Phis want it. Through the combined efforts of Staff, professional advisors, and Committee, the coming year should produce many new designs and new objects to augment our lovely Arrowcraft display. We are mindful of the new and greater opportunities which curtailment of foreign trade has created. We are alert to every possibility of strengthening the economic stability of our areas. We approach this through two mediums. One is through art and craft' courses in our Schools to prepare our future workers in basic appreciation of color, form, and design. The other means is through our adult education classes and direction of hand work among mountain people which is necessary to maintain themselves. Winogene Redding continues her fine work as supervisor of our adult weaving program. Two out-standing community achievements are the results of her vision and enthusiastic effort. The Gatlin-burg Garden Club has made noteworthy improvements in the community with the planting of Dog-wood trees along the highway and two parked areas near the center of business. There has been general impetus given to home and civic beautification. Under her direction our Weaver's Guild has taken its place among America's Summer Players. Their original play "Store Britches" continues this summer as a successful contribution to the enjoyment of visitors. Next to education, we think of Pi Phi's Health Service. Continuing under the sincere direction of Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, R.N., certain needed re-organization of this important field of community service has progressed successfully. To withdraw certain services, long accepted by community, even to devote more time and energy to the field of preventive and health education, is a delicate transition. Obviously the steady growth of our community with a resident physician now available has changed the aspect of our health service. By limiting our service to needly first aid and emergency, more time can be given to health education instruction. In addition, the war emergency need for Red Cross training courses has been met adequately and with distinction by our Health Service. Difficult as it is to believe, the past year's experience shows again that the service of a regular County nurse is not available regularly in this extended area. Elizabeth Comstock Peck, California B, is be-ginning her second year as Director with the warm regard of Staff, Community, and Committee to prove how genuine and kindly is her consideration for others and how quickly she has caught the spirit of Pi Phi service to a great cause. She has been tireless in her efforts to produce congenial efficiency. The only general Staff change was made when Annette Morse, Illinois A, resigned after four years' faithful service as house manager because of her own family need. Miss Lena Hodgins of Champaign, Illinois, is deserving of the compliments that her delicious food and smooth running household bring to her. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 47 Bequests made possible two very fine accomplishments during the past year. A new Stuart dormitory for boys was built with the net sum of $9,250.00 which was left for this purpose by Anne Elizabeth Stuart, Nebraska B. With colonial influence, expressed in simple lines, and permanency assured by use of native stone, heavy hand split shingles, and slate, already there is evidenced a fulfillment of her dream. The boys are proving their pride in an adequate charming home by assuming all responsibility for its perfect upkeep. Proud the donor would be if she could glimpse the satisfaction and inspiration that her generous gift has given to those fine young people whom she so joyously served. Although there is no concrete evidence as yet in stone or wood, the sum of $1,000.00 was given to Settlement School by District of Columbia A to start a fund for Health Center improvement. To the memory of this generous unknown Pi Phi donor who chose to share her joy in giving with her chapter, we pledge ourselves to continued effort to justify her faith. We believe that soon this sum will attract enough to it to make her dream and ours come true. With so many, many Pi Phis desirous of replacing the obsolete little old building which for so long has been inadequate to our Health Service demands, we are confidently making plans and studying the advice and suggestions of experts, that we may be ready when Pi Phi generosity makes suitable housing and equipment possible. Have you ever thought ho'*w satisfactory a choice our leaders made when they gave us a philanthropy with such varied channels? Almost any individual personal preference may be satisfied. With quite natural differences of opinions as to the most worthy field, Pi Phi Fraternity has proven that unified effort can coordinate a variety of needed services into one tremendous influence for good. We shall continue our effort to acquaint our members with each step as we unfold an expanded program of usefulness. It has been a pleasure to answer the many questions asked by devoted Pi Phis. We shall continue to welcome constructive suggestions. Our Committee is trying hard to keep pace with national trends, community changes and worthy fields for :the generous expression of Pi Phi's philanthropy. We believe that no school and no welfare organization could be in a more fortunate situation to begin this uncertain period of national emergency. We are proud to report that we have no Settlement School debts and there are no involvements. Our determination is to keep our affairs in good order, do our best to maintain the standards which we have pridefully built up, fulfill the obligations to which we are pledged and upon which is dependent the greater proportion of all necessary income and to continuance of the present program committments. This we believe we can do provided the normal contributions from earned money and gifts continue. To explain this I will quote a frequently asked question "To what extent does the Settlement Schol depend upon Pi Phi contributions ?" The answer is: To exist, Settlement School is absolutely dependent upon the continuance and the receipt of the present, and recent past, average of active and alumnx contributions. Reason: The approximate running and maintenance budget in round numbers is $30,000, exclusive of Arrowcraft. Originally there was one general source for Settlement School support, namely gifts and contributions earned by Pi Phis. Gradually by development of wise business procedure two other sources were added, namely income from sources within the Fraternity, for example, the interest on the endowment and the commissions from the magazine agency, and income from practical application of business principles to the school administration as our program became more and more involved, such as sale of farm products, staff living, small fees for certain health service, and agriculture and craft courses. The third source came from the gradually shifting to State, County, and Community of such financial responsibility as their growing ability could assume, for the educational system particularly. Here I will mention an interesting fact that few Pi Phis understand. The larger proportion of increase in expenditure, as we have increased the facilities and service of our School, has come from this gradual increase in governmental appropriation. So carefully and fairly has this balance of responsibility been worked out that there has never been a question of the integrity of local government in assuming its rightful share. Nor has the State or County ever questioned Pi Phi's integrity as the growing demands forced us to request increased appropriation for teachers. With these three sources in mind, it is simple to understand that the basic income from actives and alumnae, although approximately only one-third of the total running budget, is the nucleus which at-tracts the other two-thirds. This is the foundation. If we remove or lessen our recent average contributions, we jeopardize the receipt of the other two-thirds of necessary income. By maintaining our normal average of the first third, it is quite normal to anticipate increased income from these other sources. My own personal belief is that we can carry on for the emergency at this safe level for actual Pi Phi contributions, provided they can be upheld. I believe that future bequests and Pi Phi gifts for special equipment will provide generously for new buildings as the need is evidenced through our wise determination of actual justified need_ As you know the budget for the year is deter-mined at the summer Committee meeting. Since the first third is not fixed, it becomes necessary for the Committee to take the sum of the average expectancy from study of the past several years contributions from actives and alumnae. You can well imagine our worry if alumnae clubs' contributions drop below the normal expectancy. Another frequent question is "Are Pi Phi contributions used solely for the Arrowcraft Shop ?" The answer is, No! Arrowcraft at present is self-supporting and pays it share of general running expenses of the School. (School in this sense means proiect, not educational department.) While we cannot safely predict anything in these uncertain times, it is reasonable to suppose that Arrowcraft can be counted upon to maintain itself if 48 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 1. Pi Phi alum= continue their effort to sell Arrowcraft products. 2. If the traveling public still buy in our two local shops. (This we know will suffer because of curtailment of tires.) 3. If Wage and Hour regulations upon hand looming in the home do not create a cost increase impossible to accommodate. Arrowcraft was "in the red" for many years as Pi Phi strove to rehabilitate the mountain people and this was considered a profitable procedure, our worthy contribution to human betterment. A third question often asked is "What help do we receive from Government agencies ?" The educational system receives financial help as follows: County 1. Elementary Teachers' salaries are paid to them directly by the County. This sum does not appear on our budget, either in income or disbursement. 2. Rent for Elementary School building of $1,000.00 per year. (Additional cost of maintenance and repairs is paid by Pi Phi.) 3 Some School supplies and books State and Smith-Hughes Fund 1. Three-fourths of High School Teachers' salaries. Smith-Hughes provides part salary for certain vocational courses such as agriculture and home economics. The State allows $500.00 annually for adult weaving instruction. The Health Center receives from the State Health Department serums for certain required vaccinations and injections. Regarding other governmental agencies: 1. We were able to get a part time music teacher this current year through the Works Progress Administration. This was canceled in January when all such service was discontinued by government order. 2. Several adult trade instruction classes were established under the Defense Training authority. No so called "W.P.A." funds were or are rated by the community for services such as are offered at the School other than the aforementioned music assistance (now non-existent). Often the question is asked "Why do we not rate financial assistance from certain well known Foundations ?" The answer is "We are rated as a Foundation by other Foundations. As such, we do not quality for their assistance. However, the Committee is hopeful of getting certain "gift" assistance to fulfill specified needs such as a library of fine records, scores, and machine for music appreciation community pro-gram." We are making an exhaustive study to determine just what .classification will attract other such supplementary assistance. We have the attention and sincere interest of three officials of the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. We welcome further Pi Phi help to coordinate our requests. As to further Health Center assistance we are informed by two sources of factual information, State and County, and by a national expert in governmental budgeting, that there is no possible fund available to underwrite the educational health service through which Pi Phi has raised the whole health status of a large area. There is still only one County nurse in our entire County and even this has been irregular. I invite your study and understanding of the following outline of Pi Phi sources of income which have gradually suggested themselves as sound permanent methods to serve to stabilize our project, give security, and insure in a measure our ability to meet our assumed responsibility. 1. Income from Pi Beta Phi. General Active Chapters Alumnie Clubs Individual gifts Bequests Commissions from Magazine Agency Interest on Endowment Fund Interest on Savings Account Contributions specified for furnishings or improvements Miscellaneous (Principally insurance proceeds) School Income Small fees from Agriculture Home Economics and certain Health Services Farm Products sold to outside Farm Products sold to our kitchen Staff living fees. As you study this brief analysis there is one im portant fact to take into consideration, the running administrative budget for maintenance and upkeep is comparable with that of any home for utilities, service, repairs, replacements, etc., and is separate from the teachers' salaries and supplies of the educational program. You will see that we are providing the background while State and County are largely supplying the educational program. It is an accepted fact that Schools, Libraries, and Health Services are never self-supporting. They are either endowed or supported by public or private funds. Our project will always be to large extent a welfare project, in which we supplement the basic program, as offered by a willing community, with the advantages of a sponsored program in health, education and vocational guidance. This same need for public spirited service is evidenced in every large city as well as every small community and it is expressed by privately or publicly endowed hospitals, baby clinics, schools, libraries, health centers of every description. Every public spirited Pi Phi could designate a definite need in her community, a vital one. But long ago Pi Phi became the self-elected sponsors of a definite community. From us these really worthy Anglo-Saxon people have received every inspiration for upbuilding of body and soul. To us this community will always look for guidance, inspiration and all cultural development. As they willingly and pridefully accept certain responsibilities, we are able in turn to expand our influence into an ever growing circle. As fast as Pi Phi donors wish we will grow into a center of great national educational consequence. Our facilities, our background, our past integrity, makes possible our ability to meet whatever great need the future brings to our firmly established center in the Smokies. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 To speak of a possible present emergency opportunity we of committee are seriously mindful that added burdens may rightfully come to us. Just what, how, or when, we cannot predict now. But from patriotic and loyal Pi Phis everywhere we welcome suggestions if you see a practical opportunity to increase our service. Several ideas have already been discussed whereby we might serve the cause of youth in war time. In anticipating some additional war effort we have established contact with the several agencies in Washington under whom we may be called upon to serve. Through the War Production Board's several textile departments and its Small Business Bureau we are endeavoring to find what needed articles or fabrics can be made under our supervision. Through this means we hope to stabilize the economic status of our community and use to the fullest every bit of man and woman power. We have contacted the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor through Dr. Martha Elliott and her associate, Miss Ruth Taylor, to get first hand information regarding the government's plans for service to evacuated children or families. Through Dr. Howard McCluskey, whose responsibility in the Office of Civilian Defense is the coordinating of war efforts of organization we are promised assistance that we may find our proper field. We are studying the possibilities of additional use for our facilities in the field of occupational therapy if by chance any or all of the Gatlinburg hotels should be needed for hospitalization. At the suggestion of the National Office of Civilian Defense we are contacting the regional and State offices of Civilian Defense as a means of keeping aware of needs. It is our hope and expectation that we will be ready for any war emergency service that may come to Gatlinburg to command the unified patriotic effort of thirty-three thousand Pi Phis. Respectively submitted, Settlement School Committee. ETHEL COPP, Chairman, EPO T OF THE *I\ ECTO OF THE PI ETA PHIl SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 194142 To Grand Council of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Settlement School Committee, and the Fraternity: F oR every Pi Phi who holds a cherished place in her heart for the Settlement School, there is every reason to be proud of the year just past. Highlights that stand out are the establishing and development of the Arts and Crafts program in the school; the reorganization of the Health Center to meet changing community needs; the fall visit of Dean Taylor of the University of Kentucky with his valuable survey; the completion of the new Stuart Dormitory for boys; and just this last May the annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee here at the School, which is like having five fine friends and counselors arrive at one time to help solve problems and guide policies for the best interests of Pi Phi and our School. There's a Rip Van Winkle quiet over the school grounds now that makes it hard to picture the tremendous activity of the School year. According to Mr. Fleming's report, we had the largest high school enrollment in the history of the school. Besides the regular classes in English, History, Sociology, Science, Vocational Agriculture and Vocational Home Economics, a new unit of World History was added for the tenth grade, and Spanish for the eleventh grade, Arts and Crafts for Junior and Senior students, as well as classes in first aid and home nursing. Everyone in High School has been active in the physical education program. The Bov's Basketball team was in the District Semi-finals. This year the girls had an intramural basket-ball program as well as a few inter-school games. The Agriculture and Home Economics clubs, the Press Club, and the various other school organizations had a very successful year. The Press Club sponsored the "Pi Phi Paperette" which was a page of school news incorporated in the local Gatlinburg paper. Several Community and school socials have been held in the gymnasium, and the juniors and Seniors each gave a School play. The Seniors raised funds for their trip just before Class Week. They visited Lookout Mountain, Nashville, Mammoth Cave, and Lincoln Memorial University. In the Home Economics department nutrition was stressed and low cost healthful meals were given special attention. Weaving was especially popular with the girls this year and each girl in the junior class wove a knitting bag with an all-over design, and several have woven dresser scarves with small figure inlays such as flowers or initials. The Sophomore class was larger. Two girls worked at each loom, learning each step from the making of the warp, to the threading of the loom and finally the actual weaving. In the sewing project each girl made two garments of her own choice. Two of the girls participated in the Style Show at the University of Tennessee's Open House. Each year of Home Economics is a combination course which includes foods, clothing, personal grooming, home management, child care and other topics. The boys and girls in the third year classes met together for six weeks to study "Problems in Family Living and Home Management" and lively round table discussions were held. A total of forty-eight boys were enrolled in Vocational Agriculture. The course of study for each of these boys is based on farming on the Home Farm, with emphasis being placed on food production for home first and for national defense. National Defense classes were also held and con-ducted for out-of-school youth in the various rural communities. The boys learned blacksmithing and farm machinery repair, wood-working, simple electricity, and auto mechanics. Two evening classes of farmers met and studied problems pertaining to farming and food production, under our agriculture teacher. The new courses now being taught in the Arts and Crafts department include jewelry, Metal Craft, Ceramics, Block Printing, and the Native crafts. The courses are elective for juniors and Seniors and have been very popular. In jewelry, the students studied the fundamental techniques of constructing and decorating rings set with semi-precious stones, sterling silver pins and clips, a 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW combination of copper and brass bracelets and other chains. In Metal work, they constructed plates, ash trays, bowls, lamps and candle-sticks. Laboratory problems in ceramics include the techniques of hand building of animals and figures, wheel throwing, pressing from moulds, slip-casting, glazing and firing of the kiln. The methods of textile deco-ration were also studied, including block-printing, stenciling and tie-dyeing. Several very talented students were discovered in the classes. There were also well-attended adult classes in the evenings. For its first year, genuine progress and great enthusiasm were felt in this part of the school pro-gram. The Elementary School completed an equally successful year under Pern Price, principal. One of the outstanding affairs of the year was the children's operetta, which was the very best the school has ever had. The children were beautifully trained, the costumes were clever, and the entire performance a credit to the teachers and Mr. Price who worked with the children so patiently. The story was "Peter Rabbit" so that it is not hard to visualize the cunning songs and costumes. The Movie Projector, purchased from gift funds, has been a most valuable addition to the entire school program. Educational, as well as films for entertainment have been shown regularly and the coming year promises to see it used even more frequently as we .work in conjunction with the government showing of films for defense. The report of the Health Center has special interest as it reflected the changing, yet continued very important program. Health study, First Aid Classes, Nutrition, Home Nursing, all are stressed. Mrs. Chalmers is combining a full teaching schedule with her nursing duties. In the High School all who could arrange their time to take the shortened First Aid course, did so. Adult classes in Home Nursing at the Health Center completed their studies and qualified for their certificates. With the emphasis on health instruction, preventive service in the community was not allowed to suffer, and the totals for the year were about the same as the preceding one. There was a considerable drop in the number of calls, and community service was confined to demonstrations of nursing procedures, practical instruction and strictly emergency measures. Inspections and inoculations in the School, and corrective work was done as usual. The Health Center received gifts from the local chapter of the Red Cross, and from many of the alumni clubs, all of which were very much needed and deeply appreciated. Many of these things are for the "Loan Closet" and are in frequent use, being gratefully borrowed and carefully returned. Being a year of "transition" the Health Center passed through an eventful year in which those services which we have outgrown have been eliminated, and through greater concentration on health instruction the valuable service of the Health Center will continue to assist the community toward better and safer living. From the Arrowcraft Shop comes the report that during the past year, one hundred and thirty-two alumme clubs, nine active chapters, twenty-three shops and individuals too numerous to mention have sold Arrowcraft merchandise. One of the most successful sales of the year was handled by the Boston Club at the New England Flower Show which this year had as one of its themes "The Wildflowers of the Smokies." The sales at the Arrowcraft Booth were over $2,000. One of the most important pieces of publicity of the year, was the June number of House and Garden which featured the handicrafts of the whole Southern Appalachian region. Our own "Aunt Lizzie's" photograph, as well as many others were taken here in Gatlinburg under Mrs. Snow's guidance. Arrowcraft has received many, many inquiries as a result of this publicity. The Fall Guild meeting was held in Berea, Kentucky, with five members of the school staff at-tending. The spring meeting was 'held in Knoxville, where the invitation was extended to the Guild to hold their 1942 meeting in Gatlinburg and we hope to make it outstanding. The meeting of the stock-holders of Southern Highlanders, Inc., of which Arrowcraft is a member, was held in Knoxville following the Guild meeting. It is interesting to note that Miss Jessie Harris, Director of Home Economics of the University of Tennessee, and our Asheville initiate, was elected a Director for the coming year. The weavers for the Shop had more work than ever before last year. There was a total of ninety-eight weavers on the books and there were eighty-seven working at one time just before Christmas. The Weaving meetings have been well attended. With the cost of living increasing for them as well as everyone else, there are many families where the weaving is needed more than ever. The reports of Arrowcraft, Health Center, and Sch6ol show a unity of effort in carrying out the ideals of the fraternity in constructive aid and service in this community. If war emergency needs make demands upon us, it will be the desire of the entire staff to meet these demands, and to continue to give their very best efforts to the School, which is just as dear to everyone in Gatlinburg as it is to every Pi Phi! Respectfully submitted, ELIZABETH COMSTOCK PECK, Director, Pi Beta Phi School. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORT ON AUDIT OF Ti'EASUI.E 'S ACCOUNTS YEA ENDED JUNE 30, 1942, 51 August 3, 1942 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Bice of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1942. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the subsidiary records kept for the School and the Arrowcraft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1942, and the income and expenses for the fiscal year then ended, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from Club and Chapter contributions, which are shown in detail in Schedule 3-a, and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the Treasurer. The cash balance at Milwaukee was verified by us. The endowment securities and cash, except cash in transit, which we verified, were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's report was accepted without further verification except that we checked the accounting made of changes in investments and the income from securities and found in it good order. COMMENTS Cash Balances The cash balances at June 30, 1942, exclusive of cash with the endowment Trustees or in transit, consisted of the following: Milwaukee Account: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's checking account $ 7,922.97 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank School check ing account 793:45 Sevier County Bank Dormitory building account 79.06 Sevier County Bank Arts and Crafts acount 223.39 Gatlinburg Arrowcraft Accounts: Sevier County Bank Checking ac count 6,814.50 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 2,986.64 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 4,218.46 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 4,780.04 Petty cash funds at Gatlinburg 45.00 Total $27,863.51 As indicated above, we verified the balances in Milwaukee accounts while those at Sevierville or Knoxville were verified by Homer K. Jones and Company according to their report. The above balances do not include magazine agency receipts in the custody of Mrs. C. M. Purdunn who reported a balance due the Settlement School on May 15, 1942 of $3,216.27. In accordance with previous practice the magazine agency receipts taken into account by the Settlement School Treasurer for the fiscal year consisted only of the remittances from Mrs. Purdunn which totaled $3,000.00. Accounts Receivable The Arrowcraft accounts receivable at June 30, 1942 amounted to $6,710.25 and were due principally from alumni clubs. These accounts, which we did not verify, were listed in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company and were $162.02 greater than those at the close of the previous year. Fixed Assets Expenditures for additions to buildings, equipment and landscaping amounted to $12,480.37 for the year under ieview. Included in this total is $9,122.94 for the new Stuart Dormitory and $1,703.12 for new equipment for this dormitory, a total of $10,826.06. As indicated above, the expenditures for the new dormitory were evidently not included in the Gatlinburg audit. All additions to the property accounts are shown in Schedule 2. It may be noted that the old Stuart Cottage which was razed was removed from the books and its estimated book value of $450.00 ($2,011.02 less depreciation of $1,561.02) less salvage receipts of $25.00, was charged off to expense. Depreciation of the buildings and equipment, computed at rates used in the past, totaled $3,259.04 as shown in the same schedule. Lists sent to us indicated that most of the equipment at Gatlinburg had been inventoried at June 30, 1942 and it seemed advisable to enter the inventory values on the records in lieu of the depreciated book values. However, examination of these inventories revealed that at least the machinery and equipment in the vocational school building (industrial building) had not been listed or valued so no change was made on the records. In your particular case we believe that it would be preferable to have the present inventory values of equipment on the books rather than those now shown, if the inventories can be completed. Endowment The only changes in the endowment principal for the year under review consisted of the appropriation of three-fourths of the chapter contributions, or $1,307.75, offset to a slight extent by losses on securities of $62.03, the fund showing a net increase of $1,245.72. No amortization of bond premiums is charged against income by the Trustee although the securities on hand cost $1,710.05 more than par value. However, the market value of the securities at June 30, 1942 was $132.51 more than cost as shown in the list in Schedule 1 according to the Trustee's report. 52 .THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Current Income and Expenses The expenses of the Settlement School exceeded operating income by $6,977.50 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $12,578.43. The Settlement School expenses included depreciation of $3,259.04, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores but which is not charged to this department. The Arrowcraft net income was $1,524.65 less than that of the previous year although the sales of $54,651.28 were approximately the same as those for 1940-1941. The sales at the Mountain View Hotel which are ordinarily quite profitable fell off somewhat with a decrease in gross profit of $656.18. An accounting of the net income is presented as follows: Net income of Arrowcraft division . . . . $12,578.43 Deficit in operation of Settlement School 6,977.50 Net income $ 5,600.93 Accounted for as follows: Increase in Arrowcraft inventories $ 4,004.41 Increase in ArroWcraft receivables Increase in farm live-stock Expenditures for build ing and equipment $12,480.37 Less depreciation for year 3,259.04 $ 9,221.33 Less Stuart Cottage charged off 450.00 8,771,33 Increase in prepaid in surance 505.51 $13,594.27 Less decrease in cash balances and cash items on hand 9,301.09 $ 4,293,18 Transfer of funds to endowment principal 1,307.75 Total as above $ 5,600.93 It may be observed that the Arrowcraft inventories have been increasing each year and that a substantial portion of the net income is invested in the finished goods and materials on hand. This is probably a normal situation but in any case the insurance coverage on these inventories should be carefully watched. Respectfully submitted, REILLY, PENNER AN!)

We break our rule of "reports only" in the September ARROW to print the following pages, which should be of assistance in planning help for the Settlement School for the coming year. EFENSE AT GATLIN 16 ,e) U G THIS is war! Every American is giving wholeheartedly of his or her time, money, and effort to promote worthwhile projects in vital war production, or in equally important measures to maintain and protect those vital "defense projects" that aim to hold fast for the future the fundamental rights and privileges of American citizenship. Such a defense project is our II B Settlement School at Gatlinburg. If we are to hold the ground so painstakingly won by loyal Pi Beta Phis in the past; if we are to protect our investment in the Smokies; if we are to preserve a source of revenue for people who have no other means of livelihood; if we are to retain the faith and friendship of the mountain people who have come to respect and admire II B (I) not because they know our inner joy of member-ship but because they have seen the benefits of our altruism we, members of II B , must make this coming year of 1942-1943 as glorious a record in contributions to the Settlement School as any in our history. To do this may be harder than in the past, but the satisfaction of our accomplishment will also be greater! It is the first task of the Settlement School Committee to plan wisely so that expenses may be held within the expected income; and our second task is to help you carry on your regular projects for the benefit of the Settlement School that this in-come may be great enough to cover the necessary expenses of such an enterprise. Settlement School income from Pi Beta Phis comes largely from three sources: sale of Arrow craft, contributions from active chapters and alumna clubs, and magazine commissions. You, in your individual clubs, can best decide what means to use for the raising of your customary contributions. In this issue you will End suggestions for your magazine sales set-up from the club which has ranked first for the past six successive years in amount of commissions earned. And the new articles added this year to our fine traditional Arrow-craft will insure your Settlement School sale being a success once more. Do you or your friends have sweethearts or husbands in the Service? Of course, you do. Then did you know you could secure black and olive drab neckties of our lovely Arrowcraft quality to go with their regulation uniforms? Or is He in the Air Corps? Then he will appreciate one of the wool scarfs for men, or perhaps the extra long "ski scarf" which is a yard and a third long and can be wrapped around several times to amply protect his throat and chest when he flies in high altitudes. The Royal Standard Chapter, Daughters of the British Empire ordered six dozen of our Frozen Mist scarfs for sale to departing aviators and aviation cadets. All aviators wear some sort of scarf why not be sure that every "Pi Phi Aviator" has an Arrowcraft scarf ? Those showers for II B I, brides make a perfect occasion for Arrowcraft towels; and think of the joy you would bring if each member of the chapter would give a place mat or napkin of Arrowcraft design to complete a luncheon set. =IONS TO AR OWCRAFT s\, THE new items? Here is the latest information from Ethel Snow, our capable Manager of Arrowcraft. First there will be three new scarfs, sparkling in color and developing the theme of last year's favorite Buckeye scarf. The "Buckeye," you re-member, was that lovely brown, brick red and white with just a touch of green in a broken plaid, designed by Winogene Redding, in charge of the weaving at our Settlement School, .and named for its portrayal of the colors in the Tennessee buck-eyes. The new ones will be in different combinations: one a new soft blue and chocolate brown, with white and a deeper blue; another a bright THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 61 red, green, yellow and black one; and the third one of lovely oriental colors. For campus and sport wear the McArthur square should prove popular, twenty-seven inches square of the traditional green, black and yellow plaid of the McArthur clan. If these should not suit your coloring, there will be two other plaids to choose from, all grand for those sweaters every college girl owns. Did you know strawberries were in season? They strayed to ladies' lingerie this year, but Arrowcraft has brought them back to the breakfast table in a dead-white doilie displaying two luscious strawberries woven in the corner. Very reasonable, these should prove welcome additions to the Arrow sets in natural linen and white, and the "utility" sets with bright borders or in conservative all white. And you will need new knitting bags for war-time knitters ! A new cylinder bag (popularly called the feed-bag) has proved a good seller at the Arrowcraft shop this summer. They look jaunty slung over the shoulder, and can be used as a carryall for First Aid notebooks, as well. A new (to me, at least) bedjacket was on display at Arrowcraft Shop last summer with a clever high neckline, and in heavenly blue, pale pink or white. They can also be secured in orchid, yellow or green. Your convalescent friends would appreciate them! Mrs, Snow also tells us there will be at least six new neckties to provide Father, Son or Friend with a new one for Christmas (although these will cost you a little more this year with war prices on wool) and that there will still be quantities of shawls, all linen towels, and a limited supply of all wool yardage and wall hangings. Speaking of shawls, don't fail to ask for some of the lovely ones woven of rich deep red, blue, green and yellow, the squares so blended and arranged that folding produces three entirely different color effects. Or you might like the gossamer white, or a pastel, for evening wear with it over your head and just a corner turned back, the fringe frames your face and neck to add allure to the simplest frock. By the time your fall order is placed, the newly . appointed Craft Advisory Committee, whom we shall introduce to you next issue, will have selected additional new items for production. Aren't you anxious to see them all and show them to your II B (1, Settlement School friends? HOW TO WIN FIRST PLACE IN MAGAZINE SALES COMMISSIONS! THE Denver Alumnae Club has consistently held first place for the largest amount of magazine commissions since 1937. This is a record of which they may be justly proud, and the story of their methods should prove an inspiration to all other alumni club magazine chairmen. Such a story is here presented by Dorothy Andrews Thebus, Colorado B, Denver's magazine chairman from 1930 to 1937. "It was in 1930, I believe, that I was asked to be magazine chairman for the Denver Alumnae Club. I had a small son, and since it was hard to leave home very often for meetings, I was glad to find I could help while remaining at home. It is a real pleasure to sell people something that they already know and like. It soon became apparent to me what wonderful opportunities for service to our Settlement School lay in this field for every alumnae club. I observed with envy the clubs whose names appeared among the first eight listed in the annual reports and thought how proud I should be if the Denver Alumnx Club would be mentioned. I was very happy when in 1932 we placed seventh and three years later were in sixth place. In 1937 I had the pleasure of seeing Denver heading the list. As much of the work of the magazine chair-man comes in November and December which is also the time of preparing for Christmas, I felt in fairness to my young son and daughter I must give up this work. It was with real regret that I asked for someone to take my place in 1937. I had be-come acquainted by phone with so many of our alumna~ and have missed my periodic chats with them. Mrs. Kenneth Snodgrass (with three children) held this position for the next two years, keeping Denver in first place. Mrs. Ralph Johnson followed (she also has small children) retaining first place and in 1940-41 reached a high for Denver of $228.00 in commissions and also second place in the per capita rating. Mrs. W. Turrell Barber, (Georgia Marrs, Colorado B '40) is chairman this year and I think has reported a new high for Denver for 1941-42. When one observes the annual magazine reports and notices that many of the smaller alumnm clubs are mentioned as highest in the "per capita" rating, it makes one realize how much the larger clubs can do with intensive work. Take, e.g., a city in which there are 300 alumna', not necessarily active in the alumni club. Nearly everyone spends at least $5.00 per year on magazines. Many spend much more. If the club could average $5.00 per member, this would be $1,500.00 in subscriptions and approximately $350.00 in commissions earned for the Settlement School. I believe it helps to figure a goal toward which to work. Our chairman keeps a card file of subscribers, also a file by months of subscriptions coming due, and systematically calls these subscribers, suggesting to them new magazines they would enjoy, special rates on magazines, etc. Many excellent suggestions for selling are given each year in the annual report in the September ARROW. Magazines make excellent gifts which are enjoyed throughout the year. Surely every II (I) has one non-II cl) friend who will gladly allow us to place his or her subscriptions. Why not ask? You are not asking for money which would not be spent anyway in just this manner. A friend of our family who used to give liquor at Christmas to his business and personal friends changed to magazines and for several years has placed the subscriptions through our club. Last 62 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW year he turned in 17 subscriptions to Life and two to Fortune. Each year our club holds a Settlement School tea at which goods from the Arrowcraft Shop are displayed and sold. This is held early in November. A table is always devoted to magazine subscriptions. This serves both as a convenience and a reminder. Mrs. Barber's husband made a beautiful poster for the table last year, having titles from many popular magazines pasted along one side as they would appear in a magazine rack. KEEP THEM 'LAST FOUNDERS' DAY the Chicago South Alumnae Club decided that rather than feast themselves at a luxurious hotel for perhaps two dollars and a half each, they would do something for someone else and still hold all the friendship and fraternity spirit so much a part of Founders' Day celebrations. Their happy solution was a "Settlement School Book Tea" held at the home of one of their members, to which contributions were brought. (They had hinted that a dollar each would be most satisfactory, but members gave as their budgets warranted.) From this wartime Founders' Day, Chicago South was able to order fifty books from a list compiled by Miss May K. Duncan, head of the department of elementary education of the University of Kentucky, as selections which would be beneficial to our Settlement School elementary grade library. Can't you just see the shining faces of our Gatlinburg youngsters when Miss Margaret Burchfield, Settlement School librarian, shows them the new books on the children's shelves at the Grace Coolidge library? Other donors this past year included the Boston Alumnae Club, whose check for twenty-five dollars provided the addition of much needed reference books; and individual members who sent down forty-three books, of which nineteen were welcome new volumes on science. The library is not entirely dependent on contributions, as library fees of twenty-five cents a semester from each high-school student plus fines of two cents a day for books held over two weeks, brought a revenue of over seventy dollars last year. Much of this was needed to replace standard high school requirements that had finally reached the discard stage after continuous usage over a period of years. The Grace Coolidge library is housed in a large room in the High School building, and is open for students three hours a day, which is all of the time it is not being used by Miss Burchfield as a class-room for English and Spanish, a regrettable condition brought on by crowded quarters. Not only are the students hungry for new books, but ade (Don't you think all husbands of magazine chairmen deserve a vote of thanks for their patience and help the many phone interruptions at meal time and their help in getting subscriptions sent in, etc.) This is very satisfying work as we have such definite results to show for our efforts. The opportunity is here for every alumnae club. Each II must do a little work and every chairman a great deal." EADING! quate reference work in the classes of our Settlement School High School demands a substantial increase in volumes for all courses. The first need for the Settlement School library is to build it up for the use of our own students. It is one department of the school which, while meeting the minimum state requirements, will not hold that standard unless continued replacements are made and new books added. The second need or perhaps a dream, but a very realistic and worthwhile dream is to b,lild the number of books to the point where package libraries may be formed and loaned for definite periods of time to the nearby communities. Through this service II B c can extend its area of influence and bring joy and education to people eager for more and better reading. While you alumna members are checking your book-shelves for donations to the U.S.O. and army and navy camps, don't forget our own "defense project" in Gatlinburg, and remember to send all the volumes that might be of value to grade or high school students there. Address them to the librarian, Miss Margaret Burchfield, II B Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tenn. She will paste a II B (I) bookplate in the front of each volume, bearing your name and the date received. Or send a copy of your favorite book so that others may share your pleasure in reading it! Or, should you have too many favorites to choose from, pick a volume from one of the lists available through the Little Pigeon news editor, and order it sent to Grace Coolidge library. Perhaps your alumnm club might like to have a Book Tea or a Book Day this year, as a supplement to the regular Settlement School projects (sale of Arrow-craft goods and regular financial contributions to the general Settlement School funds) so vital to the continuance of our endeavors to build for the staunch mountain people of Tennessee a world that is truly American. NlILDRED ODELL SALE Editor, News From Little Pigeon Committee ep rts COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION T HE most interesting news of the year, concerning extension, has been the granting of a charter to II E at DePauw University by the unanimous vote of Grand Council and the chapters in the Province. Due to the postponement of the 1942 Convention, II 1 E was unable to submit its petition for the charter to Convention, the permission for which had been previously announced. The committee on extension wishes to congratulate our newest chapter and tell them how proud we are of the splendid showing they have made during this year of colonization. So in Indiana Epsilon is added a chapter fully worthy of II B cl). All inquiries have been met with cordial re sponse but to date nothing of interest has developed. Inquiries have come from A Sorority at American University, Washington, D.C.; from A A M Sorority at Massachusetts State, Amherst; from a group at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; and from the Dean at Arkansas State College, Jonesboro, Arkansas. My sincere appreciation to Miss Onken and Mrs. Finger for their assistance since my very recent appointment to chairmanship of the committee. Respectfully submitted, MILDRED BOWERS BALIMAN COMMITTEE ON T ANSFERS \ THE committee on transfers has used the same procedure as in the past few years. Chapter correspondence secretaries have reported transfers at the beginning of the school year by filling out two introductory transfer blanks: one for the chap-ter on the campus to which the girls concerned is transferring and one for the transfer chairman. After October 15, the date when the above report is listed as being due on the official calendar, this committee sent letters to all corresponding secretaries reminding them all that they should be cordial to the new Pi Phis on their campuses and urging those who had not sent in their xeports to do so at once. In the fall, letters were also sent to Province Presidents asking their cooperation with this committee by seeing during their visits with the chap ters that the transfers were being shown all possible consideration. Advisory board members in charge of transfers were asked to help where there were several transfers on the same campus by holding regular monthly meetings with those girls. All transfers received letters explaining what they might expect of the new chapters, what the general practice is regarding affiliation and what is expected of them in regard to the national organization and the local group. This year there were still more transfers than in the past few years. Eighty-six girls went from forty chapters to forty-one. Texas A headed the list with ten transfers on its campus. Illinois E had eight and both North Carolina A and Iowa Z had six. Thirteen chapters failed to report. SANCHA KILBOURN GARVEY HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE T HE Holt House Committee has carried on the work of restoration and partial furnishing as planned. Last fall some furnishings were installed downstairs and in the hostess living room and bed room. Planting was done at the front of the house. Mrs. C. C. Cary of Newton, Iowa, is hostess at Holt House greeting visitors and helping the active girls or alumnae with entertaining. Last October 17 and 18 the Pi Phis of Monmouth held open house for townspeople and Monmouth College alumna back for "homecoming." There were several hundred guests. Products of the Settlement School were displayed and many articles were sold. The chapter at Monmouth gave a rushing party and held initiation at the house. In order to make the house more complete and therefore more useful the committee hopes to complete soon furnishing of the Founders' Room, the Powder Room, and a guest bed room. This bed room would be used by visiting members of the fraternity or by parents visiting students of Mon-mouth College. It is hoped we can buy some china and plated flat silver. Holt House is now open to members of the fraternity and their friends who wish to visit it. It is available to clubs and chapters for meetings or entertaining. 63 The Holt House Committee appreciates the interest and generosity of chapters clubs and individuals. The committee wishes to thank the members of Grand Council and the Province Presidents and Province Vice-Presidents for their help and co-operation.

        46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW sive educational demands. Several years in advance of the State decision to make Physical Education and a Health Education course compulsory in Tennessee Schools after 1942, Pi Phi School has offered this training. Our satisfaction this year in securing a part time music teacher through W.P.A. funds was short lived. However, we will strive to make music possible in some other way since a soul satisfying educational program is incomplete without music. We will never be satisfied until we are able to fill this great lack. However, it is nice to be able to tell you that Community Sings will be held in our Auditorium or on our grounds during the coming year. Most noteworthy this year is the development of and interest in the Craft courses under John Moore. If you will read back through the reports of several Chairmen you will be reminded that the need for encouragement and education in the field of Crafts was long ago considered of real importance. The progress this year has been very satisfying. Committee is delighted to report to the Fraternity at large that a qualified group has accepted the responsibility of advising and directing the Craft program. You will remember Miss Jessie Harris, convention initiate at Ashville in 1938. Miss Harris was chosen for this Pi Phi distinction because, as Director of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee, she had won national recognition in her field and because she had rendered invaluable service to our Settlement School project over a period of years. It is now your good fortune to have the advice of Miss Harris, as well as that of her Pi Phi friend and associate, Miss Ida Anders, Iowa r, and Miss Hurd, University of Tennessee's Craft Director. These three constitute our new Craft Advisory Committee. Not only in the field of Craft, but in every field of advancement will the continuity of their vision and direction be felt. They have professional experience, national viewpoint, broad understanding of our mountain people to combine with loyalty and belief in our project. Long felt has been the need for a connecting link to prevent delay, to keep visions clear, to keep straight the path toward a greater service. With changing committee members, staff and directors, much inspirational leadership has been lost. We do welcome sincerely their generous response to our invitation to serve officially and anticipate constructive progress. Arrowcraft again brings us great distinction and clears a net profit of over $11,000.00. The amazing national merchandising achievement of Pi Phi Alumna Clubs in disposing of Arrowcraft products is primarily responsible for Arrowcraft be-coming a profitable business. Not to be overlooked, however, is the sound business ability of our Arrowcraft Director, Ethel Snow, Iowa r. Her strict attention to the safeguarding of Pi Phi interests, her excellent judgment in the merchandising, her untiring patience and promptness in dealing with our willing, but ofttimes inexperienced Alumna Chairmen, have combined fortunately to increase our Arrowcraft business. Only a small bit of concentrated effort regularly on the part of each Pi Phi is all that it will take to keep Arrow-craft a paying department and give sole means of support to many mountain families. This again reminds us of that' vast untouched field for craft endeavor which can result in a national center so worthy and so great as to be the source of untold pride and satisfaction to new generations of Pi Phis. But that is in itself a long and fascinating story a dream that can come true if Pi Phis want it. Through the combined efforts of Staff, professional advisors, and Committee, the coming year should produce many new designs and new objects to augment our lovely Arrowcraft display. We are mindful of the new and greater opportunities which curtailment of foreign trade has created. We are alert to every possibility of strengthening the economic stability of our areas. We approach this through two mediums. One is through art and craft' courses in our Schools to prepare our future workers in basic appreciation of color, form, and design. The other means is through our adult education classes and direction of hand work among mountain people which is necessary to maintain themselves. Winogene Redding continues her fine work as supervisor of our adult weaving program. Two out-standing community achievements are the results of her vision and enthusiastic effort. The Gatlin-burg Garden Club has made noteworthy improvements in the community with the planting of Dog-wood trees along the highway and two parked areas near the center of business. There has been general impetus given to home and civic beautification. Under her direction our Weaver's Guild has taken its place among America's Summer Players. Their original play "Store Britches" continues this summer as a successful contribution to the enjoyment of visitors. Next to education, we think of Pi Phi's Health Service. Continuing under the sincere direction of Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, R.N., certain needed re-organization of this important field of community service has progressed successfully. To withdraw certain services, long accepted by community, even to devote more time and energy to the field of preventive and health education, is a delicate transition. Obviously the steady growth of our community with a resident physician now available has changed the aspect of our health service. By limiting our service to needly first aid and emergency, more time can be given to health education instruction. In addition, the war emergency need for Red Cross training courses has been met adequately and with distinction by our Health Service. Difficult as it is to believe, the past year's experience shows again that the service of a regular County nurse is not available regularly in this extended area. Elizabeth Comstock Peck, California B, is be-ginning her second year as Director with the warm regard of Staff, Community, and Committee to prove how genuine and kindly is her consideration for others and how quickly she has caught the spirit of Pi Phi service to a great cause. She has been tireless in her efforts to produce congenial efficiency. The only general Staff change was made when Annette Morse, Illinois A, resigned after four years' faithful service as house manager because of her own family need. Miss Lena Hodgins of Champaign, Illinois, is deserving of the compliments that her delicious food and smooth running household bring to her. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 47 Bequests made possible two very fine accomplishments during the past year. A new Stuart dormitory for boys was built with the net sum of $9,250.00 which was left for this purpose by Anne Elizabeth Stuart, Nebraska B. With colonial influence, expressed in simple lines, and permanency assured by use of native stone, heavy hand split shingles, and slate, already there is evidenced a fulfillment of her dream. The boys are proving their pride in an adequate charming home by assuming all responsibility for its perfect upkeep. Proud the donor would be if she could glimpse the satisfaction and inspiration that her generous gift has given to those fine young people whom she so joyously served. Although there is no concrete evidence as yet in stone or wood, the sum of $1,000.00 was given to Settlement School by District of Columbia A to start a fund for Health Center improvement. To the memory of this generous unknown Pi Phi donor who chose to share her joy in giving with her chapter, we pledge ourselves to continued effort to justify her faith. We believe that soon this sum will attract enough to it to make her dream and ours come true. With so many, many Pi Phis desirous of replacing the obsolete little old building which for so long has been inadequate to our Health Service demands, we are confidently making plans and studying the advice and suggestions of experts, that we may be ready when Pi Phi generosity makes suitable housing and equipment possible. Have you ever thought ho'*w satisfactory a choice our leaders made when they gave us a philanthropy with such varied channels? Almost any individual personal preference may be satisfied. With quite natural differences of opinions as to the most worthy field, Pi Phi Fraternity has proven that unified effort can coordinate a variety of needed services into one tremendous influence for good. We shall continue our effort to acquaint our members with each step as we unfold an expanded program of usefulness. It has been a pleasure to answer the many questions asked by devoted Pi Phis. We shall continue to welcome constructive suggestions. Our Committee is trying hard to keep pace with national trends, community changes and worthy fields for :the generous expression of Pi Phi's philanthropy. We believe that no school and no welfare organization could be in a more fortunate situation to begin this uncertain period of national emergency. We are proud to report that we have no Settlement School debts and there are no involvements. Our determination is to keep our affairs in good order, do our best to maintain the standards which we have pridefully built up, fulfill the obligations to which we are pledged and upon which is dependent the greater proportion of all necessary income and to continuance of the present program committments. This we believe we can do provided the normal contributions from earned money and gifts continue. To explain this I will quote a frequently asked question "To what extent does the Settlement Schol depend upon Pi Phi contributions ?" The answer is: To exist, Settlement School is absolutely dependent upon the continuance and the receipt of the present, and recent past, average of active and alumnx contributions. Reason: The approximate running and maintenance budget in round numbers is $30,000, exclusive of Arrowcraft. Originally there was one general source for Settlement School support, namely gifts and contributions earned by Pi Phis. Gradually by development of wise business procedure two other sources were added, namely income from sources within the Fraternity, for example, the interest on the endowment and the commissions from the magazine agency, and income from practical application of business principles to the school administration as our program became more and more involved, such as sale of farm products, staff living, small fees for certain health service, and agriculture and craft courses. The third source came from the gradually shifting to State, County, and Community of such financial responsibility as their growing ability could assume, for the educational system particularly. Here I will mention an interesting fact that few Pi Phis understand. The larger proportion of increase in expenditure, as we have increased the facilities and service of our School, has come from this gradual increase in governmental appropriation. So carefully and fairly has this balance of responsibility been worked out that there has never been a question of the integrity of local government in assuming its rightful share. Nor has the State or County ever questioned Pi Phi's integrity as the growing demands forced us to request increased appropriation for teachers. With these three sources in mind, it is simple to understand that the basic income from actives and alumnae, although approximately only one-third of the total running budget, is the nucleus which at-tracts the other two-thirds. This is the foundation. If we remove or lessen our recent average contributions, we jeopardize the receipt of the other two-thirds of necessary income. By maintaining our normal average of the first third, it is quite normal to anticipate increased income from these other sources. My own personal belief is that we can carry on for the emergency at this safe level for actual Pi Phi contributions, provided they can be upheld. I believe that future bequests and Pi Phi gifts for special equipment will provide generously for new buildings as the need is evidenced through our wise determination of actual justified need_ As you know the budget for the year is deter-mined at the summer Committee meeting. Since the first third is not fixed, it becomes necessary for the Committee to take the sum of the average expectancy from study of the past several years contributions from actives and alumnae. You can well imagine our worry if alumnae clubs' contributions drop below the normal expectancy. Another frequent question is "Are Pi Phi contributions used solely for the Arrowcraft Shop ?" The answer is, No! Arrowcraft at present is self-supporting and pays it share of general running expenses of the School. (School in this sense means proiect, not educational department.) While we cannot safely predict anything in these uncertain times, it is reasonable to suppose that Arrowcraft can be counted upon to maintain itself if 48 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 1. Pi Phi alum= continue their effort to sell Arrowcraft products. 2. If the traveling public still buy in our two local shops. (This we know will suffer because of curtailment of tires.) 3. If Wage and Hour regulations upon hand looming in the home do not create a cost increase impossible to accommodate. Arrowcraft was "in the red" for many years as Pi Phi strove to rehabilitate the mountain people and this was considered a profitable procedure, our worthy contribution to human betterment. A third question often asked is "What help do we receive from Government agencies ?" The educational system receives financial help as follows: County 1. Elementary Teachers' salaries are paid to them directly by the County. This sum does not appear on our budget, either in income or disbursement. 2. Rent for Elementary School building of $1,000.00 per year. (Additional cost of maintenance and repairs is paid by Pi Phi.) 3 Some School supplies and books State and Smith-Hughes Fund 1. Three-fourths of High School Teachers' salaries. Smith-Hughes provides part salary for certain vocational courses such as agriculture and home economics. The State allows $500.00 annually for adult weaving instruction. The Health Center receives from the State Health Department serums for certain required vaccinations and injections. Regarding other governmental agencies: 1. We were able to get a part time music teacher this current year through the Works Progress Administration. This was canceled in January when all such service was discontinued by government order. 2. Several adult trade instruction classes were established under the Defense Training authority. No so called "W.P.A." funds were or are rated by the community for services such as are offered at the School other than the aforementioned music assistance (now non-existent). Often the question is asked "Why do we not rate financial assistance from certain well known Foundations ?" The answer is "We are rated as a Foundation by other Foundations. As such, we do not quality for their assistance. However, the Committee is hopeful of getting certain "gift" assistance to fulfill specified needs such as a library of fine records, scores, and machine for music appreciation community pro-gram." We are making an exhaustive study to determine just what .classification will attract other such supplementary assistance. We have the attention and sincere interest of three officials of the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. We welcome further Pi Phi help to coordinate our requests. As to further Health Center assistance we are informed by two sources of factual information, State and County, and by a national expert in governmental budgeting, that there is no possible fund available to underwrite the educational health service through which Pi Phi has raised the whole health status of a large area. There is still only one County nurse in our entire County and even this has been irregular. I invite your study and understanding of the following outline of Pi Phi sources of income which have gradually suggested themselves as sound permanent methods to serve to stabilize our project, give security, and insure in a measure our ability to meet our assumed responsibility. 1. Income from Pi Beta Phi. General Active Chapters Alumnie Clubs Individual gifts Bequests Commissions from Magazine Agency Interest on Endowment Fund Interest on Savings Account Contributions specified for furnishings or improvements Miscellaneous (Principally insurance proceeds) School Income Small fees from Agriculture Home Economics and certain Health Services Farm Products sold to outside Farm Products sold to our kitchen Staff living fees. As you study this brief analysis there is one im portant fact to take into consideration, the running administrative budget for maintenance and upkeep is comparable with that of any home for utilities, service, repairs, replacements, etc., and is separate from the teachers' salaries and supplies of the educational program. You will see that we are providing the background while State and County are largely supplying the educational program. It is an accepted fact that Schools, Libraries, and Health Services are never self-supporting. They are either endowed or supported by public or private funds. Our project will always be to large extent a welfare project, in which we supplement the basic program, as offered by a willing community, with the advantages of a sponsored program in health, education and vocational guidance. This same need for public spirited service is evidenced in every large city as well as every small community and it is expressed by privately or publicly endowed hospitals, baby clinics, schools, libraries, health centers of every description. Every public spirited Pi Phi could designate a definite need in her community, a vital one. But long ago Pi Phi became the self-elected sponsors of a definite community. From us these really worthy Anglo-Saxon people have received every inspiration for upbuilding of body and soul. To us this community will always look for guidance, inspiration and all cultural development. As they willingly and pridefully accept certain responsibilities, we are able in turn to expand our influence into an ever growing circle. As fast as Pi Phi donors wish we will grow into a center of great national educational consequence. Our facilities, our background, our past integrity, makes possible our ability to meet whatever great need the future brings to our firmly established center in the Smokies. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 To speak of a possible present emergency opportunity we of committee are seriously mindful that added burdens may rightfully come to us. Just what, how, or when, we cannot predict now. But from patriotic and loyal Pi Phis everywhere we welcome suggestions if you see a practical opportunity to increase our service. Several ideas have already been discussed whereby we might serve the cause of youth in war time. In anticipating some additional war effort we have established contact with the several agencies in Washington under whom we may be called upon to serve. Through the War Production Board's several textile departments and its Small Business Bureau we are endeavoring to find what needed articles or fabrics can be made under our supervision. Through this means we hope to stabilize the economic status of our community and use to the fullest every bit of man and woman power. We have contacted the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor through Dr. Martha Elliott and her associate, Miss Ruth Taylor, to get first hand information regarding the government's plans for service to evacuated children or families. Through Dr. Howard McCluskey, whose responsibility in the Office of Civilian Defense is the coordinating of war efforts of organization we are promised assistance that we may find our proper field. We are studying the possibilities of additional use for our facilities in the field of occupational therapy if by chance any or all of the Gatlinburg hotels should be needed for hospitalization. At the suggestion of the National Office of Civilian Defense we are contacting the regional and State offices of Civilian Defense as a means of keeping aware of needs. It is our hope and expectation that we will be ready for any war emergency service that may come to Gatlinburg to command the unified patriotic effort of thirty-three thousand Pi Phis. Respectively submitted, Settlement School Committee. ETHEL COPP, Chairman, EPO T OF THE *I\ ECTO OF THE PI ETA PHIl SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 194142 To Grand Council of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Settlement School Committee, and the Fraternity: F oR every Pi Phi who holds a cherished place in her heart for the Settlement School, there is every reason to be proud of the year just past. Highlights that stand out are the establishing and development of the Arts and Crafts program in the school; the reorganization of the Health Center to meet changing community needs; the fall visit of Dean Taylor of the University of Kentucky with his valuable survey; the completion of the new Stuart Dormitory for boys; and just this last May the annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee here at the School, which is like having five fine friends and counselors arrive at one time to help solve problems and guide policies for the best interests of Pi Phi and our School. There's a Rip Van Winkle quiet over the school grounds now that makes it hard to picture the tremendous activity of the School year. According to Mr. Fleming's report, we had the largest high school enrollment in the history of the school. Besides the regular classes in English, History, Sociology, Science, Vocational Agriculture and Vocational Home Economics, a new unit of World History was added for the tenth grade, and Spanish for the eleventh grade, Arts and Crafts for Junior and Senior students, as well as classes in first aid and home nursing. Everyone in High School has been active in the physical education program. The Bov's Basketball team was in the District Semi-finals. This year the girls had an intramural basket-ball program as well as a few inter-school games. The Agriculture and Home Economics clubs, the Press Club, and the various other school organizations had a very successful year. The Press Club sponsored the "Pi Phi Paperette" which was a page of school news incorporated in the local Gatlinburg paper. Several Community and school socials have been held in the gymnasium, and the juniors and Seniors each gave a School play. The Seniors raised funds for their trip just before Class Week. They visited Lookout Mountain, Nashville, Mammoth Cave, and Lincoln Memorial University. In the Home Economics department nutrition was stressed and low cost healthful meals were given special attention. Weaving was especially popular with the girls this year and each girl in the junior class wove a knitting bag with an all-over design, and several have woven dresser scarves with small figure inlays such as flowers or initials. The Sophomore class was larger. Two girls worked at each loom, learning each step from the making of the warp, to the threading of the loom and finally the actual weaving. In the sewing project each girl made two garments of her own choice. Two of the girls participated in the Style Show at the University of Tennessee's Open House. Each year of Home Economics is a combination course which includes foods, clothing, personal grooming, home management, child care and other topics. The boys and girls in the third year classes met together for six weeks to study "Problems in Family Living and Home Management" and lively round table discussions were held. A total of forty-eight boys were enrolled in Vocational Agriculture. The course of study for each of these boys is based on farming on the Home Farm, with emphasis being placed on food production for home first and for national defense. National Defense classes were also held and con-ducted for out-of-school youth in the various rural communities. The boys learned blacksmithing and farm machinery repair, wood-working, simple electricity, and auto mechanics. Two evening classes of farmers met and studied problems pertaining to farming and food production, under our agriculture teacher. The new courses now being taught in the Arts and Crafts department include jewelry, Metal Craft, Ceramics, Block Printing, and the Native crafts. The courses are elective for juniors and Seniors and have been very popular. In jewelry, the students studied the fundamental techniques of constructing and decorating rings set with semi-precious stones, sterling silver pins and clips, a 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW combination of copper and brass bracelets and other chains. In Metal work, they constructed plates, ash trays, bowls, lamps and candle-sticks. Laboratory problems in ceramics include the techniques of hand building of animals and figures, wheel throwing, pressing from moulds, slip-casting, glazing and firing of the kiln. The methods of textile deco-ration were also studied, including block-printing, stenciling and tie-dyeing. Several very talented students were discovered in the classes. There were also well-attended adult classes in the evenings. For its first year, genuine progress and great enthusiasm were felt in this part of the school pro-gram. The Elementary School completed an equally successful year under Pern Price, principal. One of the outstanding affairs of the year was the children's operetta, which was the very best the school has ever had. The children were beautifully trained, the costumes were clever, and the entire performance a credit to the teachers and Mr. Price who worked with the children so patiently. The story was "Peter Rabbit" so that it is not hard to visualize the cunning songs and costumes. The Movie Projector, purchased from gift funds, has been a most valuable addition to the entire school program. Educational, as well as films for entertainment have been shown regularly and the coming year promises to see it used even more frequently as we .work in conjunction with the government showing of films for defense. The report of the Health Center has special interest as it reflected the changing, yet continued very important program. Health study, First Aid Classes, Nutrition, Home Nursing, all are stressed. Mrs. Chalmers is combining a full teaching schedule with her nursing duties. In the High School all who could arrange their time to take the shortened First Aid course, did so. Adult classes in Home Nursing at the Health Center completed their studies and qualified for their certificates. With the emphasis on health instruction, preventive service in the community was not allowed to suffer, and the totals for the year were about the same as the preceding one. There was a considerable drop in the number of calls, and community service was confined to demonstrations of nursing procedures, practical instruction and strictly emergency measures. Inspections and inoculations in the School, and corrective work was done as usual. The Health Center received gifts from the local chapter of the Red Cross, and from many of the alumni clubs, all of which were very much needed and deeply appreciated. Many of these things are for the "Loan Closet" and are in frequent use, being gratefully borrowed and carefully returned. Being a year of "transition" the Health Center passed through an eventful year in which those services which we have outgrown have been eliminated, and through greater concentration on health instruction the valuable service of the Health Center will continue to assist the community toward better and safer living. From the Arrowcraft Shop comes the report that during the past year, one hundred and thirty-two alumme clubs, nine active chapters, twenty-three shops and individuals too numerous to mention have sold Arrowcraft merchandise. One of the most successful sales of the year was handled by the Boston Club at the New England Flower Show which this year had as one of its themes "The Wildflowers of the Smokies." The sales at the Arrowcraft Booth were over $2,000. One of the most important pieces of publicity of the year, was the June number of House and Garden which featured the handicrafts of the whole Southern Appalachian region. Our own "Aunt Lizzie's" photograph, as well as many others were taken here in Gatlinburg under Mrs. Snow's guidance. Arrowcraft has received many, many inquiries as a result of this publicity. The Fall Guild meeting was held in Berea, Kentucky, with five members of the school staff at-tending. The spring meeting was 'held in Knoxville, where the invitation was extended to the Guild to hold their 1942 meeting in Gatlinburg and we hope to make it outstanding. The meeting of the stock-holders of Southern Highlanders, Inc., of which Arrowcraft is a member, was held in Knoxville following the Guild meeting. It is interesting to note that Miss Jessie Harris, Director of Home Economics of the University of Tennessee, and our Asheville initiate, was elected a Director for the coming year. The weavers for the Shop had more work than ever before last year. There was a total of ninety-eight weavers on the books and there were eighty-seven working at one time just before Christmas. The Weaving meetings have been well attended. With the cost of living increasing for them as well as everyone else, there are many families where the weaving is needed more than ever. The reports of Arrowcraft, Health Center, and Sch6ol show a unity of effort in carrying out the ideals of the fraternity in constructive aid and service in this community. If war emergency needs make demands upon us, it will be the desire of the entire staff to meet these demands, and to continue to give their very best efforts to the School, which is just as dear to everyone in Gatlinburg as it is to every Pi Phi! Respectfully submitted, ELIZABETH COMSTOCK PECK, Director, Pi Beta Phi School. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORT ON AUDIT OF Ti'EASUI.E 'S ACCOUNTS YEA ENDED JUNE 30, 1942, 51 August 3, 1942 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Bice of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1942. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the subsidiary records kept for the School and the Arrowcraft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1942, and the income and expenses for the fiscal year then ended, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from Club and Chapter contributions, which are shown in detail in Schedule 3-a, and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the Treasurer. The cash balance at Milwaukee was verified by us. The endowment securities and cash, except cash in transit, which we verified, were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's report was accepted without further verification except that we checked the accounting made of changes in investments and the income from securities and found in it good order. COMMENTS Cash Balances The cash balances at June 30, 1942, exclusive of cash with the endowment Trustees or in transit, consisted of the following: Milwaukee Account: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's checking account $ 7,922.97 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank School check ing account 793:45 Sevier County Bank Dormitory building account 79.06 Sevier County Bank Arts and Crafts acount 223.39 Gatlinburg Arrowcraft Accounts: Sevier County Bank Checking ac count 6,814.50 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 2,986.64 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 4,218.46 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 4,780.04 Petty cash funds at Gatlinburg 45.00 Total $27,863.51 As indicated above, we verified the balances in Milwaukee accounts while those at Sevierville or Knoxville were verified by Homer K. Jones and Company according to their report. The above balances do not include magazine agency receipts in the custody of Mrs. C. M. Purdunn who reported a balance due the Settlement School on May 15, 1942 of $3,216.27. In accordance with previous practice the magazine agency receipts taken into account by the Settlement School Treasurer for the fiscal year consisted only of the remittances from Mrs. Purdunn which totaled $3,000.00. Accounts Receivable The Arrowcraft accounts receivable at June 30, 1942 amounted to $6,710.25 and were due principally from alumni clubs. These accounts, which we did not verify, were listed in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company and were $162.02 greater than those at the close of the previous year. Fixed Assets Expenditures for additions to buildings, equipment and landscaping amounted to $12,480.37 for the year under ieview. Included in this total is $9,122.94 for the new Stuart Dormitory and $1,703.12 for new equipment for this dormitory, a total of $10,826.06. As indicated above, the expenditures for the new dormitory were evidently not included in the Gatlinburg audit. All additions to the property accounts are shown in Schedule 2. It may be noted that the old Stuart Cottage which was razed was removed from the books and its estimated book value of $450.00 ($2,011.02 less depreciation of $1,561.02) less salvage receipts of $25.00, was charged off to expense. Depreciation of the buildings and equipment, computed at rates used in the past, totaled $3,259.04 as shown in the same schedule. Lists sent to us indicated that most of the equipment at Gatlinburg had been inventoried at June 30, 1942 and it seemed advisable to enter the inventory values on the records in lieu of the depreciated book values. However, examination of these inventories revealed that at least the machinery and equipment in the vocational school building (industrial building) had not been listed or valued so no change was made on the records. In your particular case we believe that it would be preferable to have the present inventory values of equipment on the books rather than those now shown, if the inventories can be completed. Endowment The only changes in the endowment principal for the year under review consisted of the appropriation of three-fourths of the chapter contributions, or $1,307.75, offset to a slight extent by losses on securities of $62.03, the fund showing a net increase of $1,245.72. No amortization of bond premiums is charged against income by the Trustee although the securities on hand cost $1,710.05 more than par value. However, the market value of the securities at June 30, 1942 was $132.51 more than cost as shown in the list in Schedule 1 according to the Trustee's report. 52 .THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Current Income and Expenses The expenses of the Settlement School exceeded operating income by $6,977.50 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $12,578.43. The Settlement School expenses included depreciation of $3,259.04, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores but which is not charged to this department. The Arrowcraft net income was $1,524.65 less than that of the previous year although the sales of $54,651.28 were approximately the same as those for 1940-1941. The sales at the Mountain View Hotel which are ordinarily quite profitable fell off somewhat with a decrease in gross profit of $656.18. An accounting of the net income is presented as follows: Net income of Arrowcraft division . . . . $12,578.43 Deficit in operation of Settlement School 6,977.50 Net income $ 5,600.93 Accounted for as follows: Increase in Arrowcraft inventories $ 4,004.41 Increase in ArroWcraft receivables Increase in farm live-stock Expenditures for build ing and equipment $12,480.37 Less depreciation for year 3,259.04 $ 9,221.33 Less Stuart Cottage charged off 450.00 8,771,33 Increase in prepaid in surance 505.51 $13,594.27 Less decrease in cash balances and cash items on hand 9,301.09 $ 4,293,18 Transfer of funds to endowment principal 1,307.75 Total as above $ 5,600.93 It may be observed that the Arrowcraft inventories have been increasing each year and that a substantial portion of the net income is invested in the finished goods and materials on hand. This is probably a normal situation but in any case the insurance coverage on these inventories should be carefully watched. Respectfully submitted, REILLY, PENNER AN!)

We break our rule of "reports only" in the September ARROW to print the following pages, which should be of assistance in planning help for the Settlement School for the coming year. EFENSE AT GATLIN 16 ,e) U G THIS is war! Every American is giving wholeheartedly of his or her time, money, and effort to promote worthwhile projects in vital war production, or in equally important measures to maintain and protect those vital "defense projects" that aim to hold fast for the future the fundamental rights and privileges of American citizenship. Such a defense project is our II B Settlement School at Gatlinburg. If we are to hold the ground so painstakingly won by loyal Pi Beta Phis in the past; if we are to protect our investment in the Smokies; if we are to preserve a source of revenue for people who have no other means of livelihood; if we are to retain the faith and friendship of the mountain people who have come to respect and admire II B (I) not because they know our inner joy of member-ship but because they have seen the benefits of our altruism we, members of II B , must make this coming year of 1942-1943 as glorious a record in contributions to the Settlement School as any in our history. To do this may be harder than in the past, but the satisfaction of our accomplishment will also be greater! It is the first task of the Settlement School Committee to plan wisely so that expenses may be held within the expected income; and our second task is to help you carry on your regular projects for the benefit of the Settlement School that this in-come may be great enough to cover the necessary expenses of such an enterprise. Settlement School income from Pi Beta Phis comes largely from three sources: sale of Arrow craft, contributions from active chapters and alumna clubs, and magazine commissions. You, in your individual clubs, can best decide what means to use for the raising of your customary contributions. In this issue you will End suggestions for your magazine sales set-up from the club which has ranked first for the past six successive years in amount of commissions earned. And the new articles added this year to our fine traditional Arrow-craft will insure your Settlement School sale being a success once more. Do you or your friends have sweethearts or husbands in the Service? Of course, you do. Then did you know you could secure black and olive drab neckties of our lovely Arrowcraft quality to go with their regulation uniforms? Or is He in the Air Corps? Then he will appreciate one of the wool scarfs for men, or perhaps the extra long "ski scarf" which is a yard and a third long and can be wrapped around several times to amply protect his throat and chest when he flies in high altitudes. The Royal Standard Chapter, Daughters of the British Empire ordered six dozen of our Frozen Mist scarfs for sale to departing aviators and aviation cadets. All aviators wear some sort of scarf why not be sure that every "Pi Phi Aviator" has an Arrowcraft scarf ? Those showers for II B I, brides make a perfect occasion for Arrowcraft towels; and think of the joy you would bring if each member of the chapter would give a place mat or napkin of Arrowcraft design to complete a luncheon set. =IONS TO AR OWCRAFT s\, THE new items? Here is the latest information from Ethel Snow, our capable Manager of Arrowcraft. First there will be three new scarfs, sparkling in color and developing the theme of last year's favorite Buckeye scarf. The "Buckeye," you re-member, was that lovely brown, brick red and white with just a touch of green in a broken plaid, designed by Winogene Redding, in charge of the weaving at our Settlement School, .and named for its portrayal of the colors in the Tennessee buck-eyes. The new ones will be in different combinations: one a new soft blue and chocolate brown, with white and a deeper blue; another a bright THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 61 red, green, yellow and black one; and the third one of lovely oriental colors. For campus and sport wear the McArthur square should prove popular, twenty-seven inches square of the traditional green, black and yellow plaid of the McArthur clan. If these should not suit your coloring, there will be two other plaids to choose from, all grand for those sweaters every college girl owns. Did you know strawberries were in season? They strayed to ladies' lingerie this year, but Arrowcraft has brought them back to the breakfast table in a dead-white doilie displaying two luscious strawberries woven in the corner. Very reasonable, these should prove welcome additions to the Arrow sets in natural linen and white, and the "utility" sets with bright borders or in conservative all white. And you will need new knitting bags for war-time knitters ! A new cylinder bag (popularly called the feed-bag) has proved a good seller at the Arrowcraft shop this summer. They look jaunty slung over the shoulder, and can be used as a carryall for First Aid notebooks, as well. A new (to me, at least) bedjacket was on display at Arrowcraft Shop last summer with a clever high neckline, and in heavenly blue, pale pink or white. They can also be secured in orchid, yellow or green. Your convalescent friends would appreciate them! Mrs, Snow also tells us there will be at least six new neckties to provide Father, Son or Friend with a new one for Christmas (although these will cost you a little more this year with war prices on wool) and that there will still be quantities of shawls, all linen towels, and a limited supply of all wool yardage and wall hangings. Speaking of shawls, don't fail to ask for some of the lovely ones woven of rich deep red, blue, green and yellow, the squares so blended and arranged that folding produces three entirely different color effects. Or you might like the gossamer white, or a pastel, for evening wear with it over your head and just a corner turned back, the fringe frames your face and neck to add allure to the simplest frock. By the time your fall order is placed, the newly . appointed Craft Advisory Committee, whom we shall introduce to you next issue, will have selected additional new items for production. Aren't you anxious to see them all and show them to your II B (1, Settlement School friends? HOW TO WIN FIRST PLACE IN MAGAZINE SALES COMMISSIONS! THE Denver Alumnae Club has consistently held first place for the largest amount of magazine commissions since 1937. This is a record of which they may be justly proud, and the story of their methods should prove an inspiration to all other alumni club magazine chairmen. Such a story is here presented by Dorothy Andrews Thebus, Colorado B, Denver's magazine chairman from 1930 to 1937. "It was in 1930, I believe, that I was asked to be magazine chairman for the Denver Alumnae Club. I had a small son, and since it was hard to leave home very often for meetings, I was glad to find I could help while remaining at home. It is a real pleasure to sell people something that they already know and like. It soon became apparent to me what wonderful opportunities for service to our Settlement School lay in this field for every alumnae club. I observed with envy the clubs whose names appeared among the first eight listed in the annual reports and thought how proud I should be if the Denver Alumnx Club would be mentioned. I was very happy when in 1932 we placed seventh and three years later were in sixth place. In 1937 I had the pleasure of seeing Denver heading the list. As much of the work of the magazine chair-man comes in November and December which is also the time of preparing for Christmas, I felt in fairness to my young son and daughter I must give up this work. It was with real regret that I asked for someone to take my place in 1937. I had be-come acquainted by phone with so many of our alumna~ and have missed my periodic chats with them. Mrs. Kenneth Snodgrass (with three children) held this position for the next two years, keeping Denver in first place. Mrs. Ralph Johnson followed (she also has small children) retaining first place and in 1940-41 reached a high for Denver of $228.00 in commissions and also second place in the per capita rating. Mrs. W. Turrell Barber, (Georgia Marrs, Colorado B '40) is chairman this year and I think has reported a new high for Denver for 1941-42. When one observes the annual magazine reports and notices that many of the smaller alumnm clubs are mentioned as highest in the "per capita" rating, it makes one realize how much the larger clubs can do with intensive work. Take, e.g., a city in which there are 300 alumna', not necessarily active in the alumni club. Nearly everyone spends at least $5.00 per year on magazines. Many spend much more. If the club could average $5.00 per member, this would be $1,500.00 in subscriptions and approximately $350.00 in commissions earned for the Settlement School. I believe it helps to figure a goal toward which to work. Our chairman keeps a card file of subscribers, also a file by months of subscriptions coming due, and systematically calls these subscribers, suggesting to them new magazines they would enjoy, special rates on magazines, etc. Many excellent suggestions for selling are given each year in the annual report in the September ARROW. Magazines make excellent gifts which are enjoyed throughout the year. Surely every II (I) has one non-II cl) friend who will gladly allow us to place his or her subscriptions. Why not ask? You are not asking for money which would not be spent anyway in just this manner. A friend of our family who used to give liquor at Christmas to his business and personal friends changed to magazines and for several years has placed the subscriptions through our club. Last 62 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW year he turned in 17 subscriptions to Life and two to Fortune. Each year our club holds a Settlement School tea at which goods from the Arrowcraft Shop are displayed and sold. This is held early in November. A table is always devoted to magazine subscriptions. This serves both as a convenience and a reminder. Mrs. Barber's husband made a beautiful poster for the table last year, having titles from many popular magazines pasted along one side as they would appear in a magazine rack. KEEP THEM 'LAST FOUNDERS' DAY the Chicago South Alumnae Club decided that rather than feast themselves at a luxurious hotel for perhaps two dollars and a half each, they would do something for someone else and still hold all the friendship and fraternity spirit so much a part of Founders' Day celebrations. Their happy solution was a "Settlement School Book Tea" held at the home of one of their members, to which contributions were brought. (They had hinted that a dollar each would be most satisfactory, but members gave as their budgets warranted.) From this wartime Founders' Day, Chicago South was able to order fifty books from a list compiled by Miss May K. Duncan, head of the department of elementary education of the University of Kentucky, as selections which would be beneficial to our Settlement School elementary grade library. Can't you just see the shining faces of our Gatlinburg youngsters when Miss Margaret Burchfield, Settlement School librarian, shows them the new books on the children's shelves at the Grace Coolidge library? Other donors this past year included the Boston Alumnae Club, whose check for twenty-five dollars provided the addition of much needed reference books; and individual members who sent down forty-three books, of which nineteen were welcome new volumes on science. The library is not entirely dependent on contributions, as library fees of twenty-five cents a semester from each high-school student plus fines of two cents a day for books held over two weeks, brought a revenue of over seventy dollars last year. Much of this was needed to replace standard high school requirements that had finally reached the discard stage after continuous usage over a period of years. The Grace Coolidge library is housed in a large room in the High School building, and is open for students three hours a day, which is all of the time it is not being used by Miss Burchfield as a class-room for English and Spanish, a regrettable condition brought on by crowded quarters. Not only are the students hungry for new books, but ade (Don't you think all husbands of magazine chairmen deserve a vote of thanks for their patience and help the many phone interruptions at meal time and their help in getting subscriptions sent in, etc.) This is very satisfying work as we have such definite results to show for our efforts. The opportunity is here for every alumnae club. Each II must do a little work and every chairman a great deal." EADING! quate reference work in the classes of our Settlement School High School demands a substantial increase in volumes for all courses. The first need for the Settlement School library is to build it up for the use of our own students. It is one department of the school which, while meeting the minimum state requirements, will not hold that standard unless continued replacements are made and new books added. The second need or perhaps a dream, but a very realistic and worthwhile dream is to b,lild the number of books to the point where package libraries may be formed and loaned for definite periods of time to the nearby communities. Through this service II B c can extend its area of influence and bring joy and education to people eager for more and better reading. While you alumna members are checking your book-shelves for donations to the U.S.O. and army and navy camps, don't forget our own "defense project" in Gatlinburg, and remember to send all the volumes that might be of value to grade or high school students there. Address them to the librarian, Miss Margaret Burchfield, II B Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tenn. She will paste a II B (I) bookplate in the front of each volume, bearing your name and the date received. Or send a copy of your favorite book so that others may share your pleasure in reading it! Or, should you have too many favorites to choose from, pick a volume from one of the lists available through the Little Pigeon news editor, and order it sent to Grace Coolidge library. Perhaps your alumnm club might like to have a Book Tea or a Book Day this year, as a supplement to the regular Settlement School projects (sale of Arrow-craft goods and regular financial contributions to the general Settlement School funds) so vital to the continuance of our endeavors to build for the staunch mountain people of Tennessee a world that is truly American. NlILDRED ODELL SALE Editor, News From Little Pigeon Committee ep rts COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION T HE most interesting news of the year, concerning extension, has been the granting of a charter to II E at DePauw University by the unanimous vote of Grand Council and the chapters in the Province. Due to the postponement of the 1942 Convention, II 1 E was unable to submit its petition for the charter to Convention, the permission for which had been previously announced. The committee on extension wishes to congratulate our newest chapter and tell them how proud we are of the splendid showing they have made during this year of colonization. So in Indiana Epsilon is added a chapter fully worthy of II B cl). All inquiries have been met with cordial re sponse but to date nothing of interest has developed. Inquiries have come from A Sorority at American University, Washington, D.C.; from A A M Sorority at Massachusetts State, Amherst; from a group at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; and from the Dean at Arkansas State College, Jonesboro, Arkansas. My sincere appreciation to Miss Onken and Mrs. Finger for their assistance since my very recent appointment to chairmanship of the committee. Respectfully submitted, MILDRED BOWERS BALIMAN COMMITTEE ON T ANSFERS \ THE committee on transfers has used the same procedure as in the past few years. Chapter correspondence secretaries have reported transfers at the beginning of the school year by filling out two introductory transfer blanks: one for the chap-ter on the campus to which the girls concerned is transferring and one for the transfer chairman. After October 15, the date when the above report is listed as being due on the official calendar, this committee sent letters to all corresponding secretaries reminding them all that they should be cordial to the new Pi Phis on their campuses and urging those who had not sent in their xeports to do so at once. In the fall, letters were also sent to Province Presidents asking their cooperation with this committee by seeing during their visits with the chap ters that the transfers were being shown all possible consideration. Advisory board members in charge of transfers were asked to help where there were several transfers on the same campus by holding regular monthly meetings with those girls. All transfers received letters explaining what they might expect of the new chapters, what the general practice is regarding affiliation and what is expected of them in regard to the national organization and the local group. This year there were still more transfers than in the past few years. Eighty-six girls went from forty chapters to forty-one. Texas A headed the list with ten transfers on its campus. Illinois E had eight and both North Carolina A and Iowa Z had six. Thirteen chapters failed to report. SANCHA KILBOURN GARVEY HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE T HE Holt House Committee has carried on the work of restoration and partial furnishing as planned. Last fall some furnishings were installed downstairs and in the hostess living room and bed room. Planting was done at the front of the house. Mrs. C. C. Cary of Newton, Iowa, is hostess at Holt House greeting visitors and helping the active girls or alumnae with entertaining. Last October 17 and 18 the Pi Phis of Monmouth held open house for townspeople and Monmouth College alumna back for "homecoming." There were several hundred guests. Products of the Settlement School were displayed and many articles were sold. The chapter at Monmouth gave a rushing party and held initiation at the house. In order to make the house more complete and therefore more useful the committee hopes to complete soon furnishing of the Founders' Room, the Powder Room, and a guest bed room. This bed room would be used by visiting members of the fraternity or by parents visiting students of Mon-mouth College. It is hoped we can buy some china and plated flat silver. Holt House is now open to members of the fraternity and their friends who wish to visit it. It is available to clubs and chapters for meetings or entertaining. 63 The Holt House Committee appreciates the interest and generosity of chapters clubs and individuals. The committee wishes to thank the members of Grand Council and the Province Presidents and Province Vice-Presidents for their help and co-operation.

        48 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 1. Pi Phi alum= continue their effort to sell Arrowcraft products. 2. If the traveling public still buy in our two local shops. (This we know will suffer because of curtailment of tires.) 3. If Wage and Hour regulations upon hand looming in the home do not create a cost increase impossible to accommodate. Arrowcraft was "in the red" for many years as Pi Phi strove to rehabilitate the mountain people and this was considered a profitable procedure, our worthy contribution to human betterment. A third question often asked is "What help do we receive from Government agencies ?" The educational system receives financial help as follows: County 1. Elementary Teachers' salaries are paid to them directly by the County. This sum does not appear on our budget, either in income or disbursement. 2. Rent for Elementary School building of $1,000.00 per year. (Additional cost of maintenance and repairs is paid by Pi Phi.) 3 Some School supplies and books State and Smith-Hughes Fund 1. Three-fourths of High School Teachers' salaries. Smith-Hughes provides part salary for certain vocational courses such as agriculture and home economics. The State allows $500.00 annually for adult weaving instruction. The Health Center receives from the State Health Department serums for certain required vaccinations and injections. Regarding other governmental agencies: 1. We were able to get a part time music teacher this current year through the Works Progress Administration. This was canceled in January when all such service was discontinued by government order. 2. Several adult trade instruction classes were established under the Defense Training authority. No so called "W.P.A." funds were or are rated by the community for services such as are offered at the School other than the aforementioned music assistance (now non-existent). Often the question is asked "Why do we not rate financial assistance from certain well known Foundations ?" The answer is "We are rated as a Foundation by other Foundations. As such, we do not quality for their assistance. However, the Committee is hopeful of getting certain "gift" assistance to fulfill specified needs such as a library of fine records, scores, and machine for music appreciation community pro-gram." We are making an exhaustive study to determine just what .classification will attract other such supplementary assistance. We have the attention and sincere interest of three officials of the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. We welcome further Pi Phi help to coordinate our requests. As to further Health Center assistance we are informed by two sources of factual information, State and County, and by a national expert in governmental budgeting, that there is no possible fund available to underwrite the educational health service through which Pi Phi has raised the whole health status of a large area. There is still only one County nurse in our entire County and even this has been irregular. I invite your study and understanding of the following outline of Pi Phi sources of income which have gradually suggested themselves as sound permanent methods to serve to stabilize our project, give security, and insure in a measure our ability to meet our assumed responsibility. 1. Income from Pi Beta Phi. General Active Chapters Alumnie Clubs Individual gifts Bequests Commissions from Magazine Agency Interest on Endowment Fund Interest on Savings Account Contributions specified for furnishings or improvements Miscellaneous (Principally insurance proceeds) School Income Small fees from Agriculture Home Economics and certain Health Services Farm Products sold to outside Farm Products sold to our kitchen Staff living fees. As you study this brief analysis there is one im portant fact to take into consideration, the running administrative budget for maintenance and upkeep is comparable with that of any home for utilities, service, repairs, replacements, etc., and is separate from the teachers' salaries and supplies of the educational program. You will see that we are providing the background while State and County are largely supplying the educational program. It is an accepted fact that Schools, Libraries, and Health Services are never self-supporting. They are either endowed or supported by public or private funds. Our project will always be to large extent a welfare project, in which we supplement the basic program, as offered by a willing community, with the advantages of a sponsored program in health, education and vocational guidance. This same need for public spirited service is evidenced in every large city as well as every small community and it is expressed by privately or publicly endowed hospitals, baby clinics, schools, libraries, health centers of every description. Every public spirited Pi Phi could designate a definite need in her community, a vital one. But long ago Pi Phi became the self-elected sponsors of a definite community. From us these really worthy Anglo-Saxon people have received every inspiration for upbuilding of body and soul. To us this community will always look for guidance, inspiration and all cultural development. As they willingly and pridefully accept certain responsibilities, we are able in turn to expand our influence into an ever growing circle. As fast as Pi Phi donors wish we will grow into a center of great national educational consequence. Our facilities, our background, our past integrity, makes possible our ability to meet whatever great need the future brings to our firmly established center in the Smokies. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 To speak of a possible present emergency opportunity we of committee are seriously mindful that added burdens may rightfully come to us. Just what, how, or when, we cannot predict now. But from patriotic and loyal Pi Phis everywhere we welcome suggestions if you see a practical opportunity to increase our service. Several ideas have already been discussed whereby we might serve the cause of youth in war time. In anticipating some additional war effort we have established contact with the several agencies in Washington under whom we may be called upon to serve. Through the War Production Board's several textile departments and its Small Business Bureau we are endeavoring to find what needed articles or fabrics can be made under our supervision. Through this means we hope to stabilize the economic status of our community and use to the fullest every bit of man and woman power. We have contacted the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor through Dr. Martha Elliott and her associate, Miss Ruth Taylor, to get first hand information regarding the government's plans for service to evacuated children or families. Through Dr. Howard McCluskey, whose responsibility in the Office of Civilian Defense is the coordinating of war efforts of organization we are promised assistance that we may find our proper field. We are studying the possibilities of additional use for our facilities in the field of occupational therapy if by chance any or all of the Gatlinburg hotels should be needed for hospitalization. At the suggestion of the National Office of Civilian Defense we are contacting the regional and State offices of Civilian Defense as a means of keeping aware of needs. It is our hope and expectation that we will be ready for any war emergency service that may come to Gatlinburg to command the unified patriotic effort of thirty-three thousand Pi Phis. Respectively submitted, Settlement School Committee. ETHEL COPP, Chairman, EPO T OF THE *I\ ECTO OF THE PI ETA PHIl SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 194142 To Grand Council of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Settlement School Committee, and the Fraternity: F oR every Pi Phi who holds a cherished place in her heart for the Settlement School, there is every reason to be proud of the year just past. Highlights that stand out are the establishing and development of the Arts and Crafts program in the school; the reorganization of the Health Center to meet changing community needs; the fall visit of Dean Taylor of the University of Kentucky with his valuable survey; the completion of the new Stuart Dormitory for boys; and just this last May the annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee here at the School, which is like having five fine friends and counselors arrive at one time to help solve problems and guide policies for the best interests of Pi Phi and our School. There's a Rip Van Winkle quiet over the school grounds now that makes it hard to picture the tremendous activity of the School year. According to Mr. Fleming's report, we had the largest high school enrollment in the history of the school. Besides the regular classes in English, History, Sociology, Science, Vocational Agriculture and Vocational Home Economics, a new unit of World History was added for the tenth grade, and Spanish for the eleventh grade, Arts and Crafts for Junior and Senior students, as well as classes in first aid and home nursing. Everyone in High School has been active in the physical education program. The Bov's Basketball team was in the District Semi-finals. This year the girls had an intramural basket-ball program as well as a few inter-school games. The Agriculture and Home Economics clubs, the Press Club, and the various other school organizations had a very successful year. The Press Club sponsored the "Pi Phi Paperette" which was a page of school news incorporated in the local Gatlinburg paper. Several Community and school socials have been held in the gymnasium, and the juniors and Seniors each gave a School play. The Seniors raised funds for their trip just before Class Week. They visited Lookout Mountain, Nashville, Mammoth Cave, and Lincoln Memorial University. In the Home Economics department nutrition was stressed and low cost healthful meals were given special attention. Weaving was especially popular with the girls this year and each girl in the junior class wove a knitting bag with an all-over design, and several have woven dresser scarves with small figure inlays such as flowers or initials. The Sophomore class was larger. Two girls worked at each loom, learning each step from the making of the warp, to the threading of the loom and finally the actual weaving. In the sewing project each girl made two garments of her own choice. Two of the girls participated in the Style Show at the University of Tennessee's Open House. Each year of Home Economics is a combination course which includes foods, clothing, personal grooming, home management, child care and other topics. The boys and girls in the third year classes met together for six weeks to study "Problems in Family Living and Home Management" and lively round table discussions were held. A total of forty-eight boys were enrolled in Vocational Agriculture. The course of study for each of these boys is based on farming on the Home Farm, with emphasis being placed on food production for home first and for national defense. National Defense classes were also held and con-ducted for out-of-school youth in the various rural communities. The boys learned blacksmithing and farm machinery repair, wood-working, simple electricity, and auto mechanics. Two evening classes of farmers met and studied problems pertaining to farming and food production, under our agriculture teacher. The new courses now being taught in the Arts and Crafts department include jewelry, Metal Craft, Ceramics, Block Printing, and the Native crafts. The courses are elective for juniors and Seniors and have been very popular. In jewelry, the students studied the fundamental techniques of constructing and decorating rings set with semi-precious stones, sterling silver pins and clips, a 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW combination of copper and brass bracelets and other chains. In Metal work, they constructed plates, ash trays, bowls, lamps and candle-sticks. Laboratory problems in ceramics include the techniques of hand building of animals and figures, wheel throwing, pressing from moulds, slip-casting, glazing and firing of the kiln. The methods of textile deco-ration were also studied, including block-printing, stenciling and tie-dyeing. Several very talented students were discovered in the classes. There were also well-attended adult classes in the evenings. For its first year, genuine progress and great enthusiasm were felt in this part of the school pro-gram. The Elementary School completed an equally successful year under Pern Price, principal. One of the outstanding affairs of the year was the children's operetta, which was the very best the school has ever had. The children were beautifully trained, the costumes were clever, and the entire performance a credit to the teachers and Mr. Price who worked with the children so patiently. The story was "Peter Rabbit" so that it is not hard to visualize the cunning songs and costumes. The Movie Projector, purchased from gift funds, has been a most valuable addition to the entire school program. Educational, as well as films for entertainment have been shown regularly and the coming year promises to see it used even more frequently as we .work in conjunction with the government showing of films for defense. The report of the Health Center has special interest as it reflected the changing, yet continued very important program. Health study, First Aid Classes, Nutrition, Home Nursing, all are stressed. Mrs. Chalmers is combining a full teaching schedule with her nursing duties. In the High School all who could arrange their time to take the shortened First Aid course, did so. Adult classes in Home Nursing at the Health Center completed their studies and qualified for their certificates. With the emphasis on health instruction, preventive service in the community was not allowed to suffer, and the totals for the year were about the same as the preceding one. There was a considerable drop in the number of calls, and community service was confined to demonstrations of nursing procedures, practical instruction and strictly emergency measures. Inspections and inoculations in the School, and corrective work was done as usual. The Health Center received gifts from the local chapter of the Red Cross, and from many of the alumni clubs, all of which were very much needed and deeply appreciated. Many of these things are for the "Loan Closet" and are in frequent use, being gratefully borrowed and carefully returned. Being a year of "transition" the Health Center passed through an eventful year in which those services which we have outgrown have been eliminated, and through greater concentration on health instruction the valuable service of the Health Center will continue to assist the community toward better and safer living. From the Arrowcraft Shop comes the report that during the past year, one hundred and thirty-two alumme clubs, nine active chapters, twenty-three shops and individuals too numerous to mention have sold Arrowcraft merchandise. One of the most successful sales of the year was handled by the Boston Club at the New England Flower Show which this year had as one of its themes "The Wildflowers of the Smokies." The sales at the Arrowcraft Booth were over $2,000. One of the most important pieces of publicity of the year, was the June number of House and Garden which featured the handicrafts of the whole Southern Appalachian region. Our own "Aunt Lizzie's" photograph, as well as many others were taken here in Gatlinburg under Mrs. Snow's guidance. Arrowcraft has received many, many inquiries as a result of this publicity. The Fall Guild meeting was held in Berea, Kentucky, with five members of the school staff at-tending. The spring meeting was 'held in Knoxville, where the invitation was extended to the Guild to hold their 1942 meeting in Gatlinburg and we hope to make it outstanding. The meeting of the stock-holders of Southern Highlanders, Inc., of which Arrowcraft is a member, was held in Knoxville following the Guild meeting. It is interesting to note that Miss Jessie Harris, Director of Home Economics of the University of Tennessee, and our Asheville initiate, was elected a Director for the coming year. The weavers for the Shop had more work than ever before last year. There was a total of ninety-eight weavers on the books and there were eighty-seven working at one time just before Christmas. The Weaving meetings have been well attended. With the cost of living increasing for them as well as everyone else, there are many families where the weaving is needed more than ever. The reports of Arrowcraft, Health Center, and Sch6ol show a unity of effort in carrying out the ideals of the fraternity in constructive aid and service in this community. If war emergency needs make demands upon us, it will be the desire of the entire staff to meet these demands, and to continue to give their very best efforts to the School, which is just as dear to everyone in Gatlinburg as it is to every Pi Phi! Respectfully submitted, ELIZABETH COMSTOCK PECK, Director, Pi Beta Phi School. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORT ON AUDIT OF Ti'EASUI.E 'S ACCOUNTS YEA ENDED JUNE 30, 1942, 51 August 3, 1942 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Bice of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1942. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the subsidiary records kept for the School and the Arrowcraft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1942, and the income and expenses for the fiscal year then ended, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from Club and Chapter contributions, which are shown in detail in Schedule 3-a, and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the Treasurer. The cash balance at Milwaukee was verified by us. The endowment securities and cash, except cash in transit, which we verified, were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's report was accepted without further verification except that we checked the accounting made of changes in investments and the income from securities and found in it good order. COMMENTS Cash Balances The cash balances at June 30, 1942, exclusive of cash with the endowment Trustees or in transit, consisted of the following: Milwaukee Account: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's checking account $ 7,922.97 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank School check ing account 793:45 Sevier County Bank Dormitory building account 79.06 Sevier County Bank Arts and Crafts acount 223.39 Gatlinburg Arrowcraft Accounts: Sevier County Bank Checking ac count 6,814.50 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 2,986.64 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 4,218.46 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 4,780.04 Petty cash funds at Gatlinburg 45.00 Total $27,863.51 As indicated above, we verified the balances in Milwaukee accounts while those at Sevierville or Knoxville were verified by Homer K. Jones and Company according to their report. The above balances do not include magazine agency receipts in the custody of Mrs. C. M. Purdunn who reported a balance due the Settlement School on May 15, 1942 of $3,216.27. In accordance with previous practice the magazine agency receipts taken into account by the Settlement School Treasurer for the fiscal year consisted only of the remittances from Mrs. Purdunn which totaled $3,000.00. Accounts Receivable The Arrowcraft accounts receivable at June 30, 1942 amounted to $6,710.25 and were due principally from alumni clubs. These accounts, which we did not verify, were listed in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company and were $162.02 greater than those at the close of the previous year. Fixed Assets Expenditures for additions to buildings, equipment and landscaping amounted to $12,480.37 for the year under ieview. Included in this total is $9,122.94 for the new Stuart Dormitory and $1,703.12 for new equipment for this dormitory, a total of $10,826.06. As indicated above, the expenditures for the new dormitory were evidently not included in the Gatlinburg audit. All additions to the property accounts are shown in Schedule 2. It may be noted that the old Stuart Cottage which was razed was removed from the books and its estimated book value of $450.00 ($2,011.02 less depreciation of $1,561.02) less salvage receipts of $25.00, was charged off to expense. Depreciation of the buildings and equipment, computed at rates used in the past, totaled $3,259.04 as shown in the same schedule. Lists sent to us indicated that most of the equipment at Gatlinburg had been inventoried at June 30, 1942 and it seemed advisable to enter the inventory values on the records in lieu of the depreciated book values. However, examination of these inventories revealed that at least the machinery and equipment in the vocational school building (industrial building) had not been listed or valued so no change was made on the records. In your particular case we believe that it would be preferable to have the present inventory values of equipment on the books rather than those now shown, if the inventories can be completed. Endowment The only changes in the endowment principal for the year under review consisted of the appropriation of three-fourths of the chapter contributions, or $1,307.75, offset to a slight extent by losses on securities of $62.03, the fund showing a net increase of $1,245.72. No amortization of bond premiums is charged against income by the Trustee although the securities on hand cost $1,710.05 more than par value. However, the market value of the securities at June 30, 1942 was $132.51 more than cost as shown in the list in Schedule 1 according to the Trustee's report. 52 .THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Current Income and Expenses The expenses of the Settlement School exceeded operating income by $6,977.50 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $12,578.43. The Settlement School expenses included depreciation of $3,259.04, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores but which is not charged to this department. The Arrowcraft net income was $1,524.65 less than that of the previous year although the sales of $54,651.28 were approximately the same as those for 1940-1941. The sales at the Mountain View Hotel which are ordinarily quite profitable fell off somewhat with a decrease in gross profit of $656.18. An accounting of the net income is presented as follows: Net income of Arrowcraft division . . . . $12,578.43 Deficit in operation of Settlement School 6,977.50 Net income $ 5,600.93 Accounted for as follows: Increase in Arrowcraft inventories $ 4,004.41 Increase in ArroWcraft receivables Increase in farm live-stock Expenditures for build ing and equipment $12,480.37 Less depreciation for year 3,259.04 $ 9,221.33 Less Stuart Cottage charged off 450.00 8,771,33 Increase in prepaid in surance 505.51 $13,594.27 Less decrease in cash balances and cash items on hand 9,301.09 $ 4,293,18 Transfer of funds to endowment principal 1,307.75 Total as above $ 5,600.93 It may be observed that the Arrowcraft inventories have been increasing each year and that a substantial portion of the net income is invested in the finished goods and materials on hand. This is probably a normal situation but in any case the insurance coverage on these inventories should be carefully watched. Respectfully submitted, REILLY, PENNER AN!)

We break our rule of "reports only" in the September ARROW to print the following pages, which should be of assistance in planning help for the Settlement School for the coming year. EFENSE AT GATLIN 16 ,e) U G THIS is war! Every American is giving wholeheartedly of his or her time, money, and effort to promote worthwhile projects in vital war production, or in equally important measures to maintain and protect those vital "defense projects" that aim to hold fast for the future the fundamental rights and privileges of American citizenship. Such a defense project is our II B Settlement School at Gatlinburg. If we are to hold the ground so painstakingly won by loyal Pi Beta Phis in the past; if we are to protect our investment in the Smokies; if we are to preserve a source of revenue for people who have no other means of livelihood; if we are to retain the faith and friendship of the mountain people who have come to respect and admire II B (I) not because they know our inner joy of member-ship but because they have seen the benefits of our altruism we, members of II B , must make this coming year of 1942-1943 as glorious a record in contributions to the Settlement School as any in our history. To do this may be harder than in the past, but the satisfaction of our accomplishment will also be greater! It is the first task of the Settlement School Committee to plan wisely so that expenses may be held within the expected income; and our second task is to help you carry on your regular projects for the benefit of the Settlement School that this in-come may be great enough to cover the necessary expenses of such an enterprise. Settlement School income from Pi Beta Phis comes largely from three sources: sale of Arrow craft, contributions from active chapters and alumna clubs, and magazine commissions. You, in your individual clubs, can best decide what means to use for the raising of your customary contributions. In this issue you will End suggestions for your magazine sales set-up from the club which has ranked first for the past six successive years in amount of commissions earned. And the new articles added this year to our fine traditional Arrow-craft will insure your Settlement School sale being a success once more. Do you or your friends have sweethearts or husbands in the Service? Of course, you do. Then did you know you could secure black and olive drab neckties of our lovely Arrowcraft quality to go with their regulation uniforms? Or is He in the Air Corps? Then he will appreciate one of the wool scarfs for men, or perhaps the extra long "ski scarf" which is a yard and a third long and can be wrapped around several times to amply protect his throat and chest when he flies in high altitudes. The Royal Standard Chapter, Daughters of the British Empire ordered six dozen of our Frozen Mist scarfs for sale to departing aviators and aviation cadets. All aviators wear some sort of scarf why not be sure that every "Pi Phi Aviator" has an Arrowcraft scarf ? Those showers for II B I, brides make a perfect occasion for Arrowcraft towels; and think of the joy you would bring if each member of the chapter would give a place mat or napkin of Arrowcraft design to complete a luncheon set. =IONS TO AR OWCRAFT s\, THE new items? Here is the latest information from Ethel Snow, our capable Manager of Arrowcraft. First there will be three new scarfs, sparkling in color and developing the theme of last year's favorite Buckeye scarf. The "Buckeye," you re-member, was that lovely brown, brick red and white with just a touch of green in a broken plaid, designed by Winogene Redding, in charge of the weaving at our Settlement School, .and named for its portrayal of the colors in the Tennessee buck-eyes. The new ones will be in different combinations: one a new soft blue and chocolate brown, with white and a deeper blue; another a bright THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 61 red, green, yellow and black one; and the third one of lovely oriental colors. For campus and sport wear the McArthur square should prove popular, twenty-seven inches square of the traditional green, black and yellow plaid of the McArthur clan. If these should not suit your coloring, there will be two other plaids to choose from, all grand for those sweaters every college girl owns. Did you know strawberries were in season? They strayed to ladies' lingerie this year, but Arrowcraft has brought them back to the breakfast table in a dead-white doilie displaying two luscious strawberries woven in the corner. Very reasonable, these should prove welcome additions to the Arrow sets in natural linen and white, and the "utility" sets with bright borders or in conservative all white. And you will need new knitting bags for war-time knitters ! A new cylinder bag (popularly called the feed-bag) has proved a good seller at the Arrowcraft shop this summer. They look jaunty slung over the shoulder, and can be used as a carryall for First Aid notebooks, as well. A new (to me, at least) bedjacket was on display at Arrowcraft Shop last summer with a clever high neckline, and in heavenly blue, pale pink or white. They can also be secured in orchid, yellow or green. Your convalescent friends would appreciate them! Mrs, Snow also tells us there will be at least six new neckties to provide Father, Son or Friend with a new one for Christmas (although these will cost you a little more this year with war prices on wool) and that there will still be quantities of shawls, all linen towels, and a limited supply of all wool yardage and wall hangings. Speaking of shawls, don't fail to ask for some of the lovely ones woven of rich deep red, blue, green and yellow, the squares so blended and arranged that folding produces three entirely different color effects. Or you might like the gossamer white, or a pastel, for evening wear with it over your head and just a corner turned back, the fringe frames your face and neck to add allure to the simplest frock. By the time your fall order is placed, the newly . appointed Craft Advisory Committee, whom we shall introduce to you next issue, will have selected additional new items for production. Aren't you anxious to see them all and show them to your II B (1, Settlement School friends? HOW TO WIN FIRST PLACE IN MAGAZINE SALES COMMISSIONS! THE Denver Alumnae Club has consistently held first place for the largest amount of magazine commissions since 1937. This is a record of which they may be justly proud, and the story of their methods should prove an inspiration to all other alumni club magazine chairmen. Such a story is here presented by Dorothy Andrews Thebus, Colorado B, Denver's magazine chairman from 1930 to 1937. "It was in 1930, I believe, that I was asked to be magazine chairman for the Denver Alumnae Club. I had a small son, and since it was hard to leave home very often for meetings, I was glad to find I could help while remaining at home. It is a real pleasure to sell people something that they already know and like. It soon became apparent to me what wonderful opportunities for service to our Settlement School lay in this field for every alumnae club. I observed with envy the clubs whose names appeared among the first eight listed in the annual reports and thought how proud I should be if the Denver Alumnx Club would be mentioned. I was very happy when in 1932 we placed seventh and three years later were in sixth place. In 1937 I had the pleasure of seeing Denver heading the list. As much of the work of the magazine chair-man comes in November and December which is also the time of preparing for Christmas, I felt in fairness to my young son and daughter I must give up this work. It was with real regret that I asked for someone to take my place in 1937. I had be-come acquainted by phone with so many of our alumna~ and have missed my periodic chats with them. Mrs. Kenneth Snodgrass (with three children) held this position for the next two years, keeping Denver in first place. Mrs. Ralph Johnson followed (she also has small children) retaining first place and in 1940-41 reached a high for Denver of $228.00 in commissions and also second place in the per capita rating. Mrs. W. Turrell Barber, (Georgia Marrs, Colorado B '40) is chairman this year and I think has reported a new high for Denver for 1941-42. When one observes the annual magazine reports and notices that many of the smaller alumnm clubs are mentioned as highest in the "per capita" rating, it makes one realize how much the larger clubs can do with intensive work. Take, e.g., a city in which there are 300 alumna', not necessarily active in the alumni club. Nearly everyone spends at least $5.00 per year on magazines. Many spend much more. If the club could average $5.00 per member, this would be $1,500.00 in subscriptions and approximately $350.00 in commissions earned for the Settlement School. I believe it helps to figure a goal toward which to work. Our chairman keeps a card file of subscribers, also a file by months of subscriptions coming due, and systematically calls these subscribers, suggesting to them new magazines they would enjoy, special rates on magazines, etc. Many excellent suggestions for selling are given each year in the annual report in the September ARROW. Magazines make excellent gifts which are enjoyed throughout the year. Surely every II (I) has one non-II cl) friend who will gladly allow us to place his or her subscriptions. Why not ask? You are not asking for money which would not be spent anyway in just this manner. A friend of our family who used to give liquor at Christmas to his business and personal friends changed to magazines and for several years has placed the subscriptions through our club. Last 62 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW year he turned in 17 subscriptions to Life and two to Fortune. Each year our club holds a Settlement School tea at which goods from the Arrowcraft Shop are displayed and sold. This is held early in November. A table is always devoted to magazine subscriptions. This serves both as a convenience and a reminder. Mrs. Barber's husband made a beautiful poster for the table last year, having titles from many popular magazines pasted along one side as they would appear in a magazine rack. KEEP THEM 'LAST FOUNDERS' DAY the Chicago South Alumnae Club decided that rather than feast themselves at a luxurious hotel for perhaps two dollars and a half each, they would do something for someone else and still hold all the friendship and fraternity spirit so much a part of Founders' Day celebrations. Their happy solution was a "Settlement School Book Tea" held at the home of one of their members, to which contributions were brought. (They had hinted that a dollar each would be most satisfactory, but members gave as their budgets warranted.) From this wartime Founders' Day, Chicago South was able to order fifty books from a list compiled by Miss May K. Duncan, head of the department of elementary education of the University of Kentucky, as selections which would be beneficial to our Settlement School elementary grade library. Can't you just see the shining faces of our Gatlinburg youngsters when Miss Margaret Burchfield, Settlement School librarian, shows them the new books on the children's shelves at the Grace Coolidge library? Other donors this past year included the Boston Alumnae Club, whose check for twenty-five dollars provided the addition of much needed reference books; and individual members who sent down forty-three books, of which nineteen were welcome new volumes on science. The library is not entirely dependent on contributions, as library fees of twenty-five cents a semester from each high-school student plus fines of two cents a day for books held over two weeks, brought a revenue of over seventy dollars last year. Much of this was needed to replace standard high school requirements that had finally reached the discard stage after continuous usage over a period of years. The Grace Coolidge library is housed in a large room in the High School building, and is open for students three hours a day, which is all of the time it is not being used by Miss Burchfield as a class-room for English and Spanish, a regrettable condition brought on by crowded quarters. Not only are the students hungry for new books, but ade (Don't you think all husbands of magazine chairmen deserve a vote of thanks for their patience and help the many phone interruptions at meal time and their help in getting subscriptions sent in, etc.) This is very satisfying work as we have such definite results to show for our efforts. The opportunity is here for every alumnae club. Each II must do a little work and every chairman a great deal." EADING! quate reference work in the classes of our Settlement School High School demands a substantial increase in volumes for all courses. The first need for the Settlement School library is to build it up for the use of our own students. It is one department of the school which, while meeting the minimum state requirements, will not hold that standard unless continued replacements are made and new books added. The second need or perhaps a dream, but a very realistic and worthwhile dream is to b,lild the number of books to the point where package libraries may be formed and loaned for definite periods of time to the nearby communities. Through this service II B c can extend its area of influence and bring joy and education to people eager for more and better reading. While you alumna members are checking your book-shelves for donations to the U.S.O. and army and navy camps, don't forget our own "defense project" in Gatlinburg, and remember to send all the volumes that might be of value to grade or high school students there. Address them to the librarian, Miss Margaret Burchfield, II B Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tenn. She will paste a II B (I) bookplate in the front of each volume, bearing your name and the date received. Or send a copy of your favorite book so that others may share your pleasure in reading it! Or, should you have too many favorites to choose from, pick a volume from one of the lists available through the Little Pigeon news editor, and order it sent to Grace Coolidge library. Perhaps your alumnm club might like to have a Book Tea or a Book Day this year, as a supplement to the regular Settlement School projects (sale of Arrow-craft goods and regular financial contributions to the general Settlement School funds) so vital to the continuance of our endeavors to build for the staunch mountain people of Tennessee a world that is truly American. NlILDRED ODELL SALE Editor, News From Little Pigeon Committee ep rts COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION T HE most interesting news of the year, concerning extension, has been the granting of a charter to II E at DePauw University by the unanimous vote of Grand Council and the chapters in the Province. Due to the postponement of the 1942 Convention, II 1 E was unable to submit its petition for the charter to Convention, the permission for which had been previously announced. The committee on extension wishes to congratulate our newest chapter and tell them how proud we are of the splendid showing they have made during this year of colonization. So in Indiana Epsilon is added a chapter fully worthy of II B cl). All inquiries have been met with cordial re sponse but to date nothing of interest has developed. Inquiries have come from A Sorority at American University, Washington, D.C.; from A A M Sorority at Massachusetts State, Amherst; from a group at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; and from the Dean at Arkansas State College, Jonesboro, Arkansas. My sincere appreciation to Miss Onken and Mrs. Finger for their assistance since my very recent appointment to chairmanship of the committee. Respectfully submitted, MILDRED BOWERS BALIMAN COMMITTEE ON T ANSFERS \ THE committee on transfers has used the same procedure as in the past few years. Chapter correspondence secretaries have reported transfers at the beginning of the school year by filling out two introductory transfer blanks: one for the chap-ter on the campus to which the girls concerned is transferring and one for the transfer chairman. After October 15, the date when the above report is listed as being due on the official calendar, this committee sent letters to all corresponding secretaries reminding them all that they should be cordial to the new Pi Phis on their campuses and urging those who had not sent in their xeports to do so at once. In the fall, letters were also sent to Province Presidents asking their cooperation with this committee by seeing during their visits with the chap ters that the transfers were being shown all possible consideration. Advisory board members in charge of transfers were asked to help where there were several transfers on the same campus by holding regular monthly meetings with those girls. All transfers received letters explaining what they might expect of the new chapters, what the general practice is regarding affiliation and what is expected of them in regard to the national organization and the local group. This year there were still more transfers than in the past few years. Eighty-six girls went from forty chapters to forty-one. Texas A headed the list with ten transfers on its campus. Illinois E had eight and both North Carolina A and Iowa Z had six. Thirteen chapters failed to report. SANCHA KILBOURN GARVEY HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE T HE Holt House Committee has carried on the work of restoration and partial furnishing as planned. Last fall some furnishings were installed downstairs and in the hostess living room and bed room. Planting was done at the front of the house. Mrs. C. C. Cary of Newton, Iowa, is hostess at Holt House greeting visitors and helping the active girls or alumnae with entertaining. Last October 17 and 18 the Pi Phis of Monmouth held open house for townspeople and Monmouth College alumna back for "homecoming." There were several hundred guests. Products of the Settlement School were displayed and many articles were sold. The chapter at Monmouth gave a rushing party and held initiation at the house. In order to make the house more complete and therefore more useful the committee hopes to complete soon furnishing of the Founders' Room, the Powder Room, and a guest bed room. This bed room would be used by visiting members of the fraternity or by parents visiting students of Mon-mouth College. It is hoped we can buy some china and plated flat silver. Holt House is now open to members of the fraternity and their friends who wish to visit it. It is available to clubs and chapters for meetings or entertaining. 63 The Holt House Committee appreciates the interest and generosity of chapters clubs and individuals. The committee wishes to thank the members of Grand Council and the Province Presidents and Province Vice-Presidents for their help and co-operation.

        50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW combination of copper and brass bracelets and other chains. In Metal work, they constructed plates, ash trays, bowls, lamps and candle-sticks. Laboratory problems in ceramics include the techniques of hand building of animals and figures, wheel throwing, pressing from moulds, slip-casting, glazing and firing of the kiln. The methods of textile deco-ration were also studied, including block-printing, stenciling and tie-dyeing. Several very talented students were discovered in the classes. There were also well-attended adult classes in the evenings. For its first year, genuine progress and great enthusiasm were felt in this part of the school pro-gram. The Elementary School completed an equally successful year under Pern Price, principal. One of the outstanding affairs of the year was the children's operetta, which was the very best the school has ever had. The children were beautifully trained, the costumes were clever, and the entire performance a credit to the teachers and Mr. Price who worked with the children so patiently. The story was "Peter Rabbit" so that it is not hard to visualize the cunning songs and costumes. The Movie Projector, purchased from gift funds, has been a most valuable addition to the entire school program. Educational, as well as films for entertainment have been shown regularly and the coming year promises to see it used even more frequently as we .work in conjunction with the government showing of films for defense. The report of the Health Center has special interest as it reflected the changing, yet continued very important program. Health study, First Aid Classes, Nutrition, Home Nursing, all are stressed. Mrs. Chalmers is combining a full teaching schedule with her nursing duties. In the High School all who could arrange their time to take the shortened First Aid course, did so. Adult classes in Home Nursing at the Health Center completed their studies and qualified for their certificates. With the emphasis on health instruction, preventive service in the community was not allowed to suffer, and the totals for the year were about the same as the preceding one. There was a considerable drop in the number of calls, and community service was confined to demonstrations of nursing procedures, practical instruction and strictly emergency measures. Inspections and inoculations in the School, and corrective work was done as usual. The Health Center received gifts from the local chapter of the Red Cross, and from many of the alumni clubs, all of which were very much needed and deeply appreciated. Many of these things are for the "Loan Closet" and are in frequent use, being gratefully borrowed and carefully returned. Being a year of "transition" the Health Center passed through an eventful year in which those services which we have outgrown have been eliminated, and through greater concentration on health instruction the valuable service of the Health Center will continue to assist the community toward better and safer living. From the Arrowcraft Shop comes the report that during the past year, one hundred and thirty-two alumme clubs, nine active chapters, twenty-three shops and individuals too numerous to mention have sold Arrowcraft merchandise. One of the most successful sales of the year was handled by the Boston Club at the New England Flower Show which this year had as one of its themes "The Wildflowers of the Smokies." The sales at the Arrowcraft Booth were over $2,000. One of the most important pieces of publicity of the year, was the June number of House and Garden which featured the handicrafts of the whole Southern Appalachian region. Our own "Aunt Lizzie's" photograph, as well as many others were taken here in Gatlinburg under Mrs. Snow's guidance. Arrowcraft has received many, many inquiries as a result of this publicity. The Fall Guild meeting was held in Berea, Kentucky, with five members of the school staff at-tending. The spring meeting was 'held in Knoxville, where the invitation was extended to the Guild to hold their 1942 meeting in Gatlinburg and we hope to make it outstanding. The meeting of the stock-holders of Southern Highlanders, Inc., of which Arrowcraft is a member, was held in Knoxville following the Guild meeting. It is interesting to note that Miss Jessie Harris, Director of Home Economics of the University of Tennessee, and our Asheville initiate, was elected a Director for the coming year. The weavers for the Shop had more work than ever before last year. There was a total of ninety-eight weavers on the books and there were eighty-seven working at one time just before Christmas. The Weaving meetings have been well attended. With the cost of living increasing for them as well as everyone else, there are many families where the weaving is needed more than ever. The reports of Arrowcraft, Health Center, and Sch6ol show a unity of effort in carrying out the ideals of the fraternity in constructive aid and service in this community. If war emergency needs make demands upon us, it will be the desire of the entire staff to meet these demands, and to continue to give their very best efforts to the School, which is just as dear to everyone in Gatlinburg as it is to every Pi Phi! Respectfully submitted, ELIZABETH COMSTOCK PECK, Director, Pi Beta Phi School. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORT ON AUDIT OF Ti'EASUI.E 'S ACCOUNTS YEA ENDED JUNE 30, 1942, 51 August 3, 1942 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Bice of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1942. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the subsidiary records kept for the School and the Arrowcraft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1942, and the income and expenses for the fiscal year then ended, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from Club and Chapter contributions, which are shown in detail in Schedule 3-a, and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the Treasurer. The cash balance at Milwaukee was verified by us. The endowment securities and cash, except cash in transit, which we verified, were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's report was accepted without further verification except that we checked the accounting made of changes in investments and the income from securities and found in it good order. COMMENTS Cash Balances The cash balances at June 30, 1942, exclusive of cash with the endowment Trustees or in transit, consisted of the following: Milwaukee Account: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's checking account $ 7,922.97 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank School check ing account 793:45 Sevier County Bank Dormitory building account 79.06 Sevier County Bank Arts and Crafts acount 223.39 Gatlinburg Arrowcraft Accounts: Sevier County Bank Checking ac count 6,814.50 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 2,986.64 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 4,218.46 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 4,780.04 Petty cash funds at Gatlinburg 45.00 Total $27,863.51 As indicated above, we verified the balances in Milwaukee accounts while those at Sevierville or Knoxville were verified by Homer K. Jones and Company according to their report. The above balances do not include magazine agency receipts in the custody of Mrs. C. M. Purdunn who reported a balance due the Settlement School on May 15, 1942 of $3,216.27. In accordance with previous practice the magazine agency receipts taken into account by the Settlement School Treasurer for the fiscal year consisted only of the remittances from Mrs. Purdunn which totaled $3,000.00. Accounts Receivable The Arrowcraft accounts receivable at June 30, 1942 amounted to $6,710.25 and were due principally from alumni clubs. These accounts, which we did not verify, were listed in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company and were $162.02 greater than those at the close of the previous year. Fixed Assets Expenditures for additions to buildings, equipment and landscaping amounted to $12,480.37 for the year under ieview. Included in this total is $9,122.94 for the new Stuart Dormitory and $1,703.12 for new equipment for this dormitory, a total of $10,826.06. As indicated above, the expenditures for the new dormitory were evidently not included in the Gatlinburg audit. All additions to the property accounts are shown in Schedule 2. It may be noted that the old Stuart Cottage which was razed was removed from the books and its estimated book value of $450.00 ($2,011.02 less depreciation of $1,561.02) less salvage receipts of $25.00, was charged off to expense. Depreciation of the buildings and equipment, computed at rates used in the past, totaled $3,259.04 as shown in the same schedule. Lists sent to us indicated that most of the equipment at Gatlinburg had been inventoried at June 30, 1942 and it seemed advisable to enter the inventory values on the records in lieu of the depreciated book values. However, examination of these inventories revealed that at least the machinery and equipment in the vocational school building (industrial building) had not been listed or valued so no change was made on the records. In your particular case we believe that it would be preferable to have the present inventory values of equipment on the books rather than those now shown, if the inventories can be completed. Endowment The only changes in the endowment principal for the year under review consisted of the appropriation of three-fourths of the chapter contributions, or $1,307.75, offset to a slight extent by losses on securities of $62.03, the fund showing a net increase of $1,245.72. No amortization of bond premiums is charged against income by the Trustee although the securities on hand cost $1,710.05 more than par value. However, the market value of the securities at June 30, 1942 was $132.51 more than cost as shown in the list in Schedule 1 according to the Trustee's report. 52 .THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Current Income and Expenses The expenses of the Settlement School exceeded operating income by $6,977.50 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $12,578.43. The Settlement School expenses included depreciation of $3,259.04, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores but which is not charged to this department. The Arrowcraft net income was $1,524.65 less than that of the previous year although the sales of $54,651.28 were approximately the same as those for 1940-1941. The sales at the Mountain View Hotel which are ordinarily quite profitable fell off somewhat with a decrease in gross profit of $656.18. An accounting of the net income is presented as follows: Net income of Arrowcraft division . . . . $12,578.43 Deficit in operation of Settlement School 6,977.50 Net income $ 5,600.93 Accounted for as follows: Increase in Arrowcraft inventories $ 4,004.41 Increase in ArroWcraft receivables Increase in farm live-stock Expenditures for build ing and equipment $12,480.37 Less depreciation for year 3,259.04 $ 9,221.33 Less Stuart Cottage charged off 450.00 8,771,33 Increase in prepaid in surance 505.51 $13,594.27 Less decrease in cash balances and cash items on hand 9,301.09 $ 4,293,18 Transfer of funds to endowment principal 1,307.75 Total as above $ 5,600.93 It may be observed that the Arrowcraft inventories have been increasing each year and that a substantial portion of the net income is invested in the finished goods and materials on hand. This is probably a normal situation but in any case the insurance coverage on these inventories should be carefully watched. Respectfully submitted, REILLY, PENNER AN!)

We break our rule of "reports only" in the September ARROW to print the following pages, which should be of assistance in planning help for the Settlement School for the coming year. EFENSE AT GATLIN 16 ,e) U G THIS is war! Every American is giving wholeheartedly of his or her time, money, and effort to promote worthwhile projects in vital war production, or in equally important measures to maintain and protect those vital "defense projects" that aim to hold fast for the future the fundamental rights and privileges of American citizenship. Such a defense project is our II B Settlement School at Gatlinburg. If we are to hold the ground so painstakingly won by loyal Pi Beta Phis in the past; if we are to protect our investment in the Smokies; if we are to preserve a source of revenue for people who have no other means of livelihood; if we are to retain the faith and friendship of the mountain people who have come to respect and admire II B (I) not because they know our inner joy of member-ship but because they have seen the benefits of our altruism we, members of II B , must make this coming year of 1942-1943 as glorious a record in contributions to the Settlement School as any in our history. To do this may be harder than in the past, but the satisfaction of our accomplishment will also be greater! It is the first task of the Settlement School Committee to plan wisely so that expenses may be held within the expected income; and our second task is to help you carry on your regular projects for the benefit of the Settlement School that this in-come may be great enough to cover the necessary expenses of such an enterprise. Settlement School income from Pi Beta Phis comes largely from three sources: sale of Arrow craft, contributions from active chapters and alumna clubs, and magazine commissions. You, in your individual clubs, can best decide what means to use for the raising of your customary contributions. In this issue you will End suggestions for your magazine sales set-up from the club which has ranked first for the past six successive years in amount of commissions earned. And the new articles added this year to our fine traditional Arrow-craft will insure your Settlement School sale being a success once more. Do you or your friends have sweethearts or husbands in the Service? Of course, you do. Then did you know you could secure black and olive drab neckties of our lovely Arrowcraft quality to go with their regulation uniforms? Or is He in the Air Corps? Then he will appreciate one of the wool scarfs for men, or perhaps the extra long "ski scarf" which is a yard and a third long and can be wrapped around several times to amply protect his throat and chest when he flies in high altitudes. The Royal Standard Chapter, Daughters of the British Empire ordered six dozen of our Frozen Mist scarfs for sale to departing aviators and aviation cadets. All aviators wear some sort of scarf why not be sure that every "Pi Phi Aviator" has an Arrowcraft scarf ? Those showers for II B I, brides make a perfect occasion for Arrowcraft towels; and think of the joy you would bring if each member of the chapter would give a place mat or napkin of Arrowcraft design to complete a luncheon set. =IONS TO AR OWCRAFT s\, THE new items? Here is the latest information from Ethel Snow, our capable Manager of Arrowcraft. First there will be three new scarfs, sparkling in color and developing the theme of last year's favorite Buckeye scarf. The "Buckeye," you re-member, was that lovely brown, brick red and white with just a touch of green in a broken plaid, designed by Winogene Redding, in charge of the weaving at our Settlement School, .and named for its portrayal of the colors in the Tennessee buck-eyes. The new ones will be in different combinations: one a new soft blue and chocolate brown, with white and a deeper blue; another a bright THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 61 red, green, yellow and black one; and the third one of lovely oriental colors. For campus and sport wear the McArthur square should prove popular, twenty-seven inches square of the traditional green, black and yellow plaid of the McArthur clan. If these should not suit your coloring, there will be two other plaids to choose from, all grand for those sweaters every college girl owns. Did you know strawberries were in season? They strayed to ladies' lingerie this year, but Arrowcraft has brought them back to the breakfast table in a dead-white doilie displaying two luscious strawberries woven in the corner. Very reasonable, these should prove welcome additions to the Arrow sets in natural linen and white, and the "utility" sets with bright borders or in conservative all white. And you will need new knitting bags for war-time knitters ! A new cylinder bag (popularly called the feed-bag) has proved a good seller at the Arrowcraft shop this summer. They look jaunty slung over the shoulder, and can be used as a carryall for First Aid notebooks, as well. A new (to me, at least) bedjacket was on display at Arrowcraft Shop last summer with a clever high neckline, and in heavenly blue, pale pink or white. They can also be secured in orchid, yellow or green. Your convalescent friends would appreciate them! Mrs, Snow also tells us there will be at least six new neckties to provide Father, Son or Friend with a new one for Christmas (although these will cost you a little more this year with war prices on wool) and that there will still be quantities of shawls, all linen towels, and a limited supply of all wool yardage and wall hangings. Speaking of shawls, don't fail to ask for some of the lovely ones woven of rich deep red, blue, green and yellow, the squares so blended and arranged that folding produces three entirely different color effects. Or you might like the gossamer white, or a pastel, for evening wear with it over your head and just a corner turned back, the fringe frames your face and neck to add allure to the simplest frock. By the time your fall order is placed, the newly . appointed Craft Advisory Committee, whom we shall introduce to you next issue, will have selected additional new items for production. Aren't you anxious to see them all and show them to your II B (1, Settlement School friends? HOW TO WIN FIRST PLACE IN MAGAZINE SALES COMMISSIONS! THE Denver Alumnae Club has consistently held first place for the largest amount of magazine commissions since 1937. This is a record of which they may be justly proud, and the story of their methods should prove an inspiration to all other alumni club magazine chairmen. Such a story is here presented by Dorothy Andrews Thebus, Colorado B, Denver's magazine chairman from 1930 to 1937. "It was in 1930, I believe, that I was asked to be magazine chairman for the Denver Alumnae Club. I had a small son, and since it was hard to leave home very often for meetings, I was glad to find I could help while remaining at home. It is a real pleasure to sell people something that they already know and like. It soon became apparent to me what wonderful opportunities for service to our Settlement School lay in this field for every alumnae club. I observed with envy the clubs whose names appeared among the first eight listed in the annual reports and thought how proud I should be if the Denver Alumnx Club would be mentioned. I was very happy when in 1932 we placed seventh and three years later were in sixth place. In 1937 I had the pleasure of seeing Denver heading the list. As much of the work of the magazine chair-man comes in November and December which is also the time of preparing for Christmas, I felt in fairness to my young son and daughter I must give up this work. It was with real regret that I asked for someone to take my place in 1937. I had be-come acquainted by phone with so many of our alumna~ and have missed my periodic chats with them. Mrs. Kenneth Snodgrass (with three children) held this position for the next two years, keeping Denver in first place. Mrs. Ralph Johnson followed (she also has small children) retaining first place and in 1940-41 reached a high for Denver of $228.00 in commissions and also second place in the per capita rating. Mrs. W. Turrell Barber, (Georgia Marrs, Colorado B '40) is chairman this year and I think has reported a new high for Denver for 1941-42. When one observes the annual magazine reports and notices that many of the smaller alumnm clubs are mentioned as highest in the "per capita" rating, it makes one realize how much the larger clubs can do with intensive work. Take, e.g., a city in which there are 300 alumna', not necessarily active in the alumni club. Nearly everyone spends at least $5.00 per year on magazines. Many spend much more. If the club could average $5.00 per member, this would be $1,500.00 in subscriptions and approximately $350.00 in commissions earned for the Settlement School. I believe it helps to figure a goal toward which to work. Our chairman keeps a card file of subscribers, also a file by months of subscriptions coming due, and systematically calls these subscribers, suggesting to them new magazines they would enjoy, special rates on magazines, etc. Many excellent suggestions for selling are given each year in the annual report in the September ARROW. Magazines make excellent gifts which are enjoyed throughout the year. Surely every II (I) has one non-II cl) friend who will gladly allow us to place his or her subscriptions. Why not ask? You are not asking for money which would not be spent anyway in just this manner. A friend of our family who used to give liquor at Christmas to his business and personal friends changed to magazines and for several years has placed the subscriptions through our club. Last 62 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW year he turned in 17 subscriptions to Life and two to Fortune. Each year our club holds a Settlement School tea at which goods from the Arrowcraft Shop are displayed and sold. This is held early in November. A table is always devoted to magazine subscriptions. This serves both as a convenience and a reminder. Mrs. Barber's husband made a beautiful poster for the table last year, having titles from many popular magazines pasted along one side as they would appear in a magazine rack. KEEP THEM 'LAST FOUNDERS' DAY the Chicago South Alumnae Club decided that rather than feast themselves at a luxurious hotel for perhaps two dollars and a half each, they would do something for someone else and still hold all the friendship and fraternity spirit so much a part of Founders' Day celebrations. Their happy solution was a "Settlement School Book Tea" held at the home of one of their members, to which contributions were brought. (They had hinted that a dollar each would be most satisfactory, but members gave as their budgets warranted.) From this wartime Founders' Day, Chicago South was able to order fifty books from a list compiled by Miss May K. Duncan, head of the department of elementary education of the University of Kentucky, as selections which would be beneficial to our Settlement School elementary grade library. Can't you just see the shining faces of our Gatlinburg youngsters when Miss Margaret Burchfield, Settlement School librarian, shows them the new books on the children's shelves at the Grace Coolidge library? Other donors this past year included the Boston Alumnae Club, whose check for twenty-five dollars provided the addition of much needed reference books; and individual members who sent down forty-three books, of which nineteen were welcome new volumes on science. The library is not entirely dependent on contributions, as library fees of twenty-five cents a semester from each high-school student plus fines of two cents a day for books held over two weeks, brought a revenue of over seventy dollars last year. Much of this was needed to replace standard high school requirements that had finally reached the discard stage after continuous usage over a period of years. The Grace Coolidge library is housed in a large room in the High School building, and is open for students three hours a day, which is all of the time it is not being used by Miss Burchfield as a class-room for English and Spanish, a regrettable condition brought on by crowded quarters. Not only are the students hungry for new books, but ade (Don't you think all husbands of magazine chairmen deserve a vote of thanks for their patience and help the many phone interruptions at meal time and their help in getting subscriptions sent in, etc.) This is very satisfying work as we have such definite results to show for our efforts. The opportunity is here for every alumnae club. Each II must do a little work and every chairman a great deal." EADING! quate reference work in the classes of our Settlement School High School demands a substantial increase in volumes for all courses. The first need for the Settlement School library is to build it up for the use of our own students. It is one department of the school which, while meeting the minimum state requirements, will not hold that standard unless continued replacements are made and new books added. The second need or perhaps a dream, but a very realistic and worthwhile dream is to b,lild the number of books to the point where package libraries may be formed and loaned for definite periods of time to the nearby communities. Through this service II B c can extend its area of influence and bring joy and education to people eager for more and better reading. While you alumna members are checking your book-shelves for donations to the U.S.O. and army and navy camps, don't forget our own "defense project" in Gatlinburg, and remember to send all the volumes that might be of value to grade or high school students there. Address them to the librarian, Miss Margaret Burchfield, II B Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tenn. She will paste a II B (I) bookplate in the front of each volume, bearing your name and the date received. Or send a copy of your favorite book so that others may share your pleasure in reading it! Or, should you have too many favorites to choose from, pick a volume from one of the lists available through the Little Pigeon news editor, and order it sent to Grace Coolidge library. Perhaps your alumnm club might like to have a Book Tea or a Book Day this year, as a supplement to the regular Settlement School projects (sale of Arrow-craft goods and regular financial contributions to the general Settlement School funds) so vital to the continuance of our endeavors to build for the staunch mountain people of Tennessee a world that is truly American. NlILDRED ODELL SALE Editor, News From Little Pigeon Committee ep rts COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION T HE most interesting news of the year, concerning extension, has been the granting of a charter to II E at DePauw University by the unanimous vote of Grand Council and the chapters in the Province. Due to the postponement of the 1942 Convention, II 1 E was unable to submit its petition for the charter to Convention, the permission for which had been previously announced. The committee on extension wishes to congratulate our newest chapter and tell them how proud we are of the splendid showing they have made during this year of colonization. So in Indiana Epsilon is added a chapter fully worthy of II B cl). All inquiries have been met with cordial re sponse but to date nothing of interest has developed. Inquiries have come from A Sorority at American University, Washington, D.C.; from A A M Sorority at Massachusetts State, Amherst; from a group at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; and from the Dean at Arkansas State College, Jonesboro, Arkansas. My sincere appreciation to Miss Onken and Mrs. Finger for their assistance since my very recent appointment to chairmanship of the committee. Respectfully submitted, MILDRED BOWERS BALIMAN COMMITTEE ON T ANSFERS \ THE committee on transfers has used the same procedure as in the past few years. Chapter correspondence secretaries have reported transfers at the beginning of the school year by filling out two introductory transfer blanks: one for the chap-ter on the campus to which the girls concerned is transferring and one for the transfer chairman. After October 15, the date when the above report is listed as being due on the official calendar, this committee sent letters to all corresponding secretaries reminding them all that they should be cordial to the new Pi Phis on their campuses and urging those who had not sent in their xeports to do so at once. In the fall, letters were also sent to Province Presidents asking their cooperation with this committee by seeing during their visits with the chap ters that the transfers were being shown all possible consideration. Advisory board members in charge of transfers were asked to help where there were several transfers on the same campus by holding regular monthly meetings with those girls. All transfers received letters explaining what they might expect of the new chapters, what the general practice is regarding affiliation and what is expected of them in regard to the national organization and the local group. This year there were still more transfers than in the past few years. Eighty-six girls went from forty chapters to forty-one. Texas A headed the list with ten transfers on its campus. Illinois E had eight and both North Carolina A and Iowa Z had six. Thirteen chapters failed to report. SANCHA KILBOURN GARVEY HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE T HE Holt House Committee has carried on the work of restoration and partial furnishing as planned. Last fall some furnishings were installed downstairs and in the hostess living room and bed room. Planting was done at the front of the house. Mrs. C. C. Cary of Newton, Iowa, is hostess at Holt House greeting visitors and helping the active girls or alumnae with entertaining. Last October 17 and 18 the Pi Phis of Monmouth held open house for townspeople and Monmouth College alumna back for "homecoming." There were several hundred guests. Products of the Settlement School were displayed and many articles were sold. The chapter at Monmouth gave a rushing party and held initiation at the house. In order to make the house more complete and therefore more useful the committee hopes to complete soon furnishing of the Founders' Room, the Powder Room, and a guest bed room. This bed room would be used by visiting members of the fraternity or by parents visiting students of Mon-mouth College. It is hoped we can buy some china and plated flat silver. Holt House is now open to members of the fraternity and their friends who wish to visit it. It is available to clubs and chapters for meetings or entertaining. 63 The Holt House Committee appreciates the interest and generosity of chapters clubs and individuals. The committee wishes to thank the members of Grand Council and the Province Presidents and Province Vice-Presidents for their help and co-operation.

        52 .THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Current Income and Expenses The expenses of the Settlement School exceeded operating income by $6,977.50 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $12,578.43. The Settlement School expenses included depreciation of $3,259.04, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores but which is not charged to this department. The Arrowcraft net income was $1,524.65 less than that of the previous year although the sales of $54,651.28 were approximately the same as those for 1940-1941. The sales at the Mountain View Hotel which are ordinarily quite profitable fell off somewhat with a decrease in gross profit of $656.18. An accounting of the net income is presented as follows: Net income of Arrowcraft division . . . . $12,578.43 Deficit in operation of Settlement School 6,977.50 Net income $ 5,600.93 Accounted for as follows: Increase in Arrowcraft inventories $ 4,004.41 Increase in ArroWcraft receivables Increase in farm live-stock Expenditures for build ing and equipment $12,480.37 Less depreciation for year 3,259.04 $ 9,221.33 Less Stuart Cottage charged off 450.00 8,771,33 Increase in prepaid in surance 505.51 $13,594.27 Less decrease in cash balances and cash items on hand 9,301.09 $ 4,293,18 Transfer of funds to endowment principal 1,307.75 Total as above $ 5,600.93 It may be observed that the Arrowcraft inventories have been increasing each year and that a substantial portion of the net income is invested in the finished goods and materials on hand. This is probably a normal situation but in any case the insurance coverage on these inventories should be carefully watched. Respectfully submitted, REILLY, PENNER AN!)

We break our rule of "reports only" in the September ARROW to print the following pages, which should be of assistance in planning help for the Settlement School for the coming year. EFENSE AT GATLIN 16 ,e) U G THIS is war! Every American is giving wholeheartedly of his or her time, money, and effort to promote worthwhile projects in vital war production, or in equally important measures to maintain and protect those vital "defense projects" that aim to hold fast for the future the fundamental rights and privileges of American citizenship. Such a defense project is our II B Settlement School at Gatlinburg. If we are to hold the ground so painstakingly won by loyal Pi Beta Phis in the past; if we are to protect our investment in the Smokies; if we are to preserve a source of revenue for people who have no other means of livelihood; if we are to retain the faith and friendship of the mountain people who have come to respect and admire II B (I) not because they know our inner joy of member-ship but because they have seen the benefits of our altruism we, members of II B , must make this coming year of 1942-1943 as glorious a record in contributions to the Settlement School as any in our history. To do this may be harder than in the past, but the satisfaction of our accomplishment will also be greater! It is the first task of the Settlement School Committee to plan wisely so that expenses may be held within the expected income; and our second task is to help you carry on your regular projects for the benefit of the Settlement School that this in-come may be great enough to cover the necessary expenses of such an enterprise. Settlement School income from Pi Beta Phis comes largely from three sources: sale of Arrow craft, contributions from active chapters and alumna clubs, and magazine commissions. You, in your individual clubs, can best decide what means to use for the raising of your customary contributions. In this issue you will End suggestions for your magazine sales set-up from the club which has ranked first for the past six successive years in amount of commissions earned. And the new articles added this year to our fine traditional Arrow-craft will insure your Settlement School sale being a success once more. Do you or your friends have sweethearts or husbands in the Service? Of course, you do. Then did you know you could secure black and olive drab neckties of our lovely Arrowcraft quality to go with their regulation uniforms? Or is He in the Air Corps? Then he will appreciate one of the wool scarfs for men, or perhaps the extra long "ski scarf" which is a yard and a third long and can be wrapped around several times to amply protect his throat and chest when he flies in high altitudes. The Royal Standard Chapter, Daughters of the British Empire ordered six dozen of our Frozen Mist scarfs for sale to departing aviators and aviation cadets. All aviators wear some sort of scarf why not be sure that every "Pi Phi Aviator" has an Arrowcraft scarf ? Those showers for II B I, brides make a perfect occasion for Arrowcraft towels; and think of the joy you would bring if each member of the chapter would give a place mat or napkin of Arrowcraft design to complete a luncheon set. =IONS TO AR OWCRAFT s\, THE new items? Here is the latest information from Ethel Snow, our capable Manager of Arrowcraft. First there will be three new scarfs, sparkling in color and developing the theme of last year's favorite Buckeye scarf. The "Buckeye," you re-member, was that lovely brown, brick red and white with just a touch of green in a broken plaid, designed by Winogene Redding, in charge of the weaving at our Settlement School, .and named for its portrayal of the colors in the Tennessee buck-eyes. The new ones will be in different combinations: one a new soft blue and chocolate brown, with white and a deeper blue; another a bright THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 61 red, green, yellow and black one; and the third one of lovely oriental colors. For campus and sport wear the McArthur square should prove popular, twenty-seven inches square of the traditional green, black and yellow plaid of the McArthur clan. If these should not suit your coloring, there will be two other plaids to choose from, all grand for those sweaters every college girl owns. Did you know strawberries were in season? They strayed to ladies' lingerie this year, but Arrowcraft has brought them back to the breakfast table in a dead-white doilie displaying two luscious strawberries woven in the corner. Very reasonable, these should prove welcome additions to the Arrow sets in natural linen and white, and the "utility" sets with bright borders or in conservative all white. And you will need new knitting bags for war-time knitters ! A new cylinder bag (popularly called the feed-bag) has proved a good seller at the Arrowcraft shop this summer. They look jaunty slung over the shoulder, and can be used as a carryall for First Aid notebooks, as well. A new (to me, at least) bedjacket was on display at Arrowcraft Shop last summer with a clever high neckline, and in heavenly blue, pale pink or white. They can also be secured in orchid, yellow or green. Your convalescent friends would appreciate them! Mrs, Snow also tells us there will be at least six new neckties to provide Father, Son or Friend with a new one for Christmas (although these will cost you a little more this year with war prices on wool) and that there will still be quantities of shawls, all linen towels, and a limited supply of all wool yardage and wall hangings. Speaking of shawls, don't fail to ask for some of the lovely ones woven of rich deep red, blue, green and yellow, the squares so blended and arranged that folding produces three entirely different color effects. Or you might like the gossamer white, or a pastel, for evening wear with it over your head and just a corner turned back, the fringe frames your face and neck to add allure to the simplest frock. By the time your fall order is placed, the newly . appointed Craft Advisory Committee, whom we shall introduce to you next issue, will have selected additional new items for production. Aren't you anxious to see them all and show them to your II B (1, Settlement School friends? HOW TO WIN FIRST PLACE IN MAGAZINE SALES COMMISSIONS! THE Denver Alumnae Club has consistently held first place for the largest amount of magazine commissions since 1937. This is a record of which they may be justly proud, and the story of their methods should prove an inspiration to all other alumni club magazine chairmen. Such a story is here presented by Dorothy Andrews Thebus, Colorado B, Denver's magazine chairman from 1930 to 1937. "It was in 1930, I believe, that I was asked to be magazine chairman for the Denver Alumnae Club. I had a small son, and since it was hard to leave home very often for meetings, I was glad to find I could help while remaining at home. It is a real pleasure to sell people something that they already know and like. It soon became apparent to me what wonderful opportunities for service to our Settlement School lay in this field for every alumnae club. I observed with envy the clubs whose names appeared among the first eight listed in the annual reports and thought how proud I should be if the Denver Alumnx Club would be mentioned. I was very happy when in 1932 we placed seventh and three years later were in sixth place. In 1937 I had the pleasure of seeing Denver heading the list. As much of the work of the magazine chair-man comes in November and December which is also the time of preparing for Christmas, I felt in fairness to my young son and daughter I must give up this work. It was with real regret that I asked for someone to take my place in 1937. I had be-come acquainted by phone with so many of our alumna~ and have missed my periodic chats with them. Mrs. Kenneth Snodgrass (with three children) held this position for the next two years, keeping Denver in first place. Mrs. Ralph Johnson followed (she also has small children) retaining first place and in 1940-41 reached a high for Denver of $228.00 in commissions and also second place in the per capita rating. Mrs. W. Turrell Barber, (Georgia Marrs, Colorado B '40) is chairman this year and I think has reported a new high for Denver for 1941-42. When one observes the annual magazine reports and notices that many of the smaller alumnm clubs are mentioned as highest in the "per capita" rating, it makes one realize how much the larger clubs can do with intensive work. Take, e.g., a city in which there are 300 alumna', not necessarily active in the alumni club. Nearly everyone spends at least $5.00 per year on magazines. Many spend much more. If the club could average $5.00 per member, this would be $1,500.00 in subscriptions and approximately $350.00 in commissions earned for the Settlement School. I believe it helps to figure a goal toward which to work. Our chairman keeps a card file of subscribers, also a file by months of subscriptions coming due, and systematically calls these subscribers, suggesting to them new magazines they would enjoy, special rates on magazines, etc. Many excellent suggestions for selling are given each year in the annual report in the September ARROW. Magazines make excellent gifts which are enjoyed throughout the year. Surely every II (I) has one non-II cl) friend who will gladly allow us to place his or her subscriptions. Why not ask? You are not asking for money which would not be spent anyway in just this manner. A friend of our family who used to give liquor at Christmas to his business and personal friends changed to magazines and for several years has placed the subscriptions through our club. Last 62 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW year he turned in 17 subscriptions to Life and two to Fortune. Each year our club holds a Settlement School tea at which goods from the Arrowcraft Shop are displayed and sold. This is held early in November. A table is always devoted to magazine subscriptions. This serves both as a convenience and a reminder. Mrs. Barber's husband made a beautiful poster for the table last year, having titles from many popular magazines pasted along one side as they would appear in a magazine rack. KEEP THEM 'LAST FOUNDERS' DAY the Chicago South Alumnae Club decided that rather than feast themselves at a luxurious hotel for perhaps two dollars and a half each, they would do something for someone else and still hold all the friendship and fraternity spirit so much a part of Founders' Day celebrations. Their happy solution was a "Settlement School Book Tea" held at the home of one of their members, to which contributions were brought. (They had hinted that a dollar each would be most satisfactory, but members gave as their budgets warranted.) From this wartime Founders' Day, Chicago South was able to order fifty books from a list compiled by Miss May K. Duncan, head of the department of elementary education of the University of Kentucky, as selections which would be beneficial to our Settlement School elementary grade library. Can't you just see the shining faces of our Gatlinburg youngsters when Miss Margaret Burchfield, Settlement School librarian, shows them the new books on the children's shelves at the Grace Coolidge library? Other donors this past year included the Boston Alumnae Club, whose check for twenty-five dollars provided the addition of much needed reference books; and individual members who sent down forty-three books, of which nineteen were welcome new volumes on science. The library is not entirely dependent on contributions, as library fees of twenty-five cents a semester from each high-school student plus fines of two cents a day for books held over two weeks, brought a revenue of over seventy dollars last year. Much of this was needed to replace standard high school requirements that had finally reached the discard stage after continuous usage over a period of years. The Grace Coolidge library is housed in a large room in the High School building, and is open for students three hours a day, which is all of the time it is not being used by Miss Burchfield as a class-room for English and Spanish, a regrettable condition brought on by crowded quarters. Not only are the students hungry for new books, but ade (Don't you think all husbands of magazine chairmen deserve a vote of thanks for their patience and help the many phone interruptions at meal time and their help in getting subscriptions sent in, etc.) This is very satisfying work as we have such definite results to show for our efforts. The opportunity is here for every alumnae club. Each II must do a little work and every chairman a great deal." EADING! quate reference work in the classes of our Settlement School High School demands a substantial increase in volumes for all courses. The first need for the Settlement School library is to build it up for the use of our own students. It is one department of the school which, while meeting the minimum state requirements, will not hold that standard unless continued replacements are made and new books added. The second need or perhaps a dream, but a very realistic and worthwhile dream is to b,lild the number of books to the point where package libraries may be formed and loaned for definite periods of time to the nearby communities. Through this service II B c can extend its area of influence and bring joy and education to people eager for more and better reading. While you alumna members are checking your book-shelves for donations to the U.S.O. and army and navy camps, don't forget our own "defense project" in Gatlinburg, and remember to send all the volumes that might be of value to grade or high school students there. Address them to the librarian, Miss Margaret Burchfield, II B Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tenn. She will paste a II B (I) bookplate in the front of each volume, bearing your name and the date received. Or send a copy of your favorite book so that others may share your pleasure in reading it! Or, should you have too many favorites to choose from, pick a volume from one of the lists available through the Little Pigeon news editor, and order it sent to Grace Coolidge library. Perhaps your alumnm club might like to have a Book Tea or a Book Day this year, as a supplement to the regular Settlement School projects (sale of Arrow-craft goods and regular financial contributions to the general Settlement School funds) so vital to the continuance of our endeavors to build for the staunch mountain people of Tennessee a world that is truly American. NlILDRED ODELL SALE Editor, News From Little Pigeon Committee ep rts COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION T HE most interesting news of the year, concerning extension, has been the granting of a charter to II E at DePauw University by the unanimous vote of Grand Council and the chapters in the Province. Due to the postponement of the 1942 Convention, II 1 E was unable to submit its petition for the charter to Convention, the permission for which had been previously announced. The committee on extension wishes to congratulate our newest chapter and tell them how proud we are of the splendid showing they have made during this year of colonization. So in Indiana Epsilon is added a chapter fully worthy of II B cl). All inquiries have been met with cordial re sponse but to date nothing of interest has developed. Inquiries have come from A Sorority at American University, Washington, D.C.; from A A M Sorority at Massachusetts State, Amherst; from a group at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; and from the Dean at Arkansas State College, Jonesboro, Arkansas. My sincere appreciation to Miss Onken and Mrs. Finger for their assistance since my very recent appointment to chairmanship of the committee. Respectfully submitted, MILDRED BOWERS BALIMAN COMMITTEE ON T ANSFERS \ THE committee on transfers has used the same procedure as in the past few years. Chapter correspondence secretaries have reported transfers at the beginning of the school year by filling out two introductory transfer blanks: one for the chap-ter on the campus to which the girls concerned is transferring and one for the transfer chairman. After October 15, the date when the above report is listed as being due on the official calendar, this committee sent letters to all corresponding secretaries reminding them all that they should be cordial to the new Pi Phis on their campuses and urging those who had not sent in their xeports to do so at once. In the fall, letters were also sent to Province Presidents asking their cooperation with this committee by seeing during their visits with the chap ters that the transfers were being shown all possible consideration. Advisory board members in charge of transfers were asked to help where there were several transfers on the same campus by holding regular monthly meetings with those girls. All transfers received letters explaining what they might expect of the new chapters, what the general practice is regarding affiliation and what is expected of them in regard to the national organization and the local group. This year there were still more transfers than in the past few years. Eighty-six girls went from forty chapters to forty-one. Texas A headed the list with ten transfers on its campus. Illinois E had eight and both North Carolina A and Iowa Z had six. Thirteen chapters failed to report. SANCHA KILBOURN GARVEY HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE T HE Holt House Committee has carried on the work of restoration and partial furnishing as planned. Last fall some furnishings were installed downstairs and in the hostess living room and bed room. Planting was done at the front of the house. Mrs. C. C. Cary of Newton, Iowa, is hostess at Holt House greeting visitors and helping the active girls or alumnae with entertaining. Last October 17 and 18 the Pi Phis of Monmouth held open house for townspeople and Monmouth College alumna back for "homecoming." There were several hundred guests. Products of the Settlement School were displayed and many articles were sold. The chapter at Monmouth gave a rushing party and held initiation at the house. In order to make the house more complete and therefore more useful the committee hopes to complete soon furnishing of the Founders' Room, the Powder Room, and a guest bed room. This bed room would be used by visiting members of the fraternity or by parents visiting students of Mon-mouth College. It is hoped we can buy some china and plated flat silver. Holt House is now open to members of the fraternity and their friends who wish to visit it. It is available to clubs and chapters for meetings or entertaining. 63 The Holt House Committee appreciates the interest and generosity of chapters clubs and individuals. The committee wishes to thank the members of Grand Council and the Province Presidents and Province Vice-Presidents for their help and co-operation.

We break our rule of "reports only" in the September ARROW to print the following pages, which should be of assistance in planning help for the Settlement School for the coming year. EFENSE AT GATLIN 16 ,e) U G THIS is war! Every American is giving wholeheartedly of his or her time, money, and effort to promote worthwhile projects in vital war production, or in equally important measures to maintain and protect those vital "defense projects" that aim to hold fast for the future the fundamental rights and privileges of American citizenship. Such a defense project is our II B Settlement School at Gatlinburg. If we are to hold the ground so painstakingly won by loyal Pi Beta Phis in the past; if we are to protect our investment in the Smokies; if we are to preserve a source of revenue for people who have no other means of livelihood; if we are to retain the faith and friendship of the mountain people who have come to respect and admire II B (I) not because they know our inner joy of member-ship but because they have seen the benefits of our altruism we, members of II B , must make this coming year of 1942-1943 as glorious a record in contributions to the Settlement School as any in our history. To do this may be harder than in the past, but the satisfaction of our accomplishment will also be greater! It is the first task of the Settlement School Committee to plan wisely so that expenses may be held within the expected income; and our second task is to help you carry on your regular projects for the benefit of the Settlement School that this in-come may be great enough to cover the necessary expenses of such an enterprise. Settlement School income from Pi Beta Phis comes largely from three sources: sale of Arrow craft, contributions from active chapters and alumna clubs, and magazine commissions. You, in your individual clubs, can best decide what means to use for the raising of your customary contributions. In this issue you will End suggestions for your magazine sales set-up from the club which has ranked first for the past six successive years in amount of commissions earned. And the new articles added this year to our fine traditional Arrow-craft will insure your Settlement School sale being a success once more. Do you or your friends have sweethearts or husbands in the Service? Of course, you do. Then did you know you could secure black and olive drab neckties of our lovely Arrowcraft quality to go with their regulation uniforms? Or is He in the Air Corps? Then he will appreciate one of the wool scarfs for men, or perhaps the extra long "ski scarf" which is a yard and a third long and can be wrapped around several times to amply protect his throat and chest when he flies in high altitudes. The Royal Standard Chapter, Daughters of the British Empire ordered six dozen of our Frozen Mist scarfs for sale to departing aviators and aviation cadets. All aviators wear some sort of scarf why not be sure that every "Pi Phi Aviator" has an Arrowcraft scarf ? Those showers for II B I, brides make a perfect occasion for Arrowcraft towels; and think of the joy you would bring if each member of the chapter would give a place mat or napkin of Arrowcraft design to complete a luncheon set. =IONS TO AR OWCRAFT s\, THE new items? Here is the latest information from Ethel Snow, our capable Manager of Arrowcraft. First there will be three new scarfs, sparkling in color and developing the theme of last year's favorite Buckeye scarf. The "Buckeye," you re-member, was that lovely brown, brick red and white with just a touch of green in a broken plaid, designed by Winogene Redding, in charge of the weaving at our Settlement School, .and named for its portrayal of the colors in the Tennessee buck-eyes. The new ones will be in different combinations: one a new soft blue and chocolate brown, with white and a deeper blue; another a bright THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 61 red, green, yellow and black one; and the third one of lovely oriental colors. For campus and sport wear the McArthur square should prove popular, twenty-seven inches square of the traditional green, black and yellow plaid of the McArthur clan. If these should not suit your coloring, there will be two other plaids to choose from, all grand for those sweaters every college girl owns. Did you know strawberries were in season? They strayed to ladies' lingerie this year, but Arrowcraft has brought them back to the breakfast table in a dead-white doilie displaying two luscious strawberries woven in the corner. Very reasonable, these should prove welcome additions to the Arrow sets in natural linen and white, and the "utility" sets with bright borders or in conservative all white. And you will need new knitting bags for war-time knitters ! A new cylinder bag (popularly called the feed-bag) has proved a good seller at the Arrowcraft shop this summer. They look jaunty slung over the shoulder, and can be used as a carryall for First Aid notebooks, as well. A new (to me, at least) bedjacket was on display at Arrowcraft Shop last summer with a clever high neckline, and in heavenly blue, pale pink or white. They can also be secured in orchid, yellow or green. Your convalescent friends would appreciate them! Mrs, Snow also tells us there will be at least six new neckties to provide Father, Son or Friend with a new one for Christmas (although these will cost you a little more this year with war prices on wool) and that there will still be quantities of shawls, all linen towels, and a limited supply of all wool yardage and wall hangings. Speaking of shawls, don't fail to ask for some of the lovely ones woven of rich deep red, blue, green and yellow, the squares so blended and arranged that folding produces three entirely different color effects. Or you might like the gossamer white, or a pastel, for evening wear with it over your head and just a corner turned back, the fringe frames your face and neck to add allure to the simplest frock. By the time your fall order is placed, the newly . appointed Craft Advisory Committee, whom we shall introduce to you next issue, will have selected additional new items for production. Aren't you anxious to see them all and show them to your II B (1, Settlement School friends? HOW TO WIN FIRST PLACE IN MAGAZINE SALES COMMISSIONS! THE Denver Alumnae Club has consistently held first place for the largest amount of magazine commissions since 1937. This is a record of which they may be justly proud, and the story of their methods should prove an inspiration to all other alumni club magazine chairmen. Such a story is here presented by Dorothy Andrews Thebus, Colorado B, Denver's magazine chairman from 1930 to 1937. "It was in 1930, I believe, that I was asked to be magazine chairman for the Denver Alumnae Club. I had a small son, and since it was hard to leave home very often for meetings, I was glad to find I could help while remaining at home. It is a real pleasure to sell people something that they already know and like. It soon became apparent to me what wonderful opportunities for service to our Settlement School lay in this field for every alumnae club. I observed with envy the clubs whose names appeared among the first eight listed in the annual reports and thought how proud I should be if the Denver Alumnx Club would be mentioned. I was very happy when in 1932 we placed seventh and three years later were in sixth place. In 1937 I had the pleasure of seeing Denver heading the list. As much of the work of the magazine chair-man comes in November and December which is also the time of preparing for Christmas, I felt in fairness to my young son and daughter I must give up this work. It was with real regret that I asked for someone to take my place in 1937. I had be-come acquainted by phone with so many of our alumna~ and have missed my periodic chats with them. Mrs. Kenneth Snodgrass (with three children) held this position for the next two years, keeping Denver in first place. Mrs. Ralph Johnson followed (she also has small children) retaining first place and in 1940-41 reached a high for Denver of $228.00 in commissions and also second place in the per capita rating. Mrs. W. Turrell Barber, (Georgia Marrs, Colorado B '40) is chairman this year and I think has reported a new high for Denver for 1941-42. When one observes the annual magazine reports and notices that many of the smaller alumnm clubs are mentioned as highest in the "per capita" rating, it makes one realize how much the larger clubs can do with intensive work. Take, e.g., a city in which there are 300 alumna', not necessarily active in the alumni club. Nearly everyone spends at least $5.00 per year on magazines. Many spend much more. If the club could average $5.00 per member, this would be $1,500.00 in subscriptions and approximately $350.00 in commissions earned for the Settlement School. I believe it helps to figure a goal toward which to work. Our chairman keeps a card file of subscribers, also a file by months of subscriptions coming due, and systematically calls these subscribers, suggesting to them new magazines they would enjoy, special rates on magazines, etc. Many excellent suggestions for selling are given each year in the annual report in the September ARROW. Magazines make excellent gifts which are enjoyed throughout the year. Surely every II (I) has one non-II cl) friend who will gladly allow us to place his or her subscriptions. Why not ask? You are not asking for money which would not be spent anyway in just this manner. A friend of our family who used to give liquor at Christmas to his business and personal friends changed to magazines and for several years has placed the subscriptions through our club. Last 62 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW year he turned in 17 subscriptions to Life and two to Fortune. Each year our club holds a Settlement School tea at which goods from the Arrowcraft Shop are displayed and sold. This is held early in November. A table is always devoted to magazine subscriptions. This serves both as a convenience and a reminder. Mrs. Barber's husband made a beautiful poster for the table last year, having titles from many popular magazines pasted along one side as they would appear in a magazine rack. KEEP THEM 'LAST FOUNDERS' DAY the Chicago South Alumnae Club decided that rather than feast themselves at a luxurious hotel for perhaps two dollars and a half each, they would do something for someone else and still hold all the friendship and fraternity spirit so much a part of Founders' Day celebrations. Their happy solution was a "Settlement School Book Tea" held at the home of one of their members, to which contributions were brought. (They had hinted that a dollar each would be most satisfactory, but members gave as their budgets warranted.) From this wartime Founders' Day, Chicago South was able to order fifty books from a list compiled by Miss May K. Duncan, head of the department of elementary education of the University of Kentucky, as selections which would be beneficial to our Settlement School elementary grade library. Can't you just see the shining faces of our Gatlinburg youngsters when Miss Margaret Burchfield, Settlement School librarian, shows them the new books on the children's shelves at the Grace Coolidge library? Other donors this past year included the Boston Alumnae Club, whose check for twenty-five dollars provided the addition of much needed reference books; and individual members who sent down forty-three books, of which nineteen were welcome new volumes on science. The library is not entirely dependent on contributions, as library fees of twenty-five cents a semester from each high-school student plus fines of two cents a day for books held over two weeks, brought a revenue of over seventy dollars last year. Much of this was needed to replace standard high school requirements that had finally reached the discard stage after continuous usage over a period of years. The Grace Coolidge library is housed in a large room in the High School building, and is open for students three hours a day, which is all of the time it is not being used by Miss Burchfield as a class-room for English and Spanish, a regrettable condition brought on by crowded quarters. Not only are the students hungry for new books, but ade (Don't you think all husbands of magazine chairmen deserve a vote of thanks for their patience and help the many phone interruptions at meal time and their help in getting subscriptions sent in, etc.) This is very satisfying work as we have such definite results to show for our efforts. The opportunity is here for every alumnae club. Each II must do a little work and every chairman a great deal." EADING! quate reference work in the classes of our Settlement School High School demands a substantial increase in volumes for all courses. The first need for the Settlement School library is to build it up for the use of our own students. It is one department of the school which, while meeting the minimum state requirements, will not hold that standard unless continued replacements are made and new books added. The second need or perhaps a dream, but a very realistic and worthwhile dream is to b,lild the number of books to the point where package libraries may be formed and loaned for definite periods of time to the nearby communities. Through this service II B c can extend its area of influence and bring joy and education to people eager for more and better reading. While you alumna members are checking your book-shelves for donations to the U.S.O. and army and navy camps, don't forget our own "defense project" in Gatlinburg, and remember to send all the volumes that might be of value to grade or high school students there. Address them to the librarian, Miss Margaret Burchfield, II B Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tenn. She will paste a II B (I) bookplate in the front of each volume, bearing your name and the date received. Or send a copy of your favorite book so that others may share your pleasure in reading it! Or, should you have too many favorites to choose from, pick a volume from one of the lists available through the Little Pigeon news editor, and order it sent to Grace Coolidge library. Perhaps your alumnm club might like to have a Book Tea or a Book Day this year, as a supplement to the regular Settlement School projects (sale of Arrow-craft goods and regular financial contributions to the general Settlement School funds) so vital to the continuance of our endeavors to build for the staunch mountain people of Tennessee a world that is truly American. NlILDRED ODELL SALE Editor, News From Little Pigeon Committee ep rts COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION T HE most interesting news of the year, concerning extension, has been the granting of a charter to II E at DePauw University by the unanimous vote of Grand Council and the chapters in the Province. Due to the postponement of the 1942 Convention, II 1 E was unable to submit its petition for the charter to Convention, the permission for which had been previously announced. The committee on extension wishes to congratulate our newest chapter and tell them how proud we are of the splendid showing they have made during this year of colonization. So in Indiana Epsilon is added a chapter fully worthy of II B cl). All inquiries have been met with cordial re sponse but to date nothing of interest has developed. Inquiries have come from A Sorority at American University, Washington, D.C.; from A A M Sorority at Massachusetts State, Amherst; from a group at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; and from the Dean at Arkansas State College, Jonesboro, Arkansas. My sincere appreciation to Miss Onken and Mrs. Finger for their assistance since my very recent appointment to chairmanship of the committee. Respectfully submitted, MILDRED BOWERS BALIMAN COMMITTEE ON T ANSFERS \ THE committee on transfers has used the same procedure as in the past few years. Chapter correspondence secretaries have reported transfers at the beginning of the school year by filling out two introductory transfer blanks: one for the chap-ter on the campus to which the girls concerned is transferring and one for the transfer chairman. After October 15, the date when the above report is listed as being due on the official calendar, this committee sent letters to all corresponding secretaries reminding them all that they should be cordial to the new Pi Phis on their campuses and urging those who had not sent in their xeports to do so at once. In the fall, letters were also sent to Province Presidents asking their cooperation with this committee by seeing during their visits with the chap ters that the transfers were being shown all possible consideration. Advisory board members in charge of transfers were asked to help where there were several transfers on the same campus by holding regular monthly meetings with those girls. All transfers received letters explaining what they might expect of the new chapters, what the general practice is regarding affiliation and what is expected of them in regard to the national organization and the local group. This year there were still more transfers than in the past few years. Eighty-six girls went from forty chapters to forty-one. Texas A headed the list with ten transfers on its campus. Illinois E had eight and both North Carolina A and Iowa Z had six. Thirteen chapters failed to report. SANCHA KILBOURN GARVEY HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE T HE Holt House Committee has carried on the work of restoration and partial furnishing as planned. Last fall some furnishings were installed downstairs and in the hostess living room and bed room. Planting was done at the front of the house. Mrs. C. C. Cary of Newton, Iowa, is hostess at Holt House greeting visitors and helping the active girls or alumnae with entertaining. Last October 17 and 18 the Pi Phis of Monmouth held open house for townspeople and Monmouth College alumna back for "homecoming." There were several hundred guests. Products of the Settlement School were displayed and many articles were sold. The chapter at Monmouth gave a rushing party and held initiation at the house. In order to make the house more complete and therefore more useful the committee hopes to complete soon furnishing of the Founders' Room, the Powder Room, and a guest bed room. This bed room would be used by visiting members of the fraternity or by parents visiting students of Mon-mouth College. It is hoped we can buy some china and plated flat silver. Holt House is now open to members of the fraternity and their friends who wish to visit it. It is available to clubs and chapters for meetings or entertaining. 63 The Holt House Committee appreciates the interest and generosity of chapters clubs and individuals. The committee wishes to thank the members of Grand Council and the Province Presidents and Province Vice-Presidents for their help and co-operation.

We break our rule of "reports only" in the September ARROW to print the following pages, which should be of assistance in planning help for the Settlement School for the coming year. EFENSE AT GATLIN 16 ,e) U G THIS is war! Every American is giving wholeheartedly of his or her time, money, and effort to promote worthwhile projects in vital war production, or in equally important measures to maintain and protect those vital "defense projects" that aim to hold fast for the future the fundamental rights and privileges of American citizenship. Such a defense project is our II B Settlement School at Gatlinburg. If we are to hold the ground so painstakingly won by loyal Pi Beta Phis in the past; if we are to protect our investment in the Smokies; if we are to preserve a source of revenue for people who have no other means of livelihood; if we are to retain the faith and friendship of the mountain people who have come to respect and admire II B (I) not because they know our inner joy of member-ship but because they have seen the benefits of our altruism we, members of II B , must make this coming year of 1942-1943 as glorious a record in contributions to the Settlement School as any in our history. To do this may be harder than in the past, but the satisfaction of our accomplishment will also be greater! It is the first task of the Settlement School Committee to plan wisely so that expenses may be held within the expected income; and our second task is to help you carry on your regular projects for the benefit of the Settlement School that this in-come may be great enough to cover the necessary expenses of such an enterprise. Settlement School income from Pi Beta Phis comes largely from three sources: sale of Arrow craft, contributions from active chapters and alumna clubs, and magazine commissions. You, in your individual clubs, can best decide what means to use for the raising of your customary contributions. In this issue you will End suggestions for your magazine sales set-up from the club which has ranked first for the past six successive years in amount of commissions earned. And the new articles added this year to our fine traditional Arrow-craft will insure your Settlement School sale being a success once more. Do you or your friends have sweethearts or husbands in the Service? Of course, you do. Then did you know you could secure black and olive drab neckties of our lovely Arrowcraft quality to go with their regulation uniforms? Or is He in the Air Corps? Then he will appreciate one of the wool scarfs for men, or perhaps the extra long "ski scarf" which is a yard and a third long and can be wrapped around several times to amply protect his throat and chest when he flies in high altitudes. The Royal Standard Chapter, Daughters of the British Empire ordered six dozen of our Frozen Mist scarfs for sale to departing aviators and aviation cadets. All aviators wear some sort of scarf why not be sure that every "Pi Phi Aviator" has an Arrowcraft scarf ? Those showers for II B I, brides make a perfect occasion for Arrowcraft towels; and think of the joy you would bring if each member of the chapter would give a place mat or napkin of Arrowcraft design to complete a luncheon set. =IONS TO AR OWCRAFT s\, THE new items? Here is the latest information from Ethel Snow, our capable Manager of Arrowcraft. First there will be three new scarfs, sparkling in color and developing the theme of last year's favorite Buckeye scarf. The "Buckeye," you re-member, was that lovely brown, brick red and white with just a touch of green in a broken plaid, designed by Winogene Redding, in charge of the weaving at our Settlement School, .and named for its portrayal of the colors in the Tennessee buck-eyes. The new ones will be in different combinations: one a new soft blue and chocolate brown, with white and a deeper blue; another a bright THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 61 red, green, yellow and black one; and the third one of lovely oriental colors. For campus and sport wear the McArthur square should prove popular, twenty-seven inches square of the traditional green, black and yellow plaid of the McArthur clan. If these should not suit your coloring, there will be two other plaids to choose from, all grand for those sweaters every college girl owns. Did you know strawberries were in season? They strayed to ladies' lingerie this year, but Arrowcraft has brought them back to the breakfast table in a dead-white doilie displaying two luscious strawberries woven in the corner. Very reasonable, these should prove welcome additions to the Arrow sets in natural linen and white, and the "utility" sets with bright borders or in conservative all white. And you will need new knitting bags for war-time knitters ! A new cylinder bag (popularly called the feed-bag) has proved a good seller at the Arrowcraft shop this summer. They look jaunty slung over the shoulder, and can be used as a carryall for First Aid notebooks, as well. A new (to me, at least) bedjacket was on display at Arrowcraft Shop last summer with a clever high neckline, and in heavenly blue, pale pink or white. They can also be secured in orchid, yellow or green. Your convalescent friends would appreciate them! Mrs, Snow also tells us there will be at least six new neckties to provide Father, Son or Friend with a new one for Christmas (although these will cost you a little more this year with war prices on wool) and that there will still be quantities of shawls, all linen towels, and a limited supply of all wool yardage and wall hangings. Speaking of shawls, don't fail to ask for some of the lovely ones woven of rich deep red, blue, green and yellow, the squares so blended and arranged that folding produces three entirely different color effects. Or you might like the gossamer white, or a pastel, for evening wear with it over your head and just a corner turned back, the fringe frames your face and neck to add allure to the simplest frock. By the time your fall order is placed, the newly . appointed Craft Advisory Committee, whom we shall introduce to you next issue, will have selected additional new items for production. Aren't you anxious to see them all and show them to your II B (1, Settlement School friends? HOW TO WIN FIRST PLACE IN MAGAZINE SALES COMMISSIONS! THE Denver Alumnae Club has consistently held first place for the largest amount of magazine commissions since 1937. This is a record of which they may be justly proud, and the story of their methods should prove an inspiration to all other alumni club magazine chairmen. Such a story is here presented by Dorothy Andrews Thebus, Colorado B, Denver's magazine chairman from 1930 to 1937. "It was in 1930, I believe, that I was asked to be magazine chairman for the Denver Alumnae Club. I had a small son, and since it was hard to leave home very often for meetings, I was glad to find I could help while remaining at home. It is a real pleasure to sell people something that they already know and like. It soon became apparent to me what wonderful opportunities for service to our Settlement School lay in this field for every alumnae club. I observed with envy the clubs whose names appeared among the first eight listed in the annual reports and thought how proud I should be if the Denver Alumnx Club would be mentioned. I was very happy when in 1932 we placed seventh and three years later were in sixth place. In 1937 I had the pleasure of seeing Denver heading the list. As much of the work of the magazine chair-man comes in November and December which is also the time of preparing for Christmas, I felt in fairness to my young son and daughter I must give up this work. It was with real regret that I asked for someone to take my place in 1937. I had be-come acquainted by phone with so many of our alumna~ and have missed my periodic chats with them. Mrs. Kenneth Snodgrass (with three children) held this position for the next two years, keeping Denver in first place. Mrs. Ralph Johnson followed (she also has small children) retaining first place and in 1940-41 reached a high for Denver of $228.00 in commissions and also second place in the per capita rating. Mrs. W. Turrell Barber, (Georgia Marrs, Colorado B '40) is chairman this year and I think has reported a new high for Denver for 1941-42. When one observes the annual magazine reports and notices that many of the smaller alumnm clubs are mentioned as highest in the "per capita" rating, it makes one realize how much the larger clubs can do with intensive work. Take, e.g., a city in which there are 300 alumna', not necessarily active in the alumni club. Nearly everyone spends at least $5.00 per year on magazines. Many spend much more. If the club could average $5.00 per member, this would be $1,500.00 in subscriptions and approximately $350.00 in commissions earned for the Settlement School. I believe it helps to figure a goal toward which to work. Our chairman keeps a card file of subscribers, also a file by months of subscriptions coming due, and systematically calls these subscribers, suggesting to them new magazines they would enjoy, special rates on magazines, etc. Many excellent suggestions for selling are given each year in the annual report in the September ARROW. Magazines make excellent gifts which are enjoyed throughout the year. Surely every II (I) has one non-II cl) friend who will gladly allow us to place his or her subscriptions. Why not ask? You are not asking for money which would not be spent anyway in just this manner. A friend of our family who used to give liquor at Christmas to his business and personal friends changed to magazines and for several years has placed the subscriptions through our club. Last 62 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW year he turned in 17 subscriptions to Life and two to Fortune. Each year our club holds a Settlement School tea at which goods from the Arrowcraft Shop are displayed and sold. This is held early in November. A table is always devoted to magazine subscriptions. This serves both as a convenience and a reminder. Mrs. Barber's husband made a beautiful poster for the table last year, having titles from many popular magazines pasted along one side as they would appear in a magazine rack. KEEP THEM 'LAST FOUNDERS' DAY the Chicago South Alumnae Club decided that rather than feast themselves at a luxurious hotel for perhaps two dollars and a half each, they would do something for someone else and still hold all the friendship and fraternity spirit so much a part of Founders' Day celebrations. Their happy solution was a "Settlement School Book Tea" held at the home of one of their members, to which contributions were brought. (They had hinted that a dollar each would be most satisfactory, but members gave as their budgets warranted.) From this wartime Founders' Day, Chicago South was able to order fifty books from a list compiled by Miss May K. Duncan, head of the department of elementary education of the University of Kentucky, as selections which would be beneficial to our Settlement School elementary grade library. Can't you just see the shining faces of our Gatlinburg youngsters when Miss Margaret Burchfield, Settlement School librarian, shows them the new books on the children's shelves at the Grace Coolidge library? Other donors this past year included the Boston Alumnae Club, whose check for twenty-five dollars provided the addition of much needed reference books; and individual members who sent down forty-three books, of which nineteen were welcome new volumes on science. The library is not entirely dependent on contributions, as library fees of twenty-five cents a semester from each high-school student plus fines of two cents a day for books held over two weeks, brought a revenue of over seventy dollars last year. Much of this was needed to replace standard high school requirements that had finally reached the discard stage after continuous usage over a period of years. The Grace Coolidge library is housed in a large room in the High School building, and is open for students three hours a day, which is all of the time it is not being used by Miss Burchfield as a class-room for English and Spanish, a regrettable condition brought on by crowded quarters. Not only are the students hungry for new books, but ade (Don't you think all husbands of magazine chairmen deserve a vote of thanks for their patience and help the many phone interruptions at meal time and their help in getting subscriptions sent in, etc.) This is very satisfying work as we have such definite results to show for our efforts. The opportunity is here for every alumnae club. Each II must do a little work and every chairman a great deal." EADING! quate reference work in the classes of our Settlement School High School demands a substantial increase in volumes for all courses. The first need for the Settlement School library is to build it up for the use of our own students. It is one department of the school which, while meeting the minimum state requirements, will not hold that standard unless continued replacements are made and new books added. The second need or perhaps a dream, but a very realistic and worthwhile dream is to b,lild the number of books to the point where package libraries may be formed and loaned for definite periods of time to the nearby communities. Through this service II B c can extend its area of influence and bring joy and education to people eager for more and better reading. While you alumna members are checking your book-shelves for donations to the U.S.O. and army and navy camps, don't forget our own "defense project" in Gatlinburg, and remember to send all the volumes that might be of value to grade or high school students there. Address them to the librarian, Miss Margaret Burchfield, II B Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tenn. She will paste a II B (I) bookplate in the front of each volume, bearing your name and the date received. Or send a copy of your favorite book so that others may share your pleasure in reading it! Or, should you have too many favorites to choose from, pick a volume from one of the lists available through the Little Pigeon news editor, and order it sent to Grace Coolidge library. Perhaps your alumnm club might like to have a Book Tea or a Book Day this year, as a supplement to the regular Settlement School projects (sale of Arrow-craft goods and regular financial contributions to the general Settlement School funds) so vital to the continuance of our endeavors to build for the staunch mountain people of Tennessee a world that is truly American. NlILDRED ODELL SALE Editor, News From Little Pigeon Committee ep rts COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION T HE most interesting news of the year, concerning extension, has been the granting of a charter to II E at DePauw University by the unanimous vote of Grand Council and the chapters in the Province. Due to the postponement of the 1942 Convention, II 1 E was unable to submit its petition for the charter to Convention, the permission for which had been previously announced. The committee on extension wishes to congratulate our newest chapter and tell them how proud we are of the splendid showing they have made during this year of colonization. So in Indiana Epsilon is added a chapter fully worthy of II B cl). All inquiries have been met with cordial re sponse but to date nothing of interest has developed. Inquiries have come from A Sorority at American University, Washington, D.C.; from A A M Sorority at Massachusetts State, Amherst; from a group at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; and from the Dean at Arkansas State College, Jonesboro, Arkansas. My sincere appreciation to Miss Onken and Mrs. Finger for their assistance since my very recent appointment to chairmanship of the committee. Respectfully submitted, MILDRED BOWERS BALIMAN COMMITTEE ON T ANSFERS \ THE committee on transfers has used the same procedure as in the past few years. Chapter correspondence secretaries have reported transfers at the beginning of the school year by filling out two introductory transfer blanks: one for the chap-ter on the campus to which the girls concerned is transferring and one for the transfer chairman. After October 15, the date when the above report is listed as being due on the official calendar, this committee sent letters to all corresponding secretaries reminding them all that they should be cordial to the new Pi Phis on their campuses and urging those who had not sent in their xeports to do so at once. In the fall, letters were also sent to Province Presidents asking their cooperation with this committee by seeing during their visits with the chap ters that the transfers were being shown all possible consideration. Advisory board members in charge of transfers were asked to help where there were several transfers on the same campus by holding regular monthly meetings with those girls. All transfers received letters explaining what they might expect of the new chapters, what the general practice is regarding affiliation and what is expected of them in regard to the national organization and the local group. This year there were still more transfers than in the past few years. Eighty-six girls went from forty chapters to forty-one. Texas A headed the list with ten transfers on its campus. Illinois E had eight and both North Carolina A and Iowa Z had six. Thirteen chapters failed to report. SANCHA KILBOURN GARVEY HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE T HE Holt House Committee has carried on the work of restoration and partial furnishing as planned. Last fall some furnishings were installed downstairs and in the hostess living room and bed room. Planting was done at the front of the house. Mrs. C. C. Cary of Newton, Iowa, is hostess at Holt House greeting visitors and helping the active girls or alumnae with entertaining. Last October 17 and 18 the Pi Phis of Monmouth held open house for townspeople and Monmouth College alumna back for "homecoming." There were several hundred guests. Products of the Settlement School were displayed and many articles were sold. The chapter at Monmouth gave a rushing party and held initiation at the house. In order to make the house more complete and therefore more useful the committee hopes to complete soon furnishing of the Founders' Room, the Powder Room, and a guest bed room. This bed room would be used by visiting members of the fraternity or by parents visiting students of Mon-mouth College. It is hoped we can buy some china and plated flat silver. Holt House is now open to members of the fraternity and their friends who wish to visit it. It is available to clubs and chapters for meetings or entertaining. 63 The Holt House Committee appreciates the interest and generosity of chapters clubs and individuals. The committee wishes to thank the members of Grand Council and the Province Presidents and Province Vice-Presidents for their help and co-operation.

We break our rule of "reports only" in the September ARROW to print the following pages, which should be of assistance in planning help for the Settlement School for the coming year. EFENSE AT GATLIN 16 ,e) U G THIS is war! Every American is giving wholeheartedly of his or her time, money, and effort to promote worthwhile projects in vital war production, or in equally important measures to maintain and protect those vital "defense projects" that aim to hold fast for the future the fundamental rights and privileges of American citizenship. Such a defense project is our II B Settlement School at Gatlinburg. If we are to hold the ground so painstakingly won by loyal Pi Beta Phis in the past; if we are to protect our investment in the Smokies; if we are to preserve a source of revenue for people who have no other means of livelihood; if we are to retain the faith and friendship of the mountain people who have come to respect and admire II B (I) not because they know our inner joy of member-ship but because they have seen the benefits of our altruism we, members of II B , must make this coming year of 1942-1943 as glorious a record in contributions to the Settlement School as any in our history. To do this may be harder than in the past, but the satisfaction of our accomplishment will also be greater! It is the first task of the Settlement School Committee to plan wisely so that expenses may be held within the expected income; and our second task is to help you carry on your regular projects for the benefit of the Settlement School that this in-come may be great enough to cover the necessary expenses of such an enterprise. Settlement School income from Pi Beta Phis comes largely from three sources: sale of Arrow craft, contributions from active chapters and alumna clubs, and magazine commissions. You, in your individual clubs, can best decide what means to use for the raising of your customary contributions. In this issue you will End suggestions for your magazine sales set-up from the club which has ranked first for the past six successive years in amount of commissions earned. And the new articles added this year to our fine traditional Arrow-craft will insure your Settlement School sale being a success once more. Do you or your friends have sweethearts or husbands in the Service? Of course, you do. Then did you know you could secure black and olive drab neckties of our lovely Arrowcraft quality to go with their regulation uniforms? Or is He in the Air Corps? Then he will appreciate one of the wool scarfs for men, or perhaps the extra long "ski scarf" which is a yard and a third long and can be wrapped around several times to amply protect his throat and chest when he flies in high altitudes. The Royal Standard Chapter, Daughters of the British Empire ordered six dozen of our Frozen Mist scarfs for sale to departing aviators and aviation cadets. All aviators wear some sort of scarf why not be sure that every "Pi Phi Aviator" has an Arrowcraft scarf ? Those showers for II B I, brides make a perfect occasion for Arrowcraft towels; and think of the joy you would bring if each member of the chapter would give a place mat or napkin of Arrowcraft design to complete a luncheon set. =IONS TO AR OWCRAFT s\, THE new items? Here is the latest information from Ethel Snow, our capable Manager of Arrowcraft. First there will be three new scarfs, sparkling in color and developing the theme of last year's favorite Buckeye scarf. The "Buckeye," you re-member, was that lovely brown, brick red and white with just a touch of green in a broken plaid, designed by Winogene Redding, in charge of the weaving at our Settlement School, .and named for its portrayal of the colors in the Tennessee buck-eyes. The new ones will be in different combinations: one a new soft blue and chocolate brown, with white and a deeper blue; another a bright THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 61 red, green, yellow and black one; and the third one of lovely oriental colors. For campus and sport wear the McArthur square should prove popular, twenty-seven inches square of the traditional green, black and yellow plaid of the McArthur clan. If these should not suit your coloring, there will be two other plaids to choose from, all grand for those sweaters every college girl owns. Did you know strawberries were in season? They strayed to ladies' lingerie this year, but Arrowcraft has brought them back to the breakfast table in a dead-white doilie displaying two luscious strawberries woven in the corner. Very reasonable, these should prove welcome additions to the Arrow sets in natural linen and white, and the "utility" sets with bright borders or in conservative all white. And you will need new knitting bags for war-time knitters ! A new cylinder bag (popularly called the feed-bag) has proved a good seller at the Arrowcraft shop this summer. They look jaunty slung over the shoulder, and can be used as a carryall for First Aid notebooks, as well. A new (to me, at least) bedjacket was on display at Arrowcraft Shop last summer with a clever high neckline, and in heavenly blue, pale pink or white. They can also be secured in orchid, yellow or green. Your convalescent friends would appreciate them! Mrs, Snow also tells us there will be at least six new neckties to provide Father, Son or Friend with a new one for Christmas (although these will cost you a little more this year with war prices on wool) and that there will still be quantities of shawls, all linen towels, and a limited supply of all wool yardage and wall hangings. Speaking of shawls, don't fail to ask for some of the lovely ones woven of rich deep red, blue, green and yellow, the squares so blended and arranged that folding produces three entirely different color effects. Or you might like the gossamer white, or a pastel, for evening wear with it over your head and just a corner turned back, the fringe frames your face and neck to add allure to the simplest frock. By the time your fall order is placed, the newly . appointed Craft Advisory Committee, whom we shall introduce to you next issue, will have selected additional new items for production. Aren't you anxious to see them all and show them to your II B (1, Settlement School friends? HOW TO WIN FIRST PLACE IN MAGAZINE SALES COMMISSIONS! THE Denver Alumnae Club has consistently held first place for the largest amount of magazine commissions since 1937. This is a record of which they may be justly proud, and the story of their methods should prove an inspiration to all other alumni club magazine chairmen. Such a story is here presented by Dorothy Andrews Thebus, Colorado B, Denver's magazine chairman from 1930 to 1937. "It was in 1930, I believe, that I was asked to be magazine chairman for the Denver Alumnae Club. I had a small son, and since it was hard to leave home very often for meetings, I was glad to find I could help while remaining at home. It is a real pleasure to sell people something that they already know and like. It soon became apparent to me what wonderful opportunities for service to our Settlement School lay in this field for every alumnae club. I observed with envy the clubs whose names appeared among the first eight listed in the annual reports and thought how proud I should be if the Denver Alumnx Club would be mentioned. I was very happy when in 1932 we placed seventh and three years later were in sixth place. In 1937 I had the pleasure of seeing Denver heading the list. As much of the work of the magazine chair-man comes in November and December which is also the time of preparing for Christmas, I felt in fairness to my young son and daughter I must give up this work. It was with real regret that I asked for someone to take my place in 1937. I had be-come acquainted by phone with so many of our alumna~ and have missed my periodic chats with them. Mrs. Kenneth Snodgrass (with three children) held this position for the next two years, keeping Denver in first place. Mrs. Ralph Johnson followed (she also has small children) retaining first place and in 1940-41 reached a high for Denver of $228.00 in commissions and also second place in the per capita rating. Mrs. W. Turrell Barber, (Georgia Marrs, Colorado B '40) is chairman this year and I think has reported a new high for Denver for 1941-42. When one observes the annual magazine reports and notices that many of the smaller alumnm clubs are mentioned as highest in the "per capita" rating, it makes one realize how much the larger clubs can do with intensive work. Take, e.g., a city in which there are 300 alumna', not necessarily active in the alumni club. Nearly everyone spends at least $5.00 per year on magazines. Many spend much more. If the club could average $5.00 per member, this would be $1,500.00 in subscriptions and approximately $350.00 in commissions earned for the Settlement School. I believe it helps to figure a goal toward which to work. Our chairman keeps a card file of subscribers, also a file by months of subscriptions coming due, and systematically calls these subscribers, suggesting to them new magazines they would enjoy, special rates on magazines, etc. Many excellent suggestions for selling are given each year in the annual report in the September ARROW. Magazines make excellent gifts which are enjoyed throughout the year. Surely every II (I) has one non-II cl) friend who will gladly allow us to place his or her subscriptions. Why not ask? You are not asking for money which would not be spent anyway in just this manner. A friend of our family who used to give liquor at Christmas to his business and personal friends changed to magazines and for several years has placed the subscriptions through our club. Last 62 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW year he turned in 17 subscriptions to Life and two to Fortune. Each year our club holds a Settlement School tea at which goods from the Arrowcraft Shop are displayed and sold. This is held early in November. A table is always devoted to magazine subscriptions. This serves both as a convenience and a reminder. Mrs. Barber's husband made a beautiful poster for the table last year, having titles from many popular magazines pasted along one side as they would appear in a magazine rack. KEEP THEM 'LAST FOUNDERS' DAY the Chicago South Alumnae Club decided that rather than feast themselves at a luxurious hotel for perhaps two dollars and a half each, they would do something for someone else and still hold all the friendship and fraternity spirit so much a part of Founders' Day celebrations. Their happy solution was a "Settlement School Book Tea" held at the home of one of their members, to which contributions were brought. (They had hinted that a dollar each would be most satisfactory, but members gave as their budgets warranted.) From this wartime Founders' Day, Chicago South was able to order fifty books from a list compiled by Miss May K. Duncan, head of the department of elementary education of the University of Kentucky, as selections which would be beneficial to our Settlement School elementary grade library. Can't you just see the shining faces of our Gatlinburg youngsters when Miss Margaret Burchfield, Settlement School librarian, shows them the new books on the children's shelves at the Grace Coolidge library? Other donors this past year included the Boston Alumnae Club, whose check for twenty-five dollars provided the addition of much needed reference books; and individual members who sent down forty-three books, of which nineteen were welcome new volumes on science. The library is not entirely dependent on contributions, as library fees of twenty-five cents a semester from each high-school student plus fines of two cents a day for books held over two weeks, brought a revenue of over seventy dollars last year. Much of this was needed to replace standard high school requirements that had finally reached the discard stage after continuous usage over a period of years. The Grace Coolidge library is housed in a large room in the High School building, and is open for students three hours a day, which is all of the time it is not being used by Miss Burchfield as a class-room for English and Spanish, a regrettable condition brought on by crowded quarters. Not only are the students hungry for new books, but ade (Don't you think all husbands of magazine chairmen deserve a vote of thanks for their patience and help the many phone interruptions at meal time and their help in getting subscriptions sent in, etc.) This is very satisfying work as we have such definite results to show for our efforts. The opportunity is here for every alumnae club. Each II must do a little work and every chairman a great deal." EADING! quate reference work in the classes of our Settlement School High School demands a substantial increase in volumes for all courses. The first need for the Settlement School library is to build it up for the use of our own students. It is one department of the school which, while meeting the minimum state requirements, will not hold that standard unless continued replacements are made and new books added. The second need or perhaps a dream, but a very realistic and worthwhile dream is to b,lild the number of books to the point where package libraries may be formed and loaned for definite periods of time to the nearby communities. Through this service II B c can extend its area of influence and bring joy and education to people eager for more and better reading. While you alumna members are checking your book-shelves for donations to the U.S.O. and army and navy camps, don't forget our own "defense project" in Gatlinburg, and remember to send all the volumes that might be of value to grade or high school students there. Address them to the librarian, Miss Margaret Burchfield, II B Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tenn. She will paste a II B (I) bookplate in the front of each volume, bearing your name and the date received. Or send a copy of your favorite book so that others may share your pleasure in reading it! Or, should you have too many favorites to choose from, pick a volume from one of the lists available through the Little Pigeon news editor, and order it sent to Grace Coolidge library. Perhaps your alumnm club might like to have a Book Tea or a Book Day this year, as a supplement to the regular Settlement School projects (sale of Arrow-craft goods and regular financial contributions to the general Settlement School funds) so vital to the continuance of our endeavors to build for the staunch mountain people of Tennessee a world that is truly American. NlILDRED ODELL SALE Editor, News From Little Pigeon Committee ep rts COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION T HE most interesting news of the year, concerning extension, has been the granting of a charter to II E at DePauw University by the unanimous vote of Grand Council and the chapters in the Province. Due to the postponement of the 1942 Convention, II 1 E was unable to submit its petition for the charter to Convention, the permission for which had been previously announced. The committee on extension wishes to congratulate our newest chapter and tell them how proud we are of the splendid showing they have made during this year of colonization. So in Indiana Epsilon is added a chapter fully worthy of II B cl). All inquiries have been met with cordial re sponse but to date nothing of interest has developed. Inquiries have come from A Sorority at American University, Washington, D.C.; from A A M Sorority at Massachusetts State, Amherst; from a group at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; and from the Dean at Arkansas State College, Jonesboro, Arkansas. My sincere appreciation to Miss Onken and Mrs. Finger for their assistance since my very recent appointment to chairmanship of the committee. Respectfully submitted, MILDRED BOWERS BALIMAN COMMITTEE ON T ANSFERS \ THE committee on transfers has used the same procedure as in the past few years. Chapter correspondence secretaries have reported transfers at the beginning of the school year by filling out two introductory transfer blanks: one for the chap-ter on the campus to which the girls concerned is transferring and one for the transfer chairman. After October 15, the date when the above report is listed as being due on the official calendar, this committee sent letters to all corresponding secretaries reminding them all that they should be cordial to the new Pi Phis on their campuses and urging those who had not sent in their xeports to do so at once. In the fall, letters were also sent to Province Presidents asking their cooperation with this committee by seeing during their visits with the chap ters that the transfers were being shown all possible consideration. Advisory board members in charge of transfers were asked to help where there were several transfers on the same campus by holding regular monthly meetings with those girls. All transfers received letters explaining what they might expect of the new chapters, what the general practice is regarding affiliation and what is expected of them in regard to the national organization and the local group. This year there were still more transfers than in the past few years. Eighty-six girls went from forty chapters to forty-one. Texas A headed the list with ten transfers on its campus. Illinois E had eight and both North Carolina A and Iowa Z had six. Thirteen chapters failed to report. SANCHA KILBOURN GARVEY HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE T HE Holt House Committee has carried on the work of restoration and partial furnishing as planned. Last fall some furnishings were installed downstairs and in the hostess living room and bed room. Planting was done at the front of the house. Mrs. C. C. Cary of Newton, Iowa, is hostess at Holt House greeting visitors and helping the active girls or alumnae with entertaining. Last October 17 and 18 the Pi Phis of Monmouth held open house for townspeople and Monmouth College alumna back for "homecoming." There were several hundred guests. Products of the Settlement School were displayed and many articles were sold. The chapter at Monmouth gave a rushing party and held initiation at the house. In order to make the house more complete and therefore more useful the committee hopes to complete soon furnishing of the Founders' Room, the Powder Room, and a guest bed room. This bed room would be used by visiting members of the fraternity or by parents visiting students of Mon-mouth College. It is hoped we can buy some china and plated flat silver. Holt House is now open to members of the fraternity and their friends who wish to visit it. It is available to clubs and chapters for meetings or entertaining. 63 The Holt House Committee appreciates the interest and generosity of chapters clubs and individuals. The committee wishes to thank the members of Grand Council and the Province Presidents and Province Vice-Presidents for their help and co-operation.

We break our rule of "reports only" in the September ARROW to print the following pages, which should be of assistance in planning help for the Settlement School for the coming year. EFENSE AT GATLIN 16 ,e) U G THIS is war! Every American is giving wholeheartedly of his or her time, money, and effort to promote worthwhile projects in vital war production, or in equally important measures to maintain and protect those vital "defense projects" that aim to hold fast for the future the fundamental rights and privileges of American citizenship. Such a defense project is our II B Settlement School at Gatlinburg. If we are to hold the ground so painstakingly won by loyal Pi Beta Phis in the past; if we are to protect our investment in the Smokies; if we are to preserve a source of revenue for people who have no other means of livelihood; if we are to retain the faith and friendship of the mountain people who have come to respect and admire II B (I) not because they know our inner joy of member-ship but because they have seen the benefits of our altruism we, members of II B , must make this coming year of 1942-1943 as glorious a record in contributions to the Settlement School as any in our history. To do this may be harder than in the past, but the satisfaction of our accomplishment will also be greater! It is the first task of the Settlement School Committee to plan wisely so that expenses may be held within the expected income; and our second task is to help you carry on your regular projects for the benefit of the Settlement School that this in-come may be great enough to cover the necessary expenses of such an enterprise. Settlement School income from Pi Beta Phis comes largely from three sources: sale of Arrow craft, contributions from active chapters and alumna clubs, and magazine commissions. You, in your individual clubs, can best decide what means to use for the raising of your customary contributions. In this issue you will End suggestions for your magazine sales set-up from the club which has ranked first for the past six successive years in amount of commissions earned. And the new articles added this year to our fine traditional Arrow-craft will insure your Settlement School sale being a success once more. Do you or your friends have sweethearts or husbands in the Service? Of course, you do. Then did you know you could secure black and olive drab neckties of our lovely Arrowcraft quality to go with their regulation uniforms? Or is He in the Air Corps? Then he will appreciate one of the wool scarfs for men, or perhaps the extra long "ski scarf" which is a yard and a third long and can be wrapped around several times to amply protect his throat and chest when he flies in high altitudes. The Royal Standard Chapter, Daughters of the British Empire ordered six dozen of our Frozen Mist scarfs for sale to departing aviators and aviation cadets. All aviators wear some sort of scarf why not be sure that every "Pi Phi Aviator" has an Arrowcraft scarf ? Those showers for II B I, brides make a perfect occasion for Arrowcraft towels; and think of the joy you would bring if each member of the chapter would give a place mat or napkin of Arrowcraft design to complete a luncheon set. =IONS TO AR OWCRAFT s\, THE new items? Here is the latest information from Ethel Snow, our capable Manager of Arrowcraft. First there will be three new scarfs, sparkling in color and developing the theme of last year's favorite Buckeye scarf. The "Buckeye," you re-member, was that lovely brown, brick red and white with just a touch of green in a broken plaid, designed by Winogene Redding, in charge of the weaving at our Settlement School, .and named for its portrayal of the colors in the Tennessee buck-eyes. The new ones will be in different combinations: one a new soft blue and chocolate brown, with white and a deeper blue; another a bright THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 61 red, green, yellow and black one; and the third one of lovely oriental colors. For campus and sport wear the McArthur square should prove popular, twenty-seven inches square of the traditional green, black and yellow plaid of the McArthur clan. If these should not suit your coloring, there will be two other plaids to choose from, all grand for those sweaters every college girl owns. Did you know strawberries were in season? They strayed to ladies' lingerie this year, but Arrowcraft has brought them back to the breakfast table in a dead-white doilie displaying two luscious strawberries woven in the corner. Very reasonable, these should prove welcome additions to the Arrow sets in natural linen and white, and the "utility" sets with bright borders or in conservative all white. And you will need new knitting bags for war-time knitters ! A new cylinder bag (popularly called the feed-bag) has proved a good seller at the Arrowcraft shop this summer. They look jaunty slung over the shoulder, and can be used as a carryall for First Aid notebooks, as well. A new (to me, at least) bedjacket was on display at Arrowcraft Shop last summer with a clever high neckline, and in heavenly blue, pale pink or white. They can also be secured in orchid, yellow or green. Your convalescent friends would appreciate them! Mrs, Snow also tells us there will be at least six new neckties to provide Father, Son or Friend with a new one for Christmas (although these will cost you a little more this year with war prices on wool) and that there will still be quantities of shawls, all linen towels, and a limited supply of all wool yardage and wall hangings. Speaking of shawls, don't fail to ask for some of the lovely ones woven of rich deep red, blue, green and yellow, the squares so blended and arranged that folding produces three entirely different color effects. Or you might like the gossamer white, or a pastel, for evening wear with it over your head and just a corner turned back, the fringe frames your face and neck to add allure to the simplest frock. By the time your fall order is placed, the newly . appointed Craft Advisory Committee, whom we shall introduce to you next issue, will have selected additional new items for production. Aren't you anxious to see them all and show them to your II B (1, Settlement School friends? HOW TO WIN FIRST PLACE IN MAGAZINE SALES COMMISSIONS! THE Denver Alumnae Club has consistently held first place for the largest amount of magazine commissions since 1937. This is a record of which they may be justly proud, and the story of their methods should prove an inspiration to all other alumni club magazine chairmen. Such a story is here presented by Dorothy Andrews Thebus, Colorado B, Denver's magazine chairman from 1930 to 1937. "It was in 1930, I believe, that I was asked to be magazine chairman for the Denver Alumnae Club. I had a small son, and since it was hard to leave home very often for meetings, I was glad to find I could help while remaining at home. It is a real pleasure to sell people something that they already know and like. It soon became apparent to me what wonderful opportunities for service to our Settlement School lay in this field for every alumnae club. I observed with envy the clubs whose names appeared among the first eight listed in the annual reports and thought how proud I should be if the Denver Alumnx Club would be mentioned. I was very happy when in 1932 we placed seventh and three years later were in sixth place. In 1937 I had the pleasure of seeing Denver heading the list. As much of the work of the magazine chair-man comes in November and December which is also the time of preparing for Christmas, I felt in fairness to my young son and daughter I must give up this work. It was with real regret that I asked for someone to take my place in 1937. I had be-come acquainted by phone with so many of our alumna~ and have missed my periodic chats with them. Mrs. Kenneth Snodgrass (with three children) held this position for the next two years, keeping Denver in first place. Mrs. Ralph Johnson followed (she also has small children) retaining first place and in 1940-41 reached a high for Denver of $228.00 in commissions and also second place in the per capita rating. Mrs. W. Turrell Barber, (Georgia Marrs, Colorado B '40) is chairman this year and I think has reported a new high for Denver for 1941-42. When one observes the annual magazine reports and notices that many of the smaller alumnm clubs are mentioned as highest in the "per capita" rating, it makes one realize how much the larger clubs can do with intensive work. Take, e.g., a city in which there are 300 alumna', not necessarily active in the alumni club. Nearly everyone spends at least $5.00 per year on magazines. Many spend much more. If the club could average $5.00 per member, this would be $1,500.00 in subscriptions and approximately $350.00 in commissions earned for the Settlement School. I believe it helps to figure a goal toward which to work. Our chairman keeps a card file of subscribers, also a file by months of subscriptions coming due, and systematically calls these subscribers, suggesting to them new magazines they would enjoy, special rates on magazines, etc. Many excellent suggestions for selling are given each year in the annual report in the September ARROW. Magazines make excellent gifts which are enjoyed throughout the year. Surely every II (I) has one non-II cl) friend who will gladly allow us to place his or her subscriptions. Why not ask? You are not asking for money which would not be spent anyway in just this manner. A friend of our family who used to give liquor at Christmas to his business and personal friends changed to magazines and for several years has placed the subscriptions through our club. Last 62 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW year he turned in 17 subscriptions to Life and two to Fortune. Each year our club holds a Settlement School tea at which goods from the Arrowcraft Shop are displayed and sold. This is held early in November. A table is always devoted to magazine subscriptions. This serves both as a convenience and a reminder. Mrs. Barber's husband made a beautiful poster for the table last year, having titles from many popular magazines pasted along one side as they would appear in a magazine rack. KEEP THEM 'LAST FOUNDERS' DAY the Chicago South Alumnae Club decided that rather than feast themselves at a luxurious hotel for perhaps two dollars and a half each, they would do something for someone else and still hold all the friendship and fraternity spirit so much a part of Founders' Day celebrations. Their happy solution was a "Settlement School Book Tea" held at the home of one of their members, to which contributions were brought. (They had hinted that a dollar each would be most satisfactory, but members gave as their budgets warranted.) From this wartime Founders' Day, Chicago South was able to order fifty books from a list compiled by Miss May K. Duncan, head of the department of elementary education of the University of Kentucky, as selections which would be beneficial to our Settlement School elementary grade library. Can't you just see the shining faces of our Gatlinburg youngsters when Miss Margaret Burchfield, Settlement School librarian, shows them the new books on the children's shelves at the Grace Coolidge library? Other donors this past year included the Boston Alumnae Club, whose check for twenty-five dollars provided the addition of much needed reference books; and individual members who sent down forty-three books, of which nineteen were welcome new volumes on science. The library is not entirely dependent on contributions, as library fees of twenty-five cents a semester from each high-school student plus fines of two cents a day for books held over two weeks, brought a revenue of over seventy dollars last year. Much of this was needed to replace standard high school requirements that had finally reached the discard stage after continuous usage over a period of years. The Grace Coolidge library is housed in a large room in the High School building, and is open for students three hours a day, which is all of the time it is not being used by Miss Burchfield as a class-room for English and Spanish, a regrettable condition brought on by crowded quarters. Not only are the students hungry for new books, but ade (Don't you think all husbands of magazine chairmen deserve a vote of thanks for their patience and help the many phone interruptions at meal time and their help in getting subscriptions sent in, etc.) This is very satisfying work as we have such definite results to show for our efforts. The opportunity is here for every alumnae club. Each II must do a little work and every chairman a great deal." EADING! quate reference work in the classes of our Settlement School High School demands a substantial increase in volumes for all courses. The first need for the Settlement School library is to build it up for the use of our own students. It is one department of the school which, while meeting the minimum state requirements, will not hold that standard unless continued replacements are made and new books added. The second need or perhaps a dream, but a very realistic and worthwhile dream is to b,lild the number of books to the point where package libraries may be formed and loaned for definite periods of time to the nearby communities. Through this service II B c can extend its area of influence and bring joy and education to people eager for more and better reading. While you alumna members are checking your book-shelves for donations to the U.S.O. and army and navy camps, don't forget our own "defense project" in Gatlinburg, and remember to send all the volumes that might be of value to grade or high school students there. Address them to the librarian, Miss Margaret Burchfield, II B Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tenn. She will paste a II B (I) bookplate in the front of each volume, bearing your name and the date received. Or send a copy of your favorite book so that others may share your pleasure in reading it! Or, should you have too many favorites to choose from, pick a volume from one of the lists available through the Little Pigeon news editor, and order it sent to Grace Coolidge library. Perhaps your alumnm club might like to have a Book Tea or a Book Day this year, as a supplement to the regular Settlement School projects (sale of Arrow-craft goods and regular financial contributions to the general Settlement School funds) so vital to the continuance of our endeavors to build for the staunch mountain people of Tennessee a world that is truly American.

Chapter correspondence secretaries have reported transfers at the beginning of the school year by filling out two introductory transfer blanks: one for the chap-ter on the campus to which the girls concerned is transferring and one for the transfer chairman. After October 15, the date when the above report is listed as being due on the official calendar, this committee sent letters to all corresponding secretaries reminding them all that they should be cordial to the new Pi Phis on their campuses and urging those who had not sent in their xeports to do so at once. In the fall, letters were also sent to Province Presidents asking their cooperation with this committee by seeing during their visits with the chap ters that the transfers were being shown all possible consideration. Advisory board members in charge of transfers were asked to help where there were several transfers on the same campus by holding regular monthly meetings with those girls. All transfers received letters explaining what they might expect of the new chapters, what the general practice is regarding affiliation and what is expected of them in regard to the national organization and the local group. This year there were still more transfers than in the past few years. Eighty-six girls went from forty chapters to forty-one. Texas A headed the list with ten transfers on its campus. Illinois E had eight and both North Carolina A and Iowa Z had six. Thirteen chapters failed to report.

A survey of the past year's accomplishments brings to your Settlement School Chairman a realization of how dependent we are upon cooperation, faith, unity of purpose, and genuine sincerity. With this the hardest tasks are made easy, great problems solve themselves, and then "can't be done" is accomplished. I wish to acknowledge with grateful appreciation the generous spirit and unreserved support which has made my first year as Chairman an experience so lovely that I shall be indebted forever to II B .P. Because your fine spirit of generosity has added another year of constructive development in the lives and homes of many fine mountain people, it is a happy experience to re-view the results of the Pi Phis' united effort. As a prelude to these uncertain times, the joint meeting of Grand Council and Settlement School Committee at the School June 20-23, 1941, served to establish a fine understanding between these ten representatives of our national opinion. To talk freely, to vote frankly and honestly, to enjoy personal relationship, to exchange differences of opinion and proceed toward constructive agreement was a perfect foundation for real progress at a time when changes are obligatory. We of Committee wish to express to Grand Council our appreciation for their trust and confidence and belief in our sincerity which has been expressed continuously by their generous approval and constructive support throughout the past year. At the invitation of Committee, Miss Onken served as Grand Council contact member. Through her, the committee has maintained constant and close touch with our National Officers in the belief that only by complete understanding of conditions, of Committee decisions and policies can be served well the best interests of our vital project. Miss Onken's prompt attention to details, her conscientious cooperation, her wise counsel, based upon years of intimate experience in School and Fraternity affairs, her open-minded and generous spirit has contributed at all times immeasurably to the advancement of our program and been an inspiration to those who work with her. To each member of Grand Council we are greatly indebted for ever willing assistance and immediate personal response to our frequent requests for help, This report will summarize events and conditions from July, 1941 to July, 1942. At the conclusion of Marie Hagee's term of service June, 1941, I was appointed to serve as Chairman. From Lillian Holton and Marie Hagee, the previous chairmen under whom it was my pleasure to serve, came an example of wise administration and unselfish devotion to the service which they had pledged their best effort. The advantages of intel ligent planning and wise decisions brought to new leadership a sound business structure and forward looking policies. To keep the right direction, to hold fast to the ground gained, to advance consistently toward accomplishment, to be worthy of Pi Phi trust, to clarify new goals, all these desires have been shared by five very humble and privileged Pi Phis, your Settlement School Committee. Committee members present at the June, 1941 meeting were Irene Eldridge, Beth Brainard LeRoy, Lolita Snell Prouty, Agnes Wright Spring and Ethel Hogan Copp. The retiring chairman, Marie Bacon Hagee, was invited to be present at this meeting with Grand Council. She gave valued assistance in clarifying plans and outlining policies. We thank her again for this additional service. Irene Eldridge continued as the efficient treasurer to complete four years of faithful service July 1, 1942, with a balanced budget to prove her watchfulness. Professional duties forced her to withdraw before completing her five year term. Lolita Prouty has accepted the appointment to the treasurer's position, having served as secretary during her first year on the committee. Indicative of her sincerity and serious sense of obligation to this Fraternity responsibility, Mrs. Prouty took a course in bookkeeping and typing in order to better execute her duties. With the background of a mathematics major in college and a fine record of achievement in Club, Civic and College circles, you can understand Committee's confidence in our new financial advisor. Beth LeRoy completes her third year on the Committee by earning honorable mention in the field of public relations. She distributes the films and sends out information upon request. We wish that every Club and Chapter could be inspired by Mrs. LeRoy's sincere enthusiasm. With deep human sympathy and inspired vision, she faithfully unfolds her three fold plan for Pi Phi's service to humanity through Settlement School channels. Proud we are that Mrs. LeRoy has been invited to tell the story of Settlement School not only to Pi Phis but to various church groups Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Catholic to Woman's Clubs and over the radio! It would delight any Pi Phi to know the enthusiasm of "outside" admirers. Mrs. LeRoy's inspiration and devotion to furthering Pi Phi interests was largely responsible for the outstanding success of the sale of Arrowcraft products at the New England Flower Show last October. To sell over $2,000.00 worth of Arrowcraft is in itself noteworthy. But the Fraternity and the Settlement School Committee is indebted for all time to the large group of Boston area Pi Phis whose spontaneous response to a sudden call to hard labor deserves honorable mention along with our gratitude. To the satisfaction which all Pi Phis will feel because of this national recognition of the quality and high standards of our Settlement School service, will be added the even greater joy occasioned by the complete unselfish cooperation of Boston Pi 44 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 4 Phis in their enthusiastic effort to do justice to a wonderful opportunity. In January because of ill health it became necessary for Agnes Wright Spring, Wyoming A, to resign from the committee, having served only from summer 1941. Mildred Odell Sale accepted the appointment to take Mrs. Spring's place, assuming the duties of Editor of News from Little Pigeon. In addition she will coordinate the effort to develop our library and its services. Mrs. Spring's article in the December ARROW proved so delightful a story of Settlement School that Grand Council has arranged to have it printed in booklet form to distribute to pledges. We appreciate Mrs. Spring's fine abilities and unselfish effort. We hope that re-stored good health soon will permit her again to share her talents with the Fraternity. It is good fortune indeed that brings us Mildred Sale's editorial experience, creative writing ability, and executive talents, combined with a delightful personality and alert sound judgment. The appointment of Ann Leichliter Munn, Iowa I', to fill the vacancy created by Irene Eldridge's resignation completes the fortunate group of five who will serve together for the coming year. Ann Munn's radiant charm won for her an instant place in the hearts of Committee, Staff and community. With her special training in Arts and Crafts, she brings understanding assistance to the current emphasis toward growth and expansion in this field. I have appreciated the perfect cooperation from Committee and the Director in the matter of communications, a most important part of our duties. By use of carbon copies, a duplicate of each letter is sent to each member of Committee, to the con-tact member from Grand Council and to the Grand Vice-President. This enables us to execute promptly the administration of School affairs. Always there are monthly reports, weekly letters, and frequently daily contact by letter or telegraph. In addition to normal committee correspondence, I have sent car-bon copies of all important outside correspondence to each member in order that each have the ad-vantage of first impressions. Following the 1941 summer decision of Committee to take advantage of the best possible professional opinions to clarify our plans and guide our course, a survey was made by Dr. William S. Taylor, Dean of Education of the University of Kentucky, and his associate, Professor Seay. Their evaluation of our project was given to you in the December ARROW. Subsequent detailed helpful suggestions and working plans have been submitted by Dr. Taylor, as we move toward a wider field of service. In addition to his own offer of continued service, Dr. Taylor is alert and generous in bringing to us national recognition and help in many fields of specialized service. As an example we feel now that our long needed advancement in library service is assured. May K. Duncan, Librarian at University of Kentucky, has already completed book lists for our Elementary and High Schools. Soon we hope to report the reality of an extended package library service. Several Clubs and individuals have shown enthusiastic approval of our effort to improve our library by sending selected books or money. Chicago Alumnae Club South's recent gift of fifty new books from Miss Duncan's list was substantial proof to Committee that generous Pi Phis are eager to cooperate when we make the needs known. To get a clear vision of Settlement School, w think of our one hundred acres and our thirteei buildings in the beautiful valley, so deep in th, heart of the Smokies. We think of our service ii education through our High School and our Ele mentary School. Through the conscientious effol of eight teachers in each school, half Pi Phis, hal County, our program has been most satisfactor this year. Ben Fleming has completed his secon, year as Superintendent, having advanced from firs grade through our school out to college an, back to teach. His sincerity, loyalty, and lug] ideals have combined to bring about the fine spirit of teaching cooperation that has ever bee, enjoyed at the School. Much appreciation is du his wife, Josephine Fleming, who unselfishly an, generously gives of her time and varied abilitie whenever a need presents itself. Mr. Fleming' program is made doubly full by his teaching c mathematics. Mr. Pern Price as Principal has continued to and velop the Elementary School, insure its grade . rating and increase our field of service. Mr. Prh is energetic, a fine and progressive teacher, an alert to community need. Participation in the al nual National School Week Program in the Fa brought convincing evidence of the advanced an broad trends of our educational program. Gre enthusiasm and interest was shown by both paren and pupils alike, as huge crowds gathered o "Open House Night" to inspect the School an view the results of the year's activities. Mention of the teaching staff cannot be mac without bringing to mind a picture of happy grow living which impressed your Chairman during hl first winter visit to the School. In conformani with Fraternity requirement, I went to the Scho, for a two weeks' visit in late October. This vis gives opportunity to observe and study the proje in its season of full activity. At this time the Chai man assists the Director and Staff in every possib way to carry out the plans of the administratic and the wishes of the Fraternity. It is her priN lege, as well, to further community understandir of the policies and plans and assist in maintainir a balanced and happy relationship of responsibilit An after dinner glimpse into Teacher's Cotta. living room brought surprised delight on an C tober evening.

It is an opportuni Sharing in a joyous group living which offers n opportunity for experiencing soul satisfying serv. develops womanly qualities which are highly  sirable. This is just another yardstick by which to me ure the dividends which return to Pi Phis becai of service rendered. We are not enjoying f benefits if we fail to acquaint young Pi Phi teach, with the enriching experience that may be theirs. The curriculum is being strengthened constan and changed to meet community need and progr 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW sive educational demands. Several years in advance of the State decision to make Physical Education and a Health Education course compulsory in Tennessee Schools after 1942, Pi Phi School has offered this training. Our satisfaction this year in securing a part time music teacher through W.P.A. funds was short lived. However, we will strive to make music possible in some other way since a soul satisfying educational program is incomplete without music. We will never be satisfied until we are able to fill this great lack. However, it is nice to be able to tell you that Community Sings will be held in our Auditorium or on our grounds during the coming year. Most noteworthy this year is the development of and interest in the Craft courses under John Moore. If you will read back through the reports of several Chairmen you will be reminded that the need for encouragement and education in the field of Crafts was long ago considered of real importance. The progress this year has been very satisfying. Committee is delighted to report to the Fraternity at large that a qualified group has accepted the responsibility of advising and directing the Craft program. You will remember Miss Jessie Harris, convention initiate at Ashville in 1938. Miss Harris was chosen for this Pi Phi distinction because, as Director of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee, she had won national recognition in her field and because she had rendered invaluable service to our Settlement School project over a period of years. It is now your good fortune to have the advice of Miss Harris, as well as that of her Pi Phi friend and associate, Miss Ida Anders, Iowa r, and Miss Hurd, University of Tennessee's Craft Director. These three constitute our new Craft Advisory Committee. Not only in the field of Craft, but in every field of advancement will the continuity of their vision and direction be felt. They have professional experience, national viewpoint, broad understanding of our mountain people to combine with loyalty and belief in our project. Long felt has been the need for a connecting link to prevent delay, to keep visions clear, to keep straight the path toward a greater service. With changing committee members, staff and directors, much inspirational leadership has been lost. We do welcome sincerely their generous response to our invitation to serve officially and anticipate constructive progress. Arrowcraft again brings us great distinction and clears a net profit of over $11,000.00. The amazing national merchandising achievement of Pi Phi Alumna Clubs in disposing of Arrowcraft products is primarily responsible for Arrowcraft be-coming a profitable business. Not to be overlooked, however, is the sound business ability of our Arrowcraft Director, Ethel Snow, Iowa r. Her strict attention to the safeguarding of Pi Phi interests, her excellent judgment in the merchandising, her untiring patience and promptness in dealing with our willing, but ofttimes inexperienced Alumna Chairmen, have combined fortunately to increase our Arrowcraft business. Only a small bit of concentrated effort regularly on the part of each Pi Phi is all that it will take to keep Arrow-craft a paying department and give sole means of support to many mountain families. This again reminds us of that' vast untouched field for craft endeavor which can result in a national center so worthy and so great as to be the source of untold pride and satisfaction to new generations of Pi Phis. But that is in itself a long and fascinating story a dream that can come true if Pi Phis want it. Through the combined efforts of Staff, professional advisors, and Committee, the coming year should produce many new designs and new objects to augment our lovely Arrowcraft display. We are mindful of the new and greater opportunities which curtailment of foreign trade has created. We are alert to every possibility of strengthening the economic stability of our areas. We approach this through two mediums. One is through art and craft' courses in our Schools to prepare our future workers in basic appreciation of color, form, and design. The other means is through our adult education classes and direction of hand work among mountain people which is necessary to maintain themselves. Winogene Redding continues her fine work as supervisor of our adult weaving program. Two out-standing community achievements are the results of her vision and enthusiastic effort. The Gatlin-burg Garden Club has made noteworthy improvements in the community with the planting of Dog-wood trees along the highway and two parked areas near the center of business. There has been general impetus given to home and civic beautification. Under her direction our Weaver's Guild has taken its place among America's Summer Players. Their original play "Store Britches" continues this summer as a successful contribution to the enjoyment of visitors. Next to education, we think of Pi Phi's Health Service. Continuing under the sincere direction of Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, R.N., certain needed re-organization of this important field of community service has progressed successfully. To withdraw certain services, long accepted by community, even to devote more time and energy to the field of preventive and health education, is a delicate transition. Obviously the steady growth of our community with a resident physician now available has changed the aspect of our health service. By limiting our service to needly first aid and emergency, more time can be given to health education instruction. In addition, the war emergency need for Red Cross training courses has been met adequately and with distinction by our Health Service. Difficult as it is to believe, the past year's experience shows again that the service of a regular County nurse is not available regularly in this extended area. Elizabeth Comstock Peck, California B, is be-ginning her second year as Director with the warm regard of Staff, Community, and Committee to prove how genuine and kindly is her consideration for others and how quickly she has caught the spirit of Pi Phi service to a great cause. She has been tireless in her efforts to produce congenial efficiency. The only general Staff change was made when Annette Morse, Illinois A, resigned after four years' faithful service as house manager because of her own family need. Miss Lena Hodgins of Champaign, Illinois, is deserving of the compliments that her delicious food and smooth running household bring to her. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 47 Bequests made possible two very fine accomplishments during the past year. A new Stuart dormitory for boys was built with the net sum of $9,250.00 which was left for this purpose by Anne Elizabeth Stuart, Nebraska B. With colonial influence, expressed in simple lines, and permanency assured by use of native stone, heavy hand split shingles, and slate, already there is evidenced a fulfillment of her dream. The boys are proving their pride in an adequate charming home by assuming all responsibility for its perfect upkeep. Proud the donor would be if she could glimpse the satisfaction and inspiration that her generous gift has given to those fine young people whom she so joyously served. Although there is no concrete evidence as yet in stone or wood, the sum of $1,000.00 was given to Settlement School by District of Columbia A to start a fund for Health Center improvement. To the memory of this generous unknown Pi Phi donor who chose to share her joy in giving with her chapter, we pledge ourselves to continued effort to justify her faith. We believe that soon this sum will attract enough to it to make her dream and ours come true. With so many, many Pi Phis desirous of replacing the obsolete little old building which for so long has been inadequate to our Health Service demands, we are confidently making plans and studying the advice and suggestions of experts, that we may be ready when Pi Phi generosity makes suitable housing and equipment possible. Have you ever thought ho'*w satisfactory a choice our leaders made when they gave us a philanthropy with such varied channels? Almost any individual personal preference may be satisfied. With quite natural differences of opinions as to the most worthy field, Pi Phi Fraternity has proven that unified effort can coordinate a variety of needed services into one tremendous influence for good. We shall continue our effort to acquaint our members with each step as we unfold an expanded program of usefulness. It has been a pleasure to answer the many questions asked by devoted Pi Phis. We shall continue to welcome constructive suggestions. Our Committee is trying hard to keep pace with national trends, community changes and worthy fields for :the generous expression of Pi Phi's philanthropy. We believe that no school and no welfare organization could be in a more fortunate situation to begin this uncertain period of national emergency. We are proud to report that we have no Settlement School debts and there are no involvements. Our determination is to keep our affairs in good order, do our best to maintain the standards which we have pridefully built up, fulfill the obligations to which we are pledged and upon which is dependent the greater proportion of all necessary income and to continuance of the present program committments. This we believe we can do provided the normal contributions from earned money and gifts continue. To explain this I will quote a frequently asked question "To what extent does the Settlement Schol depend upon Pi Phi contributions ?" The answer is: To exist, Settlement School is absolutely dependent upon the continuance and the receipt of the present, and recent past, average of active and alumnx contributions. Reason: The approximate running and maintenance budget in round numbers is $30,000, exclusive of Arrowcraft. Originally there was one general source for Settlement School support, namely gifts and contributions earned by Pi Phis. Gradually by development of wise business procedure two other sources were added, namely income from sources within the Fraternity, for example, the interest on the endowment and the commissions from the magazine agency, and income from practical application of business principles to the school administration as our program became more and more involved, such as sale of farm products, staff living, small fees for certain health service, and agriculture and craft courses. The third source came from the gradually shifting to State, County, and Community of such financial responsibility as their growing ability could assume, for the educational system particularly. Here I will mention an interesting fact that few Pi Phis understand. The larger proportion of increase in expenditure, as we have increased the facilities and service of our School, has come from this gradual increase in governmental appropriation. So carefully and fairly has this balance of responsibility been worked out that there has never been a question of the integrity of local government in assuming its rightful share. Nor has the State or County ever questioned Pi Phi's integrity as the growing demands forced us to request increased appropriation for teachers. With these three sources in mind, it is simple to understand that the basic income from actives and alumnae, although approximately only one-third of the total running budget, is the nucleus which at-tracts the other two-thirds. This is the foundation. If we remove or lessen our recent average contributions, we jeopardize the receipt of the other two-thirds of necessary income. By maintaining our normal average of the first third, it is quite normal to anticipate increased income from these other sources. My own personal belief is that we can carry on for the emergency at this safe level for actual Pi Phi contributions, provided they can be upheld. I believe that future bequests and Pi Phi gifts for special equipment will provide generously for new buildings as the need is evidenced through our wise determination of actual justified need_ As you know the budget for the year is deter-mined at the summer Committee meeting. Since the first third is not fixed, it becomes necessary for the Committee to take the sum of the average expectancy from study of the past several years contributions from actives and alumnae. You can well imagine our worry if alumnae clubs' contributions drop below the normal expectancy. Another frequent question is "Are Pi Phi contributions used solely for the Arrowcraft Shop ?" The answer is, No! Arrowcraft at present is self-supporting and pays it share of general running expenses of the School. (School in this sense means proiect, not educational department.) While we cannot safely predict anything in these uncertain times, it is reasonable to suppose that Arrowcraft can be counted upon to maintain itself if 48 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 1. Pi Phi alum= continue their effort to sell Arrowcraft products. 2. If the traveling public still buy in our two local shops. (This we know will suffer because of curtailment of tires.) 3. If Wage and Hour regulations upon hand looming in the home do not create a cost increase impossible to accommodate. Arrowcraft was "in the red" for many years as Pi Phi strove to rehabilitate the mountain people and this was considered a profitable procedure, our worthy contribution to human betterment. A third question often asked is "What help do we receive from Government agencies ?" The educational system receives financial help as follows: County 1. Elementary Teachers' salaries are paid to them directly by the County. This sum does not appear on our budget, either in income or disbursement. 2. Rent for Elementary School building of $1,000.00 per year. (Additional cost of maintenance and repairs is paid by Pi Phi.) 3 Some School supplies and books State and Smith-Hughes Fund 1. Three-fourths of High School Teachers' salaries. Smith-Hughes provides part salary for certain vocational courses such as agriculture and home economics. The State allows $500.00 annually for adult weaving instruction. The Health Center receives from the State Health Department serums for certain required vaccinations and injections. Regarding other governmental agencies: 1. We were able to get a part time music teacher this current year through the Works Progress Administration. This was canceled in January when all such service was discontinued by government order. 2. Several adult trade instruction classes were established under the Defense Training authority. No so called "W.P.A." funds were or are rated by the community for services such as are offered at the School other than the aforementioned music assistance (now non-existent). Often the question is asked "Why do we not rate financial assistance from certain well known Foundations ?" The answer is "We are rated as a Foundation by other Foundations. As such, we do not quality for their assistance. However, the Committee is hopeful of getting certain "gift" assistance to fulfill specified needs such as a library of fine records, scores, and machine for music appreciation community pro-gram." We are making an exhaustive study to determine just what .classification will attract other such supplementary assistance. We have the attention and sincere interest of three officials of the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. We welcome further Pi Phi help to coordinate our requests. As to further Health Center assistance we are informed by two sources of factual information, State and County, and by a national expert in governmental budgeting, that there is no possible fund available to underwrite the educational health service through which Pi Phi has raised the whole health status of a large area. There is still only one County nurse in our entire County and even this has been irregular. I invite your study and understanding of the following outline of Pi Phi sources of income which have gradually suggested themselves as sound permanent methods to serve to stabilize our project, give security, and insure in a measure our ability to meet our assumed responsibility. 1. Income from Pi Beta Phi. General Active Chapters Alumnie Clubs Individual gifts Bequests Commissions from Magazine Agency Interest on Endowment Fund Interest on Savings Account Contributions specified for furnishings or improvements Miscellaneous (Principally insurance proceeds) School Income Small fees from Agriculture Home Economics and certain Health Services Farm Products sold to outside Farm Products sold to our kitchen Staff living fees. As you study this brief analysis there is one im portant fact to take into consideration, the running administrative budget for maintenance and upkeep is comparable with that of any home for utilities, service, repairs, replacements, etc., and is separate from the teachers' salaries and supplies of the educational program. You will see that we are providing the background while State and County are largely supplying the educational program. It is an accepted fact that Schools, Libraries, and Health Services are never self-supporting. They are either endowed or supported by public or private funds. Our project will always be to large extent a welfare project, in which we supplement the basic program, as offered by a willing community, with the advantages of a sponsored program in health, education and vocational guidance. This same need for public spirited service is evidenced in every large city as well as every small community and it is expressed by privately or publicly endowed hospitals, baby clinics, schools, libraries, health centers of every description. Every public spirited Pi Phi could designate a definite need in her community, a vital one. But long ago Pi Phi became the self-elected sponsors of a definite community. From us these really worthy Anglo-Saxon people have received every inspiration for upbuilding of body and soul. To us this community will always look for guidance, inspiration and all cultural development. As they willingly and pridefully accept certain responsibilities, we are able in turn to expand our influence into an ever growing circle. As fast as Pi Phi donors wish we will grow into a center of great national educational consequence. Our facilities, our background, our past integrity, makes possible our ability to meet whatever great need the future brings to our firmly established center in the Smokies. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 To speak of a possible present emergency opportunity we of committee are seriously mindful that added burdens may rightfully come to us. Just what, how, or when, we cannot predict now. But from patriotic and loyal Pi Phis everywhere we welcome suggestions if you see a practical opportunity to increase our service. Several ideas have already been discussed whereby we might serve the cause of youth in war time. In anticipating some additional war effort we have established contact with the several agencies in Washington under whom we may be called upon to serve. Through the War Production Board's several textile departments and its Small Business Bureau we are endeavoring to find what needed articles or fabrics can be made under our supervision. Through this means we hope to stabilize the economic status of our community and use to the fullest every bit of man and woman power. We have contacted the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor through Dr. Martha Elliott and her associate, Miss Ruth Taylor, to get first hand information regarding the government's plans for service to evacuated children or families. Through Dr. Howard McCluskey, whose responsibility in the Office of Civilian Defense is the coordinating of war efforts of organization we are promised assistance that we may find our proper field. We are studying the possibilities of additional use for our facilities in the field of occupational therapy if by chance any or all of the Gatlinburg hotels should be needed for hospitalization. At the suggestion of the National Office of Civilian Defense we are contacting the regional and State offices of Civilian Defense as a means of keeping aware of needs. It is our hope and expectation that we will be ready for any war emergency service that may come to Gatlinburg to command the unified patriotic effort of thirty-three thousand Pi Phis. Respectively submitted, Settlement School Committee. ETHEL COPP, Chairman, EPO T OF THE *I\ ECTO OF THE PI ETA PHIl SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 194142 To Grand Council of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Settlement School Committee, and the Fraternity: F oR every Pi Phi who holds a cherished place in her heart for the Settlement School, there is every reason to be proud of the year just past. Highlights that stand out are the establishing and development of the Arts and Crafts program in the school; the reorganization of the Health Center to meet changing community needs; the fall visit of Dean Taylor of the University of Kentucky with his valuable survey; the completion of the new Stuart Dormitory for boys; and just this last May the annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee here at the School, which is like having five fine friends and counselors arrive at one time to help solve problems and guide policies for the best interests of Pi Phi and our School. There's a Rip Van Winkle quiet over the school grounds now that makes it hard to picture the tremendous activity of the School year. According to Mr. Fleming's report, we had the largest high school enrollment in the history of the school. Besides the regular classes in English, History, Sociology, Science, Vocational Agriculture and Vocational Home Economics, a new unit of World History was added for the tenth grade, and Spanish for the eleventh grade, Arts and Crafts for Junior and Senior students, as well as classes in first aid and home nursing. Everyone in High School has been active in the physical education program. The Bov's Basketball team was in the District Semi-finals. This year the girls had an intramural basket-ball program as well as a few inter-school games. The Agriculture and Home Economics clubs, the Press Club, and the various other school organizations had a very successful year. The Press Club sponsored the "Pi Phi Paperette" which was a page of school news incorporated in the local Gatlinburg paper. Several Community and school socials have been held in the gymnasium, and the juniors and Seniors each gave a School play. The Seniors raised funds for their trip just before Class Week. They visited Lookout Mountain, Nashville, Mammoth Cave, and Lincoln Memorial University. In the Home Economics department nutrition was stressed and low cost healthful meals were given special attention. Weaving was especially popular with the girls this year and each girl in the junior class wove a knitting bag with an all-over design, and several have woven dresser scarves with small figure inlays such as flowers or initials. The Sophomore class was larger. Two girls worked at each loom, learning each step from the making of the warp, to the threading of the loom and finally the actual weaving. In the sewing project each girl made two garments of her own choice. Two of the girls participated in the Style Show at the University of Tennessee's Open House. Each year of Home Economics is a combination course which includes foods, clothing, personal grooming, home management, child care and other topics. The boys and girls in the third year classes met together for six weeks to study "Problems in Family Living and Home Management" and lively round table discussions were held. A total of forty-eight boys were enrolled in Vocational Agriculture. The course of study for each of these boys is based on farming on the Home Farm, with emphasis being placed on food production for home first and for national defense. National Defense classes were also held and con-ducted for out-of-school youth in the various rural communities. The boys learned blacksmithing and farm machinery repair, wood-working, simple electricity, and auto mechanics. Two evening classes of farmers met and studied problems pertaining to farming and food production, under our agriculture teacher. The new courses now being taught in the Arts and Crafts department include jewelry, Metal Craft, Ceramics, Block Printing, and the Native crafts. The courses are elective for juniors and Seniors and have been very popular. In jewelry, the students studied the fundamental techniques of constructing and decorating rings set with semi-precious stones, sterling silver pins and clips, a 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW combination of copper and brass bracelets and other chains. In Metal work, they constructed plates, ash trays, bowls, lamps and candle-sticks. Laboratory problems in ceramics include the techniques of hand building of animals and figures, wheel throwing, pressing from moulds, slip-casting, glazing and firing of the kiln. The methods of textile deco-ration were also studied, including block-printing, stenciling and tie-dyeing. Several very talented students were discovered in the classes. There were also well-attended adult classes in the evenings. For its first year, genuine progress and great enthusiasm were felt in this part of the school pro-gram. The Elementary School completed an equally successful year under Pern Price, principal. One of the outstanding affairs of the year was the children's operetta, which was the very best the school has ever had. The children were beautifully trained, the costumes were clever, and the entire performance a credit to the teachers and Mr. Price who worked with the children so patiently. The story was "Peter Rabbit" so that it is not hard to visualize the cunning songs and costumes. The Movie Projector, purchased from gift funds, has been a most valuable addition to the entire school program. Educational, as well as films for entertainment have been shown regularly and the coming year promises to see it used even more frequently as we .work in conjunction with the government showing of films for defense. The report of the Health Center has special interest as it reflected the changing, yet continued very important program. Health study, First Aid Classes, Nutrition, Home Nursing, all are stressed. Mrs. Chalmers is combining a full teaching schedule with her nursing duties. In the High School all who could arrange their time to take the shortened First Aid course, did so. Adult classes in Home Nursing at the Health Center completed their studies and qualified for their certificates. With the emphasis on health instruction, preventive service in the community was not allowed to suffer, and the totals for the year were about the same as the preceding one. There was a considerable drop in the number of calls, and community service was confined to demonstrations of nursing procedures, practical instruction and strictly emergency measures. Inspections and inoculations in the School, and corrective work was done as usual. The Health Center received gifts from the local chapter of the Red Cross, and from many of the alumni clubs, all of which were very much needed and deeply appreciated. Many of these things are for the "Loan Closet" and are in frequent use, being gratefully borrowed and carefully returned. Being a year of "transition" the Health Center passed through an eventful year in which those services which we have outgrown have been eliminated, and through greater concentration on health instruction the valuable service of the Health Center will continue to assist the community toward better and safer living. From the Arrowcraft Shop comes the report that during the past year, one hundred and thirty-two alumme clubs, nine active chapters, twenty-three shops and individuals too numerous to mention have sold Arrowcraft merchandise. One of the most successful sales of the year was handled by the Boston Club at the New England Flower Show which this year had as one of its themes "The Wildflowers of the Smokies." The sales at the Arrowcraft Booth were over $2,000. One of the most important pieces of publicity of the year, was the June number of House and Garden which featured the handicrafts of the whole Southern Appalachian region. Our own "Aunt Lizzie's" photograph, as well as many others were taken here in Gatlinburg under Mrs. Snow's guidance. Arrowcraft has received many, many inquiries as a result of this publicity. The Fall Guild meeting was held in Berea, Kentucky, with five members of the school staff at-tending. The spring meeting was 'held in Knoxville, where the invitation was extended to the Guild to hold their 1942 meeting in Gatlinburg and we hope to make it outstanding. The meeting of the stock-holders of Southern Highlanders, Inc., of which Arrowcraft is a member, was held in Knoxville following the Guild meeting. It is interesting to note that Miss Jessie Harris, Director of Home Economics of the University of Tennessee, and our Asheville initiate, was elected a Director for the coming year. The weavers for the Shop had more work than ever before last year. There was a total of ninety-eight weavers on the books and there were eighty-seven working at one time just before Christmas. The Weaving meetings have been well attended. With the cost of living increasing for them as well as everyone else, there are many families where the weaving is needed more than ever. The reports of Arrowcraft, Health Center, and Sch6ol show a unity of effort in carrying out the ideals of the fraternity in constructive aid and service in this community. If war emergency needs make demands upon us, it will be the desire of the entire staff to meet these demands, and to continue to give their very best efforts to the School, which is just as dear to everyone in Gatlinburg as it is to every Pi Phi! Respectfully submitted, ELIZABETH COMSTOCK PECK, Director, Pi Beta Phi School. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORT ON AUDIT OF Ti'EASUI.E 'S ACCOUNTS YEA ENDED JUNE 30, 1942, 51 August 3, 1942 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Bice of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1942. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the subsidiary records kept for the School and the Arrowcraft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1942, and the income and expenses for the fiscal year then ended, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from Club and Chapter contributions, which are shown in detail in Schedule 3-a, and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the Treasurer. The cash balance at Milwaukee was verified by us. The endowment securities and cash, except cash in transit, which we verified, were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's report was accepted without further verification except that we checked the accounting made of changes in investments and the income from securities and found in it good order. COMMENTS Cash Balances The cash balances at June 30, 1942, exclusive of cash with the endowment Trustees or in transit, consisted of the following: Milwaukee Account: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's checking account $ 7,922.97 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank School check ing account 793:45 Sevier County Bank Dormitory building account 79.06 Sevier County Bank Arts and Crafts acount 223.39 Gatlinburg Arrowcraft Accounts: Sevier County Bank Checking ac count 6,814.50 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 2,986.64 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 4,218.46 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 4,780.04 Petty cash funds at Gatlinburg 45.00 Total $27,863.51 As indicated above, we verified the balances in Milwaukee accounts while those at Sevierville or Knoxville were verified by Homer K. Jones and Company according to their report. The above balances do not include magazine agency receipts in the custody of Mrs. C. M. Purdunn who reported a balance due the Settlement School on May 15, 1942 of $3,216.27. In accordance with previous practice the magazine agency receipts taken into account by the Settlement School Treasurer for the fiscal year consisted only of the remittances from Mrs. Purdunn which totaled $3,000.00. Accounts Receivable The Arrowcraft accounts receivable at June 30, 1942 amounted to $6,710.25 and were due principally from alumni clubs. These accounts, which we did not verify, were listed in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company and were $162.02 greater than those at the close of the previous year. Fixed Assets Expenditures for additions to buildings, equipment and landscaping amounted to $12,480.37 for the year under ieview. Included in this total is $9,122.94 for the new Stuart Dormitory and $1,703.12 for new equipment for this dormitory, a total of $10,826.06. As indicated above, the expenditures for the new dormitory were evidently not included in the Gatlinburg audit. All additions to the property accounts are shown in Schedule 2. It may be noted that the old Stuart Cottage which was razed was removed from the books and its estimated book value of $450.00 ($2,011.02 less depreciation of $1,561.02) less salvage receipts of $25.00, was charged off to expense. Depreciation of the buildings and equipment, computed at rates used in the past, totaled $3,259.04 as shown in the same schedule. Lists sent to us indicated that most of the equipment at Gatlinburg had been inventoried at June 30, 1942 and it seemed advisable to enter the inventory values on the records in lieu of the depreciated book values. However, examination of these inventories revealed that at least the machinery and equipment in the vocational school building (industrial building) had not been listed or valued so no change was made on the records. In your particular case we believe that it would be preferable to have the present inventory values of equipment on the books rather than those now shown, if the inventories can be completed. Endowment The only changes in the endowment principal for the year under review consisted of the appropriation of three-fourths of the chapter contributions, or $1,307.75, offset to a slight extent by losses on securities of $62.03, the fund showing a net increase of $1,245.72. No amortization of bond premiums is charged against income by the Trustee although the securities on hand cost $1,710.05 more than par value. However, the market value of the securities at June 30, 1942 was $132.51 more than cost as shown in the list in Schedule 1 according to the Trustee's report. 52 .THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Current Income and Expenses The expenses of the Settlement School exceeded operating income by $6,977.50 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $12,578.43. The Settlement School expenses included depreciation of $3,259.04, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores but which is not charged to this department. The Arrowcraft net income was $1,524.65 less than that of the previous year although the sales of $54,651.28 were approximately the same as those for 1940-1941. The sales at the Mountain View Hotel which are ordinarily quite profitable fell off somewhat with a decrease in gross profit of $656.18. An accounting of the net income is presented as follows: Net income of Arrowcraft division . . . . $12,578.43 Deficit in operation of Settlement School 6,977.50 Net income $ 5,600.93 Accounted for as follows: Increase in Arrowcraft inventories $ 4,004.41 Increase in ArroWcraft receivables Increase in farm live-stock Expenditures for build ing and equipment $12,480.37 Less depreciation for year 3,259.04 $ 9,221.33 Less Stuart Cottage charged off 450.00 8,771,33 Increase in prepaid in surance 505.51 $13,594.27 Less decrease in cash balances and cash items on hand 9,301.09 $ 4,293,18 Transfer of funds to endowment principal 1,307.75 Total as above $ 5,600.93 It may be observed that the Arrowcraft inventories have been increasing each year and that a substantial portion of the net income is invested in the finished goods and materials on hand. This is probably a normal situation but in any case the insurance coverage on these inventories should be carefully watched. Respectfully submitted, REILLY, PENNER AN!)

We break our rule of "reports only" in the September ARROW to print the following pages, which should be of assistance in planning help for the Settlement School for the coming year. EFENSE AT GATLIN 16 ,e) U G THIS is war! Every American is giving wholeheartedly of his or her time, money, and effort to promote worthwhile projects in vital war production, or in equally important measures to maintain and protect those vital "defense projects" that aim to hold fast for the future the fundamental rights and privileges of American citizenship. Such a defense project is our II B Settlement School at Gatlinburg. If we are to hold the ground so painstakingly won by loyal Pi Beta Phis in the past; if we are to protect our investment in the Smokies; if we are to preserve a source of revenue for people who have no other means of livelihood; if we are to retain the faith and friendship of the mountain people who have come to respect and admire II B (I) not because they know our inner joy of member-ship but because they have seen the benefits of our altruism we, members of II B , must make this coming year of 1942-1943 as glorious a record in contributions to the Settlement School as any in our history. To do this may be harder than in the past, but the satisfaction of our accomplishment will also be greater! It is the first task of the Settlement School Committee to plan wisely so that expenses may be held within the expected income; and our second task is to help you carry on your regular projects for the benefit of the Settlement School that this in-come may be great enough to cover the necessary expenses of such an enterprise. Settlement School income from Pi Beta Phis comes largely from three sources: sale of Arrow craft, contributions from active chapters and alumna clubs, and magazine commissions. You, in your individual clubs, can best decide what means to use for the raising of your customary contributions. In this issue you will End suggestions for your magazine sales set-up from the club which has ranked first for the past six successive years in amount of commissions earned. And the new articles added this year to our fine traditional Arrow-craft will insure your Settlement School sale being a success once more. Do you or your friends have sweethearts or husbands in the Service? Of course, you do. Then did you know you could secure black and olive drab neckties of our lovely Arrowcraft quality to go with their regulation uniforms? Or is He in the Air Corps? Then he will appreciate one of the wool scarfs for men, or perhaps the extra long "ski scarf" which is a yard and a third long and can be wrapped around several times to amply protect his throat and chest when he flies in high altitudes. The Royal Standard Chapter, Daughters of the British Empire ordered six dozen of our Frozen Mist scarfs for sale to departing aviators and aviation cadets. All aviators wear some sort of scarf why not be sure that every "Pi Phi Aviator" has an Arrowcraft scarf ? Those showers for II B I, brides make a perfect occasion for Arrowcraft towels; and think of the joy you would bring if each member of the chapter would give a place mat or napkin of Arrowcraft design to complete a luncheon set. =IONS TO AR OWCRAFT s\, THE new items? Here is the latest information from Ethel Snow, our capable Manager of Arrowcraft. First there will be three new scarfs, sparkling in color and developing the theme of last year's favorite Buckeye scarf. The "Buckeye," you re-member, was that lovely brown, brick red and white with just a touch of green in a broken plaid, designed by Winogene Redding, in charge of the weaving at our Settlement School, .and named for its portrayal of the colors in the Tennessee buck-eyes. The new ones will be in different combinations: one a new soft blue and chocolate brown, with white and a deeper blue; another a bright THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 61 red, green, yellow and black one; and the third one of lovely oriental colors. For campus and sport wear the McArthur square should prove popular, twenty-seven inches square of the traditional green, black and yellow plaid of the McArthur clan. If these should not suit your coloring, there will be two other plaids to choose from, all grand for those sweaters every college girl owns. Did you know strawberries were in season? They strayed to ladies' lingerie this year, but Arrowcraft has brought them back to the breakfast table in a dead-white doilie displaying two luscious strawberries woven in the corner. Very reasonable, these should prove welcome additions to the Arrow sets in natural linen and white, and the "utility" sets with bright borders or in conservative all white. And you will need new knitting bags for war-time knitters ! A new cylinder bag (popularly called the feed-bag) has proved a good seller at the Arrowcraft shop this summer. They look jaunty slung over the shoulder, and can be used as a carryall for First Aid notebooks, as well. A new (to me, at least) bedjacket was on display at Arrowcraft Shop last summer with a clever high neckline, and in heavenly blue, pale pink or white. They can also be secured in orchid, yellow or green. Your convalescent friends would appreciate them! Mrs, Snow also tells us there will be at least six new neckties to provide Father, Son or Friend with a new one for Christmas (although these will cost you a little more this year with war prices on wool) and that there will still be quantities of shawls, all linen towels, and a limited supply of all wool yardage and wall hangings. Speaking of shawls, don't fail to ask for some of the lovely ones woven of rich deep red, blue, green and yellow, the squares so blended and arranged that folding produces three entirely different color effects. Or you might like the gossamer white, or a pastel, for evening wear with it over your head and just a corner turned back, the fringe frames your face and neck to add allure to the simplest frock. By the time your fall order is placed, the newly . appointed Craft Advisory Committee, whom we shall introduce to you next issue, will have selected additional new items for production. Aren't you anxious to see them all and show them to your II B (1, Settlement School friends? HOW TO WIN FIRST PLACE IN MAGAZINE SALES COMMISSIONS! THE Denver Alumnae Club has consistently held first place for the largest amount of magazine commissions since 1937. This is a record of which they may be justly proud, and the story of their methods should prove an inspiration to all other alumni club magazine chairmen. Such a story is here presented by Dorothy Andrews Thebus, Colorado B, Denver's magazine chairman from 1930 to 1937. "It was in 1930, I believe, that I was asked to be magazine chairman for the Denver Alumnae Club. I had a small son, and since it was hard to leave home very often for meetings, I was glad to find I could help while remaining at home. It is a real pleasure to sell people something that they already know and like. It soon became apparent to me what wonderful opportunities for service to our Settlement School lay in this field for every alumnae club. I observed with envy the clubs whose names appeared among the first eight listed in the annual reports and thought how proud I should be if the Denver Alumnx Club would be mentioned. I was very happy when in 1932 we placed seventh and three years later were in sixth place. In 1937 I had the pleasure of seeing Denver heading the list. As much of the work of the magazine chair-man comes in November and December which is also the time of preparing for Christmas, I felt in fairness to my young son and daughter I must give up this work. It was with real regret that I asked for someone to take my place in 1937. I had be-come acquainted by phone with so many of our alumna~ and have missed my periodic chats with them. Mrs. Kenneth Snodgrass (with three children) held this position for the next two years, keeping Denver in first place. Mrs. Ralph Johnson followed (she also has small children) retaining first place and in 1940-41 reached a high for Denver of $228.00 in commissions and also second place in the per capita rating. Mrs. W. Turrell Barber, (Georgia Marrs, Colorado B '40) is chairman this year and I think has reported a new high for Denver for 1941-42. When one observes the annual magazine reports and notices that many of the smaller alumnm clubs are mentioned as highest in the "per capita" rating, it makes one realize how much the larger clubs can do with intensive work. Take, e.g., a city in which there are 300 alumna', not necessarily active in the alumni club. Nearly everyone spends at least $5.00 per year on magazines. Many spend much more. If the club could average $5.00 per member, this would be $1,500.00 in subscriptions and approximately $350.00 in commissions earned for the Settlement School. I believe it helps to figure a goal toward which to work. Our chairman keeps a card file of subscribers, also a file by months of subscriptions coming due, and systematically calls these subscribers, suggesting to them new magazines they would enjoy, special rates on magazines, etc. Many excellent suggestions for selling are given each year in the annual report in the September ARROW. Magazines make excellent gifts which are enjoyed throughout the year. Surely every II (I) has one non-II cl) friend who will gladly allow us to place his or her subscriptions. Why not ask? You are not asking for money which would not be spent anyway in just this manner. A friend of our family who used to give liquor at Christmas to his business and personal friends changed to magazines and for several years has placed the subscriptions through our club. Last 62 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW year he turned in 17 subscriptions to Life and two to Fortune. Each year our club holds a Settlement School tea at which goods from the Arrowcraft Shop are displayed and sold. This is held early in November. A table is always devoted to magazine subscriptions. This serves both as a convenience and a reminder. Mrs. Barber's husband made a beautiful poster for the table last year, having titles from many popular magazines pasted along one side as they would appear in a magazine rack. KEEP THEM 'LAST FOUNDERS' DAY the Chicago South Alumnae Club decided that rather than feast themselves at a luxurious hotel for perhaps two dollars and a half each, they would do something for someone else and still hold all the friendship and fraternity spirit so much a part of Founders' Day celebrations. Their happy solution was a "Settlement School Book Tea" held at the home of one of their members, to which contributions were brought. (They had hinted that a dollar each would be most satisfactory, but members gave as their budgets warranted.) From this wartime Founders' Day, Chicago South was able to order fifty books from a list compiled by Miss May K. Duncan, head of the department of elementary education of the University of Kentucky, as selections which would be beneficial to our Settlement School elementary grade library. Can't you just see the shining faces of our Gatlinburg youngsters when Miss Margaret Burchfield, Settlement School librarian, shows them the new books on the children's shelves at the Grace Coolidge library? Other donors this past year included the Boston Alumnae Club, whose check for twenty-five dollars provided the addition of much needed reference books; and individual members who sent down forty-three books, of which nineteen were welcome new volumes on science. The library is not entirely dependent on contributions, as library fees of twenty-five cents a semester from each high-school student plus fines of two cents a day for books held over two weeks, brought a revenue of over seventy dollars last year. Much of this was needed to replace standard high school requirements that had finally reached the discard stage after continuous usage over a period of years. The Grace Coolidge library is housed in a large room in the High School building, and is open for students three hours a day, which is all of the time it is not being used by Miss Burchfield as a class-room for English and Spanish, a regrettable condition brought on by crowded quarters. Not only are the students hungry for new books, but ade (Don't you think all husbands of magazine chairmen deserve a vote of thanks for their patience and help the many phone interruptions at meal time and their help in getting subscriptions sent in, etc.) This is very satisfying work as we have such definite results to show for our efforts. The opportunity is here for every alumnae club. Each II must do a little work and every chairman a great deal." EADING! quate reference work in the classes of our Settlement School High School demands a substantial increase in volumes for all courses. The first need for the Settlement School library is to build it up for the use of our own students. It is one department of the school which, while meeting the minimum state requirements, will not hold that standard unless continued replacements are made and new books added. The second need or perhaps a dream, but a very realistic and worthwhile dream is to b,lild the number of books to the point where package libraries may be formed and loaned for definite periods of time to the nearby communities. Through this service II B c can extend its area of influence and bring joy and education to people eager for more and better reading. While you alumna members are checking your book-shelves for donations to the U.S.O. and army and navy camps, don't forget our own "defense project" in Gatlinburg, and remember to send all the volumes that might be of value to grade or high school students there. Address them to the librarian, Miss Margaret Burchfield, II B Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tenn. She will paste a II B (I) bookplate in the front of each volume, bearing your name and the date received. Or send a copy of your favorite book so that others may share your pleasure in reading it! Or, should you have too many favorites to choose from, pick a volume from one of the lists available through the Little Pigeon news editor, and order it sent to Grace Coolidge library. Perhaps your alumnm club might like to have a Book Tea or a Book Day this year, as a supplement to the regular Settlement School projects (sale of Arrow-craft goods and regular financial contributions to the general Settlement School funds) so vital to the continuance of our endeavors to build for the staunch mountain people of Tennessee a world that is truly American. NlILDRED ODELL SALE Editor, News From Little Pigeon Committee ep rts COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION T HE most interesting news of the year, concerning extension, has been the granting of a charter to II E at DePauw University by the unanimous vote of Grand Council and the chapters in the Province. Due to the postponement of the 1942 Convention, II 1 E was unable to submit its petition for the charter to Convention, the permission for which had been previously announced. The committee on extension wishes to congratulate our newest chapter and tell them how proud we are of the splendid showing they have made during this year of colonization. So in Indiana Epsilon is added a chapter fully worthy of II B cl). All inquiries have been met with cordial re sponse but to date nothing of interest has developed. Inquiries have come from A Sorority at American University, Washington, D.C.; from A A M Sorority at Massachusetts State, Amherst; from a group at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; and from the Dean at Arkansas State College, Jonesboro, Arkansas. My sincere appreciation to Miss Onken and Mrs. Finger for their assistance since my very recent appointment to chairmanship of the committee. Respectfully submitted, MILDRED BOWERS BALIMAN COMMITTEE ON T ANSFERS \ THE committee on transfers has used the same procedure as in the past few years. Chapter correspondence secretaries have reported transfers at the beginning of the school year by filling out two introductory transfer blanks: one for the chap-ter on the campus to which the girls concerned is transferring and one for the transfer chairman. After October 15, the date when the above report is listed as being due on the official calendar, this committee sent letters to all corresponding secretaries reminding them all that they should be cordial to the new Pi Phis on their campuses and urging those who had not sent in their xeports to do so at once. In the fall, letters were also sent to Province Presidents asking their cooperation with this committee by seeing during their visits with the chap ters that the transfers were being shown all possible consideration. Advisory board members in charge of transfers were asked to help where there were several transfers on the same campus by holding regular monthly meetings with those girls. All transfers received letters explaining what they might expect of the new chapters, what the general practice is regarding affiliation and what is expected of them in regard to the national organization and the local group. This year there were still more transfers than in the past few years. Eighty-six girls went from forty chapters to forty-one. Texas A headed the list with ten transfers on its campus. Illinois E had eight and both North Carolina A and Iowa Z had six. Thirteen chapters failed to report. SANCHA KILBOURN GARVEY HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE T HE Holt House Committee has carried on the work of restoration and partial furnishing as planned. Last fall some furnishings were installed downstairs and in the hostess living room and bed room. Planting was done at the front of the house. Mrs. C. C. Cary of Newton, Iowa, is hostess at Holt House greeting visitors and helping the active girls or alumnae with entertaining. Last October 17 and 18 the Pi Phis of Monmouth held open house for townspeople and Monmouth College alumna back for "homecoming." There were several hundred guests. Products of the Settlement School were displayed and many articles were sold. The chapter at Monmouth gave a rushing party and held initiation at the house. In order to make the house more complete and therefore more useful the committee hopes to complete soon furnishing of the Founders' Room, the Powder Room, and a guest bed room. This bed room would be used by visiting members of the fraternity or by parents visiting students of Mon-mouth College. It is hoped we can buy some china and plated flat silver. Holt House is now open to members of the fraternity and their friends who wish to visit it. It is available to clubs and chapters for meetings or entertaining. 63 The Holt House Committee appreciates the interest and generosity of chapters clubs and individuals. The committee wishes to thank the members of Grand Council and the Province Presidents and Province Vice-Presidents for their help and co-operation.
