Further honor was paid to he new chapter by the presence of Amy Burn-~arn Honorary Grand President, Lolita ;hell Prouty, 'Counsellor for Chapter House :orporations, Mary Cooper Frost, former provnce president, and a large group of distin-;uished alumnae from Denver, Laramie and iearby places.

THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Credit for success goes to, the fine Fort 'Collins alumnae, the advisory board with Joyce Everitt as chairman. Lilla Bryan Morgan, Texas B, wife of the president of the college, Evalyn Prouty Lewis, Colorado A, of the house corporation, and many others who had each a share in the welcome to the new chapter. All were especially happy at the fine greetings from Panhellenic, and at the local interest shown by the large attendance at the reception which closed the festivities. ---   The Panhellenic Association of Dallas, Texas, recently had a 15-minute program period over the Dallas Times-Herald KRLD-TV station. The program was slanted toward giving in-formation to girls who are entering college, with explanations of rushing procedures of the present. The program was so widely received and so favorably regarded that it will be continued as a permanent pre-rushing feature. For the information about it we are indebted to Margrette Grubbs Nance, Delta Gamma, who was co-chairman of the project. t The Centennial Committee is set up. The six clubs nominated by the PVPs in Miami, and elected by the Alumnae Session, have chosen the members, and Grand Council has selected the first chairman. Here are the members: flew~ FROM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by Louise Wheelock Dobler, Washington Beta THE MAY, 1954 meeting of your Settle ment School 'Committee was an all-time high for replacing key personnel in Gatlinburg. Before arriving there the resignation of Joni Newcomer, the vivacious all-capable assistant to the Director, had been announced and Joni had asked to be relieved by mid-June to realize a planned European vacation. That meant prompt action, for it was necessary for a successor to be coached before the opening of the Summer Workshop which was set for mid-July. Before that replacement was consummated, Miss Ruth Dyer, who had served as Director since the summer of 1943, announced her resignation to become effective in August! Fortunately for the committee, the school, the town, and Pi Phi, what seemed the impossible was almost readily achieved.' It just so happened that among the University of Tennessee students who were doing practice teaching in our high school, was one Tennessee Gamma Pi Phi, Nancy Jo Hayes, who was qualified for, and accepted the position as assistant to the Director. Joni immediately introduced her to her new duties, and Nancy Jo was back in Gatlinburg following her graduation in plenty of time to assist Miss Dyer in setting up the Workshop facilities, and she continues as an able and attractive addition to our year-round staff. To succeed Miss Dyer, the committee was unanimously agreed that Marion Webb Mueller (Mrs. A. G. and pronounced "Miller"), Indiana Gamma, who had been serving as Manager of Arrowcraft since Ethel Snow left in the fall of 1952, would be the ideal choice. She had been living in the Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House, was acquainted with the demands of the job, and familiar with all our activity in Gatlinburg. Then, too, she could continue to oversee the affairs at Arrowcraft until a new manager could be found. Pi Phi is indeed fortunate that Marion accepted the challenge, and she assumed the new role when Miss Dyer left in August. A farewell for Ruth, which was held in the Staff House on one of the summer's hottest days, brought more than 100 friends and townspeople to wish her well. Her plansfor the future include a chance for a complete rest and visiting with her family. With her go the gratitude of the Fraternity for a job well done and wishes for best of luck and happiness from Pi Phis everywhere. At the same time we heartily welcome Mrs. Mueller. Her personality, enthusiasm and ability assure continued success for our philanthropy in the Smokies. The Pi Beta Phi School in. Gatlinburg is in capable hands.

Accordingly a plan to establish a piano fund was launched on Chapter Loyalty Day when actives and alumni the country over were asked to join in a "Penny Parade." Enough pennies (and dollars) were collected by the 144 cooperating chapters and clubs to realize the sum of $565.32 by the time the Committee met in Gatlinburg in May. A dealer in Knoxville al-lowed a school discount and it was a thrill to have the piano, a Storey and Clark" spinet with bench to match, purchased and delivered during the time of committee meeting. The piano adds musical pleasure as well as beauty as a furnishing a fact attested to by the resident staff and Summer Workshop students.
