It is with sincere regret we break these ties, but the many beautiful and worthwhile things Gene has accomplished while at Arrowcraft will continue to live in the memories of all Pi Phis who were privileged to know her and enjoy her work. When Gene came to Gatlinburg in 1925 she found a sleepy little mountain village with electricity only when there was enough water in the river to make it. There were no telephones then and a radio was an unheard of thing. In the twenty years since she came to Arrowcraft as the "weave boss" she has seen Gatlinburg progress from an isolated mountain community to a modern incorporated town. Now it boasts of 1600 population, four very up-to-date modern hotels, a library, Post Office, telephone exchange, four churches and a four lane highway with sidewalks. In 1926 Arrowcraft was born and Gene has put much effort, enthusiasm and interest into making it the thriving business Pi Beta Phi enjoys at the present time. She has been responsible for the many beautiful woven articles which Pi Phis all over the country prize. Arrow-craft started with six weavers and as the business grew, more and more women were employed until we had, at one time last year, 123 weavers working for Arrowcraft. Gene brought something more than just the economic aspect of weaving into the lives of these mountain women. The weavers first met in small informal gatherings, and out of these there, the Weaver's Guild developed. This organization taught them the lessons of cooperation and as a result they have planned and enjoyed working on many projects together. This social outlet has been a broadening influence in their everyday mode of life. They have been exposed to University Extension lectures, preachers, artists, and whoever else could bring them a message to help them educationally. Gene not only possessed the technical knowledge of weaving but has helped the adults inthe community to raise the artistic quality their finished materials. Her ability in worki with people gradually gained the confides and friendship of these reticent, retiring mol taineers. It has taken constant supervision a much patience to arrive at and maintain i standard of work which we have achieved. Gene has been a trusted and understands friend of the mountain women and the imps sion she has left on their lives is valuable them and to Pi Beta Phi. Meta Schattschneider With Gene's accomplishments and sere in mind, the committee realized full well w: a difficult job was ahead to find someone fill her place. The person must be a mas Miss Meta Schattschneider New Weaving Supervisor at Arrowcraft craftsman in weaving with a fine appreciat and understanding of people. She must b promoter and an enthusiastic believer in ha work with the ability to communicate enthusiasm to the women with whom she co 285 86 THE MARCH ARROW Arrowca f t Shop Is located on the main highway through Gatlinburg York. She must possess patience and kindliness Lnd be able to understand the mountain people nd gain their confidence and friendship. She nust have a knowledge of production. It was the opinion of the committee that vliss Meta Schattschneider would meet these .equirements. She was elected in the late sumner and agreed to assume her responsibilities .t Gatlinburg in October. The committee now .ealizes its good fortune in this selection of a veaving supervisor, for Miss Meta immediately nade a place for herself at the school and in he community. From early childhood her father taught her o use her hands to make lovely things and to eek the beauty in things about her. Due to hat early training and a natural talent, she ias an unusual gift in creativity and ingenuity. ;he has a fine sense of design and an innate eeling for color and is capable of expressing ler ideas in a variety of interesting and beauti-'ul ways. She possesses an inquiring mind and s continually striving to improve her work. Miss vleta is one of few who has the right combinaion of skill in crafts, sensitivity to art values, .nd an interest in human beings. Along withher many accomplishments in the field of art, she is an able pianist and violinist. Miss Schattschneider comes to her work at the Settlement School with an excellent back-ground in her educational training and experience. Following her graduation at the DeForest High School at DeForest, Wisconsin, she earned her diploma at the Whitewater State Teachers' College in Wisconsin, and a second diploma from the Pratt Institute of Brooklyn, New York. Miss Schattschneider continued her education at Teachers College at Columbia University and earned the B.S. degree in 1933. She then entered upon her graduate study at the University of Wisconsin and at Teachers College of Columbia University and was awarded her Master's degree from Columbia in 1943. Miss Schattschneider has had wide experience in her teaching which was started in the grade schools in Wisconsin where she handled the first five grades. For five years she taught art and supervised art work in grades one to twelve in the school systems of Wyoming, Delaware. From 1938 to 1945, she continued her THE MARCH ARROW 287 teaching of art and supervisory work in the schools of Claymont, Delaware. During the summers of 1942 and 1944, Miss Meta was on the staff of the Oneonta State Teachers' College of Cragsmoor, New York, where she offered work in weaving and stitchery. In 1944, she was in charge of a similar crafts program for the Woodstock Guild of Craftsmen at Woodstock, New York. This variety of experience brings Miss Schattschneider to her present position with an unusual preparation for the many and varied duties at the Settlement School. School Activities This last fall has been an interesting and eventful one at the school. Ben Fleming reports the school had the best start of any year since Pearl Harbor, with three hundred enrolled in the Elementary School and one hundred in the High School. The P.T.A. hot lunch program is proving a success for the second consecutive year, with 220 youngsters fed each day. A new storage type electric refrigerator has been purchased for the lunch room. The ladies made a contribution of $50.00 to a ditto machine for the use of the Elementary School teachers. The new physical education teacher, Don Spargo, is contributing much to the school and community. Under his direction a program of basketball for boys, girls, and the community has been in full swing. The county allowed the use of the school bus to transport the teams to nearby places. The merchants in town were asked to pro-vide jackets for the Basketball team. These have the name of the firm on the back and while they are expensive, the ladies reported that no one approached had refused to cooperate in the project. An open letter to the merchants of Gatlinburg states: "On behalf of the committee; the athletic director and the students wish to thank the merchants of Gatlinburg who so graciously responded to our re-quest to sponsor warm-up jackets for the basket ball team. The jackets are most attractive and we know our merchants will take a personal pride in the students carrying his name-and the students and players equally honored in wearing them. We know the team will do their best in competition. We are also very grateful to the following for their contributions to our athletic funds. The Lions Club, the American Legion, Mr. Emmert, Mr. Medlin and Mrs. Isabelle Cron." Mrs. F. Lang, Chairman Mrs. R. Creswell Mrs. J. Donohoe. On November 20 in a high school assembly, twenty-two girls received Home Nursing pins. They had satisfactorily completed the specified course offered by the American Red Cross under the teaching direction of the Home Economics Instructor, Miss Sue Landrum, and the School Nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers. The girls were proud and delighted to have these pins presented to them. A student Council has been organized in the High School with the following statement of rules and purposes: "Student Council Presents: Members of the Student Council of Pi Beta Phi High School present the following laws which were compiled by the council with the knowledge and support of the faculty to the students of Pi Beta Phi High School. These are the laws we wish to be governed by in order that we may attain better school cooperation, more school loyalty, and a better school in which to work and play: 1. We will respect each other and our teachers at all times, especially during school hours. 2. No student shall leave the school ground during school hours without permission. 3. No student shall smoke on school property. 4. No student shall use violent language on school property. 5.

Holidays A Gala Time Miss Dyer's letter about the Christmas festi'v ities at the School makes one yearn to be ther to see the many interesting and lovely things tha are accomplished. She writes: "Arrowcraft Shop looked so nice this holi day season. The girls decorated the window with greens and candles and Miss Meta made window picture, a picture of angels, the Chri!

The teachers came over here and we them out and wrapped the ones that it. Some came wrapped and labeled as and sex. These gifts were given out at )arties. The teachers got candy and the room mothers made cookies for refreshments. They all get such a thrill out of their presents that it is worth the work to get them. "I did not have enough gifts, so spent five dollars that a Pi Phi daughter sent me for thirteen boxes of marbles, four books, and ten crayolas and ten coloring books. At the big program on Thursday morning we gave an orange to each student and teacher and also to the little pre-school children who came to the program. "I wish you could have been here to see our program. Our curtains with the cyclorama just make any program nicer. Patsy King, child of a cook we had last year, appeared between curtains, dressed in one of the choir cottas and THE MARCH ARROW 289 holding a book that Miss Meta made for them. `Christmas Story' in red was on the cover. Patsy would read and then the curtains would part and there would be an appropriate tableau on the stage while the children from different grades sang appropriate carols and Christmas songs. The stage was simply trimmed but the scenes were effective. The craft boys made a pretty manger and Marjorie's Chase doll was the baby Jesus. Miss Lapp and Miss Grove had made lovely angel wings and halos for two lovely girls. The shepherds and the wise men were all there. It really was sweet !" "Miss Petrie, our Arts and Crafts teacher writes of the Christmas celebration "Our school Christmas the best I have ever known it to be. Mrs. Armstrong, in spite of a bad cold, gave an excellent program. "My effort for the season turned out better than I dared hope. I explained a creche to the 4th, 5th and 6th grades, gave each child his first piece of clay and asked him to model a figure to be used in a creche of our own: then I selected the best and fired them in our new kiln. The figures were crude and rough but there was the feel of what each was de-signed to be and the result of the whole thing when arranged on our hall table was very sweet and brought comments from many callers." How fine for the children to be taught to create for themselves! At our school we are giving the youngsters a complete and broadening education, exposing them to experiences they will carry with them into later life.

THE MARCH ARROW Pi Beta Phi Loses a Friend Gatlinburg and the Pi Beta Phi School suffered a great loss when Charley Ogle passed away last December 10, 1945. Mr. Ogle was a leading citizen of Gatlinburg and a devoted friend of our school. The entire community mourns his death. i excerpt from Agnes Spring's article on ;ettlement School tells us of the interest the family has had in the School these many very visitor to Gatlinburg takes a ramble through ,ey Ogles's store a many-roomed building in you can find everything from a hair pin to a m range and a T-bone steak. It was Charley who, a boy, rounded up all' of the firecrackers in 3urg and set them off all at once when it was ed that *them wimmin' (our Pi Phis); were to stay and run the school in Gatlinburg. .Ithough Pi Beta Phi entered the mountains with .vowed intention of staying and of establishing =anent school, the local people were slow in g the promised cooperation. They had had no ience with purely altruistic projects and many skeptical about the religious affiliations of the is. Then the matter of providing land and a permalocation for the School dragged on and on with ng being accomplished, Mrs. Helmick, the chair-of the Settlement School Committee, issued an atum. She said that it was customary in most s for the business men to support movements as ours, and that the people must do their part ying land and thus assuring us that they wanted chool. If they did not do so by a certain hour chool would be moved elsewhere. he story of how Andy Huff was sent for at his er camp eight miles away, and of how Mrs. urged him not to let the school go away is ing. Andy Huff and Steve Whaley headed a ription list with $250 each, and then proceeded Ilea the rest of the $1800 that was needed to tase the Ogle property. Pi Beta Phi contributed A hack had been ordered from Sevierville to up to take the Committee and the School equip merit away, if the money for the land purchase was not raised in the allotted time. "Kate Miller, a member of the School committee, who waited on the porch of the teacher's cottage with Mrs. Huff and Mrs. Helmick while the groups of excited people gathered around Ogle's store at the foot of the hill, said later: "Just before noon Mr. E. E. Ogle came up to say that he had decided to sell the tract if the money could be raised, that he would rather have the school than his land provided he could get a fair price for his land. He would give as much as anyone toward the sale price, $250. His neighbors said that if Eph had wanted to sell anyone else he could have gotten $2,000. "The last stage of the transaction was at hand. The hack from Sevierville now arrived and raised the excitement to fever heat. Soon after its arrival, word was sent us that we were wanted at the store. Men were crowding around the outside of the building, on the steps, in the doors and were standing inside and sitting on the counters. We found Mr. Ogle busy writing a title bond to be held by us till the deed could be made and sworn to. Almost all the money had been subscribed and Mr. Huff and Mr. Maple had agreed to make up any final deficit. When the terms were finally and satisfactorily embodied in this preliminary instrument, it was signed and given to Mrs. Helmick. The wave of relaxation that passed through that assemblage was almost audible. "It was then that Charley Ogle fired off the fire-crackers !" The Ogle family's interest in the School has never waned and it is loyalty and friendship such as Charley Ogle's that has aided and encouraged us through these thirty-four years at Gatlinburg. The Pi Beta Phi Summer School and Workshop at Gatlinburg is a beneficial way to spend a vacation and its fun! Write MRS. CLARENCE M. SALE 3741 Purdue Street, Dallas, Texas for information regarding this summer work. It may be necessary to limit enrollment so get your reservation in early.

It is with sincere regret we break these ties, but the many beautiful and worthwhile things Gene has accomplished while at Arrowcraft will continue to live in the memories of all Pi Phis who were privileged to know her and enjoy her work. When Gene came to Gatlinburg in 1925 she found a sleepy little mountain village with electricity only when there was enough water in the river to make it. There were no telephones then and a radio was an unheard of thing. In the twenty years since she came to Arrowcraft as the "weave boss" she has seen Gatlinburg progress from an isolated mountain community to a modern incorporated town. Now it boasts of 1600 population, four very up-to-date modern hotels, a library, Post Office, telephone exchange, four churches and a four lane highway with sidewalks. In 1926 Arrowcraft was born and Gene has put much effort, enthusiasm and interest into making it the thriving business Pi Beta Phi enjoys at the present time. She has been responsible for the many beautiful woven articles which Pi Phis all over the country prize. Arrow-craft started with six weavers and as the business grew, more and more women were employed until we had, at one time last year, 123 weavers working for Arrowcraft. Gene brought something more than just the economic aspect of weaving into the lives of these mountain women. The weavers first met in small informal gatherings, and out of these there, the Weaver's Guild developed. This organization taught them the lessons of cooperation and as a result they have planned and enjoyed working on many projects together. This social outlet has been a broadening influence in their everyday mode of life. They have been exposed to University Extension lectures, preachers, artists, and whoever else could bring them a message to help them educationally. Gene not only possessed the technical knowledge of weaving but has helped the adults inthe community to raise the artistic quality their finished materials. Her ability in worki with people gradually gained the confides and friendship of these reticent, retiring mol taineers. It has taken constant supervision a much patience to arrive at and maintain i standard of work which we have achieved. Gene has been a trusted and understands friend of the mountain women and the imps sion she has left on their lives is valuable them and to Pi Beta Phi. Meta Schattschneider With Gene's accomplishments and sere in mind, the committee realized full well w: a difficult job was ahead to find someone fill her place. The person must be a mas Miss Meta Schattschneider New Weaving Supervisor at Arrowcraft craftsman in weaving with a fine appreciat and understanding of people. She must b promoter and an enthusiastic believer in ha work with the ability to communicate enthusiasm to the women with whom she co 285 86 THE MARCH ARROW Arrowca f t Shop Is located on the main highway through Gatlinburg York. She must possess patience and kindliness Lnd be able to understand the mountain people nd gain their confidence and friendship. She nust have a knowledge of production. It was the opinion of the committee that vliss Meta Schattschneider would meet these .equirements. She was elected in the late sumner and agreed to assume her responsibilities .t Gatlinburg in October. The committee now .ealizes its good fortune in this selection of a veaving supervisor, for Miss Meta immediately nade a place for herself at the school and in he community. From early childhood her father taught her o use her hands to make lovely things and to eek the beauty in things about her. Due to hat early training and a natural talent, she ias an unusual gift in creativity and ingenuity. ;he has a fine sense of design and an innate eeling for color and is capable of expressing ler ideas in a variety of interesting and beauti-'ul ways. She possesses an inquiring mind and s continually striving to improve her work. Miss vleta is one of few who has the right combinaion of skill in crafts, sensitivity to art values, .nd an interest in human beings. Along withher many accomplishments in the field of art, she is an able pianist and violinist. Miss Schattschneider comes to her work at the Settlement School with an excellent back-ground in her educational training and experience. Following her graduation at the DeForest High School at DeForest, Wisconsin, she earned her diploma at the Whitewater State Teachers' College in Wisconsin, and a second diploma from the Pratt Institute of Brooklyn, New York. Miss Schattschneider continued her education at Teachers College at Columbia University and earned the B.S. degree in 1933. She then entered upon her graduate study at the University of Wisconsin and at Teachers College of Columbia University and was awarded her Master's degree from Columbia in 1943. Miss Schattschneider has had wide experience in her teaching which was started in the grade schools in Wisconsin where she handled the first five grades. For five years she taught art and supervised art work in grades one to twelve in the school systems of Wyoming, Delaware. From 1938 to 1945, she continued her THE MARCH ARROW 287 teaching of art and supervisory work in the schools of Claymont, Delaware. During the summers of 1942 and 1944, Miss Meta was on the staff of the Oneonta State Teachers' College of Cragsmoor, New York, where she offered work in weaving and stitchery. In 1944, she was in charge of a similar crafts program for the Woodstock Guild of Craftsmen at Woodstock, New York. This variety of experience brings Miss Schattschneider to her present position with an unusual preparation for the many and varied duties at the Settlement School. School Activities This last fall has been an interesting and eventful one at the school. Ben Fleming reports the school had the best start of any year since Pearl Harbor, with three hundred enrolled in the Elementary School and one hundred in the High School. The P.T.A. hot lunch program is proving a success for the second consecutive year, with 220 youngsters fed each day. A new storage type electric refrigerator has been purchased for the lunch room. The ladies made a contribution of $50.00 to a ditto machine for the use of the Elementary School teachers. The new physical education teacher, Don Spargo, is contributing much to the school and community. Under his direction a program of basketball for boys, girls, and the community has been in full swing. The county allowed the use of the school bus to transport the teams to nearby places. The merchants in town were asked to pro-vide jackets for the Basketball team. These have the name of the firm on the back and while they are expensive, the ladies reported that no one approached had refused to cooperate in the project. An open letter to the merchants of Gatlinburg states: "On behalf of the committee; the athletic director and the students wish to thank the merchants of Gatlinburg who so graciously responded to our re-quest to sponsor warm-up jackets for the basket ball team. The jackets are most attractive and we know our merchants will take a personal pride in the students carrying his name-and the students and players equally honored in wearing them. We know the team will do their best in competition. We are also very grateful to the following for their contributions to our athletic funds. The Lions Club, the American Legion, Mr. Emmert, Mr. Medlin and Mrs. Isabelle Cron." Mrs. F. Lang, Chairman Mrs. R. Creswell Mrs. J. Donohoe. On November 20 in a high school assembly, twenty-two girls received Home Nursing pins. They had satisfactorily completed the specified course offered by the American Red Cross under the teaching direction of the Home Economics Instructor, Miss Sue Landrum, and the School Nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers. The girls were proud and delighted to have these pins presented to them. A student Council has been organized in the High School with the following statement of rules and purposes: "Student Council Presents: Members of the Student Council of Pi Beta Phi High School present the following laws which were compiled by the council with the knowledge and support of the faculty to the students of Pi Beta Phi High School. These are the laws we wish to be governed by in order that we may attain better school cooperation, more school loyalty, and a better school in which to work and play: 1. We will respect each other and our teachers at all times, especially during school hours. 2. No student shall leave the school ground during school hours without permission. 3.

It was Charley who, a boy, rounded up all' of the firecrackers in 3urg and set them off all at once when it was ed that *them wimmin' (our Pi Phis); were to stay and run the school in Gatlinburg. .Ithough Pi Beta Phi entered the mountains with .vowed intention of staying and of establishing =anent school, the local people were slow in g the promised cooperation. They had had no ience with purely altruistic projects and many skeptical about the religious affiliations of the is. Then the matter of providing land and a permalocation for the School dragged on and on with ng being accomplished, Mrs. Helmick, the chair-of the Settlement School Committee, issued an atum. She said that it was customary in most s for the business men to support movements as ours, and that the people must do their part ying land and thus assuring us that they wanted chool. If they did not do so by a certain hour chool would be moved elsewhere. he story of how Andy Huff was sent for at his er camp eight miles away, and of how Mrs. urged him not to let the school go away is ing. Andy Huff and Steve Whaley headed a ription list with $250 each, and then proceeded Ilea the rest of the $1800 that was needed to tase the Ogle property. Pi Beta Phi contributed A hack had been ordered from Sevierville to up to take the Committee and the School equip merit away, if the money for the land purchase was not raised in the allotted time. "Kate Miller, a member of the School committee, who waited on the porch of the teacher's cottage with Mrs. Huff and Mrs. Helmick while the groups of excited people gathered around Ogle's store at the foot of the hill, said later: "Just before noon Mr. E. E. Ogle came up to say that he had decided to sell the tract if the money could be raised, that he would rather have the school than his land provided he could get a fair price for his land. He would give as much as anyone toward the sale price, $250. His neighbors said that if Eph had wanted to sell anyone else he could have gotten $2,000. "The last stage of the transaction was at hand. The hack from Sevierville now arrived and raised the excitement to fever heat. Soon after its arrival, word was sent us that we were wanted at the store. Men were crowding around the outside of the building, on the steps, in the doors and were standing inside and sitting on the counters. We found Mr. Ogle busy writing a title bond to be held by us till the deed could be made and sworn to. Almost all the money had been subscribed and Mr. Huff and Mr. Maple had agreed to make up any final deficit. When the terms were finally and satisfactorily embodied in this preliminary instrument, it was signed and given to Mrs. Helmick. The wave of relaxation that passed through that assemblage was almost audible. "It was then that Charley Ogle fired off the fire-crackers !" The Ogle family's interest in the School has never waned and it is loyalty and friendship such as Charley Ogle's that has aided and encouraged us through these thirty-four years at Gatlinburg.
