The following will give you some conception of the reason for the confidence placed in her by our people of the mountains. MOUNTAIN MUSINGS By MARJORIE CHALMERS Could anything look more cosy than a log cabin, small and solid, clay thinking between the squared logs and the big outside chimney of field stones? Set it in the fold of the wooded hills with a lazy plume of smoke above it, and fling a tumbling little branch at its feet. Under the trees, set a few "bee-gums" sections of big log with the bark still on, hollowed and burned out and with a hole for entrance, and roofed with a slab. Swing a huge three-legged caldron over the charcoal of past fires. It is a fitting picture for the home of sturdy adventure and true American independence. "Draw up and warm. Hit's raight cold out this evenin', an' hit's a fur piece up th' hill. I've not been s'feisty sence back younder. I've just felt a sight on earth bad. Tuesday week I was clean out o' heart, and 'lowed I'd send fer you. I been ill as a hornet, too, and though I'm not much stout yet, I did all what you-uns told me afore and hit holp me fine." We sat talking, comfortably toasting our toes before the old fire-place of field stones, with the glowing embers and huge back log. The late winter sunshine lay in golden pools on the wide boards of the floor. It touched gently the fine patrician features and well shaped work-roughened hands lying relaxed on the clean print dress. Many kinds of work could those hands do. Hoeing in the 'taters or the corn on the steep hillside (for where a plow will not go, a woman and her man can and will) ; washing, up in the wash-holler, where the clear cold mountain stream rushes over its rocky bed, and the clothes, taken from the great iron kettle hung over the log fire, are plunged and rinsed, and hung on near-by bushes to dry; mixing the meal ground at the mill farther down the creek, into corn-bread baked sometimes in the wood stove in the "lean-to" and sometimes in the four-legged kettle in the ashes on the hearth lovingly caring for the numerous children the oldest now settled in the cabin "a pieceways up the hill," and the "least-un" chubby and pink-cheeked sleeping under the bright-pieced kiverlid on the hand-made wooden bed in the corner of the big room. The clumsy-looking loom by the fireplace bore mute testimony to the artistry of those hands, for the work on it was linen, fine and smooth, its border of beautifully blended colors. Carding, spinning, and dyeing the wool with home-made vegetable dyes, is not so common in these days, when "fotched-on" yarns and threads are so easy to obtain, but the rhythmic thumping of the loom can be heard in many of the homes. Often, rising above the sound of the loom, can be heard the sweet minor of an old harp song. Harp singing was once the frequent entertainment in the Great Smokies, but many of the younger folk are losing their interest in the old ways, as in the rest of the world today, and there is great danger in its dying out entirely. People come from miles around for a Harp Singing, sometimes for just the evening and at other times for all day, "eatin' round" at noon. The song books are quaint and interesting, "New Harp of Columbia, A System of Musical Notation, with a note for each sound and a shape for each note," arranged for publication in 1867. The shape denotes the place in the scale a triangle for "do," a diamond for "mi" and so on. The place that "do" occupies on the staff, indicates the key. Many of the songs are identical with the ballads sung by wandering minstrels in the days of Chylde Harold, songs of valor and unrequited love, in quaint phrasing and weird melody. Usually unaccompanied, some-times to the lovely tunes of a dulcimer, they are pitched by a leader, sung through by 1088 THE MAY ARROW 1089 Photograph by Dorothy J. MacLean, Gatlinburg, Term. MOUNTAIN CABIN, GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK note, and then comes the lining of innumerable verses of the "poetry". Men singers are greatly in the majority, the acknowledged leaders, and follow each other in directing the chosen songs with simplicity and quiet poise. A tuning fork may or may not be used, but so true-toned are these natural singers that there is never the slightest variation in pitch from the beginning to the ending of the song. The slight swaying of the body, the faint tapping of the foot, or the movement of the hand, tells the absorption as song follows song. One who has never heard a real "Old Harp Singing" cannot imagine the gripping beauty of sound, the thin reedy voices of the women and the full rich tones of the men, blending in almost wild harmony now triumphant in religious ecstasy, now saddened by the sin and sorrow of the world. Money earned in weaving is often used to repay money loaned in time of need. More than once, the Weaving Supervisor has heard a remark somewhat like this, "My, I'm raight proud to get this warp. We-uns are about to have Johnnie's tonsils tuk out. The nurse says she won't get shet of her misery till hits done. She's just plum whupped out all the time, and ain't been raight peart sence she had that spell of the Tizik. What with risin's and her head a'bealing till I cain't plat her ha'r, she ain't fitten to circulate around." Or it may be that "I aim to carry Major to see the tooth dentist next time he comes. He's got a doty tooth, an' hit's drug out long enough waitin' fer sommat to pay him with." Of all the nurse's busy days, perhaps the most interesting are those of the Well Baby Clinics, in the out-lying districts. Visiting is done days in advance, to get the word back in the hills and "hollers" that the County Health doctor and the nurse are coming at a certain time. A central place is selected, the school or church house, or a neighbor's house, a bench is provided where the babies may be examined, platform and baby scales, a measure "to see how much you've grown since last time," and the family folders with the records 1090 THE MAY ARROW of each child under six. Those who go to school are examined in the school and the records are kept in separate folders. Should the day be warm and the shade inviting, the clinic may be held under the trees and the affair takes on a social aspect. Old and young turn out for the event and they come "fur pieces" for the service or just to watch. Life seems to be set at slower tempo in the hills, and folk take time to enjoy each day's happenings and to be friendly. Babies seem to like being weighed in the scales set up on the running board, with the blue sky overhead and laughter of grown folk and children mingling with the song of birds. Amid goodnatured chaffing, a line forms for the "shots" so often a feature of these gatherings. "Hit'll shore kill ye if'n ye take hit, but that's better than airy dose of the fever." "Ketch a'holt of Crockett. He's apt to throw a dog-fit when the needle strikes in." "Well if that ain't the beatin'est. I never felt a thing." " 'Slike buyin' a pig-in-a-poke, never know if'n hit's gain' to get sore." In the friendly atmosphere of these clinics, in the quiet visits in home or office, and in working side by side at some sick bed, one comes to appreciate to the fullest, the fineness of character and keen mentality of these people ; their reticence is not backwardness, but the calm poise, the unselfishness of the well-bred. The very land in which they live should make them grow in "wisdom and stature." One should learn the happy gift of patience in these hills. They stand, serene and strong, ever-changing, yet never-changing through the years. Sometimes a glimpse of the Old Smokies is breath-taking in its beauty. The vista opens through the clouds and, there in the distance, timeless and magnificent, are the everlasting hills". One who comes to these mountains in the winter would be surprised to see the cabins, which are screened by thick foliage in the leafy seasons. Homes are tucked away in the most unexpected places, their backs against a cliff, their feet in a creek ; or perched precariously on a ledge, with foot-holds up a bank to the hospitably open door. Each day, each season has its loveliness the gorgeous colorings of autumn, the soft tints of spring, summer's thick foliage and flowers and the almost unearthly beauty of snow on the evergreens, the Fairyland on the mountains when the sun gleams on frozen mist in winter. To be understanding in problems of sickness and of health, to serve in a way that teaches as it aids, to keep philosophy, sympathy, and tact as watchwords, gaining thereby a poise, a contentment, an inner calm, that will carry one through the rough places these must be the aims of one who strives to make living more secure for a community. Such a one then, should make this petition: "May I never be too busy with persons to care for personalities. May I never see duty so clearly as to be blind to its blessings. May I always find beauty in life and be ever grateful for each loveliness that I find." GRAND COUNCIL announces that the 11 B (I) Fellowship for 1939-1940 has been awarded to JANE JOHNSON, Wisconsin A. Her picture appears among honor girls in this issue. Vermont A won first place in a snow-modeling contest last winter at Middlebury, Vt. The Third Biennial Zeta Province Conference will be held June 12, and 13, 1939 in Miami, Florida.
