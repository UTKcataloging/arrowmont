JEFFRIES GREEN PACE AN URGENT INVITATION TO CONVENTION AN THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGE Edited by JEFFRIES GREEN PACE, Virginia A .,,,111111111111111111.111111.111IIIIIIIII.1111.111111.1111.11111.111.11.k.111A 111111W.111 II 11118.1.110 II 11110111 11111111 111111 111111 Greetings to everyone from your filler-inner. I have no claim to fame, was a charter member of Virginia A, when Miss Keller was Grand President, married early into the United States Navy and have been nothing but a wife, mother, and reluctant traveler ever since. However, the Settlement School exerts a consistent charm for me and that is why I happen to be writing this. Convention time is nearly here and I hope you will be patient with me for reviewing a number of items which may interest the readers enough to get them to Asheville and incidently to Gatlinburg. First, I want to introduce the members of the school staff, who will be most in evidence during that time. Mrs. Eunice Weaver, our small directress, who like the rest, begins her day at six A.M., and keeps at her job of leavening the loaf until bed time. She meets dozens of problems of management each day, corresponds regularly with the committee andmaintains a cordial and interested with the members of the community as being a cheerful hostess for the who have crowded the school every and the park has been open. Mrs. Ethel Snow presides at Art( Even larger crowds swarm into the sh ing the daylight hours and she must and dumb often, to avoid unpleasant r to some of the very rude and stupid b which exhibits itself before her. Qua tourists are not always "those d people." She also sees that orders are over to the weaving director and tE are shipped in time for the needs of ti ordering. Mrs. Georgia Duffield keeps the hoi and I defy you not to remember he' and graciousness. Miss Winogene Redding is the 1 supervisor. She is particularly gifte artistic sense and originality and pros Left: A mountain hunter in full regalia including hog rifle. Center: Mountain home.

We her car along dirt mountain roads on the edge of nothing, even limping along up the rocky bed of a stream when the road failed us. At last our car could go no farther, so, getting out, we began a long climb up to a new little mountain cabin. From its porch, one could look down the mountain and through a cleft in the surrounding ridge, with beauty everywhere, sunshine, trees and flowering wild shrubs and a stream trickling musically somewhere near. In the house however, problems presented themselves. The patient was a little mother of seventeen with her second baby the first having died of pneumonia. She was in bed cuddling the infant, which since its birth three days before had had no care save that of a neighbor's eight year old child. A fire had to be built in the wood stove, water boiled and the baby washed with strong yellow kitchen soap. It was then rubbed with oil from the nurse's kit, its eyes attended to and it was ready to snooze away in comfort. No visible supply nor source of food was at hand and even the wood had to be picked up and chopped by the little girl in attendance. The husband and father had chosen that time to go away just an itching foot as far as we could learn. Fortunately the nurse was able to arrange with a neighbor farther up the mountain to keep a weather eye out for the little family. At another time I accompanied the nurse on the scheduled visit to the Big Ridge School, which stood on the top of the mountain and served the slopes running in all directions. The program called for typhoid and diphtheria injections and vaccinations, The school house was a rough log cabin, standing in a clearing, where the ground about had been trodden bare by many restless and energetic little feet. The teacher was a lank sleepy mountaineer in his shirt sleeves, who provided instruction up to and including the eighth grade. The one room held crude wooden benches and tables and one small black board. The only modern note was the health records tacked on the wall and kept from day to day for the nurse. The children were studying from books not then on the required list of the state, for requirements had been changed two or three years before and red tape had as yet kept them from such remote districts. There were about thirty pupils all ages and both sexes; the boys clad in overalls and bare-footed; the girls often beautiful with the wildrose complexion they sometimes have in spite of hardships THE MAY ARROW and poor living and wearing any odd-fitting faded or handed-down garment available. The children down to the smallest, were all interested in having the inoculations, which had to be given for all three things at once, for as soon as the bad weather set in the school was isolated until spring. A stranger is a novelty among them and they felt too shy at first to do anything but whisper cautiously to the nurse but I was proud that they became accustomed to me before the visit was over and one little girl shyly gave me a reed basket she had made when her mother was making them for sale in the "burg." We visited her family later on the way home and found her little sister ill. Her mother had just walked down to the nearest store two miles down and back, with crackers for the ailing one to use in milk as she could retain no other food. Father and mother were both young but so worn and tired with the hard work of wresting a living from the few poor acres never meant for farming raising corn, a few vegetables, and a little cotton for spinning. They made brooms and baskets in the bad weather to market in town on good days. Please remember this and consider that conditions in our early days at Gatlinburg were even more primitive contrast our progressive and modern conditions at the present school and forestall any feelings that we havedone our share for the school and longer needed. No Pi Phi's share done. Now we have a whole new set A "FUTURE FARMER OF TENNESS for influence and help as the outsic presents its vices as well as its advar Do come and see the school and vinced. Until June then Cheerio. JEFFRIES GREEN In his address, at N.I.C., Conference Chairman H. Maurice Darling, L. K E, gave the minimum requirements of a well-conducted chapter, the objectives of the college of today as they relate to the Fraternity, and the program of the Fraternity in co-operating with the college in meeting those objectives. The nine minimum requirements set up for the 2359 chapters in this country are: No member dropped for deficiency in scholar-ship ; no chapter bills left unpaid receivable from members to the chc insanitary or unsafe chapter house; ing meals, conforming to dietetic ments; no departures from the best of conduct and behavior; no membe merely for their athletic ability ; no of accepted rushing rules; no fol tiation practices ; no chapter expand extent that congeniality, cohesion, sponsibility are lost.
