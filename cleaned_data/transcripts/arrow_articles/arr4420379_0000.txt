        THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Courtesy of Women and Missions AUNT LYDIA WHALEY NEWS FRoM LITTLE PIGEON . 379 M !L.! NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by BLANCHE CHARLTON Cunris (Mas. PERcE H. 2525 Hillside Drive, Burlingame, Calif. Aunt Lydia Whaley, one of the most picturesque and interesting characters in Eastern Tennessee is no longer to be found in her little cabin on the mountainside. The hands which so expertly wove the baskets which were eagerly sought by everyone, are stilled. After an illness due to her advanced years, Aunt Lydia passed away last spring. The following story written by Agnes Wright Spring, appeared in the November, 19 25, issue of Women and ill issiom and the photograph used here was used as the cover of the magazine and is reprinted by permission of the editor of that magazine. A MOUNTAIN WOMAN IGH up on the side of a "hiller" in the Smoky Mountain region of eastern Tennessee lives "Aunt" Lydia Whaley, `\ i13, despite her eighty-four years, tills her own soil, ral,es her own food, makes remarkable baskets, is a ski.led worker at the loom and spinning wheel and cheers many a weary heart with her unique philosophy. Aunt Lydia is a devout student of the Biblz and can quote Scripture by the hour. All aline, a quarter of a m:lz from her necrest neighbor, this mountain woman lives from day to day with the same independent spirit which she has shown during all the years since her husband was killed in the Civil War, leaving her a widow with a small family to care for. After her husband's death, life in the little log cabin home was a hard struggle. From early dawn until dark Lydia Whaley tended her crop, gathered wild fruits and berries to preserve, took her own corn to mill, made new shoes for her children cut of old ones which she ripped up, and often for the sum of $1 each made coats by hand in order to pay the taxes on her land. 380 THE ARROW 01, PI BETA PH i SOME OF THE STAFF AT GATLINBURG Labelle Allen and "Miss Evelyn" Bishop Gene Redding and Jean Steele (Office Force) (High and Low Jean) Maggie White and Marion Folsom La Dell and Mrs. Chapin (Refer to News From Little Pigeon, ARaow, Feb. 1027, page 415) NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 381 Five or six years after the war, the government allowed her a. pension of $8 a month. "I was a savin' of it," she explained, "and bought each of my chilurn a some u p yander," pointing to t h e Sugarlands. "Later I got them to sell and buy homes here near me." Lydia Whaley, whose "grandpap" moved from "Carliny" to Tennessee a century or more ago, learned to weave when she was so small that the treadles had to be tied up in order that she might reach them. .Her first spinning was done on her grand-mother's wheel, and she later taught the art of weaving and spinning to her daughters. She knows how to make "ooze" out of barks, roots a n d weeds and can explain in detail each step necessary to the making of "county pins," beginning :with the raising of the sheep, the shearing of them, the ashing, spinning, twisting and dyeing of the wool to the making of the patterns such as the "Gentleman's Fancy Little Bow Knot," and the "Rattlesnake." These pat-terns are made from "drafts" handed down from mother to daughter for more than 100 years. From hemlock bark, willow switches, willow bark, white oak, corn husks and ash all of which she obtains on the mountainside near her cabin Aunt Lydia designs and makes baskets of many kinds and shapes. Her basketry fame has spread far and wide and has become a source of considerable revenue to her, Every visitor to Gatlinburg now makes a pilgrimage up the foot-path along Little Pigeon River to the little, one-roomed, window-less cabin with its fireplace and tiny Dutch oven, to purchase baskets and to listen to the stories of the Indians, the Civil War and early Tennessee history which. this picturesque mountaineer loves to relate. When asked if she finds life easier now than when she was bringing up a family, hunt Lydia said: "Well, no. It's easier to have childurn on the toes than on the heart. Back when my childurn was on my toes was the best of it. When they are on the toes it's easier; when they're on the heart, it's worse." Of sturdy Scotch and 'Welsh ancestry, she is the oldest of five generations, there being thirty children in the fourth genera382 THE ARROW oii' PI BETA PHI tion and fifteen in the fifth. From Aunt Lydia's lips these children have heard many of the folksongs and ballads which are still being sung in the mountain districts. This solemn faced woman with a twinkle in her eyes is. not afraid to live alone up on the mountainside. "I never seed but one `f raid in my life," she said, "and that was one night when I seed something black out in the yard. I went out to it and give it a hard kick and it was my little black kittle." In that land of mountain laurel, dogwood, magnolia and tulip trees shut away from the rest of the world by creeks and mountain ridges there is much time for contemplation and the reading of Scripture. There, in the peace and quiet of the valley, Aunt Lydia Whaley has thought out a philosophy of h e r own as one may judge from these words of hers : "I've seed a heap of ups and downs and had a world of trouble the whole world through, and I hope I get to a better some day. But the trials of this world must be borne with patience. This world is only a stopping place." * * * IN MEMORIU11,1 Nothing shall be the same again ; Bright winds that sing And flash a rainbow-colored wing, In hedgero ws wet with April rains; And every lovely thing Shall be less beautiful, Since you Who are more beautiful than these, Have taken wing And flown away, beyond the silent seas. -OLGA BINET.

This report does not include any of the Sevier county ritory Public Nurse's work. REPORT OF RUBY C. RYMAN FOR JANUARY, 1927 We have been busy with toxin-antitoxin clinics this nzow The teachers have cooperated splendidly with us. Several ( them coming to see us, and requesting the treatment while oth( have written asking when we can come in order that they m work up the clinic so as to include the pre-school children. I Kinzer and I sent the teachers material explaining .the treatme to be distributed. They write the parents and get their perm sion to treat the children, and ask them to bring the younger on, So far we have had only one objection from any parent. T mother wrote the teacher, No, she didn't want her "child assaand nated." This boy needs a tonsillectomy badly. I asked Dr. Ki zer to see him. He did, and said he would see his father at I first oppoi-tunity. As I ride up the streams where we cannot go in a car, t mothers stop me all along the way, and ask me, "If I wog: mind to stop and vaccinate Johnny." They have mumps up the school, and she doesn't want him to get the mumps. M have had several cases of mumps, but hope to avoid an epidem I organized a class in home hygiene and care of the sick January 3. I taught four days a week for the first two wee] now I am teaching two days a week. My class consists of twe] girls from the Gatlinburg High School. We are expecting M Ely to visit us in the near future. Mrs. Bel-rill Ogle continues to. improve. She is now able be up and about the house helping to care for her six lovely : tle children. I took Kate Huskey into Knoxville to Dr. 'Patterson January 24. He was very much pleased with the improvem^ she has made wearing a brace for two months. On New Year's night about twelve o'clock, I answered call for the nurse. It proved to be a gentleman from the, Gre, brier. He had been riding since early evening (the roads w 386 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI so bad). He brought a note from Dr. Hoffman asking. me to call Dr. Lynn immediately, and ask him to start as early as possible in the morning for Gatlinburg. He arrived at seven A. M. We ate breakfast and started in a Ford, arriving at the patient's home at noon. Dr. Lynn did an appendectomy. The appendix was just about to rupture. The patient was a young man in the navy who was spending the holidays at home. He made a rapid recovery. It is impossible to bring a patient out at this season over the roads. We didn't ride all the way by any means, did considerable walking as well as pushing. On January 14, about 3 P. M., I had a letter from Dr. Thomas at Pitman Center, asking me to call a Knoxville surgeon to start immediately for Gatlinburg to go to Pitman Health Center and operate. He asked me to come if I could. Dr. Lynn arrived at 7 o'clock, and we started in a Ford for Pitman. It was raining, and had been raining for several days. Had scarcely started when the Ford stopped we decided we couldn't g o horseback and carry our supplies in the rain, so Mr. Huff said Jim could take us in his Chevrolet as far as the river, about a mile from Pitman; we reached the river about 11 o'clock after much difficulty. We decided to try to cross, but the c a r stopped in the middle of the river, and the rain was pouring. Jim waded out and tried to get a mule team to pull us out. He walked about a mile to a house but could not get any response, as they were all so sound asleep. Jim came back, waded the river again, and tried some folks on the other side about a mile down the river. This time he succeeded in getting a good team which was accustomed to pulling cars out. The man said he would wait for us if we would hurry back. We proceeded to Pitman. The patient had decided to wait another day for his operation. H i s home was five miles up the hollow from Pitman. He told the doctor he would be carried down on the stretcher to Pitman, and have the operation there, but decided after Dr. Thomas left him to wait another day. Imagine how we felt. We started home, and this time both team and car stuck in the middle of the river. Again Jim had to get out and put the mules to the back of the car, pull us back and start again. This time, safely across, the car wouldn't run ; something happened to NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 387 the oil while we were in the water so long. No oil anywhere; finally a man said he had some that had been used. We tried it, all went well until we reached Hickam hill stuck again. Jim assisted Dr. Lynn up. I managed to get up (being more accustomed to mud, and carried the flashlight and lighted the way foi them. We waited in the rain while Jim labored, trying to get the car up. He got it up after a while, and we reached Gatlinburg at 6 A. M., stopping several times to put on chains having lost one, and the other kept coming off. Aunt Lizzie had a good breakfast prepared. We did it justice. This was a night which all of us will long remember. On our first visit to Greenbrier school, Julius Proffitt was the first to greet us. I think he is on his way to China now. FEBRUARY Dr. Kinzer, Miss Linn and I have held twenty-six toxin-antitoxin clinics, and seven typhoid vaccine clinics. Inoculated 153 pre-school children, and 474 above six years of age against diphtheria. We have not included our three largest clinics as our reports are not in as yet. Will feport them next month. I have made thirty-six school visits, not including those in Gatlinburg. All these visits were either in my territory or Pit-man Center territory. Many of these trips require from fifteen to thirty miles horseback riding in one day. Was unable to fill one engagement because I learned I could not get a horse after it was too late to cancel. Miss Linn arrived on February 9. She went with us to Greenbrier on February 11. On February 24 she and I vaccinated about 400 in Pitman Center territory against typhoid and diphtheria. We have had full cooperation with all the teachers. One teacher remained in territory four days after school to work up clinic, and was present at the first one. Have been. unable to fill engagements requested of us. We enjoyed a visit from Miss Joyce Ely on February 11. She came out to visit my Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick class as well as the women's night club which has been organized by Miss Steele and me. She told us of what is being done in our Southland in teaching Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick by the 388 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI Red Cross nurses. Also the combining of this work with home economics. My class is demonstrating to this club what they have accomplished by taking this course. The girls have asked me if they can attend every meeting. It is a real pleasure to me to see the interest they are showing in this work. We meet every two weeks on Friday night. There were fifty-four present last meeting. I attended the East Tennessee Public Health nurses meeting in Knoxville on February 12 with Miss Ely. I made fifty-nine home visits this month, seven business calls and thirty-six school visits. MARCH We had the additional work of dog vaccination this month. I have vaccinated sixty-five against rabies. Bringing ,the dogs to have them vaccinated has increased our Work in inoculations against typhoid fever and diphtheria. The largest group in one day this month was eighty-nine people and twelve dogs at a one-room school, and 229 people and thirty-seven dogs at another three-room school. This trip required a thirty-mile horseback ride over very muddy roads, followed by our club meeting a t night. Our club is proving to be quite worth while. We meet every second and fourth Friday night. I am teaching Home Hygiene and Care of Sick on Monday and Wednesday in connection with Miss Steele's work in Home Economics. Miss Weston from Boston arrived at Pitman Center t h i s month. We have visited several schools together, getting acquainted. On March 1, Dr. Kinzer and I took two children to Knoxville for examination and treatment. Miss Linn and I attended the East Tennessee State Nurses' association meeting on March 10, also the Mountain. Workers' Conference on March 20. Quite a large delegation of h e a 1 t.h workers were present. I have made seventy-seven visits this month. We are so glad to have had Miss Higinbotham with us for short visit. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 389 THE ARROWCRAVT SHOP T the close of the eight months term of school last spring the Arrowcraft Shop was opened in the dining room of the Teachers Cottage where the kindergarten classes had been. The next month we moved it into the Stuart Cottage where it stayed until school opened again the middle of August. Then back it came to the Teachers Cottage, baskets, tools, chairs and every thing stored wherever there was even a little space. We have planned that as soon as the new building could be finished and the agriculture and shop work moved into it that we would take the little old schoolhouse near the road for the Arrow craft. Day after day we grew more crowded until finally it was apparent that a storage room must be built. and built at once. As it should be where the Shop was' to be permanently we decided to move the old schoolhouse a hundred feet back, build an addition and fix the attics of both the old and new parts for storage, That has been done and we are moving not only the surplus stock but the regular shop there. Againthis year the tourists have come in in sufficient num., bers to make a Gift Shop necessary and we shall continue it through the entire year. Miss LaDelle Allen will have entire charge of the Arrowcraft and with her keen interest and her year of experience here we are 'sure it will be handled most efficiently. When you think that between Sept: 1, 1926, and Sept. 1, 1927, about $21,000 worth of products went out froiu here you will not wonder that it has been necessary to have a place, a per son (or persons) and much time for it all.

OT so very long ago there was a corner of Eastern Tennessee, bounded by creeks and "hollers" and mountain ridges, almost entirely shut away from the rest of the world by muddy, impassable roads. Those hills covered with mountain laurel, dogwood, holly and hundreds of luxuriant plants and trees sheltered the picturesque cabins of mountaineers, many of whom had never been down in the broad valley seven miles away. Gatlinburg, the center of civilization in that part of Tennessee, with its six houses, a "well-ventilated" church, an open air blacksmith shop, a tumbled down school house and two general stores, lay in one of the most beautiful valleys in the entire United States. Families living up and down the creeks that drained into the Little Pigeon River came to Gatlinburg to do their trading but did not go beyond. Five years ago when the Grand Council made the trip from Knoxville to Gatlinburg (a distance of forty-eight miles as the crow flies), we rode all morning on the caboose of a' lumber train which wound its way through fertile valleys, then up a canon along a rushing mountain stream bordered by wooded mountain-sides on which now and then glistened the waters of a misty waterfall, or from which ferns and mountain foliage formed arches over the train as we creaked around the curves. About noon we arrived at Elkmont, a lumber camp, where we had dinner and then climbed aboard an automobile. After a mile, however, over most, exasperating roads the car "gave up the ghost." We walked, waded streams, and finally finished the last two miles of the journey in a Ford which brought us to our destination at about four o'clock in the afternoon. The return trip to Knoxville that same week was made over a different route with a one-horse bu'ggy to Pigeon Forge, seven miles, over the road from Gatlinburg that was then being rebuilt ; I LOADS NEAR GATLINBURC BEFORE IMPROVEMENT NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON then to Sevierville by automobile; and from there to Knot by a small train. On the way down from Gatlinburg we passed lumber wa loaded with tan bark mired down in mud hub deep. A'r o one curve we met two teams at a very narrow place. It necessary for us to unhitch our conveyance, lead our horse to a wider place in the road, hold our one-horse buggy up or side of the mountain while the teams and loaded wagons p-us. The journey down the Little Pigeon River in the one-1' buggy furnished thrills a-plenty and wound up by fording river where the water ran through the bottom of the buggy we perched our feet on the dashboard and made the cro: safely. Plenty of time did we have in jogging along that first s miles to enjoy the cabins tucked away on the hillsides; to the rail fences covered with fragrant honeysuckle vines; ar gaze at the many new and interesting things. At that time work had just been begun on the Gatlinbu: Pigeon Forge road and a steamshovel was grinding its way the mountainsides. Imagine our surprise a year ago to get into a large aut^ bile in Knoxville and to glide over roads as smooth as an could desire and to arrive at Gatlinburg in less than two how Excellent roads, concrete bridges of the latest design, erred roads now greet the traveler on his way into the heart of the Great Smoky region. The excellent main road m runs right by the gate of our Settlement School, is pushing too, towards Asheville, North Carolina, and by the time the C Smoky National Park is opened to the public this road wi completed through one of the most verdant and picturesque of the United States. No longer is that part of Eastern Tennessee shut away the rest of the world. That land of flowering laurel and wood, of rushing waterfalls, of exquisite foliage and ma mountains, of sturdy pioneers is now within easy access. Gatlinburg now boasts our splendid Settlement Scho fine new. church, two excellent summer hotels new homes; 400 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI general stores, a barber shop, two gift shops, two Antique shops and a number of other buildings. The Y.W.C.A. has bought land there for a summer camp, and summer homes are appearing among the trees on the hillsides. Land which was worthless or practically so, ten years ago, is being put into orchards, cultivated into corn fields, or is be-coming the background of ideal summer cottages. Real estate men have options up and down all of the important "hollers" near Little Pigeon River. Land is exchanging hands at almost unbelievable figures. Mountaineers who a few years since were toting their corn to mill on horseback and who bartered for almost everything they had, now do their marketing in an automobile and jingle coins in their pockets. They have improved their homes, bought thorou:hbred stock, are sending their children to school and are learning scientific farming. A.W.S.

RYMAN FOR JANUARY, 1927 We have been busy with toxin-antitoxin clinics this nzow The teachers have cooperated splendidly with us. Several ( them coming to see us, and requesting the treatment while oth( have written asking when we can come in order that they m work up the clinic so as to include the pre-school children. I Kinzer and I sent the teachers material explaining .the treatme to be distributed. They write the parents and get their perm sion to treat the children, and ask them to bring the younger on, So far we have had only one objection from any parent. T mother wrote the teacher, No, she didn't want her "child assaand nated." This boy needs a tonsillectomy badly. I asked Dr. Ki zer to see him. He did, and said he would see his father at I first oppoi-tunity. As I ride up the streams where we cannot go in a car, t mothers stop me all along the way, and ask me, "If I wog: mind to stop and vaccinate Johnny." They have mumps up the school, and she doesn't want him to get the mumps. M have had several cases of mumps, but hope to avoid an epidem I organized a class in home hygiene and care of the sick January 3. I taught four days a week for the first two wee] now I am teaching two days a week. My class consists of twe] girls from the Gatlinburg High School. We are expecting M Ely to visit us in the near future. Mrs. Bel-rill Ogle continues to. improve. She is now able be up and about the house helping to care for her six lovely : tle children. I took Kate Huskey into Knoxville to Dr. 'Patterson January 24. He was very much pleased with the improvem^ she has made wearing a brace for two months. On New Year's night about twelve o'clock, I answered call for the nurse. It proved to be a gentleman from the, Gre, brier. He had been riding since early evening (the roads w 386 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI so bad). He brought a note from Dr. Hoffman asking. me to call Dr. Lynn immediately, and ask him to start as early as possible in the morning for Gatlinburg. He arrived at seven A. M. We ate breakfast and started in a Ford, arriving at the patient's home at noon. Dr. Lynn did an appendectomy. The appendix was just about to rupture. The patient was a young man in the navy who was spending the holidays at home. He made a rapid recovery. It is impossible to bring a patient out at this season over the roads. We didn't ride all the way by any means, did considerable walking as well as pushing. On January 14, about 3 P. M., I had a letter from Dr. Thomas at Pitman Center, asking me to call a Knoxville surgeon to start immediately for Gatlinburg to go to Pitman Health Center and operate. He asked me to come if I could. Dr. Lynn arrived at 7 o'clock, and we started in a Ford for Pitman. It was raining, and had been raining for several days. Had scarcely started when the Ford stopped we decided we couldn't g o horseback and carry our supplies in the rain, so Mr. Huff said Jim could take us in his Chevrolet as far as the river, about a mile from Pitman; we reached the river about 11 o'clock after much difficulty. We decided to try to cross, but the c a r stopped in the middle of the river, and the rain was pouring. Jim waded out and tried to get a mule team to pull us out. He walked about a mile to a house but could not get any response, as they were all so sound asleep. Jim came back, waded the river again, and tried some folks on the other side about a mile down the river. This time he succeeded in getting a good team which was accustomed to pulling cars out. The man said he would wait for us if we would hurry back. We proceeded to Pitman. The patient had decided to wait another day for his operation. H i s home was five miles up the hollow from Pitman. He told the doctor he would be carried down on the stretcher to Pitman, and have the operation there, but decided after Dr. Thomas left him to wait another day. Imagine how we felt. We started home, and this time both team and car stuck in the middle of the river. Again Jim had to get out and put the mules to the back of the car, pull us back and start again. This time, safely across, the car wouldn't run ; something happened to NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 387 the oil while we were in the water so long. No oil anywhere; finally a man said he had some that had been used. We tried it, all went well until we reached Hickam hill stuck again. Jim assisted Dr. Lynn up. I managed to get up (being more accustomed to mud, and carried the flashlight and lighted the way foi them. We waited in the rain while Jim labored, trying to get the car up. He got it up after a while, and we reached Gatlinburg at 6 A. M., stopping several times to put on chains having lost one, and the other kept coming off. Aunt Lizzie had a good breakfast prepared. We did it justice. This was a night which all of us will long remember. On our first visit to Greenbrier school, Julius Proffitt was the first to greet us. I think he is on his way to China now. FEBRUARY Dr. Kinzer, Miss Linn and I have held twenty-six toxin-antitoxin clinics, and seven typhoid vaccine clinics. Inoculated 153 pre-school children, and 474 above six years of age against diphtheria. We have not included our three largest clinics as our reports are not in as yet. Will feport them next month. I have made thirty-six school visits, not including those in Gatlinburg. All these visits were either in my territory or Pit-man Center territory. Many of these trips require from fifteen to thirty miles horseback riding in one day. Was unable to fill one engagement because I learned I could not get a horse after it was too late to cancel. Miss Linn arrived on February 9. She went with us to Greenbrier on February 11. On February 24 she and I vaccinated about 400 in Pitman Center territory against typhoid and diphtheria. We have had full cooperation with all the teachers. One teacher remained in territory four days after school to work up clinic, and was present at the first one. Have been. unable to fill engagements requested of us. We enjoyed a visit from Miss Joyce Ely on February 11. She came out to visit my Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick class as well as the women's night club which has been organized by Miss Steele and me. She told us of what is being done in our Southland in teaching Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick by the 388 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI Red Cross nurses. Also the combining of this work with home economics. My class is demonstrating to this club what they have accomplished by taking this course. The girls have asked me if they can attend every meeting. It is a real pleasure to me to see the interest they are showing in this work. We meet every two weeks on Friday night. There were fifty-four present last meeting. I attended the East Tennessee Public Health nurses meeting in Knoxville on February 12 with Miss Ely. I made fifty-nine home visits this month, seven business calls and thirty-six school visits. MARCH We had the additional work of dog vaccination this month. I have vaccinated sixty-five against rabies. Bringing ,the dogs to have them vaccinated has increased our Work in inoculations against typhoid fever and diphtheria. The largest group in one day this month was eighty-nine people and twelve dogs at a one-room school, and 229 people and thirty-seven dogs at another three-room school. This trip required a thirty-mile horseback ride over very muddy roads, followed by our club meeting a t night. Our club is proving to be quite worth while. We meet every second and fourth Friday night. I am teaching Home Hygiene and Care of Sick on Monday and Wednesday in connection with Miss Steele's work in Home Economics. Miss Weston from Boston arrived at Pitman Center t h i s month. We have visited several schools together, getting acquainted. On March 1, Dr. Kinzer and I took two children to Knoxville for examination and treatment. Miss Linn and I attended the East Tennessee State Nurses' association meeting on March 10, also the Mountain. Workers' Conference on March 20. Quite a large delegation of h e a 1 t.h workers were present. I have made seventy-seven visits this month. We are so glad to have had Miss Higinbotham with us for short visit. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 389 THE ARROWCRAVT SHOP T the close of the eight months term of school last spring the Arrowcraft Shop was opened in the dining room of the Teachers Cottage where the kindergarten classes had been. The next month we moved it into the Stuart Cottage where it stayed until school opened again the middle of August. Then back it came to the Teachers Cottage, baskets, tools, chairs and every thing stored wherever there was even a little space. We have planned that as soon as the new building could be finished and the agriculture and shop work moved into it that we would take the little old schoolhouse near the road for the Arrow craft. Day after day we grew more crowded until finally it was apparent that a storage room must be built. and built at once. As it should be where the Shop was' to be permanently we decided to move the old schoolhouse a hundred feet back, build an addition and fix the attics of both the old and new parts for storage, That has been done and we are moving not only the surplus stock but the regular shop there. Againthis year the tourists have come in in sufficient num., bers to make a Gift Shop necessary and we shall continue it through the entire year. Miss LaDelle Allen will have entire charge of the Arrowcraft and with her keen interest and her year of experience here we are 'sure it will be handled most efficiently. When you think that between Sept: 1, 1926, and Sept. 1, 1927, about $21,000 worth of products went out froiu here you will not wonder that it has been necessary to have a place, a per son (or persons) and much time for it all.

OT so very long ago there was a corner of Eastern Tennessee, bounded by creeks and "hollers" and mountain ridges, almost entirely shut away from the rest of the world by muddy, impassable roads. Those hills covered with mountain laurel, dogwood, holly and hundreds of luxuriant plants and trees sheltered the picturesque cabins of mountaineers, many of whom had never been down in the broad valley seven miles away. Gatlinburg, the center of civilization in that part of Tennessee, with its six houses, a "well-ventilated" church, an open air blacksmith shop, a tumbled down school house and two general stores, lay in one of the most beautiful valleys in the entire United States. Families living up and down the creeks that drained into the Little Pigeon River came to Gatlinburg to do their trading but did not go beyond. Five years ago when the Grand Council made the trip from Knoxville to Gatlinburg (a distance of forty-eight miles as the crow flies), we rode all morning on the caboose of a' lumber train which wound its way through fertile valleys, then up a canon along a rushing mountain stream bordered by wooded mountain-sides on which now and then glistened the waters of a misty waterfall, or from which ferns and mountain foliage formed arches over the train as we creaked around the curves. About noon we arrived at Elkmont, a lumber camp, where we had dinner and then climbed aboard an automobile. After a mile, however, over most, exasperating roads the car "gave up the ghost." We walked, waded streams, and finally finished the last two miles of the journey in a Ford which brought us to our destination at about four o'clock in the afternoon. The return trip to Knoxville that same week was made over a different route with a one-horse bu'ggy to Pigeon Forge, seven miles, over the road from Gatlinburg that was then being rebuilt ; I LOADS NEAR GATLINBURC BEFORE IMPROVEMENT NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON then to Sevierville by automobile; and from there to Knot by a small train. On the way down from Gatlinburg we passed lumber wa loaded with tan bark mired down in mud hub deep. A'r o one curve we met two teams at a very narrow place. It necessary for us to unhitch our conveyance, lead our horse to a wider place in the road, hold our one-horse buggy up or side of the mountain while the teams and loaded wagons p-us. The journey down the Little Pigeon River in the one-1' buggy furnished thrills a-plenty and wound up by fording river where the water ran through the bottom of the buggy we perched our feet on the dashboard and made the cro: safely. Plenty of time did we have in jogging along that first s miles to enjoy the cabins tucked away on the hillsides; to the rail fences covered with fragrant honeysuckle vines; ar gaze at the many new and interesting things. At that time work had just been begun on the Gatlinbu: Pigeon Forge road and a steamshovel was grinding its way the mountainsides. Imagine our surprise a year ago to get into a large aut^ bile in Knoxville and to glide over roads as smooth as an could desire and to arrive at Gatlinburg in less than two how Excellent roads, concrete bridges of the latest design, erred roads now greet the traveler on his way into the heart of the Great Smoky region. The excellent main road m runs right by the gate of our Settlement School, is pushing too, towards Asheville, North Carolina, and by the time the C Smoky National Park is opened to the public this road wi completed through one of the most verdant and picturesque of the United States. No longer is that part of Eastern Tennessee shut away the rest of the world. That land of flowering laurel and wood, of rushing waterfalls, of exquisite foliage and ma mountains, of sturdy pioneers is now within easy access. Gatlinburg now boasts our splendid Settlement Scho fine new. church, two excellent summer hotels new homes; 400 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI general stores, a barber shop, two gift shops, two Antique shops and a number of other buildings. The Y.W.C.A. has bought land there for a summer camp, and summer homes are appearing among the trees on the hillsides. Land which was worthless or practically so, ten years ago, is being put into orchards, cultivated into corn fields, or is be-coming the background of ideal summer cottages. Real estate men have options up and down all of the important "hollers" near Little Pigeon River. Land is exchanging hands at almost unbelievable figures. Mountaineers who a few years since were toting their corn to mill on horseback and who bartered for almost everything they had, now do their marketing in an automobile and jingle coins in their pockets. They have improved their homes, bought thorou:hbred stock, are sending their children to school and are learning scientific farming. A.W.S.

        382 THE ARROW oii' PI BETA PHI tion and fifteen in the fifth. From Aunt Lydia's lips these children have heard many of the folksongs and ballads which are still being sung in the mountain districts. This solemn faced woman with a twinkle in her eyes is. not afraid to live alone up on the mountainside. "I never seed but one `f raid in my life," she said, "and that was one night when I seed something black out in the yard. I went out to it and give it a hard kick and it was my little black kittle." In that land of mountain laurel, dogwood, magnolia and tulip trees shut away from the rest of the world by creeks and mountain ridges there is much time for contemplation and the reading of Scripture. There, in the peace and quiet of the valley, Aunt Lydia Whaley has thought out a philosophy of h e r own as one may judge from these words of hers : "I've seed a heap of ups and downs and had a world of trouble the whole world through, and I hope I get to a better some day. But the trials of this world must be borne with patience. This world is only a stopping place." * * * IN MEMORIU11,1 Nothing shall be the same again ; Bright winds that sing And flash a rainbow-colored wing, In hedgero ws wet with April rains; And every lovely thing Shall be less beautiful, Since you Who are more beautiful than these, Have taken wing And flown away, beyond the silent seas. -OLGA BINET.

We meet every second and fourth Friday night. I am teaching Home Hygiene and Care of Sick on Monday and Wednesday in connection with Miss Steele's work in Home Economics. Miss Weston from Boston arrived at Pitman Center t h i s month. We have visited several schools together, getting acquainted. On March 1, Dr. Kinzer and I took two children to Knoxville for examination and treatment. Miss Linn and I attended the East Tennessee State Nurses' association meeting on March 10, also the Mountain. Workers' Conference on March 20. Quite a large delegation of h e a 1 t.h workers were present. I have made seventy-seven visits this month. We are so glad to have had Miss Higinbotham with us for short visit. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 389 THE ARROWCRAVT SHOP T the close of the eight months term of school last spring the Arrowcraft Shop was opened in the dining room of the Teachers Cottage where the kindergarten classes had been. The next month we moved it into the Stuart Cottage where it stayed until school opened again the middle of August. Then back it came to the Teachers Cottage, baskets, tools, chairs and every thing stored wherever there was even a little space. We have planned that as soon as the new building could be finished and the agriculture and shop work moved into it that we would take the little old schoolhouse near the road for the Arrow craft. Day after day we grew more crowded until finally it was apparent that a storage room must be built. and built at once. As it should be where the Shop was' to be permanently we decided to move the old schoolhouse a hundred feet back, build an addition and fix the attics of both the old and new parts for storage, That has been done and we are moving not only the surplus stock but the regular shop there. Againthis year the tourists have come in in sufficient num., bers to make a Gift Shop necessary and we shall continue it through the entire year. Miss LaDelle Allen will have entire charge of the Arrowcraft and with her keen interest and her year of experience here we are 'sure it will be handled most efficiently. When you think that between Sept: 1, 1926, and Sept. 1, 1927, about $21,000 worth of products went out froiu here you will not wonder that it has been necessary to have a place, a per son (or persons) and much time for it all.

OT so very long ago there was a corner of Eastern Tennessee, bounded by creeks and "hollers" and mountain ridges, almost entirely shut away from the rest of the world by muddy, impassable roads. Those hills covered with mountain laurel, dogwood, holly and hundreds of luxuriant plants and trees sheltered the picturesque cabins of mountaineers, many of whom had never been down in the broad valley seven miles away. Gatlinburg, the center of civilization in that part of Tennessee, with its six houses, a "well-ventilated" church, an open air blacksmith shop, a tumbled down school house and two general stores, lay in one of the most beautiful valleys in the entire United States. Families living up and down the creeks that drained into the Little Pigeon River came to Gatlinburg to do their trading but did not go beyond. Five years ago when the Grand Council made the trip from Knoxville to Gatlinburg (a distance of forty-eight miles as the crow flies), we rode all morning on the caboose of a' lumber train which wound its way through fertile valleys, then up a canon along a rushing mountain stream bordered by wooded mountain-sides on which now and then glistened the waters of a misty waterfall, or from which ferns and mountain foliage formed arches over the train as we creaked around the curves. About noon we arrived at Elkmont, a lumber camp, where we had dinner and then climbed aboard an automobile. After a mile, however, over most, exasperating roads the car "gave up the ghost." We walked, waded streams, and finally finished the last two miles of the journey in a Ford which brought us to our destination at about four o'clock in the afternoon. The return trip to Knoxville that same week was made over a different route with a one-horse bu'ggy to Pigeon Forge, seven miles, over the road from Gatlinburg that was then being rebuilt ; I LOADS NEAR GATLINBURC BEFORE IMPROVEMENT NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON then to Sevierville by automobile; and from there to Knot by a small train. On the way down from Gatlinburg we passed lumber wa loaded with tan bark mired down in mud hub deep. A'r o one curve we met two teams at a very narrow place. It necessary for us to unhitch our conveyance, lead our horse to a wider place in the road, hold our one-horse buggy up or side of the mountain while the teams and loaded wagons p-us. The journey down the Little Pigeon River in the one-1' buggy furnished thrills a-plenty and wound up by fording river where the water ran through the bottom of the buggy we perched our feet on the dashboard and made the cro: safely. Plenty of time did we have in jogging along that first s miles to enjoy the cabins tucked away on the hillsides; to the rail fences covered with fragrant honeysuckle vines; ar gaze at the many new and interesting things. At that time work had just been begun on the Gatlinbu: Pigeon Forge road and a steamshovel was grinding its way the mountainsides.

Real estate men have options up and down all of the important "hollers" near Little Pigeon River. Land is exchanging hands at almost unbelievable figures. Mountaineers who a few years since were toting their corn to mill on horseback and who bartered for almost everything they had, now do their marketing in an automobile and jingle coins in their pockets.

This report does not include any of the Sevier county ritory Public Nurse's work. REPORT OF RUBY C. RYMAN FOR JANUARY, 1927 We have been busy with toxin-antitoxin clinics this nzow The teachers have cooperated splendidly with us. Several ( them coming to see us, and requesting the treatment while oth( have written asking when we can come in order that they m work up the clinic so as to include the pre-school children. I Kinzer and I sent the teachers material explaining .the treatme to be distributed. They write the parents and get their perm sion to treat the children, and ask them to bring the younger on, So far we have had only one objection from any parent. T mother wrote the teacher, No, she didn't want her "child assaand nated." This boy needs a tonsillectomy badly. I asked Dr. Ki zer to see him. He did, and said he would see his father at I first oppoi-tunity. As I ride up the streams where we cannot go in a car, t mothers stop me all along the way, and ask me, "If I wog: mind to stop and vaccinate Johnny." They have mumps up the school, and she doesn't want him to get the mumps. M have had several cases of mumps, but hope to avoid an epidem I organized a class in home hygiene and care of the sick January 3. I taught four days a week for the first two wee] now I am teaching two days a week. My class consists of twe] girls from the Gatlinburg High School. We are expecting M Ely to visit us in the near future. Mrs. Bel-rill Ogle continues to. improve. She is now able be up and about the house helping to care for her six lovely : tle children. I took Kate Huskey into Knoxville to Dr. 'Patterson January 24. He was very much pleased with the improvem^ she has made wearing a brace for two months. On New Year's night about twelve o'clock, I answered call for the nurse. It proved to be a gentleman from the, Gre, brier. He had been riding since early evening (the roads w 386 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI so bad). He brought a note from Dr. Hoffman asking. me to call Dr. Lynn immediately, and ask him to start as early as possible in the morning for Gatlinburg. He arrived at seven A. M. We ate breakfast and started in a Ford, arriving at the patient's home at noon. Dr. Lynn did an appendectomy. The appendix was just about to rupture. The patient was a young man in the navy who was spending the holidays at home. He made a rapid recovery. It is impossible to bring a patient out at this season over the roads. We didn't ride all the way by any means, did considerable walking as well as pushing. On January 14, about 3 P. M., I had a letter from Dr. Thomas at Pitman Center, asking me to call a Knoxville surgeon to start immediately for Gatlinburg to go to Pitman Health Center and operate. He asked me to come if I could. Dr. Lynn arrived at 7 o'clock, and we started in a Ford for Pitman. It was raining, and had been raining for several days. Had scarcely started when the Ford stopped we decided we couldn't g o horseback and carry our supplies in the rain, so Mr. Huff said Jim could take us in his Chevrolet as far as the river, about a mile from Pitman; we reached the river about 11 o'clock after much difficulty. We decided to try to cross, but the c a r stopped in the middle of the river, and the rain was pouring. Jim waded out and tried to get a mule team to pull us out. He walked about a mile to a house but could not get any response, as they were all so sound asleep. Jim came back, waded the river again, and tried some folks on the other side about a mile down the river. This time he succeeded in getting a good team which was accustomed to pulling cars out. The man said he would wait for us if we would hurry back. We proceeded to Pitman. The patient had decided to wait another day for his operation. H i s home was five miles up the hollow from Pitman. He told the doctor he would be carried down on the stretcher to Pitman, and have the operation there, but decided after Dr. Thomas left him to wait another day. Imagine how we felt. We started home, and this time both team and car stuck in the middle of the river. Again Jim had to get out and put the mules to the back of the car, pull us back and start again. This time, safely across, the car wouldn't run ; something happened to NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 387 the oil while we were in the water so long. No oil anywhere; finally a man said he had some that had been used. We tried it, all went well until we reached Hickam hill stuck again. Jim assisted Dr. Lynn up. I managed to get up (being more accustomed to mud, and carried the flashlight and lighted the way foi them. We waited in the rain while Jim labored, trying to get the car up. He got it up after a while, and we reached Gatlinburg at 6 A. M., stopping several times to put on chains having lost one, and the other kept coming off. Aunt Lizzie had a good breakfast prepared. We did it justice. This was a night which all of us will long remember. On our first visit to Greenbrier school, Julius Proffitt was the first to greet us. I think he is on his way to China now. FEBRUARY Dr. Kinzer, Miss Linn and I have held twenty-six toxin-antitoxin clinics, and seven typhoid vaccine clinics. Inoculated 153 pre-school children, and 474 above six years of age against diphtheria. We have not included our three largest clinics as our reports are not in as yet. Will feport them next month. I have made thirty-six school visits, not including those in Gatlinburg. All these visits were either in my territory or Pit-man Center territory. Many of these trips require from fifteen to thirty miles horseback riding in one day. Was unable to fill one engagement because I learned I could not get a horse after it was too late to cancel. Miss Linn arrived on February 9. She went with us to Greenbrier on February 11. On February 24 she and I vaccinated about 400 in Pitman Center territory against typhoid and diphtheria. We have had full cooperation with all the teachers. One teacher remained in territory four days after school to work up clinic, and was present at the first one. Have been. unable to fill engagements requested of us. We enjoyed a visit from Miss Joyce Ely on February 11. She came out to visit my Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick class as well as the women's night club which has been organized by Miss Steele and me. She told us of what is being done in our Southland in teaching Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick by the 388 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI Red Cross nurses. Also the combining of this work with home economics. My class is demonstrating to this club what they have accomplished by taking this course. The girls have asked me if they can attend every meeting. It is a real pleasure to me to see the interest they are showing in this work. We meet every two weeks on Friday night. There were fifty-four present last meeting. I attended the East Tennessee Public Health nurses meeting in Knoxville on February 12 with Miss Ely. I made fifty-nine home visits this month, seven business calls and thirty-six school visits. MARCH We had the additional work of dog vaccination this month. I have vaccinated sixty-five against rabies. Bringing ,the dogs to have them vaccinated has increased our Work in inoculations against typhoid fever and diphtheria. The largest group in one day this month was eighty-nine people and twelve dogs at a one-room school, and 229 people and thirty-seven dogs at another three-room school. This trip required a thirty-mile horseback ride over very muddy roads, followed by our club meeting a t night. Our club is proving to be quite worth while.

They have improved their homes, bought thorou:hbred stock, are sending their children to school and are learning scientific farming. A.W.S.

        386 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI so bad). He brought a note from Dr. Hoffman asking. me to call Dr. Lynn immediately, and ask him to start as early as possible in the morning for Gatlinburg. He arrived at seven A. M. We ate breakfast and started in a Ford, arriving at the patient's home at noon. Dr. Lynn did an appendectomy. The appendix was just about to rupture. The patient was a young man in the navy who was spending the holidays at home. He made a rapid recovery. It is impossible to bring a patient out at this season over the roads. We didn't ride all the way by any means, did considerable walking as well as pushing. On January 14, about 3 P. M., I had a letter from Dr. Thomas at Pitman Center, asking me to call a Knoxville surgeon to start immediately for Gatlinburg to go to Pitman Health Center and operate. He asked me to come if I could. Dr. Lynn arrived at 7 o'clock, and we started in a Ford for Pitman. It was raining, and had been raining for several days. Had scarcely started when the Ford stopped we decided we couldn't g o horseback and carry our supplies in the rain, so Mr. Huff said Jim could take us in his Chevrolet as far as the river, about a mile from Pitman; we reached the river about 11 o'clock after much difficulty. We decided to try to cross, but the c a r stopped in the middle of the river, and the rain was pouring. Jim waded out and tried to get a mule team to pull us out. He walked about a mile to a house but could not get any response, as they were all so sound asleep. Jim came back, waded the river again, and tried some folks on the other side about a mile down the river. This time he succeeded in getting a good team which was accustomed to pulling cars out. The man said he would wait for us if we would hurry back. We proceeded to Pitman. The patient had decided to wait another day for his operation. H i s home was five miles up the hollow from Pitman. He told the doctor he would be carried down on the stretcher to Pitman, and have the operation there, but decided after Dr. Thomas left him to wait another day. Imagine how we felt. We started home, and this time both team and car stuck in the middle of the river. Again Jim had to get out and put the mules to the back of the car, pull us back and start again. This time, safely across, the car wouldn't run ; something happened to NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 387 the oil while we were in the water so long. No oil anywhere; finally a man said he had some that had been used. We tried it, all went well until we reached Hickam hill stuck again. Jim assisted Dr. Lynn up. I managed to get up (being more accustomed to mud, and carried the flashlight and lighted the way foi them. We waited in the rain while Jim labored, trying to get the car up. He got it up after a while, and we reached Gatlinburg at 6 A. M., stopping several times to put on chains having lost one, and the other kept coming off. Aunt Lizzie had a good breakfast prepared. We did it justice. This was a night which all of us will long remember. On our first visit to Greenbrier school, Julius Proffitt was the first to greet us. I think he is on his way to China now. FEBRUARY Dr. Kinzer, Miss Linn and I have held twenty-six toxin-antitoxin clinics, and seven typhoid vaccine clinics. Inoculated 153 pre-school children, and 474 above six years of age against diphtheria. We have not included our three largest clinics as our reports are not in as yet. Will feport them next month. I have made thirty-six school visits, not including those in Gatlinburg. All these visits were either in my territory or Pit-man Center territory. Many of these trips require from fifteen to thirty miles horseback riding in one day. Was unable to fill one engagement because I learned I could not get a horse after it was too late to cancel. Miss Linn arrived on February 9. She went with us to Greenbrier on February 11. On February 24 she and I vaccinated about 400 in Pitman Center territory against typhoid and diphtheria. We have had full cooperation with all the teachers. One teacher remained in territory four days after school to work up clinic, and was present at the first one. Have been. unable to fill engagements requested of us. We enjoyed a visit from Miss Joyce Ely on February 11. She came out to visit my Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick class as well as the women's night club which has been organized by Miss Steele and me. She told us of what is being done in our Southland in teaching Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick by the 388 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI Red Cross nurses. Also the combining of this work with home economics. My class is demonstrating to this club what they have accomplished by taking this course. The girls have asked me if they can attend every meeting. It is a real pleasure to me to see the interest they are showing in this work. We meet every two weeks on Friday night. There were fifty-four present last meeting. I attended the East Tennessee Public Health nurses meeting in Knoxville on February 12 with Miss Ely. I made fifty-nine home visits this month, seven business calls and thirty-six school visits. MARCH We had the additional work of dog vaccination this month. I have vaccinated sixty-five against rabies. Bringing ,the dogs to have them vaccinated has increased our Work in inoculations against typhoid fever and diphtheria. The largest group in one day this month was eighty-nine people and twelve dogs at a one-room school, and 229 people and thirty-seven dogs at another three-room school. This trip required a thirty-mile horseback ride over very muddy roads, followed by our club meeting a t night. Our club is proving to be quite worth while. We meet every second and fourth Friday night. I am teaching Home Hygiene and Care of Sick on Monday and Wednesday in connection with Miss Steele's work in Home Economics. Miss Weston from Boston arrived at Pitman Center t h i s month. We have visited several schools together, getting acquainted. On March 1, Dr. Kinzer and I took two children to Knoxville for examination and treatment. Miss Linn and I attended the East Tennessee State Nurses' association meeting on March 10, also the Mountain. Workers' Conference on March 20. Quite a large delegation of h e a 1 t.h workers were present. I have made seventy-seven visits this month. We are so glad to have had Miss Higinbotham with us for short visit. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 389 THE ARROWCRAVT SHOP T the close of the eight months term of school last spring the Arrowcraft Shop was opened in the dining room of the Teachers Cottage where the kindergarten classes had been. The next month we moved it into the Stuart Cottage where it stayed until school opened again the middle of August. Then back it came to the Teachers Cottage, baskets, tools, chairs and every thing stored wherever there was even a little space. We have planned that as soon as the new building could be finished and the agriculture and shop work moved into it that we would take the little old schoolhouse near the road for the Arrow craft. Day after day we grew more crowded until finally it was apparent that a storage room must be built. and built at once. As it should be where the Shop was' to be permanently we decided to move the old schoolhouse a hundred feet back, build an addition and fix the attics of both the old and new parts for storage, That has been done and we are moving not only the surplus stock but the regular shop there.

OT so very long ago there was a corner of Eastern Tennessee, bounded by creeks and "hollers" and mountain ridges, almost entirely shut away from the rest of the world by muddy, impassable roads. Those hills covered with mountain laurel, dogwood, holly and hundreds of luxuriant plants and trees sheltered the picturesque cabins of mountaineers, many of whom had never been down in the broad valley seven miles away. Gatlinburg, the center of civilization in that part of Tennessee, with its six houses, a "well-ventilated" church, an open air blacksmith shop, a tumbled down school house and two general stores, lay in one of the most beautiful valleys in the entire United States. Families living up and down the creeks that drained into the Little Pigeon River came to Gatlinburg to do their trading but did not go beyond. Five years ago when the Grand Council made the trip from Knoxville to Gatlinburg (a distance of forty-eight miles as the crow flies), we rode all morning on the caboose of a' lumber train which wound its way through fertile valleys, then up a canon along a rushing mountain stream bordered by wooded mountain-sides on which now and then glistened the waters of a misty waterfall, or from which ferns and mountain foliage formed arches over the train as we creaked around the curves. About noon we arrived at Elkmont, a lumber camp, where we had dinner and then climbed aboard an automobile. After a mile, however, over most, exasperating roads the car "gave up the ghost." We walked, waded streams, and finally finished the last two miles of the journey in a Ford which brought us to our destination at about four o'clock in the afternoon. The return trip to Knoxville that same week was made over a different route with a one-horse bu'ggy to Pigeon Forge, seven miles, over the road from Gatlinburg that was then being rebuilt ; I LOADS NEAR GATLINBURC BEFORE IMPROVEMENT NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON then to Sevierville by automobile; and from there to Knot by a small train. On the way down from Gatlinburg we passed lumber wa loaded with tan bark mired down in mud hub deep. A'r o one curve we met two teams at a very narrow place. It necessary for us to unhitch our conveyance, lead our horse to a wider place in the road, hold our one-horse buggy up or side of the mountain while the teams and loaded wagons p-us.

Plenty of time did we have in jogging along that first s miles to enjoy the cabins tucked away on the hillsides; to the rail fences covered with fragrant honeysuckle vines; ar gaze at the many new and interesting things. At that time work had just been begun on the Gatlinbu: Pigeon Forge road and a steamshovel was grinding its way the mountainsides. Imagine our surprise a year ago to get into a large aut^ bile in Knoxville and to glide over roads as smooth as an could desire and to arrive at Gatlinburg in less than two how Excellent roads, concrete bridges of the latest design, erred roads now greet the traveler on his way into the heart of the Great Smoky region. The excellent main road m runs right by the gate of our Settlement School, is pushing too, towards Asheville, North Carolina, and by the time the C Smoky National Park is opened to the public this road wi completed through one of the most verdant and picturesque of the United States. No longer is that part of Eastern Tennessee shut away the rest of the world. That land of flowering laurel and wood, of rushing waterfalls, of exquisite foliage and ma mountains, of sturdy pioneers is now within easy access. Gatlinburg now boasts our splendid Settlement Scho fine new. church, two excellent summer hotels new homes; 400 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI general stores, a barber shop, two gift shops, two Antique shops and a number of other buildings.

OT so very long ago there was a corner of Eastern Tennessee, bounded by creeks and "hollers" and mountain ridges, almost entirely shut away from the rest of the world by muddy, impassable roads. Those hills covered with mountain laurel, dogwood, holly and hundreds of luxuriant plants and trees sheltered the picturesque cabins of mountaineers, many of whom had never been down in the broad valley seven miles away. Gatlinburg, the center of civilization in that part of Tennessee, with its six houses, a "well-ventilated" church, an open air blacksmith shop, a tumbled down school house and two general stores, lay in one of the most beautiful valleys in the entire United States. Families living up and down the creeks that drained into the Little Pigeon River came to Gatlinburg to do their trading but did not go beyond. Five years ago when the Grand Council made the trip from Knoxville to Gatlinburg (a distance of forty-eight miles as the crow flies), we rode all morning on the caboose of a' lumber train which wound its way through fertile valleys, then up a canon along a rushing mountain stream bordered by wooded mountain-sides on which now and then glistened the waters of a misty waterfall, or from which ferns and mountain foliage formed arches over the train as we creaked around the curves. About noon we arrived at Elkmont, a lumber camp, where we had dinner and then climbed aboard an automobile. After a mile, however, over most, exasperating roads the car "gave up the ghost." We walked, waded streams, and finally finished the last two miles of the journey in a Ford which brought us to our destination at about four o'clock in the afternoon. The return trip to Knoxville that same week was made over a different route with a one-horse bu'ggy to Pigeon Forge, seven miles, over the road from Gatlinburg that was then being rebuilt ; I LOADS NEAR GATLINBURC BEFORE IMPROVEMENT NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON then to Sevierville by automobile; and from there to Knot by a small train. On the way down from Gatlinburg we passed lumber wa loaded with tan bark mired down in mud hub deep. A'r o one curve we met two teams at a very narrow place. It necessary for us to unhitch our conveyance, lead our horse to a wider place in the road, hold our one-horse buggy up or side of the mountain while the teams and loaded wagons p-us.

        396 THE ARROW OV PI BETA PHI NEW ROADS NEAR GATLINBURG NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 397 NEW MAIN ROADS (Although the trails and by-ways are still muddy and impassable part of the year, good roads are being constructed in Eastern Tennessee and tourist travel is being assured.-The Editor). OT so very long ago there was a corner of Eastern Tennessee, bounded by creeks and "hollers" and mountain ridges, almost entirely shut away from the rest of the world by muddy, impassable roads. Those hills covered with mountain laurel, dogwood, holly and hundreds of luxuriant plants and trees sheltered the picturesque cabins of mountaineers, many of whom had never been down in the broad valley seven miles away. Gatlinburg, the center of civilization in that part of Tennessee, with its six houses, a "well-ventilated" church, an open air blacksmith shop, a tumbled down school house and two general stores, lay in one of the most beautiful valleys in the entire United States. Families living up and down the creeks that drained into the Little Pigeon River came to Gatlinburg to do their trading but did not go beyond. Five years ago when the Grand Council made the trip from Knoxville to Gatlinburg (a distance of forty-eight miles as the crow flies), we rode all morning on the caboose of a' lumber train which wound its way through fertile valleys, then up a canon along a rushing mountain stream bordered by wooded mountain-sides on which now and then glistened the waters of a misty waterfall, or from which ferns and mountain foliage formed arches over the train as we creaked around the curves. About noon we arrived at Elkmont, a lumber camp, where we had dinner and then climbed aboard an automobile. After a mile, however, over most, exasperating roads the car "gave up the ghost." We walked, waded streams, and finally finished the last two miles of the journey in a Ford which brought us to our destination at about four o'clock in the afternoon. The return trip to Knoxville that same week was made over a different route with a one-horse bu'ggy to Pigeon Forge, seven miles, over the road from Gatlinburg that was then being rebuilt ; I LOADS NEAR GATLINBURC BEFORE IMPROVEMENT NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON then to Sevierville by automobile; and from there to Knot by a small train. On the way down from Gatlinburg we passed lumber wa loaded with tan bark mired down in mud hub deep. A'r o one curve we met two teams at a very narrow place. It necessary for us to unhitch our conveyance, lead our horse to a wider place in the road, hold our one-horse buggy up or side of the mountain while the teams and loaded wagons p-us. The journey down the Little Pigeon River in the one-1' buggy furnished thrills a-plenty and wound up by fording river where the water ran through the bottom of the buggy we perched our feet on the dashboard and made the cro: safely. Plenty of time did we have in jogging along that first s miles to enjoy the cabins tucked away on the hillsides; to the rail fences covered with fragrant honeysuckle vines; ar gaze at the many new and interesting things. At that time work had just been begun on the Gatlinbu: Pigeon Forge road and a steamshovel was grinding its way the mountainsides. Imagine our surprise a year ago to get into a large aut^ bile in Knoxville and to glide over roads as smooth as an could desire and to arrive at Gatlinburg in less than two how Excellent roads, concrete bridges of the latest design, erred roads now greet the traveler on his way into the heart of the Great Smoky region.

THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Courtesy of Women and Missions AUNT LYDIA WHALEY NEWS FRoM LITTLE PIGEON . 379 M !L.! NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by BLANCHE CHARLTON Cunris (Mas. PERcE H. 2525 Hillside Drive, Burlingame, Calif. Aunt Lydia Whaley, one of the most picturesque and interesting characters in Eastern Tennessee is no longer to be found in her little cabin on the mountainside. The hands which so expertly wove the baskets which were eagerly sought by everyone, are stilled. After an illness due to her advanced years, Aunt Lydia passed away last spring. The following story written by Agnes Wright Spring, appeared in the November, 19 25, issue of Women and ill issiom and the photograph used here was used as the cover of the magazine and is reprinted by permission of the editor of that magazine. A MOUNTAIN WOMAN IGH up on the side of a "hiller" in the Smoky Mountain region of eastern Tennessee lives "Aunt" Lydia Whaley, `\ i13, despite her eighty-four years, tills her own soil, ral,es her own food, makes remarkable baskets, is a ski.led worker at the loom and spinning wheel and cheers many a weary heart with her unique philosophy. Aunt Lydia is a devout student of the Biblz and can quote Scripture by the hour. All aline, a quarter of a m:lz from her necrest neighbor, this mountain woman lives from day to day with the same independent spirit which she has shown during all the years since her husband was killed in the Civil War, leaving her a widow with a small family to care for. After her husband's death, life in the little log cabin home was a hard struggle. From early dawn until dark Lydia Whaley tended her crop, gathered wild fruits and berries to preserve, took her own corn to mill, made new shoes for her children cut of old ones which she ripped up, and often for the sum of $1 each made coats by hand in order to pay the taxes on her land. 380 THE ARROW 01, PI BETA PH i SOME OF THE STAFF AT GATLINBURG Labelle Allen and "Miss Evelyn" Bishop Gene Redding and Jean Steele (Office Force) (High and Low Jean) Maggie White and Marion Folsom La Dell and Mrs. Chapin (Refer to News From Little Pigeon, ARaow, Feb. 1027, page 415) NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 381 Five or six years after the war, the government allowed her a. pension of $8 a month. "I was a savin' of it," she explained, "and bought each of my chilurn a some u p yander," pointing to t h e Sugarlands. "Later I got them to sell and buy homes here near me." Lydia Whaley, whose "grandpap" moved from "Carliny" to Tennessee a century or more ago, learned to weave when she was so small that the treadles had to be tied up in order that she might reach them. .Her first spinning was done on her grand-mother's wheel, and she later taught the art of weaving and spinning to her daughters. She knows how to make "ooze" out of barks, roots a n d weeds and can explain in detail each step necessary to the making of "county pins," beginning :with the raising of the sheep, the shearing of them, the ashing, spinning, twisting and dyeing of the wool to the making of the patterns such as the "Gentleman's Fancy Little Bow Knot," and the "Rattlesnake." These pat-terns are made from "drafts" handed down from mother to daughter for more than 100 years. From hemlock bark, willow switches, willow bark, white oak, corn husks and ash all of which she obtains on the mountainside near her cabin Aunt Lydia designs and makes baskets of many kinds and shapes. Her basketry fame has spread far and wide and has become a source of considerable revenue to her, Every visitor to Gatlinburg now makes a pilgrimage up the foot-path along Little Pigeon River to the little, one-roomed, window-less cabin with its fireplace and tiny Dutch oven, to purchase baskets and to listen to the stories of the Indians, the Civil War and early Tennessee history which. this picturesque mountaineer loves to relate. When asked if she finds life easier now than when she was bringing up a family, hunt Lydia said: "Well, no. It's easier to have childurn on the toes than on the heart. Back when my childurn was on my toes was the best of it. When they are on the toes it's easier; when they're on the heart, it's worse." Of sturdy Scotch and 'Welsh ancestry, she is the oldest of five generations, there being thirty children in the fourth genera382 THE ARROW oii' PI BETA PHI tion and fifteen in the fifth. From Aunt Lydia's lips these children have heard many of the folksongs and ballads which are still being sung in the mountain districts. This solemn faced woman with a twinkle in her eyes is. not afraid to live alone up on the mountainside. "I never seed but one `f raid in my life," she said, "and that was one night when I seed something black out in the yard. I went out to it and give it a hard kick and it was my little black kittle." In that land of mountain laurel, dogwood, magnolia and tulip trees shut away from the rest of the world by creeks and mountain ridges there is much time for contemplation and the reading of Scripture. There, in the peace and quiet of the valley, Aunt Lydia Whaley has thought out a philosophy of h e r own as one may judge from these words of hers : "I've seed a heap of ups and downs and had a world of trouble the whole world through, and I hope I get to a better some day. But the trials of this world must be borne with patience. This world is only a stopping place." * * * IN MEMORIU11,1 Nothing shall be the same again ; Bright winds that sing And flash a rainbow-colored wing, In hedgero ws wet with April rains; And every lovely thing Shall be less beautiful, Since you Who are more beautiful than these, Have taken wing And flown away, beyond the silent seas. -OLGA BINET.

Inoculated 126 school children against typhoid fever in November and December. I have made 446 visits during five months. Traveled 1,993 miles, the greater part on horseback. Helped to inoculate 935 children against diphtheria, and 447 against typhoid fever in January, February and March. All of these inoculations require from three to five school visits and some from fifteen to thirty mile horseback rides over very rough roads. Reported forty-two babies born during 1926 found unregistered in eleventh, second and fifth districts. Assisted with three major operations. Have given 144 first aid treatments at school.

RYMAN FOR JANUARY, 1927 We have been busy with toxin-antitoxin clinics this nzow The teachers have cooperated splendidly with us. Several ( them coming to see us, and requesting the treatment while oth( have written asking when we can come in order that they m work up the clinic so as to include the pre-school children. I Kinzer and I sent the teachers material explaining .the treatme to be distributed. They write the parents and get their perm sion to treat the children, and ask them to bring the younger on, So far we have had only one objection from any parent. T mother wrote the teacher, No, she didn't want her "child assaand nated." This boy needs a tonsillectomy badly. I asked Dr. Ki zer to see him. He did, and said he would see his father at I first oppoi-tunity. As I ride up the streams where we cannot go in a car, t mothers stop me all along the way, and ask me, "If I wog: mind to stop and vaccinate Johnny." They have mumps up the school, and she doesn't want him to get the mumps. M have had several cases of mumps, but hope to avoid an epidem I organized a class in home hygiene and care of the sick January 3. I taught four days a week for the first two wee] now I am teaching two days a week. My class consists of twe] girls from the Gatlinburg High School. We are expecting M Ely to visit us in the near future. Mrs. Bel-rill Ogle continues to. improve. She is now able be up and about the house helping to care for her six lovely : tle children. I took Kate Huskey into Knoxville to Dr. 'Patterson January 24. He was very much pleased with the improvem^ she has made wearing a brace for two months. On New Year's night about twelve o'clock, I answered call for the nurse. It proved to be a gentleman from the, Gre, brier. He had been riding since early evening (the roads w 386 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI so bad). He brought a note from Dr. Hoffman asking. me to call Dr. Lynn immediately, and ask him to start as early as possible in the morning for Gatlinburg. He arrived at seven A. M. We ate breakfast and started in a Ford, arriving at the patient's home at noon. Dr. Lynn did an appendectomy. The appendix was just about to rupture. The patient was a young man in the navy who was spending the holidays at home. He made a rapid recovery. It is impossible to bring a patient out at this season over the roads. We didn't ride all the way by any means, did considerable walking as well as pushing. On January 14, about 3 P. M., I had a letter from Dr. Thomas at Pitman Center, asking me to call a Knoxville surgeon to start immediately for Gatlinburg to go to Pitman Health Center and operate. He asked me to come if I could. Dr. Lynn arrived at 7 o'clock, and we started in a Ford for Pitman. It was raining, and had been raining for several days. Had scarcely started when the Ford stopped we decided we couldn't g o horseback and carry our supplies in the rain, so Mr. Huff said Jim could take us in his Chevrolet as far as the river, about a mile from Pitman; we reached the river about 11 o'clock after much difficulty. We decided to try to cross, but the c a r stopped in the middle of the river, and the rain was pouring. Jim waded out and tried to get a mule team to pull us out. He walked about a mile to a house but could not get any response, as they were all so sound asleep. Jim came back, waded the river again, and tried some folks on the other side about a mile down the river. This time he succeeded in getting a good team which was accustomed to pulling cars out. The man said he would wait for us if we would hurry back. We proceeded to Pitman. The patient had decided to wait another day for his operation. H i s home was five miles up the hollow from Pitman. He told the doctor he would be carried down on the stretcher to Pitman, and have the operation there, but decided after Dr. Thomas left him to wait another day. Imagine how we felt. We started home, and this time both team and car stuck in the middle of the river. Again Jim had to get out and put the mules to the back of the car, pull us back and start again. This time, safely across, the car wouldn't run ; something happened to NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 387 the oil while we were in the water so long. No oil anywhere; finally a man said he had some that had been used. We tried it, all went well until we reached Hickam hill stuck again. Jim assisted Dr. Lynn up. I managed to get up (being more accustomed to mud, and carried the flashlight and lighted the way foi them. We waited in the rain while Jim labored, trying to get the car up. He got it up after a while, and we reached Gatlinburg at 6 A. M., stopping several times to put on chains having lost one, and the other kept coming off. Aunt Lizzie had a good breakfast prepared. We did it justice. This was a night which all of us will long remember. On our first visit to Greenbrier school, Julius Proffitt was the first to greet us. I think he is on his way to China now. FEBRUARY Dr. Kinzer, Miss Linn and I have held twenty-six toxin-antitoxin clinics, and seven typhoid vaccine clinics. Inoculated 153 pre-school children, and 474 above six years of age against diphtheria. We have not included our three largest clinics as our reports are not in as yet. Will feport them next month. I have made thirty-six school visits, not including those in Gatlinburg. All these visits were either in my territory or Pit-man Center territory. Many of these trips require from fifteen to thirty miles horseback riding in one day. Was unable to fill one engagement because I learned I could not get a horse after it was too late to cancel. Miss Linn arrived on February 9. She went with us to Greenbrier on February 11. On February 24 she and I vaccinated about 400 in Pitman Center territory against typhoid and diphtheria. We have had full cooperation with all the teachers. One teacher remained in territory four days after school to work up clinic, and was present at the first one. Have been. unable to fill engagements requested of us. We enjoyed a visit from Miss Joyce Ely on February 11. She came out to visit my Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick class as well as the women's night club which has been organized by Miss Steele and me. She told us of what is being done in our Southland in teaching Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick by the 388 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI Red Cross nurses. Also the combining of this work with home economics. My class is demonstrating to this club what they have accomplished by taking this course. The girls have asked me if they can attend every meeting. It is a real pleasure to me to see the interest they are showing in this work. We meet every two weeks on Friday night. There were fifty-four present last meeting. I attended the East Tennessee Public Health nurses meeting in Knoxville on February 12 with Miss Ely. I made fifty-nine home visits this month, seven business calls and thirty-six school visits. MARCH We had the additional work of dog vaccination this month. I have vaccinated sixty-five against rabies. Bringing ,the dogs to have them vaccinated has increased our Work in inoculations against typhoid fever and diphtheria. The largest group in one day this month was eighty-nine people and twelve dogs at a one-room school, and 229 people and thirty-seven dogs at another three-room school. This trip required a thirty-mile horseback ride over very muddy roads, followed by our club meeting a t night. Our club is proving to be quite worth while. We meet every second and fourth Friday night. I am teaching Home Hygiene and Care of Sick on Monday and Wednesday in connection with Miss Steele's work in Home Economics. Miss Weston from Boston arrived at Pitman Center t h i s month. We have visited several schools together, getting acquainted. On March 1, Dr. Kinzer and I took two children to Knoxville for examination and treatment. Miss Linn and I attended the East Tennessee State Nurses' association meeting on March 10, also the Mountain. Workers' Conference on March 20. Quite a large delegation of h e a 1 t.h workers were present. I have made seventy-seven visits this month. We are so glad to have had Miss Higinbotham with us for short visit. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 389 THE ARROWCRAVT SHOP T the close of the eight months term of school last spring the Arrowcraft Shop was opened in the dining room of the Teachers Cottage where the kindergarten classes had been. The next month we moved it into the Stuart Cottage where it stayed until school opened again the middle of August. Then back it came to the Teachers Cottage, baskets, tools, chairs and every thing stored wherever there was even a little space. We have planned that as soon as the new building could be finished and the agriculture and shop work moved into it that we would take the little old schoolhouse near the road for the Arrow craft. Day after day we grew more crowded until finally it was apparent that a storage room must be built. and built at once. As it should be where the Shop was' to be permanently we decided to move the old schoolhouse a hundred feet back, build an addition and fix the attics of both the old and new parts for storage, That has been done and we are moving not only the surplus stock but the regular shop there. Againthis year the tourists have come in in sufficient num., bers to make a Gift Shop necessary and we shall continue it through the entire year. Miss LaDelle Allen will have entire charge of the Arrowcraft and with her keen interest and her year of experience here we are 'sure it will be handled most efficiently. When you think that between Sept: 1, 1926, and Sept. 1, 1927, about $21,000 worth of products went out froiu here you will not wonder that it has been necessary to have a place, a per son (or persons) and much time for it all.

OT so very long ago there was a corner of Eastern Tennessee, bounded by creeks and "hollers" and mountain ridges, almost entirely shut away from the rest of the world by muddy, impassable roads. Those hills covered with mountain laurel, dogwood, holly and hundreds of luxuriant plants and trees sheltered the picturesque cabins of mountaineers, many of whom had never been down in the broad valley seven miles away. Gatlinburg, the center of civilization in that part of Tennessee, with its six houses, a "well-ventilated" church, an open air blacksmith shop, a tumbled down school house and two general stores, lay in one of the most beautiful valleys in the entire United States. Families living up and down the creeks that drained into the Little Pigeon River came to Gatlinburg to do their trading but did not go beyond. Five years ago when the Grand Council made the trip from Knoxville to Gatlinburg (a distance of forty-eight miles as the crow flies), we rode all morning on the caboose of a' lumber train which wound its way through fertile valleys, then up a canon along a rushing mountain stream bordered by wooded mountain-sides on which now and then glistened the waters of a misty waterfall, or from which ferns and mountain foliage formed arches over the train as we creaked around the curves. About noon we arrived at Elkmont, a lumber camp, where we had dinner and then climbed aboard an automobile. After a mile, however, over most, exasperating roads the car "gave up the ghost." We walked, waded streams, and finally finished the last two miles of the journey in a Ford which brought us to our destination at about four o'clock in the afternoon. The return trip to Knoxville that same week was made over a different route with a one-horse bu'ggy to Pigeon Forge, seven miles, over the road from Gatlinburg that was then being rebuilt ; I LOADS NEAR GATLINBURC BEFORE IMPROVEMENT NEws FROM LITTLE PIGEON then to Sevierville by automobile; and from there to Knot by a small train. On the way down from Gatlinburg we passed lumber wa loaded with tan bark mired down in mud hub deep. A'r o one curve we met two teams at a very narrow place. It necessary for us to unhitch our conveyance, lead our horse to a wider place in the road, hold our one-horse buggy up or side of the mountain while the teams and loaded wagons p-us. The journey down the Little Pigeon River in the one-1' buggy furnished thrills a-plenty and wound up by fording river where the water ran through the bottom of the buggy we perched our feet on the dashboard and made the cro: safely. Plenty of time did we have in jogging along that first s miles to enjoy the cabins tucked away on the hillsides; to the rail fences covered with fragrant honeysuckle vines; ar gaze at the many new and interesting things. At that time work had just been begun on the Gatlinbu: Pigeon Forge road and a steamshovel was grinding its way the mountainsides. Imagine our surprise a year ago to get into a large aut^ bile in Knoxville and to glide over roads as smooth as an could desire and to arrive at Gatlinburg in less than two how Excellent roads, concrete bridges of the latest design, erred roads now greet the traveler on his way into the heart of the Great Smoky region. The excellent main road m runs right by the gate of our Settlement School, is pushing too, towards Asheville, North Carolina, and by the time the C Smoky National Park is opened to the public this road wi completed through one of the most verdant and picturesque of the United States. No longer is that part of Eastern Tennessee shut away the rest of the world. That land of flowering laurel and wood, of rushing waterfalls, of exquisite foliage and ma mountains, of sturdy pioneers is now within easy access. Gatlinburg now boasts our splendid Settlement Scho fine new. church, two excellent summer hotels new homes; 400 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI general stores, a barber shop, two gift shops, two Antique shops and a number of other buildings. The Y.W.C.A. has bought land there for a summer camp, and summer homes are appearing among the trees on the hillsides. Land which was worthless or practically so, ten years ago, is being put into orchards, cultivated into corn fields, or is be-coming the background of ideal summer cottages. Real estate men have options up and down all of the important "hollers" near Little Pigeon River. Land is exchanging hands at almost unbelievable figures. Mountaineers who a few years since were toting their corn to mill on horseback and who bartered for almost everything they had, now do their marketing in an automobile and jingle coins in their pockets. They have improved their homes, bought thorou:hbred stock, are sending their children to school and are learning scientific farming. A.W.S.
