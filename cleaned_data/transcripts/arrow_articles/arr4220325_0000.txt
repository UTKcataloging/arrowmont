LIFE AT THE GIRLS' DORMITORY At the beginning of the school term of 1920 at Gatlinburg the dormitory for girls was first opened. There were only four of us girls with the young matron. We had all the cooking, house work and our own washing and ironing to do. But with all this work we had time for play and had. lots of fun. At the close of the term there were only two girls left. The dormitory was once an old residence of a very primitive style of architecture. Across the front of the house were two rooms. Between these a narrow, crooked stairway leading to two small bed rooms above. I remember well one time being baptized with the contents of a mop bucket. Just as I started up the stairs one of the girls slipped and fell, knocking over the bucket which she was using on the stairs. When I came to my senses again she was rolling on top of me. In spite of falling girls and buckets we found ourselves unhurt, only thoroughly drenched. The following year when we came back to the dormitory we found many changes in the building. The crooked stairway had been eliminated and in its place was one of easy ascent. There were many new faces in the school that year and I found that our number in the dormitory had increased. The greatest sport with us girls that winter was climibing out on the roof first supplying ourselves with wraps and pillows. Then we would talk over the events of the day and do a bit of gossiping and do some studying. This was.,.. prohibited the next year for fear of damage to the roof. One of the girls was a great reader and she had read a story of girls having secret parties and teas so we all decided we would do likewise. But about the fifth time the little girl we had swiping our things from the kitchen was held up on the stairs by the matron whom we thought had already gone out. The girl, in trying to hide the things under her apron, let them fall and roll down the stairs at the matron's feet. After we girls had seen the matron privately for a few minutes we didn't try to have any more secret teas. I forgot 326 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI to tell you that we girls were not allowed to drink tea but we all liked it. The winter of '23 and '24 an Arcola was installed in the dormitory. It was very cold, that winter and we were busy girls keeping fires so as to keep the pipes from freezing. With all the good time, trials and little troubles we had, I am sorry to say I am not one of the girls at the dormitory this year. LUCINDA OAKLEY. OUR COOKING CLASS The girls in the high school thought themselves in a bad predicament when they heard that the responsibility of cooking lunch for the teachers and the dormitory girls had fallen on them. The high school girls are a humorous lot. Some say they had "the Giggles." No matter how much they fussed about it they usually had fun. Most of them took jokes and some returned them a little too heavily. One girl in the class was inclined to taste the food a little too much, so the others thought. All had been studying the kind of food the body needs. We all know different people need different foods. They decided this girl needed more potato skins so served them to her as they are supposed to be so good for one. I'll leave it to you to decide whether she ate them or not. Some of the cooking done during the summer showed that the girls did not prepare lunches all in vain. They all,liked the teachers, too. If you are ever in Gatlinburg we will welcome you to share our joys and sorrows in the cooking classes. MYRTLE PARTON. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 327 THE RED CROSS CLASS After the Christmas of 1924 there came a new subject in the Pi Beta Phi School. It was the Red Cross training for the girls. The classes came on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoon. The first thing after dinner the girls would go dreamily off to the little hospital. Some of the girls would be "laughing and trying to decide which one would be patient for that afternoon. One very warm afternoon we had our first patient lesson. It was changing a patient from one bed to another. When all the girls got there the nurse asked who would volunteer to be the patient. The girls were slow about volunteering but at last one said she would if some-one else would agree to the next time. Of course the girls said they would take their turn. The first thing to do was to pull another bed up beside the one the girl was in. After this was done the nurse asked three girls to move the patient. They were glad to try and they were trying to be calm but they did laugh in spite of themselves. The girls took the patient and started to the other bed, they were almost there when they began laughing. The patient reached the bed pretty suddenly. A few days later it was another girl's turn to be patient. This time the class had to make a mustard plaster and they left it on so long it almost blistered. The first of May all the girls took examinations. Some were saying that they couldn't pass. The first week of school this year the girls had the surprise of their lives. They were called up in chapel and given their diplomas. They sure were proud of them. OPAL CAREY. THE BOYS' DORMITORY The Boys' Dormitory opened January 8, 1925, with six boys there to stay until the close of school if it was agreeable with everybody. The first thing we had to do after we got settled was to decide who was to carry the woad and water, but after quite a quarrel we finally decided that we would all carry the wood and take morning about carrying the water, so this settled the first question. The next question to cause any trouble was being out at night. To stop this the teachers had us go down to the school house for one hour study period which we thought a very good thing at first but we finally got tired of it. You know boys would get tired even putting holes in doughnuts. So to make things worse we all ran off one night and went to a dance. To our sorrow Miss Evelyn received the news before we returned but she let it go until morning. We had begun to think that the storm had passed over when the call was given for all 328 THE ARROW Or Pr BETA PHI dormitory boys to report to her in the school_ building. Well, I won't tell you what happened at this little meeting but we have not run off to a dance any more. We have a very good bunch of teachers in the school this year and hope to have them back next year. We are disappointed in Miss Taylor, who helps the nurse, though. She hails from Texas where there are several cattle ranches but to our surprise she is afraid of a cow. One day as we came out of the school house for recess we ,heard some one screaming so three or four of us boys ran over there and to our surprise what do you think was the trouble? Well, Miss Taylor had started to the Cottage and as she was looking around over the country she spied a cow in Mr. Maples barn lot so she was afraid to go any farther. She stopped and sent out her appeal for help. The cow was two or three hundred yards from her, across a fence, looking as innocent as a baby. Miss Evelyn just returned from a fine vacation. Some of the people began to think that she had gone for good. All were glad to have her return for she is a friend to us dormitory boys. The teachers sure give us trouble.

NITA HILL STARK As I dictate this article, Fall is already here with its undergraduate interest to Pi Beta Phis, its stirrings in alumnce clubs and the-opening of the Settlement School at Gatlinburg an accomplished fact: We are beginning to think of the problems that daily confront each of us, in our separate and individual spheres and so it seems entirely appropriate that I should discuss with you the greatest work that any fraternity has ever undertaken. Nzws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 329 I am sorry that I cannot come in personal contact with each of you and talk over the problems which daily confront the committee. I went to the Bigwin Inn 'Convention, where I had hoped to get the inspiration which so undoubtedly flows from personal contact. Unfortunately I was stricken ill and lost that opportunity which I am sure the rest of the committee gained. Inasmuch as Lois Stoolman has been promoted to Grand Treasureship and Frances Curtis to Beta Province Vice President, we are to have new faces on the committee and so I shall lack the exchange of advice fi*om these two most valuable sources. I should like to give you a picture of Gatlinburg which May Keller received when on her tour of inspection in 1910 and 1911,-a needy LIVING ROOM, POLLARD COTTAGE community of people of wonderful stock, which lacked the schooling and touch with the outside world so necessary to develop them to the fullest realization of the enjoyment of life and the duties of citizenship ; of little one-room school houses in most cases with only a door for light and ventilation, running sometimes two or three months of the year, with yearly changing of teachers and very little continuity in education. Of course such places have produced the Abraham Lin-coins of the world, but as the march of civilization goes on, it becomes constantly more evident that it requires more training than this to bring our future citizenry into step with all the world. For full information about the early history of the school which 330 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI found its inception in the Washington Alumna* Club, ably championed at the Swarthmore Convention 'on June 29, 1910 by Emma Harper Turner, a former Grand President of the Fraternity, let me refer you to the reprints from THE ARRow of Pi Beta Phi, 'which may be secured by writing in to the Historian, Sarah Eikenberry Sigler (Mrs. F. C.), 703 West Ashland Ave., Indianola, Iowa. Under the able leadership of May Keller, Anna Nickerson, Amy Onken, Elizabeth Clark-Helmick, Abbie Langmaid, Kate Miller, Martha Hill, Dell Gillette, Illinois Z, (now Mrs. P. R. Morgan), Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Anne and Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, Evelyn Bishop, New York A and many others, this small beginning which was opened December 20, 1912 with one teacher and thirteen small children has naturally grown and developed into what we have today. For equipment we have a six-room school building, steam heated, modestly equipped for weaving, domestic science and school work; our Smith-Hughes and manual training domiciled in the decayed one-room log building which served as our beginning, a ten-room teachers' cottage and two cottages for girl boarders, a completely equipped small hospital and another cottage at some distance for use of the boys. All of these, with the exception of the boys' cottage are steam heated and equipped with running water. We have a staff of fifteen teachers under the able direction of Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A. In this staff the feminine part of which are mostly Pi Phis, we have two men for the handling of farm instruction, manual training and such kindred subjects. We have a graduate nurse and assistant, who spend their time taking care of the needs of the district. I wish I could picture for you the growth of the community, *Which now has become a mountain summer resort, with electric lights sup-plied from a dam, with picture shows given regularly once a week in the Pi Phi barn, with a machine donated to Pi Phi; with a demand for better drinking water and all things hygiene, with radio also donated to Pi Phis, with growing demands for pure and blooded stock and chickens, with an annual fair held early in September, from which exhibits are sent to the outside world, where boys and girls are growing up with an interest in life and a desire to go to college, where people from contact with the outside world are beginning to think of those things which go to make your life and mine so useful and pleasant. Could I do all these things, I would present to you the problems which lead me to ask the headline question. While the community has advanced in its thought, its financial standing has increased very little. Our weaving has become recognized throughout Pi Phi, the demand for our basketry is growing at such a great rate that we are trying now to put in charge the very best type of teacher, so that we may standardize this work. No longer do we purchase all the work Ntws FROM LITTEiE PIGEON 331 offered to us and we intend to trademark all this work so that our brand will become known throughout the length and breadth of our country. But in a community which has served as the summer home of Knoxville Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls, which has become a moderately priced mountain summer resort, where the people are coming in daily contact with the outside world through picture shows, the radio, their basketball and baseball teams, there is no longer the necessity to stress such rules of health and hygiene as it was formerly, over and above the necessity of teaching all civilized children the use of the tooth brush and soap. Nothing could be clearer than this after looking at the pictures shown herewith of some of our boys and girls. So that if we are to continue in Gatlinburg, the type of work necessarily had to be enlarged and changed. If we do not give the children preparatory college work, this community must necessarily develop another school to do this work or go without it and with a demand for college training, are we fulfilling our duty to the community? If we do not prepare them for college, then the children must seek this work elsewhere, which seems contrary to the usual American system of education. But what of the Settlement School Idea? There are plenty of places in the mountains of Tennessee where this type of work is almost as necessary as it was in Gatlinburg before the coming of Pi Phi. The Committee has sought to continue this work by establishing a feeder school at Sugarlands under Pi Phi instruction. This worked splendidly last year and we hope to continue the work, except that we would rather the county supplied the teacher and let Pi Phi do the resident supervising. If our policy is to continue, then we are establishing a mountain school something of the type of Berea. If we are to continue to do settlement school work alone, then we necessarily must go where the work is needed. But what of our investment at Gatlinburg? The community is not large and financially strong enough to take it over, and so it seems to us that our duty is to continue what we are doing. As you know, the Settlement School is supported from two sources; the under-graduate support from the beginning has been placed in an endowment fund which now amounts to $12,000.00. The real work of the school has been financed by free-will offerings from the various alumne clubs and by gifts to the school such as the dental equipment, the hospital equipment, the picture machine, the radio and others. There is no definite understanding as to the amount or the time when these gifts may come in, nor is it certain that some club, which has been a heavy supporter in the past will continue that support. We have developed quite a wonderful institution but this matter of financing, while it has kept in the amount, has nothing definite about it and so the Committee feels that it is about time you as fraternity members deteirmine what you desire to do in the future and thus relieve the Committee of trying to solve the problem. 332 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI The Committee representing Pi Beta Phi has no selfish interest in what it is doing for the Settlement School. Knowing all of the problems and watching the School grow from day to day, the Committee is but seeking to serve Pi Beta Phi's wishes in the development of the surrounding country. They have definitely made up their minds from what they know of the investment, the response of the community and the type of work that is being done, that the Settlement School should remain at Gatlinburg, supported by under-graduates and alumnie clubs in some definite budgeted manner, receiving as now at Gatlinburg and in the outlying feeder schools some small support from' the county, state and government in Smith-Hughes and other funds. The Committee feels that it should continue the feeder school idea which was tried out with such great success last year and should establish more county schools under Pi Phi supervision, it should continue to develop the weaving, basketry, farming, pure-bred livestock raising and all other things, besides preparing such children as desire at least an accredited high school education in anticipation of college. As I said before, the Committee is seeking to serve Pi Beta Phi and would appreciate any letters from those interested, asking any and all questions which may come to mind and giving any and all ideas with regard to the development and continuance of this wnrk,. so that they can answer the query WHAT SHALL WE DO AT GATLINBURG?

The fraternity passed a ruling two years Rough Probation ago prohibiting any form of mock initiation or rough probation and every chapter should abide by this fraternity law. Pi Beta Phi does not believe that a girl's loyalty can be in-creased or her interest in the fraternity strengthened if she is required to perform menial tasks for upper classmen or to participate in anything that will make her conspicuous or embarrassed. To see a freshman pushing a tea cart (on which reposes a rag doll) through the streets of a. college town surely does not raise fraternities in the estimation of the on-lookers! To quote from The Palm of Alpha Tau Omega: Good sense on the subject of rough initiations and hazing has come from President Coolidge. It may do good, although the type of mind that goes in for rough initiations is not the sort easily accessible to good sense from any source. A dispatch from Washington, dated May 1, reads as follows: Rough hazing of college fraternity freshmen, is frowned upon by President Coolidge. In joining today as a charter member a fraternity composed of fathers who are members of Phi Gamma Delta and 'ehose sons are of the same fraternity the President expressed his disfavor for present day methods of training freshmen. He believes college freshmen have enough to do if they attend to their studies without acceding to the demands of seniors for shoe shines and other service. In the case of his son, John, a student at Amherst, Mr. Coolidge takes the position that the boy is in college for a definite purpose which cannot be aided materially by horseplay. No complaint or intimation of such tactics, however, has come from young Coolidge. * * * We who are proud of our Settlement School in the Tennessee Mountains should also be interested in the philanthropic enter prises of the other national frater Phi Mu's Philanthropy nities. For three years the Phi Mu Healthmobile has been traveling through Georgia under the auspices of the Georgia State Board of Health, with Dr. Alice Moses, director of the Division of Child Hygiene at its helm.

        328 THE ARROW Or Pr BETA PHI dormitory boys to report to her in the school_ building. Well, I won't tell you what happened at this little meeting but we have not run off to a dance any more. We have a very good bunch of teachers in the school this year and hope to have them back next year. We are disappointed in Miss Taylor, who helps the nurse, though. She hails from Texas where there are several cattle ranches but to our surprise she is afraid of a cow. One day as we came out of the school house for recess we ,heard some one screaming so three or four of us boys ran over there and to our surprise what do you think was the trouble? Well, Miss Taylor had started to the Cottage and as she was looking around over the country she spied a cow in Mr. Maples barn lot so she was afraid to go any farther. She stopped and sent out her appeal for help. The cow was two or three hundred yards from her, across a fence, looking as innocent as a baby. Miss Evelyn just returned from a fine vacation. Some of the people began to think that she had gone for good. All were glad to have her return for she is a friend to us dormitory boys. The teachers sure give us trouble. ROY GRIFFIN. * * * WHAT SHALL WE DO AT GATLINI.31.TRG? NITA HILL STARK As I dictate this article, Fall is already here with its undergraduate interest to Pi Beta Phis, its stirrings in alumnce clubs and the-opening of the Settlement School at Gatlinburg an accomplished fact: We are beginning to think of the problems that daily confront each of us, in our separate and individual spheres and so it seems entirely appropriate that I should discuss with you the greatest work that any fraternity has ever undertaken. Nzws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 329 I am sorry that I cannot come in personal contact with each of you and talk over the problems which daily confront the committee. I went to the Bigwin Inn 'Convention, where I had hoped to get the inspiration which so undoubtedly flows from personal contact. Unfortunately I was stricken ill and lost that opportunity which I am sure the rest of the committee gained. Inasmuch as Lois Stoolman has been promoted to Grand Treasureship and Frances Curtis to Beta Province Vice President, we are to have new faces on the committee and so I shall lack the exchange of advice fi*om these two most valuable sources. I should like to give you a picture of Gatlinburg which May Keller received when on her tour of inspection in 1910 and 1911,-a needy LIVING ROOM, POLLARD COTTAGE community of people of wonderful stock, which lacked the schooling and touch with the outside world so necessary to develop them to the fullest realization of the enjoyment of life and the duties of citizenship ; of little one-room school houses in most cases with only a door for light and ventilation, running sometimes two or three months of the year, with yearly changing of teachers and very little continuity in education. Of course such places have produced the Abraham Lin-coins of the world, but as the march of civilization goes on, it becomes constantly more evident that it requires more training than this to bring our future citizenry into step with all the world. For full information about the early history of the school which 330 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI found its inception in the Washington Alumna* Club, ably championed at the Swarthmore Convention 'on June 29, 1910 by Emma Harper Turner, a former Grand President of the Fraternity, let me refer you to the reprints from THE ARRow of Pi Beta Phi, 'which may be secured by writing in to the Historian, Sarah Eikenberry Sigler (Mrs. F. C.), 703 West Ashland Ave., Indianola, Iowa. Under the able leadership of May Keller, Anna Nickerson, Amy Onken, Elizabeth Clark-Helmick, Abbie Langmaid, Kate Miller, Martha Hill, Dell Gillette, Illinois Z, (now Mrs. P. R. Morgan), Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Anne and Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, Evelyn Bishop, New York A and many others, this small beginning which was opened December 20, 1912 with one teacher and thirteen small children has naturally grown and developed into what we have today. For equipment we have a six-room school building, steam heated, modestly equipped for weaving, domestic science and school work; our Smith-Hughes and manual training domiciled in the decayed one-room log building which served as our beginning, a ten-room teachers' cottage and two cottages for girl boarders, a completely equipped small hospital and another cottage at some distance for use of the boys. All of these, with the exception of the boys' cottage are steam heated and equipped with running water. We have a staff of fifteen teachers under the able direction of Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A. In this staff the feminine part of which are mostly Pi Phis, we have two men for the handling of farm instruction, manual training and such kindred subjects. We have a graduate nurse and assistant, who spend their time taking care of the needs of the district. I wish I could picture for you the growth of the community, *Which now has become a mountain summer resort, with electric lights sup-plied from a dam, with picture shows given regularly once a week in the Pi Phi barn, with a machine donated to Pi Phi; with a demand for better drinking water and all things hygiene, with radio also donated to Pi Phis, with growing demands for pure and blooded stock and chickens, with an annual fair held early in September, from which exhibits are sent to the outside world, where boys and girls are growing up with an interest in life and a desire to go to college, where people from contact with the outside world are beginning to think of those things which go to make your life and mine so useful and pleasant. Could I do all these things, I would present to you the problems which lead me to ask the headline question. While the community has advanced in its thought, its financial standing has increased very little. Our weaving has become recognized throughout Pi Phi, the demand for our basketry is growing at such a great rate that we are trying now to put in charge the very best type of teacher, so that we may standardize this work. No longer do we purchase all the work Ntws FROM LITTEiE PIGEON 331 offered to us and we intend to trademark all this work so that our brand will become known throughout the length and breadth of our country. But in a community which has served as the summer home of Knoxville Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls, which has become a moderately priced mountain summer resort, where the people are coming in daily contact with the outside world through picture shows, the radio, their basketball and baseball teams, there is no longer the necessity to stress such rules of health and hygiene as it was formerly, over and above the necessity of teaching all civilized children the use of the tooth brush and soap. Nothing could be clearer than this after looking at the pictures shown herewith of some of our boys and girls. So that if we are to continue in Gatlinburg, the type of work necessarily had to be enlarged and changed. If we do not give the children preparatory college work, this community must necessarily develop another school to do this work or go without it and with a demand for college training, are we fulfilling our duty to the community? If we do not prepare them for college, then the children must seek this work elsewhere, which seems contrary to the usual American system of education. But what of the Settlement School Idea? There are plenty of places in the mountains of Tennessee where this type of work is almost as necessary as it was in Gatlinburg before the coming of Pi Phi. The Committee has sought to continue this work by establishing a feeder school at Sugarlands under Pi Phi instruction. This worked splendidly last year and we hope to continue the work, except that we would rather the county supplied the teacher and let Pi Phi do the resident supervising. If our policy is to continue, then we are establishing a mountain school something of the type of Berea. If we are to continue to do settlement school work alone, then we necessarily must go where the work is needed. But what of our investment at Gatlinburg? The community is not large and financially strong enough to take it over, and so it seems to us that our duty is to continue what we are doing. As you know, the Settlement School is supported from two sources; the under-graduate support from the beginning has been placed in an endowment fund which now amounts to $12,000.00. The real work of the school has been financed by free-will offerings from the various alumne clubs and by gifts to the school such as the dental equipment, the hospital equipment, the picture machine, the radio and others. There is no definite understanding as to the amount or the time when these gifts may come in, nor is it certain that some club, which has been a heavy supporter in the past will continue that support. We have developed quite a wonderful institution but this matter of financing, while it has kept in the amount, has nothing definite about it and so the Committee feels that it is about time you as fraternity members deteirmine what you desire to do in the future and thus relieve the Committee of trying to solve the problem. 332 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI The Committee representing Pi Beta Phi has no selfish interest in what it is doing for the Settlement School. Knowing all of the problems and watching the School grow from day to day, the Committee is but seeking to serve Pi Beta Phi's wishes in the development of the surrounding country. They have definitely made up their minds from what they know of the investment, the response of the community and the type of work that is being done, that the Settlement School should remain at Gatlinburg, supported by under-graduates and alumnie clubs in some definite budgeted manner, receiving as now at Gatlinburg and in the outlying feeder schools some small support from' the county, state and government in Smith-Hughes and other funds. The Committee feels that it should continue the feeder school idea which was tried out with such great success last year and should establish more county schools under Pi Phi supervision, it should continue to develop the weaving, basketry, farming, pure-bred livestock raising and all other things, besides preparing such children as desire at least an accredited high school education in anticipation of college. As I said before, the Committee is seeking to serve Pi Beta Phi and would appreciate any letters from those interested, asking any and all questions which may come to mind and giving any and all ideas with regard to the development and continuance of this wnrk,. so that they can answer the query WHAT SHALL WE DO AT GATLINBURG?

LIFE AT THE GIRLS' DORMITORY At the beginning of the school term of 1920 at Gatlinburg the dormitory for girls was first opened. There were only four of us girls with the young matron. We had all the cooking, house work and our own washing and ironing to do. But with all this work we had time for play and had. lots of fun. At the close of the term there were only two girls left. The dormitory was once an old residence of a very primitive style of architecture. Across the front of the house were two rooms. Between these a narrow, crooked stairway leading to two small bed rooms above. I remember well one time being baptized with the contents of a mop bucket. Just as I started up the stairs one of the girls slipped and fell, knocking over the bucket which she was using on the stairs. When I came to my senses again she was rolling on top of me. In spite of falling girls and buckets we found ourselves unhurt, only thoroughly drenched. The following year when we came back to the dormitory we found many changes in the building. The crooked stairway had been eliminated and in its place was one of easy ascent. There were many new faces in the school that year and I found that our number in the dormitory had increased. The greatest sport with us girls that winter was climibing out on the roof first supplying ourselves with wraps and pillows. Then we would talk over the events of the day and do a bit of gossiping and do some studying. This was.,.. prohibited the next year for fear of damage to the roof. One of the girls was a great reader and she had read a story of girls having secret parties and teas so we all decided we would do likewise. But about the fifth time the little girl we had swiping our things from the kitchen was held up on the stairs by the matron whom we thought had already gone out. The girl, in trying to hide the things under her apron, let them fall and roll down the stairs at the matron's feet. After we girls had seen the matron privately for a few minutes we didn't try to have any more secret teas. I forgot 326 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI to tell you that we girls were not allowed to drink tea but we all liked it. The winter of '23 and '24 an Arcola was installed in the dormitory. It was very cold, that winter and we were busy girls keeping fires so as to keep the pipes from freezing. With all the good time, trials and little troubles we had, I am sorry to say I am not one of the girls at the dormitory this year. LUCINDA OAKLEY. OUR COOKING CLASS The girls in the high school thought themselves in a bad predicament when they heard that the responsibility of cooking lunch for the teachers and the dormitory girls had fallen on them. The high school girls are a humorous lot. Some say they had "the Giggles." No matter how much they fussed about it they usually had fun. Most of them took jokes and some returned them a little too heavily. One girl in the class was inclined to taste the food a little too much, so the others thought. All had been studying the kind of food the body needs. We all know different people need different foods. They decided this girl needed more potato skins so served them to her as they are supposed to be so good for one. I'll leave it to you to decide whether she ate them or not. Some of the cooking done during the summer showed that the girls did not prepare lunches all in vain. They all,liked the teachers, too. If you are ever in Gatlinburg we will welcome you to share our joys and sorrows in the cooking classes. MYRTLE PARTON. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 327 THE RED CROSS CLASS After the Christmas of 1924 there came a new subject in the Pi Beta Phi School. It was the Red Cross training for the girls. The classes came on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoon. The first thing after dinner the girls would go dreamily off to the little hospital. Some of the girls would be "laughing and trying to decide which one would be patient for that afternoon. One very warm afternoon we had our first patient lesson. It was changing a patient from one bed to another. When all the girls got there the nurse asked who would volunteer to be the patient. The girls were slow about volunteering but at last one said she would if some-one else would agree to the next time. Of course the girls said they would take their turn. The first thing to do was to pull another bed up beside the one the girl was in. After this was done the nurse asked three girls to move the patient. They were glad to try and they were trying to be calm but they did laugh in spite of themselves. The girls took the patient and started to the other bed, they were almost there when they began laughing. The patient reached the bed pretty suddenly. A few days later it was another girl's turn to be patient. This time the class had to make a mustard plaster and they left it on so long it almost blistered. The first of May all the girls took examinations. Some were saying that they couldn't pass. The first week of school this year the girls had the surprise of their lives. They were called up in chapel and given their diplomas. They sure were proud of them. OPAL CAREY. THE BOYS' DORMITORY The Boys' Dormitory opened January 8, 1925, with six boys there to stay until the close of school if it was agreeable with everybody. The first thing we had to do after we got settled was to decide who was to carry the woad and water, but after quite a quarrel we finally decided that we would all carry the wood and take morning about carrying the water, so this settled the first question. The next question to cause any trouble was being out at night. To stop this the teachers had us go down to the school house for one hour study period which we thought a very good thing at first but we finally got tired of it. You know boys would get tired even putting holes in doughnuts. So to make things worse we all ran off one night and went to a dance. To our sorrow Miss Evelyn received the news before we returned but she let it go until morning. We had begun to think that the storm had passed over when the call was given for all 328 THE ARROW Or Pr BETA PHI dormitory boys to report to her in the school_ building. Well, I won't tell you what happened at this little meeting but we have not run off to a dance any more. We have a very good bunch of teachers in the school this year and hope to have them back next year. We are disappointed in Miss Taylor, who helps the nurse, though. She hails from Texas where there are several cattle ranches but to our surprise she is afraid of a cow. One day as we came out of the school house for recess we ,heard some one screaming so three or four of us boys ran over there and to our surprise what do you think was the trouble? Well, Miss Taylor had started to the Cottage and as she was looking around over the country she spied a cow in Mr. Maples barn lot so she was afraid to go any farther. She stopped and sent out her appeal for help. The cow was two or three hundred yards from her, across a fence, looking as innocent as a baby. Miss Evelyn just returned from a fine vacation. Some of the people began to think that she had gone for good. All were glad to have her return for she is a friend to us dormitory boys. The teachers sure give us trouble. ROY GRIFFIN. * * * WHAT SHALL WE DO AT GATLINI.31.TRG? NITA HILL STARK As I dictate this article, Fall is already here with its undergraduate interest to Pi Beta Phis, its stirrings in alumnce clubs and the-opening of the Settlement School at Gatlinburg an accomplished fact: We are beginning to think of the problems that daily confront each of us, in our separate and individual spheres and so it seems entirely appropriate that I should discuss with you the greatest work that any fraternity has ever undertaken. Nzws FROM LITTLE PIGEON 329 I am sorry that I cannot come in personal contact with each of you and talk over the problems which daily confront the committee. I went to the Bigwin Inn 'Convention, where I had hoped to get the inspiration which so undoubtedly flows from personal contact. Unfortunately I was stricken ill and lost that opportunity which I am sure the rest of the committee gained. Inasmuch as Lois Stoolman has been promoted to Grand Treasureship and Frances Curtis to Beta Province Vice President, we are to have new faces on the committee and so I shall lack the exchange of advice fi*om these two most valuable sources. I should like to give you a picture of Gatlinburg which May Keller received when on her tour of inspection in 1910 and 1911,-a needy LIVING ROOM, POLLARD COTTAGE community of people of wonderful stock, which lacked the schooling and touch with the outside world so necessary to develop them to the fullest realization of the enjoyment of life and the duties of citizenship ; of little one-room school houses in most cases with only a door for light and ventilation, running sometimes two or three months of the year, with yearly changing of teachers and very little continuity in education. Of course such places have produced the Abraham Lin-coins of the world, but as the march of civilization goes on, it becomes constantly more evident that it requires more training than this to bring our future citizenry into step with all the world. For full information about the early history of the school which 330 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI found its inception in the Washington Alumna* Club, ably championed at the Swarthmore Convention 'on June 29, 1910 by Emma Harper Turner, a former Grand President of the Fraternity, let me refer you to the reprints from THE ARRow of Pi Beta Phi, 'which may be secured by writing in to the Historian, Sarah Eikenberry Sigler (Mrs. F. C.), 703 West Ashland Ave., Indianola, Iowa. Under the able leadership of May Keller, Anna Nickerson, Amy Onken, Elizabeth Clark-Helmick, Abbie Langmaid, Kate Miller, Martha Hill, Dell Gillette, Illinois Z, (now Mrs. P. R. Morgan), Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Anne and Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, Evelyn Bishop, New York A and many others, this small beginning which was opened December 20, 1912 with one teacher and thirteen small children has naturally grown and developed into what we have today. For equipment we have a six-room school building, steam heated, modestly equipped for weaving, domestic science and school work; our Smith-Hughes and manual training domiciled in the decayed one-room log building which served as our beginning, a ten-room teachers' cottage and two cottages for girl boarders, a completely equipped small hospital and another cottage at some distance for use of the boys. All of these, with the exception of the boys' cottage are steam heated and equipped with running water. We have a staff of fifteen teachers under the able direction of Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A. In this staff the feminine part of which are mostly Pi Phis, we have two men for the handling of farm instruction, manual training and such kindred subjects. We have a graduate nurse and assistant, who spend their time taking care of the needs of the district. I wish I could picture for you the growth of the community, *Which now has become a mountain summer resort, with electric lights sup-plied from a dam, with picture shows given regularly once a week in the Pi Phi barn, with a machine donated to Pi Phi; with a demand for better drinking water and all things hygiene, with radio also donated to Pi Phis, with growing demands for pure and blooded stock and chickens, with an annual fair held early in September, from which exhibits are sent to the outside world, where boys and girls are growing up with an interest in life and a desire to go to college, where people from contact with the outside world are beginning to think of those things which go to make your life and mine so useful and pleasant. Could I do all these things, I would present to you the problems which lead me to ask the headline question. While the community has advanced in its thought, its financial standing has increased very little. Our weaving has become recognized throughout Pi Phi, the demand for our basketry is growing at such a great rate that we are trying now to put in charge the very best type of teacher, so that we may standardize this work. No longer do we purchase all the work Ntws FROM LITTEiE PIGEON 331 offered to us and we intend to trademark all this work so that our brand will become known throughout the length and breadth of our country. But in a community which has served as the summer home of Knoxville Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls, which has become a moderately priced mountain summer resort, where the people are coming in daily contact with the outside world through picture shows, the radio, their basketball and baseball teams, there is no longer the necessity to stress such rules of health and hygiene as it was formerly, over and above the necessity of teaching all civilized children the use of the tooth brush and soap. Nothing could be clearer than this after looking at the pictures shown herewith of some of our boys and girls. So that if we are to continue in Gatlinburg, the type of work necessarily had to be enlarged and changed. If we do not give the children preparatory college work, this community must necessarily develop another school to do this work or go without it and with a demand for college training, are we fulfilling our duty to the community? If we do not prepare them for college, then the children must seek this work elsewhere, which seems contrary to the usual American system of education. But what of the Settlement School Idea? There are plenty of places in the mountains of Tennessee where this type of work is almost as necessary as it was in Gatlinburg before the coming of Pi Phi. The Committee has sought to continue this work by establishing a feeder school at Sugarlands under Pi Phi instruction. This worked splendidly last year and we hope to continue the work, except that we would rather the county supplied the teacher and let Pi Phi do the resident supervising. If our policy is to continue, then we are establishing a mountain school something of the type of Berea. If we are to continue to do settlement school work alone, then we necessarily must go where the work is needed. But what of our investment at Gatlinburg? The community is not large and financially strong enough to take it over, and so it seems to us that our duty is to continue what we are doing. As you know, the Settlement School is supported from two sources; the under-graduate support from the beginning has been placed in an endowment fund which now amounts to $12,000.00. The real work of the school has been financed by free-will offerings from the various alumne clubs and by gifts to the school such as the dental equipment, the hospital equipment, the picture machine, the radio and others. There is no definite understanding as to the amount or the time when these gifts may come in, nor is it certain that some club, which has been a heavy supporter in the past will continue that support. We have developed quite a wonderful institution but this matter of financing, while it has kept in the amount, has nothing definite about it and so the Committee feels that it is about time you as fraternity members deteirmine what you desire to do in the future and thus relieve the Committee of trying to solve the problem. 332 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI The Committee representing Pi Beta Phi has no selfish interest in what it is doing for the Settlement School. Knowing all of the problems and watching the School grow from day to day, the Committee is but seeking to serve Pi Beta Phi's wishes in the development of the surrounding country. They have definitely made up their minds from what they know of the investment, the response of the community and the type of work that is being done, that the Settlement School should remain at Gatlinburg, supported by under-graduates and alumnie clubs in some definite budgeted manner, receiving as now at Gatlinburg and in the outlying feeder schools some small support from' the county, state and government in Smith-Hughes and other funds. The Committee feels that it should continue the feeder school idea which was tried out with such great success last year and should establish more county schools under Pi Phi supervision, it should continue to develop the weaving, basketry, farming, pure-bred livestock raising and all other things, besides preparing such children as desire at least an accredited high school education in anticipation of college. As I said before, the Committee is seeking to serve Pi Beta Phi and would appreciate any letters from those interested, asking any and all questions which may come to mind and giving any and all ideas with regard to the development and continuance of this wnrk,. so that they can answer the query WHAT SHALL WE DO AT GATLINBURG?

The fraternity passed a ruling two years Rough Probation ago prohibiting any form of mock initiation or rough probation and every chapter should abide by this fraternity law. Pi Beta Phi does not believe that a girl's loyalty can be in-creased or her interest in the fraternity strengthened if she is required to perform menial tasks for upper classmen or to participate in anything that will make her conspicuous or embarrassed. To see a freshman pushing a tea cart (on which reposes a rag doll) through the streets of a. college town surely does not raise fraternities in the estimation of the on-lookers! To quote from The Palm of Alpha Tau Omega: Good sense on the subject of rough initiations and hazing has come from President Coolidge. It may do good, although the type of mind that goes in for rough initiations is not the sort easily accessible to good sense from any source. A dispatch from Washington, dated May 1, reads as follows: Rough hazing of college fraternity freshmen, is frowned upon by President Coolidge. In joining today as a charter member a fraternity composed of fathers who are members of Phi Gamma Delta and 'ehose sons are of the same fraternity the President expressed his disfavor for present day methods of training freshmen. He believes college freshmen have enough to do if they attend to their studies without acceding to the demands of seniors for shoe shines and other service. In the case of his son, John, a student at Amherst, Mr. Coolidge takes the position that the boy is in college for a definite purpose which cannot be aided materially by horseplay. No complaint or intimation of such tactics, however, has come from young Coolidge. * * * We who are proud of our Settlement School in the Tennessee Mountains should also be interested in the philanthropic enter prises of the other national frater Phi Mu's Philanthropy nities.
