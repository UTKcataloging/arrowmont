The answer is, "No." The accor articles are by persons of different training, occupation, and point of view: Mrs. Weaver, loyal II 4), m( Illinois Z, and director of the School since July, 1934, who has had ample opportunity to observe the School meets the needs of the community ; and Colonel Eakin, Superintendent of the Great Smoky Natior who is well acquainted with conditions throughout Tennessee. PRESENT DAY SERVICE By J. R. EAKIN Due to changed conditions in the community the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School has a greater field of usefulness than ever before. Probably the mere teaching of the three R's could be well done in a County school, except that the capable staff of the present school would then not come in contact with the pupils, and thus would be unable to teach them things that are in my opinion more important. I refer to agriculture, home economics, sewing and making over of clothing, etc. Many people here believe that the most important and the most vital activity of the school is the weaving classes in which the mountain women are taught design and color in order to reproduce pioneer weaving. I am informed that more than one hundred mountain women are self-supporting in whole or in part, by weaving in their homes. Aside from the fact that if school instruction is withdrawn designs would deteriorate, a ready market could not be found for mountain products, as is now done by the Pi Phi Alumnae Associations. Cooking and sewing schools are also conducted for grown mountain women. A recent occurrence may be of interest. A mountain woman has shown aptitude for making baskets, but designs used by her were so unattractive there was little sale for her work. The school has completed designs for baskets that will have a ready sale. That the Pi Phi School has a great field of usefulness and is taking advantage of the opportunity, there is no doubt. It would be a great pity if the fruits of the vision which founded the school were nullified by with-drawing from the field.

How I revel in their beauty! Color does something to me that I cannot put into words one has to feel it to understand. From these colors I make my selections, taking this one, and discarding that one, until I get the combination that I want. The selected ones belong to what I call the same family of colors. Now I'm ready to begin the weaving. Most of the time the design is created as I weave lots of times I grow so interested in working out an idea that I get all keyed up, just as I used to do when singing a song I particularly loved.

THE MAY ARROW TLIN G PICTURES G \. I a, U By CHARLOTTE CROPLEY BROWN From my first trip to Gatlinburg I had brought back some priceless memory pictures, unforgettable memories of the rare natural beauty of the countryside and the naive graciousness of the "Burg's" people, but it remained for my second trip there to give me two really intimate Gatlinburg pictures a harp-singing and a weavers' meeting. A harp-singing or singing on the old harp as some prefer to call it does not involve the use of that great golden instrument which, I suspect, has been called to your mind. The name originated instead from the title of an old-time song book, Harp of Columbia. Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in their titles, and it is thus that all singing from these books earns its name. Within the books the old-fashioned square and diamond-shaped notes, the lack of a signature, and the peculiar method of indicating time relationships make even the simplest song quite unreadable to those of us uninitated in the art of harp-singing. It was Mr. Harve Reagan, member of the local committee, who planned a special harp-singing for the Settlement School Commit-tee one Sunday during our visit last summer. Gathered in the church, a group of about twenty-five, mostly men, sang for us for more than an hour. It was fascinating. The elderly director had the same regular attention from his group that one expects to see a trained college glee club director command. He found the true pitch for his chorus by using a tuning-fork such as most of us have seen only in a museum or a physics laboratory. Then there was his instruction, "Strike your pitch now, all your parts. Ready, Sing." With arms beating time, the leader carried his group, unaccompanied, through the minor harmonies of the various songs. All were hymns; some resembled the Gregorian chants which many churches have adapted for modern use. "When shall I be delivered from this vain world of sin ?" was sung with the greatest enthusiasm, I think, but I liked best the spirited "Blow, blow, ye trumpet, blow." Weavers' meeting on the previous day had meant some harp-singing, too. The Gatlin-burg Weavers' Guild, sponsored and organ-ized three years ago by Craft and weaving depar real women's organizatioi Its name indicates its m( interest.

So now I am the proud possessor, or rather the shop is, of full pages of her sketches and her full name and address. When she left the shop, she shook hands, saying, "It is nice to have known you. I hope you will continue to have a successful year as I understand you have had a splendid summer." Customers like the Rockefellers don't come our way every day. They gave six mil-lions to the Park, and this was their first visit here. Mr. Rockefeller told Colonel Eakin that he had no conception of the grandeur of our mountains. They were out every day going over and through the mountains. They were both very pleasant to everyone whom they came in contact with, and as folks up here say, "just as common as anybody." We had a surprise party last night. About five o'clock seven gentlemen called at the Arrow Craft Shop: Henry A. Wallace, U. S. Secretary of Agriculture; A. E. Morgan, TVA Chairman; Earl Draper, Chief of Home Planning Division of the TVA; Neil Bass, former City Manager of Knoxville; Secretary Wallace's secretary; and two gentlemen from Knoxville. They bought some things and asked questions about the business. When they were ready to leave, Mrs. Pattengill brought them up to the cottage to meet the family. As it was then ten minutes full time THE MAY ARROW for the bell to ring, we invited them to sup-per. To our surprise and pleasure they accepted, and Mrs. McDonald rose to the occasion, as she always does, and had a very nice supper. But I guess this news belongs to Mrs. Pattengill, so I'll ring off . I don't want to steal her thunder. This is Sunday. Dinner is over, and soon I go back to the church to play for the Sun-day afternoon singing. You know I enjoy this immensely it is not the kind of music that I've always known and has been my life, but it is the kind for our mountain people, and they love it. If you could see the crowd of stalwart men that gathers there for this, you'd realize how worth while it is and what joy this small service to them brings me. The little old white church on the Pigeon, surrounded on Sundays by every sort of temptation to lure these folks away from their church and Sunday observances, rings with the voices of the mountain people, singing their "do-misol-do's." Then the poetry of the songs they love so well ! a something of refinement and betterment is bound to come and uplift as music always does to the souls that love it.

The answer is, "No." The accor articles are by persons of different training, occupation, and point of view: Mrs. Weaver, loyal II 4), m( Illinois Z, and director of the School since July, 1934, who has had ample opportunity to observe the School meets the needs of the community ; and Colonel Eakin, Superintendent of the Great Smoky Natior who is well acquainted with conditions throughout Tennessee. PRESENT DAY SERVICE By J. R. EAKIN Due to changed conditions in the community the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School has a greater field of usefulness than ever before. Probably the mere teaching of the three R's could be well done in a County school, except that the capable staff of the present school would then not come in contact with the pupils, and thus would be unable to teach them things that are in my opinion more important. I refer to agriculture, home economics, sewing and making over of clothing, etc. Many people here believe that the most important and the most vital activity of the school is the weaving classes in which the mountain women are taught design and color in order to reproduce pioneer weaving. I am informed that more than one hundred mountain women are self-supporting in whole or in part, by weaving in their homes. Aside from the fact that if school instruction is withdrawn designs would deteriorate, a ready market could not be found for mountain products, as is now done by the Pi Phi Alumnae Associations. Cooking and sewing schools are also conducted for grown mountain women. A recent occurrence may be of interest. A mountain woman has shown aptitude for making baskets, but designs used by her were so unattractive there was little sale for her work. The school has completed designs for baskets that will have a ready sale. That the Pi Phi School has a great field of usefulness and is taking advantage of the opportunity, there is no doubt. It would be a great pity if the fruits of the vision which founded the school were nullified by with-drawing from the field. GATLINBURG AND THE SCHO By EUNICE WEAVER Upon the Settlement School falls responsibility in the changing world little Gatlinburg.

"As you know, our chapter at Swarthmore College is now non-existent. After we sold our chapter lodge and paid back every dollar to those who built the lodge, we still had money to `invest' in some Pi Beta Phi projects. Yours was one of the two chosen. "We shall enjoy knowing we are helping in your fine work. "Most sincerely yours, "MARY W. REDPATH" MY AFGH NS By GEORGIE M. DUFFIELD ve been asked to tell how I make my s I really do not know, unless it is put into them, the thing that I used into my songs myself. (Meld at her loom. One of her afghans, price $12.00, is hanging from the loom. n. I gave up singing, I tried hard to mething that would take the place of rt of me that seemed to be gone. In vh I found the loom. Now, I put into my weaving what I used to put into my sin ing. When getting ready to make an afghan, I sometimes sit on the floor, beside a little old-fashioned trunk where I keep my yarns, and gather from its depths my arms and lap full of its lovely colors. How I revel in their beauty! Color does something to me that I cannot put into words one has to feel it to understand. From these colors I make my selections, taking this one, and discarding that one, until I get the combination that I want. The selected ones belong to what I call the same family of colors. Now I'm ready to begin the weaving. Most of the time the design is created as I weave lots of times I grow so interested in working out an idea that I get all keyed up, just as I used to do when singing a song I particularly loved. Creative work a getting away from one's self and things that bother into a world of beautiful dreams and blissful forgetfulness. The afghan's nothing wonderful just mine a part of me. THE MAY ARROW TLIN G PICTURES G \. I a, U By CHARLOTTE CROPLEY BROWN From my first trip to Gatlinburg I had brought back some priceless memory pictures, unforgettable memories of the rare natural beauty of the countryside and the naive graciousness of the "Burg's" people, but it remained for my second trip there to give me two really intimate Gatlinburg pictures a harp-singing and a weavers' meeting. A harp-singing or singing on the old harp as some prefer to call it does not involve the use of that great golden instrument which, I suspect, has been called to your mind. The name originated instead from the title of an old-time song book, Harp of Columbia. Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in their titles, and it is thus that all singing from these books earns its name. Within the books the old-fashioned square and diamond-shaped notes, the lack of a signature, and the peculiar method of indicating time relationships make even the simplest song quite unreadable to those of us uninitated in the art of harp-singing. It was Mr. Harve Reagan, member of the local committee, who planned a special harp-singing for the Settlement School Commit-tee one Sunday during our visit last summer. Gathered in the church, a group of about twenty-five, mostly men, sang for us for more than an hour. It was fascinating. The elderly director had the same regular attention from his group that one expects to see a trained college glee club director command. He found the true pitch for his chorus by using a tuning-fork such as most of us have seen only in a museum or a physics laboratory. Then there was his instruction, "Strike your pitch now, all your parts. Ready, Sing." With arms beating time, the leader carried his group, unaccompanied, through the minor harmonies of the various songs. All were hymns; some resembled the Gregorian chants which many churches have adapted for modern use. "When shall I be delivered from this vain world of sin ?" was sung with the greatest enthusiasm, I think, but I liked best the spirited "Blow, blow, ye trumpet, blow." Weavers' meeting on the previous day had meant some harp-singing, too. The Gatlin-burg Weavers' Guild, sponsored and organ-ized three years ago by Craft and weaving depar real women's organizatioi Its name indicates its m( interest. Programs and r monthly meetings have weavers' committees wort ance of the staff. Eager organization has been e' bers arrive regularly tv,) early for the meetings, si in . ;terns of news while t: more than six miles to Much of direct value to t gained through the pre perts have brought in torical and technical asp the use of color, older described interesting aril the greatest contribution o through the feeling of sc liness which the meetii bred.

The col' which the weavers had weave, hung at the win. weaving room. In spite o it was last July's hotte certain festive spirit in ti was simple, harp-singing under Mollie Moore's di behalf of the fraternity and from the committe^ presentation of the Scho( rector who had arrived fore, and finally, an info] ing which refreshments gathered to talk busily. members marvelled as strated some particularly one of the many looms in endless questions.

"I shall how you can follow that pattern, but I think the perfectly beautiful," said member. And almost at the Izora, the basket-maker, hese years did understandhow the Pi Phis found such grand commit-tees, but I do believe this committee here is just the best one yet." What if the mercury outside was breaking all previous Gatlinburg temperature records? Inside, all time records of mutual trust and loyalty were being made through the medium of "a weavers' meeting." Can you see why I treasure so fondly those new memory pictures of mine? MY GUEST zOOK By GEORGIE M. DUFFIELD This is the second in a series of two articles by Mis' Georgic ng round, and my legs are ;e last few weeks. October Lsy month in this little shops ing into the hotel like bees Georgie's shop in the Mountain View Hotel :an live years in this place eks. If only I had the names to have been in to see and )ut no time to fish out the d beneath a stack of bath i in my crowded quarters st prominent visitors were m D. Rockefeller, Jr., who day until Tuesday morning !y paid several visits to the ,lodcefeller bought a dozen me an order for four dozen more for her four grandchildren one dozen for each. I have a whole big page of her sketches of designs she thought would be at-tractive in them, and each child's name so that I could have the names on each one. She had a lot of fun over the drawings as she said she was no artist. Mrs. Rockefeller said, You can write to me about them; and if you will give me your book, I will write my ad-dress for you." So now I am the proud possessor, or rather the shop is, of full pages of her sketches and her full name and address. When she left the shop, she shook hands, saying, "It is nice to have known you. I hope you will continue to have a successful year as I understand you have had a splendid summer." Customers like the Rockefellers don't come our way every day. They gave six mil-lions to the Park, and this was their first visit here. Mr. Rockefeller told Colonel Eakin that he had no conception of the grandeur of our mountains. They were out every day going over and through the mountains. They were both very pleasant to everyone whom they came in contact with, and as folks up here say, "just as common as anybody." We had a surprise party last night. About five o'clock seven gentlemen called at the Arrow Craft Shop: Henry A. Wallace, U. S. Secretary of Agriculture; A. E. Morgan, TVA Chairman; Earl Draper, Chief of Home Planning Division of the TVA; Neil Bass, former City Manager of Knoxville; Secretary Wallace's secretary; and two gentlemen from Knoxville. They bought some things and asked questions about the business. When they were ready to leave, Mrs. Pattengill brought them up to the cottage to meet the family. As it was then ten minutes full time THE MAY ARROW for the bell to ring, we invited them to sup-per. To our surprise and pleasure they accepted, and Mrs. McDonald rose to the occasion, as she always does, and had a very nice supper. But I guess this news belongs to Mrs. Pattengill, so I'll ring off . I don't want to steal her thunder. This is Sunday. Dinner is over, and soon I go back to the church to play for the Sun-day afternoon singing. You know I enjoy this immensely it is not the kind of music that I've always known and has been my life, but it is the kind for our mountain people, and they love it. If you could see the crowd of stalwart men that gathers there for this, you'd realize how worth while it is and what joy this small service to them brings me. The little old white church on the Pigeon, surrounded on Sundays by every sort of temptation to lure these folks away from their church and Sunday observances, rings with the voices of the mountain people, singing their "do-misol-do's." Then the poetry of the songs they love so well ! a something of refinement and betterment is bound to come and uplift as music always does to the souls that love it.
