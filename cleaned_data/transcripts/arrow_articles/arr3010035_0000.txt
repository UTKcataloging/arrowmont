        34 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON KATE R. MILLER [Since much of the recent history of our Settlement School while interesting to us was of too personal a nature to be published in a regular number of THE ARRow, Miss Miller has kindly prepared this intimate account of current history in addition to the formal report of the Chairman and Treasurer of the Settlement School Committee which will be found in the section devoted to reports of committees.-EmToR.] The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee of the Chicago Alum= Club is very happy to announce to the fraternity that a permanent home for the school has been secured. On Monday, July 21, the committee sent Mrs. Helmick and me to Tennessee to make the final adjustment of the land question. March 13, Mrs. Helmick had written to the County Superintendent of Public Schools, Mr. J. R. Keeble, of Sevierville, asking permission to use the new school house the next year. On June 26, she wrote again, telling him of the selection of teachers for the new year and of her determination to secure land when she went down in July. She wrote, saying, in substance, that we were leaving Chicago on July 21, for Gatlinburg, to prepare for the opening of school on August 4. She also wrote to E. E. Ogle, L. Maples, and A. J. Huff of Gatlinburg that we were coming, and that if the school were established permanently in Gatlinburg, the community would need to give the fraternity a tract of land. She further wrote that the E. E. Ogle tract on which the cottage was situated would be acceptable. She had no, response from any of these gentlemen. But knowing the habits of the mountain people, she attached no special significance to their failure to answer letters. We arrived in Sevierville on Tuesday afternoon after a hot journey from Chicago. After supper, Mr. Keeble called upon us at the Snapp House. He told us that our school had been very much the best one that Gatlinburg had ever had, that every one in the community, with one or two exceptions, wanted us to conduct the school in the public school house again this year, and wanted our school to be permanent, but that Dr. Montgomery, the member of the County School Board for the large school district in which Gatlin-burg is situated, was opposed to it. When we had somewhat re-covered from the surprise occasioned by this last statement, we GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 35 sought explanations. That our surprise may be understood, it should be stated that last year we had cooperated with the public school and used the public school building only at the earnest request of Mr. Keeble and with his oral and written promise that the whole school situation in Gatlinburg district would this year be given into our hands. He had promised Mrs. Helmick and me personally that the money used for school purposes there, amounting to $300 more or less, annually, would be given to us. We had acted upon this request and promise. He now said that he was as surprised as we were to learn of Dr. Montgomery's opposition, but that there was nothing he, Mr. Keeble, could do more than he had done in trying to influence the school director. We might perhaps be able to influence him before the next Saturday, when the school board would meet in Sevierville and officially appoint the teachers for the coming year, thus putting the seal upon whatever the various school directors should then recommend. We had heard that Dr. Montgomery's children had been the terror of all previous school teachers, but that the Pi Phi teacher last year had disciplined one of them and that they had then either stayed at home or been tractable. In revenge for Pi Phi's not recognizing the privileges of the children of the arbiter of the school destinies of Civil District 11 of Sevier County, Dr. and Mrs. Montgomery had said that "them wimmen" should not teach their school again. This statement was riveted to a promije to one of the native teachers Mr. Fillmore McMahan, that he should have the school. Mr. Keeble assured us of his support, but said that he had no real power in such cases, that each school director was practically absolute ruler of the school situation in his own district. Then the County Superintendent further disheartened us by saying that though he knew the Gatlinburg families, with the exception noted, were our loyal friends, he did not think that the men would give us land. This latter statement disturbed us more that the other, concerning the opposition of the school. director, for we knew that it was the result of personal pique and political ambition. As the superintendent hinted the women teachers had no vote, and the native men teachers who did were complaining of the "foreign labor" that was taking their jobs. We felt that perhaps such politics might be diplomatically handled, but that if the community refused to give 36 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI us land, we should be compelled at once to seek another field for our work. Mrs. Helmick and the committee, after much correspondence with men and women experienced in such work as ours, and after personal investigation, had come to the conclusion that the community in which the school was located must, for the best interests of both community and fraternity, cooperate with us to the extent of giving land for school purposes. We had left Chicago this time instructed not to return without a deed to land in Gatlinburg or in some other suitable and needy place. The members of the Committee of Ten, who first selected a place for the school, are best fitted to understand the consternation in our hearts when it seemed probable that we should have a similar task to perform. Our calls in Sevierville on the president of the school board, Mr. Rawlings, the former president, Mr. Ballard, also vice-president of the Seiverville Bank, and Mr. Drinnen, former County Superintendent and a prominent lawyer, made us realize that we were again in the land of uncertain information, for they all told us that they knew Dr. Montgomery well, and that they were sure there was no opposition to us whatever. They thought that the director from the eleventh district would not think of "turning down" an eight months' school conducted by competent teachers for a four or five months' school with a native teacher in charge, that he would not dare to do it in the face of the sentiment of the community. With these conflicting statements we left Sevierville for our fate on the Little Pigeon. Mrs. Helmick and I have written of the ride over the rough mountain roads in September and in November. The beauty of the mountains in another season we had eagerly anticipated, but their beauty for us this morning was clouded by something other than the alluring haze which always envelops the ranges of the Great Smoky Mountains. I have made this long preliminary explanation in order that the situation which confronted us may be understood.* The temptation before me in writing this report has been to announce to the fraternity only the results of our final crossing of Pi Phi's Little Pigeon Rubicon. I feel, however, that even though these details may be tiresome, they are essential to a satisfactory understanding GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 37 of the results. And the miracle which happened would not be a miracle to the one who did not know them. It seemed to us like getting home after a long absence when we had forded Little Pigeon for the last time and approached the ford to Roaring Book, at the foot of the school house hill. By those we met we were greeted with impassive cordiality, and, it seemed, latent wonder as to what we would do. Please note the italicized we at this stage of the story. We crossed Roaring Brook and drove on beside the winding Little Pigeon into the heart of Gatlinburg, greeted the people in the scattered houses who came to their doorways to see us, and then turned up Baskin's Creek to Mrs. Andrew Huff's, where we were to have dinner, the invitation having been given by telephone to us in Sevierville. Mrs. Huff's greeting had none of the mountain reserve with which outsiders are met. She was genuinely glad to see us and received us as if we were her "own folks". We learned from her that "everybody" Ts. anted us to have the public school on the hill, and she reiterated Mr. Keeble's praises ,of our school work, and added that her children had learned more under "Miss Dell's" teaching than they had learned during all their previous schooling, that she and "Andy" would not send their children to school at all unless we taught, and that most of the people had said the same thing. After dinner we went up to the hill to the Pi Phi Cottage, and made it as habitable 'as we could for a stay of possibly only a few days. Visitors at once began to arrive and to talk in their hesitant but always friendly fashion. From the moment of our arrival, we were deeply touched by their conviction of their own helplessness in the situation and by their hope that the "winimen", meaning us, could in some way straighten out the tangle. As this day and other days wore away, we had to grip hard our own conviction that the fraternity interests and those of the community, too, demanded our departure if the people could not be roused to give land. All that they would now talk of, however, was our securing control of the public school, or, if we failed in that, our opening an independent school in the ramshackle, abandoned one-room building on the same tract with the cottage, the desired E. E. Ogle tract, which the men said could be "fixed up" at slight expense and used until we could erect our own building. They still hoped, however, that the 38 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI County Board might be moved to act according to the public opinion of Gatlinburg. On Saturday morning early, Mr. Huff came to drive Mrs. Helmick to Sevierville for the Board meeting. We had been unable to see the all important Dr. Montgomery. He is a physician for a lumber camp many miles away in the mountains, and comes home only for the week end. He had been expected at home the pre-ceding Friday night, as he would of course have to be at the Board meeting on Saturday. We had gone to the Montgomery home to see him and waited until after dark, but he did not come. We afterwards learned that the native teachers had stopped him on his way home and kept him until we nad left his house. This, you see, was their tribute to the persuasive powers of Mrs. Helmick. We could not see him that night, but Mrs. Helmick was determined to see him early the next morning. However, when she stopped on the way to Sevierville, she found that two of the young men had gone home with him for the night, and all had left before daylight. So her first encounter with our friend, the enemy, was in the Board meeting. I hope you may all hear her tell of that meeting. If there had not been an obligation very binding, the vote would certainly have been in our favor. As it was, the Board gave the public school for the year to Mr. McMahan, but, the President of the Board said, voted that after Christmas, the public school building should be given us for our use, and that another year we should have the whole school situation in our hands. Mrs. Helmick had convinced them that we were in earnest; Dr. Montgomery had intimated that we were not. Now we were face to face with the really important land question. After a very great deal of talking, Mr. Huff said that the men might be able to get us the Steve Whaley tract, worth about $600. But it was not desirable land for our purposes. The men did not think that E. E. Ogle would sell his land, even if the money could be raised. But it seemed to all of us that the Ogle tract was the only one acceptable, and that with proper suasion Mr. Ogle would part with it. They wanted us to try to get the money and also to persuade Mr. Ogle. Tuesday morning, Mrs. Helmick went down to Mr. Ogle's store hoping to influence him to sell his tract for $1200. He refused this, but said that he would sell for $1800. So if the fraternity would put in $600 and the men $1200, the land could no doubt be secured. This GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 39 ultimatum was therefore given on Tuesday morning: if this Ogle land were not secured for us (we contributing $600) by Wednesday noon, we should go elsewhere and establish a school where land would be given us. We now wondered what they would do. They were at last convinced that "those wimmen" meant what they said. We packed our trunks, began to get the household things ready to leave until we should have them sent elsewhere, ordered the hack from Sevierville to come for us the next day, and wondered what the next twenty-four hours would bring forth. Mr. Huff was sent for from his lumber camp eight miles away; every one gave up his business and those that had no business gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for any public affair. They said that there was no one to go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Mr. Huff was drawn forth. As I think back over the stirring weeks, it seems to me that nothing which came out of them will be of greater good to these men and women than this: the knowledge that they can do things themselves. Tuesday evening we had many callers, three of the women staying until after dark. They said they just couldn't let us go, that they knew the men would try their best, but that perhaps they couldn't raise enough money. For women in the mountains to stay out after dark was a violation of their social code, but they were forgetting even their rigid social customs now. The next morning while we were at breakfast, Mr. Huff and Mr. Whaley came to get us to draw up a subscription paper. Mrs. Helmick wrote the heading for one, putting Pi Beta. Phi down for $600. Mr. Huff put down $250 and Mr. Whaley '$250. Then they started off saying that the hack would not take us back. Later Mrs. Huff came and told us her dream, which must be another story. When she had told it to her husband that morning, she had said, "Andy, you must keep them wimmen here, if it takes everything you've got." "Andy," we found out afterwards, had said that he would give a thousand dollars if that were necessary, but shrewd man that he was, he thought that he would first get others to give as much as they would, and then he would make up the deficit. We 40 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI again sat on our front porch and wondered and watched the excited groups around the store at the foot of the hill. Bulletins were given us from time to time, but as the morning wore on towards noon, and several hundred dollars were still lacking, we, the people and the three of us on the Pi Beta Phi veranda, were all at such a tension that, if some relief did not come immediately, it seemed we should break. Just before noon Mr. E. E. Ogle came up to say that he had decided to sell the tract if the money could be raised. As he had said that he would give as much as any one towards the purchase price, the men were counting on him for $250, though he had not yet put his name down. He was a very staunch friend of the school and had made up his mind that he would rather have the school than his land provided he could get a fair price for the land. His neighbors said that if "Eph" had wanted to sell to any one else, he could have gotten $2000. The mountaineers like to own land, some-thing tangible, that cannot be eaten up or worn out. They under-stand the value of land, but they do not understand the value of money except as it will buy more land ; they are therefore not eager to sell. Furthermore, this particular tract of land had come by original grant, to an ancestor of E. E. Ogle. All this Mr. Ogle had balanced against the school, and the school won. But how can we make clear that even now his shrewdness in a land trade was not in abeyance! He came to us to ask if we would care if he should put a new store building, which he expected to erect soon, on a corner of this tract. When he was asked if he wished to rent or lease the land, his gray eyes twinkled as he said no, he guessed he meant that he would just reserve that when he made the deed. But he respected the business sense of the fraternity's representatives all the more when they refused him. The last stage of the transaction was at hand. The hack from Sevierville now arrived and raised the excitement to a fever heat. Soon after its arrival, word was sent us that we were wanted at the store. Mrs. Helmick must sometime picture for you the scene at the store. Men were crowding around outside the building, on the steps, in the doors, were standing inside and sitting on the counters. We found 'Mr. Ogle busy writing a title bond to be held by us till the deed could be made and sworn to. Almost all the money had been subscribed and Mr. Huff and Mr. Maple had agreed to make up any final deficit. When the terms were finally and satis GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 41 factorily embodied in this preliminary instrument, it was signed and given to Mrs. Helmick. The wave of relaxation that passed through that assemblage was almost audible. Charlie Ogle, the son of Mr. E. E. Ogle, collected all the fire-cracke)rs remaining from the Fourth, and fired them off in front of the store, thus announcing to any few who were not at the store that "them wimmen" were not going back to Sevierville in the hack. All that happened after this seemed to us at the time an anti-climax, but intrinsically it was not. Word was sent to Miss Helen Bryan (New York Beta), who had written from Asheville, North Carolina, asking if she could be of any help, that she could, and trunks were unpacked. Preparations were made for rendering what was now our own ramshackle school house habitable until something better could be had. The men straightened some of the elevations in the floor, put another rock or so in the foundation, closed up a few air spaces, while the women vigorously scrubbed away the ac-cumulations of months. On Monday, August 4, at eight a. m. Miss Langmaid opened the school while Mrs. Helmick assisted the surveyor in his travels over the Pi Beta Phi lands, and I trailed after them. The next day Mrs. Helmick transacted necessary business, kept house, and entertained visitors, while Miss Langmaid and I taught school. There were thirty-three scholars to begin with, ranging from the kindergarten grade to the sixth grade, all that the two of us could possibly take care of in one room. Pending the arrival of Miss Ledbetter or Miss Bryan, this arrangement held. Both Mrs. Helmick and I had already stayed beyond the leave of absence our families had given us, but Miss Langmaid felt, as we did, too,. of course, that we could not go until some one came. But on Saturday, Aug-List 9, Mrs. Helmick felt compelled to leave. Before she left Sevierville, however, on that last Saturday, she saw the deed signed, and it is now in her possession. A copy of it is appended to this report. . Miss Bryan arrived Monday noon, August 11. She went at once into the school, and took charge of the eighteen kindergartners, "primarians" and first graders, while I prepared to go back with the driver that brought her. After our departure Miss Ledbetter arrived. She found, however, that she was not strong enough for the very busy life of the:teachers, 42 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI having been ill this summer. Much to our disappointment, she has been compelled to go home. So now, at this writing, August 22, Miss Bryan, who came to visit, is the only resident besides Miss Lang-maid, resident in charge. Our own building is to be erected just as soon as Mr. Huff can get out the lumber. He will begin doing this when the sap ceases to run; he says in September. Then the lumber is to be put in dry kilns and the seasoning hastened as much as is possible.. Conditions at Gatlinburg are ripe for everything we can possibly do. (Mrs. Helmick will in her report make clear the pressing needs of the school.) If we could but let you look into the crystal of our past three weeks' experience, no plea from the committee would be necessary.

Mr. Huff was sent for from his lumber camp eight miles away; every one gave up his business and those that had no business gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for any public affair. They said that there was no one to go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Mr. Huff was drawn forth. As I think back over the stirring weeks, it seems to me that nothing which came out of them will be of greater good to these men and women than this: the knowledge that they can do things themselves. Tuesday evening we had many callers, three of the women staying until after dark. They said they just couldn't let us go, that they knew the men would try their best, but that perhaps they couldn't raise enough money. For women in the mountains to stay out after dark was a violation of their social code, but they were forgetting even their rigid social customs now. The next morning while we were at breakfast, Mr. Huff and Mr. Whaley came to get us to draw up a subscription paper. Mrs. Helmick wrote the heading for one, putting Pi Beta. Phi down for $600. Mr. Huff put down $250 and Mr. Whaley '$250. Then they started off saying that the hack would not take us back. Later Mrs. Huff came and told us her dream, which must be another story. When she had told it to her husband that morning, she had said, "Andy, you must keep them wimmen here, if it takes everything you've got." "Andy," we found out afterwards, had said that he would give a thousand dollars if that were necessary, but shrewd man that he was, he thought that he would first get others to give as much as they would, and then he would make up the deficit. We 40 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI again sat on our front porch and wondered and watched the excited groups around the store at the foot of the hill. Bulletins were given us from time to time, but as the morning wore on towards noon, and several hundred dollars were still lacking, we, the people and the three of us on the Pi Beta Phi veranda, were all at such a tension that, if some relief did not come immediately, it seemed we should break. Just before noon Mr. E. E. Ogle came up to say that he had decided to sell the tract if the money could be raised. As he had said that he would give as much as any one towards the purchase price, the men were counting on him for $250, though he had not yet put his name down. He was a very staunch friend of the school and had made up his mind that he would rather have the school than his land provided he could get a fair price for the land. His neighbors said that if "Eph" had wanted to sell to any one else, he could have gotten $2000. The mountaineers like to own land, some-thing tangible, that cannot be eaten up or worn out. They under-stand the value of land, but they do not understand the value of money except as it will buy more land ; they are therefore not eager to sell. Furthermore, this particular tract of land had come by original grant, to an ancestor of E. E. Ogle. All this Mr. Ogle had balanced against the school, and the school won. But how can we make clear that even now his shrewdness in a land trade was not in abeyance! He came to us to ask if we would care if he should put a new store building, which he expected to erect soon, on a corner of this tract. When he was asked if he wished to rent or lease the land, his gray eyes twinkled as he said no, he guessed he meant that he would just reserve that when he made the deed. But he respected the business sense of the fraternity's representatives all the more when they refused him. The last stage of the transaction was at hand. The hack from Sevierville now arrived and raised the excitement to a fever heat. Soon after its arrival, word was sent us that we were wanted at the store. Mrs. Helmick must sometime picture for you the scene at the store. Men were crowding around outside the building, on the steps, in the doors, were standing inside and sitting on the counters. We found 'Mr. Ogle busy writing a title bond to be held by us till the deed could be made and sworn to. Almost all the money had been subscribed and Mr. Huff and Mr. Maple had agreed to make up any final deficit. When the terms were finally and satis GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 41 factorily embodied in this preliminary instrument, it was signed and given to Mrs. Helmick. The wave of relaxation that passed through that assemblage was almost audible. Charlie Ogle, the son of Mr. E. E. Ogle, collected all the fire-cracke)rs remaining from the Fourth, and fired them off in front of the store, thus announcing to any few who were not at the store that "them wimmen" were not going back to Sevierville in the hack. All that happened after this seemed to us at the time an anti-climax, but intrinsically it was not. Word was sent to Miss Helen Bryan (New York Beta), who had written from Asheville, North Carolina, asking if she could be of any help, that she could, and trunks were unpacked. Preparations were made for rendering what was now our own ramshackle school house habitable until something better could be had. The men straightened some of the elevations in the floor, put another rock or so in the foundation, closed up a few air spaces, while the women vigorously scrubbed away the ac-cumulations of months. On Monday, August 4, at eight a. m. Miss Langmaid opened the school while Mrs. Helmick assisted the surveyor in his travels over the Pi Beta Phi lands, and I trailed after them. The next day Mrs. Helmick transacted necessary business, kept house, and entertained visitors, while Miss Langmaid and I taught school. There were thirty-three scholars to begin with, ranging from the kindergarten grade to the sixth grade, all that the two of us could possibly take care of in one room. Pending the arrival of Miss Ledbetter or Miss Bryan, this arrangement held. Both Mrs. Helmick and I had already stayed beyond the leave of absence our families had given us, but Miss Langmaid felt, as we did, too,. of course, that we could not go until some one came. But on Saturday, Aug-List 9, Mrs. Helmick felt compelled to leave. Before she left Sevierville, however, on that last Saturday, she saw the deed signed, and it is now in her possession. A copy of it is appended to this report. . Miss Bryan arrived Monday noon, August 11. She went at once into the school, and took charge of the eighteen kindergartners, "primarians" and first graders, while I prepared to go back with the driver that brought her. After our departure Miss Ledbetter arrived. She found, however, that she was not strong enough for the very busy life of the:teachers, 42 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI having been ill this summer. Much to our disappointment, she has been compelled to go home. So now, at this writing, August 22, Miss Bryan, who came to visit, is the only resident besides Miss Lang-maid, resident in charge. Our own building is to be erected just as soon as Mr. Huff can get out the lumber. He will begin doing this when the sap ceases to run; he says in September. Then the lumber is to be put in dry kilns and the seasoning hastened as much as is possible.. Conditions at Gatlinburg are ripe for everything we can possibly do. (Mrs. Helmick will in her report make clear the pressing needs of the school.) If we could but let you look into the crystal of our past three weeks' experience, no plea from the committee would be necessary.

        38 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI County Board might be moved to act according to the public opinion of Gatlinburg. On Saturday morning early, Mr. Huff came to drive Mrs. Helmick to Sevierville for the Board meeting. We had been unable to see the all important Dr. Montgomery. He is a physician for a lumber camp many miles away in the mountains, and comes home only for the week end. He had been expected at home the pre-ceding Friday night, as he would of course have to be at the Board meeting on Saturday. We had gone to the Montgomery home to see him and waited until after dark, but he did not come. We afterwards learned that the native teachers had stopped him on his way home and kept him until we nad left his house. This, you see, was their tribute to the persuasive powers of Mrs. Helmick. We could not see him that night, but Mrs. Helmick was determined to see him early the next morning. However, when she stopped on the way to Sevierville, she found that two of the young men had gone home with him for the night, and all had left before daylight. So her first encounter with our friend, the enemy, was in the Board meeting. I hope you may all hear her tell of that meeting. If there had not been an obligation very binding, the vote would certainly have been in our favor. As it was, the Board gave the public school for the year to Mr. McMahan, but, the President of the Board said, voted that after Christmas, the public school building should be given us for our use, and that another year we should have the whole school situation in our hands. Mrs. Helmick had convinced them that we were in earnest; Dr. Montgomery had intimated that we were not. Now we were face to face with the really important land question. After a very great deal of talking, Mr. Huff said that the men might be able to get us the Steve Whaley tract, worth about $600. But it was not desirable land for our purposes. The men did not think that E. E. Ogle would sell his land, even if the money could be raised. But it seemed to all of us that the Ogle tract was the only one acceptable, and that with proper suasion Mr. Ogle would part with it. They wanted us to try to get the money and also to persuade Mr. Ogle. Tuesday morning, Mrs. Helmick went down to Mr. Ogle's store hoping to influence him to sell his tract for $1200. He refused this, but said that he would sell for $1800. So if the fraternity would put in $600 and the men $1200, the land could no doubt be secured. This GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 39 ultimatum was therefore given on Tuesday morning: if this Ogle land were not secured for us (we contributing $600) by Wednesday noon, we should go elsewhere and establish a school where land would be given us. We now wondered what they would do. They were at last convinced that "those wimmen" meant what they said. We packed our trunks, began to get the household things ready to leave until we should have them sent elsewhere, ordered the hack from Sevierville to come for us the next day, and wondered what the next twenty-four hours would bring forth. Mr. Huff was sent for from his lumber camp eight miles away; every one gave up his business and those that had no business gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for any public affair. They said that there was no one to go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Mr. Huff was drawn forth.

Mrs. Helmick must sometime picture for you the scene at the store. Men were crowding around outside the building, on the steps, in the doors, were standing inside and sitting on the counters. We found 'Mr. Ogle busy writing a title bond to be held by us till the deed could be made and sworn to. Almost all the money had been subscribed and Mr. Huff and Mr. Maple had agreed to make up any final deficit. When the terms were finally and satis GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 41 factorily embodied in this preliminary instrument, it was signed and given to Mrs. Helmick. The wave of relaxation that passed through that assemblage was almost audible. Charlie Ogle, the son of Mr. E. E. Ogle, collected all the fire-cracke)rs remaining from the Fourth, and fired them off in front of the store, thus announcing to any few who were not at the store that "them wimmen" were not going back to Sevierville in the hack. All that happened after this seemed to us at the time an anti-climax, but intrinsically it was not. Word was sent to Miss Helen Bryan (New York Beta), who had written from Asheville, North Carolina, asking if she could be of any help, that she could, and trunks were unpacked. Preparations were made for rendering what was now our own ramshackle school house habitable until something better could be had. The men straightened some of the elevations in the floor, put another rock or so in the foundation, closed up a few air spaces, while the women vigorously scrubbed away the ac-cumulations of months. On Monday, August 4, at eight a. m. Miss Langmaid opened the school while Mrs. Helmick assisted the surveyor in his travels over the Pi Beta Phi lands, and I trailed after them. The next day Mrs. Helmick transacted necessary business, kept house, and entertained visitors, while Miss Langmaid and I taught school. There were thirty-three scholars to begin with, ranging from the kindergarten grade to the sixth grade, all that the two of us could possibly take care of in one room. Pending the arrival of Miss Ledbetter or Miss Bryan, this arrangement held. Both Mrs. Helmick and I had already stayed beyond the leave of absence our families had given us, but Miss Langmaid felt, as we did, too,. of course, that we could not go until some one came. But on Saturday, Aug-List 9, Mrs. Helmick felt compelled to leave. Before she left Sevierville, however, on that last Saturday, she saw the deed signed, and it is now in her possession. A copy of it is appended to this report. . Miss Bryan arrived Monday noon, August 11. She went at once into the school, and took charge of the eighteen kindergartners, "primarians" and first graders, while I prepared to go back with the driver that brought her. After our departure Miss Ledbetter arrived. She found, however, that she was not strong enough for the very busy life of the:teachers, 42 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI having been ill this summer. Much to our disappointment, she has been compelled to go home. So now, at this writing, August 22, Miss Bryan, who came to visit, is the only resident besides Miss Lang-maid, resident in charge. Our own building is to be erected just as soon as Mr. Huff can get out the lumber. He will begin doing this when the sap ceases to run; he says in September. Then the lumber is to be put in dry kilns and the seasoning hastened as much as is possible.. Conditions at Gatlinburg are ripe for everything we can possibly do. (Mrs. Helmick will in her report make clear the pressing needs of the school.) If we could but let you look into the crystal of our past three weeks' experience, no plea from the committee would be necessary.

MILLER [Since much of the recent history of our Settlement School while interesting to us was of too personal a nature to be published in a regular number of THE ARRow, Miss Miller has kindly prepared this intimate account of current history in addition to the formal report of the Chairman and Treasurer of the Settlement School Committee which will be found in the section devoted to reports of committees.-EmToR.] The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee of the Chicago Alum= Club is very happy to announce to the fraternity that a permanent home for the school has been secured. On Monday, July 21, the committee sent Mrs. Helmick and me to Tennessee to make the final adjustment of the land question. March 13, Mrs. Helmick had written to the County Superintendent of Public Schools, Mr. J. R. Keeble, of Sevierville, asking permission to use the new school house the next year. On June 26, she wrote again, telling him of the selection of teachers for the new year and of her determination to secure land when she went down in July. She wrote, saying, in substance, that we were leaving Chicago on July 21, for Gatlinburg, to prepare for the opening of school on August 4. She also wrote to E. E. Ogle, L. Maples, and A. J. Huff of Gatlinburg that we were coming, and that if the school were established permanently in Gatlinburg, the community would need to give the fraternity a tract of land. She further wrote that the E. E. Ogle tract on which the cottage was situated would be acceptable. She had no, response from any of these gentlemen. But knowing the habits of the mountain people, she attached no special significance to their failure to answer letters. We arrived in Sevierville on Tuesday afternoon after a hot journey from Chicago. After supper, Mr. Keeble called upon us at the Snapp House. He told us that our school had been very much the best one that Gatlinburg had ever had, that every one in the community, with one or two exceptions, wanted us to conduct the school in the public school house again this year, and wanted our school to be permanent, but that Dr. Montgomery, the member of the County School Board for the large school district in which Gatlin-burg is situated, was opposed to it. When we had somewhat re-covered from the surprise occasioned by this last statement, we GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 35 sought explanations. That our surprise may be understood, it should be stated that last year we had cooperated with the public school and used the public school building only at the earnest request of Mr. Keeble and with his oral and written promise that the whole school situation in Gatlinburg district would this year be given into our hands. He had promised Mrs. Helmick and me personally that the money used for school purposes there, amounting to $300 more or less, annually, would be given to us. We had acted upon this request and promise. He now said that he was as surprised as we were to learn of Dr. Montgomery's opposition, but that there was nothing he, Mr. Keeble, could do more than he had done in trying to influence the school director. We might perhaps be able to influence him before the next Saturday, when the school board would meet in Sevierville and officially appoint the teachers for the coming year, thus putting the seal upon whatever the various school directors should then recommend. We had heard that Dr. Montgomery's children had been the terror of all previous school teachers, but that the Pi Phi teacher last year had disciplined one of them and that they had then either stayed at home or been tractable. In revenge for Pi Phi's not recognizing the privileges of the children of the arbiter of the school destinies of Civil District 11 of Sevier County, Dr. and Mrs. Montgomery had said that "them wimmen" should not teach their school again. This statement was riveted to a promije to one of the native teachers Mr. Fillmore McMahan, that he should have the school. Mr. Keeble assured us of his support, but said that he had no real power in such cases, that each school director was practically absolute ruler of the school situation in his own district. Then the County Superintendent further disheartened us by saying that though he knew the Gatlinburg families, with the exception noted, were our loyal friends, he did not think that the men would give us land. This latter statement disturbed us more that the other, concerning the opposition of the school. director, for we knew that it was the result of personal pique and political ambition. As the superintendent hinted the women teachers had no vote, and the native men teachers who did were complaining of the "foreign labor" that was taking their jobs. We felt that perhaps such politics might be diplomatically handled, but that if the community refused to give 36 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI us land, we should be compelled at once to seek another field for our work. Mrs. Helmick and the committee, after much correspondence with men and women experienced in such work as ours, and after personal investigation, had come to the conclusion that the community in which the school was located must, for the best interests of both community and fraternity, cooperate with us to the extent of giving land for school purposes. We had left Chicago this time instructed not to return without a deed to land in Gatlinburg or in some other suitable and needy place. The members of the Committee of Ten, who first selected a place for the school, are best fitted to understand the consternation in our hearts when it seemed probable that we should have a similar task to perform. Our calls in Sevierville on the president of the school board, Mr. Rawlings, the former president, Mr. Ballard, also vice-president of the Seiverville Bank, and Mr. Drinnen, former County Superintendent and a prominent lawyer, made us realize that we were again in the land of uncertain information, for they all told us that they knew Dr. Montgomery well, and that they were sure there was no opposition to us whatever. They thought that the director from the eleventh district would not think of "turning down" an eight months' school conducted by competent teachers for a four or five months' school with a native teacher in charge, that he would not dare to do it in the face of the sentiment of the community. With these conflicting statements we left Sevierville for our fate on the Little Pigeon. Mrs. Helmick and I have written of the ride over the rough mountain roads in September and in November. The beauty of the mountains in another season we had eagerly anticipated, but their beauty for us this morning was clouded by something other than the alluring haze which always envelops the ranges of the Great Smoky Mountains. I have made this long preliminary explanation in order that the situation which confronted us may be understood.* The temptation before me in writing this report has been to announce to the fraternity only the results of our final crossing of Pi Phi's Little Pigeon Rubicon. I feel, however, that even though these details may be tiresome, they are essential to a satisfactory understanding GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 37 of the results. And the miracle which happened would not be a miracle to the one who did not know them. It seemed to us like getting home after a long absence when we had forded Little Pigeon for the last time and approached the ford to Roaring Book, at the foot of the school house hill. By those we met we were greeted with impassive cordiality, and, it seemed, latent wonder as to what we would do. Please note the italicized we at this stage of the story. We crossed Roaring Brook and drove on beside the winding Little Pigeon into the heart of Gatlinburg, greeted the people in the scattered houses who came to their doorways to see us, and then turned up Baskin's Creek to Mrs. Andrew Huff's, where we were to have dinner, the invitation having been given by telephone to us in Sevierville. Mrs. Huff's greeting had none of the mountain reserve with which outsiders are met. She was genuinely glad to see us and received us as if we were her "own folks". We learned from her that "everybody" Ts. anted us to have the public school on the hill, and she reiterated Mr. Keeble's praises ,of our school work, and added that her children had learned more under "Miss Dell's" teaching than they had learned during all their previous schooling, that she and "Andy" would not send their children to school at all unless we taught, and that most of the people had said the same thing. After dinner we went up to the hill to the Pi Phi Cottage, and made it as habitable 'as we could for a stay of possibly only a few days. Visitors at once began to arrive and to talk in their hesitant but always friendly fashion. From the moment of our arrival, we were deeply touched by their conviction of their own helplessness in the situation and by their hope that the "winimen", meaning us, could in some way straighten out the tangle. As this day and other days wore away, we had to grip hard our own conviction that the fraternity interests and those of the community, too, demanded our departure if the people could not be roused to give land. All that they would now talk of, however, was our securing control of the public school, or, if we failed in that, our opening an independent school in the ramshackle, abandoned one-room building on the same tract with the cottage, the desired E. E. Ogle tract, which the men said could be "fixed up" at slight expense and used until we could erect our own building. They still hoped, however, that the 38 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI County Board might be moved to act according to the public opinion of Gatlinburg. On Saturday morning early, Mr. Huff came to drive Mrs. Helmick to Sevierville for the Board meeting. We had been unable to see the all important Dr. Montgomery. He is a physician for a lumber camp many miles away in the mountains, and comes home only for the week end. He had been expected at home the pre-ceding Friday night, as he would of course have to be at the Board meeting on Saturday. We had gone to the Montgomery home to see him and waited until after dark, but he did not come. We afterwards learned that the native teachers had stopped him on his way home and kept him until we nad left his house. This, you see, was their tribute to the persuasive powers of Mrs. Helmick. We could not see him that night, but Mrs. Helmick was determined to see him early the next morning. However, when she stopped on the way to Sevierville, she found that two of the young men had gone home with him for the night, and all had left before daylight. So her first encounter with our friend, the enemy, was in the Board meeting. I hope you may all hear her tell of that meeting. If there had not been an obligation very binding, the vote would certainly have been in our favor. As it was, the Board gave the public school for the year to Mr. McMahan, but, the President of the Board said, voted that after Christmas, the public school building should be given us for our use, and that another year we should have the whole school situation in our hands. Mrs. Helmick had convinced them that we were in earnest; Dr. Montgomery had intimated that we were not. Now we were face to face with the really important land question. After a very great deal of talking, Mr. Huff said that the men might be able to get us the Steve Whaley tract, worth about $600. But it was not desirable land for our purposes. The men did not think that E. E. Ogle would sell his land, even if the money could be raised. But it seemed to all of us that the Ogle tract was the only one acceptable, and that with proper suasion Mr. Ogle would part with it. They wanted us to try to get the money and also to persuade Mr. Ogle. Tuesday morning, Mrs. Helmick went down to Mr. Ogle's store hoping to influence him to sell his tract for $1200. He refused this, but said that he would sell for $1800. So if the fraternity would put in $600 and the men $1200, the land could no doubt be secured. This GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 39 ultimatum was therefore given on Tuesday morning: if this Ogle land were not secured for us (we contributing $600) by Wednesday noon, we should go elsewhere and establish a school where land would be given us. We now wondered what they would do. They were at last convinced that "those wimmen" meant what they said. We packed our trunks, began to get the household things ready to leave until we should have them sent elsewhere, ordered the hack from Sevierville to come for us the next day, and wondered what the next twenty-four hours would bring forth. Mr. Huff was sent for from his lumber camp eight miles away; every one gave up his business and those that had no business gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for any public affair. They said that there was no one to go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Mr. Huff was drawn forth. As I think back over the stirring weeks, it seems to me that nothing which came out of them will be of greater good to these men and women than this: the knowledge that they can do things themselves. Tuesday evening we had many callers, three of the women staying until after dark. They said they just couldn't let us go, that they knew the men would try their best, but that perhaps they couldn't raise enough money. For women in the mountains to stay out after dark was a violation of their social code, but they were forgetting even their rigid social customs now. The next morning while we were at breakfast, Mr. Huff and Mr. Whaley came to get us to draw up a subscription paper. Mrs. Helmick wrote the heading for one, putting Pi Beta. Phi down for $600. Mr. Huff put down $250 and Mr. Whaley '$250. Then they started off saying that the hack would not take us back. Later Mrs. Huff came and told us her dream, which must be another story. When she had told it to her husband that morning, she had said, "Andy, you must keep them wimmen here, if it takes everything you've got." "Andy," we found out afterwards, had said that he would give a thousand dollars if that were necessary, but shrewd man that he was, he thought that he would first get others to give as much as they would, and then he would make up the deficit. We 40 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI again sat on our front porch and wondered and watched the excited groups around the store at the foot of the hill. Bulletins were given us from time to time, but as the morning wore on towards noon, and several hundred dollars were still lacking, we, the people and the three of us on the Pi Beta Phi veranda, were all at such a tension that, if some relief did not come immediately, it seemed we should break. Just before noon Mr. E. E. Ogle came up to say that he had decided to sell the tract if the money could be raised. As he had said that he would give as much as any one towards the purchase price, the men were counting on him for $250, though he had not yet put his name down. He was a very staunch friend of the school and had made up his mind that he would rather have the school than his land provided he could get a fair price for the land. His neighbors said that if "Eph" had wanted to sell to any one else, he could have gotten $2000. The mountaineers like to own land, some-thing tangible, that cannot be eaten up or worn out. They under-stand the value of land, but they do not understand the value of money except as it will buy more land ; they are therefore not eager to sell. Furthermore, this particular tract of land had come by original grant, to an ancestor of E. E. Ogle. All this Mr. Ogle had balanced against the school, and the school won. But how can we make clear that even now his shrewdness in a land trade was not in abeyance! He came to us to ask if we would care if he should put a new store building, which he expected to erect soon, on a corner of this tract. When he was asked if he wished to rent or lease the land, his gray eyes twinkled as he said no, he guessed he meant that he would just reserve that when he made the deed. But he respected the business sense of the fraternity's representatives all the more when they refused him. The last stage of the transaction was at hand. The hack from Sevierville now arrived and raised the excitement to a fever heat. Soon after its arrival, word was sent us that we were wanted at the store. Mrs. Helmick must sometime picture for you the scene at the store. Men were crowding around outside the building, on the steps, in the doors, were standing inside and sitting on the counters. We found 'Mr. Ogle busy writing a title bond to be held by us till the deed could be made and sworn to. Almost all the money had been subscribed and Mr. Huff and Mr. Maple had agreed to make up any final deficit. When the terms were finally and satis GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 41 factorily embodied in this preliminary instrument, it was signed and given to Mrs. Helmick. The wave of relaxation that passed through that assemblage was almost audible. Charlie Ogle, the son of Mr. E. E. Ogle, collected all the fire-cracke)rs remaining from the Fourth, and fired them off in front of the store, thus announcing to any few who were not at the store that "them wimmen" were not going back to Sevierville in the hack. All that happened after this seemed to us at the time an anti-climax, but intrinsically it was not. Word was sent to Miss Helen Bryan (New York Beta), who had written from Asheville, North Carolina, asking if she could be of any help, that she could, and trunks were unpacked. Preparations were made for rendering what was now our own ramshackle school house habitable until something better could be had. The men straightened some of the elevations in the floor, put another rock or so in the foundation, closed up a few air spaces, while the women vigorously scrubbed away the ac-cumulations of months. On Monday, August 4, at eight a. m. Miss Langmaid opened the school while Mrs. Helmick assisted the surveyor in his travels over the Pi Beta Phi lands, and I trailed after them. The next day Mrs. Helmick transacted necessary business, kept house, and entertained visitors, while Miss Langmaid and I taught school. There were thirty-three scholars to begin with, ranging from the kindergarten grade to the sixth grade, all that the two of us could possibly take care of in one room. Pending the arrival of Miss Ledbetter or Miss Bryan, this arrangement held. Both Mrs. Helmick and I had already stayed beyond the leave of absence our families had given us, but Miss Langmaid felt, as we did, too,. of course, that we could not go until some one came. But on Saturday, Aug-List 9, Mrs. Helmick felt compelled to leave. Before she left Sevierville, however, on that last Saturday, she saw the deed signed, and it is now in her possession. A copy of it is appended to this report. . Miss Bryan arrived Monday noon, August 11. She went at once into the school, and took charge of the eighteen kindergartners, "primarians" and first graders, while I prepared to go back with the driver that brought her. After our departure Miss Ledbetter arrived. She found, however, that she was not strong enough for the very busy life of the:teachers, 42 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI having been ill this summer. Much to our disappointment, she has been compelled to go home. So now, at this writing, August 22, Miss Bryan, who came to visit, is the only resident besides Miss Lang-maid, resident in charge. Our own building is to be erected just as soon as Mr. Huff can get out the lumber. He will begin doing this when the sap ceases to run; he says in September. Then the lumber is to be put in dry kilns and the seasoning hastened as much as is possible.. Conditions at Gatlinburg are ripe for everything we can possibly do. (Mrs. Helmick will in her report make clear the pressing needs of the school.) If we could but let you look into the crystal of our past three weeks' experience, no plea from the committee would be necessary.
