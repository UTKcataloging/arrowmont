Good health of teachers and pupils has meant full teaching periods in the school, ensuring the maximum of work accomplished for the minimum of effort expended. The older boys and girls have stayed through till the closing of the high school, much to the satisfaction of everyone, even if it meant crowding in the dormitories and dining room. The extension of the agricultural and domestic science classes to new centers in the county has been a source of great pride to the school and to the committee. Both the agriculture and domestic science teachers have willingly put up with great discomforts and difficulties entailed by a winter of deep snow and long continued frost making impassable roads, in order to carry on the weekly classes. The weaving teacher has continued the good work started by her predecessor. The Health Center has had one of its busiest years. The nurse has never spared herself. When a call came from a remote home far from the passable roads she has crone by horseback or on foot to relieve suffering and to save life. 7 Arrowcraft Shop has been cont. ally busy, and a larger public ever acclaiming the beauty and d ability of its products. The Sug lands extension has continued excellent program in school ; community. Day by day, the w of the school .is more and mor part of the life of the commun For the details of the work, I , refer you to the splendid report the Director giving the particul of each department. Those who are watching growth of the school with close terest are most anxious to r what changes in the district an be observed through the entra of the new highway into the cl munity. Crowds of casual and thinking visitors whose appre, tion of the mountaineers and tl heritage is limited to a superfi glance that does not carry bey the attempts to meet the so-ca progress on its own grounds them by with inaccurate comme Already damage has been d through the expression of tl thoughtless impressions in ne paper and magazine. The me taineer himself is the first to sent the insinuations that are unfounded, and those of us know his sterling qualities splendid potentialities are righter ly indignant that such misre The September ARROW :ations should get abroad and a be believed by our own mem-. The mountaineer has much ear from the casual visitor who handicap him with a name ch is far different from actual s. We cannot be too emphatic crying that the integrity of mind body, the honesty of purpose life, the ambition and hard k that characterized the mouneers about Gatlinburg in the are still their outstanding qual This is true of the majority he people. Some there are, as all other communities, whose dards are low, and whose men-Nluipment is poor. These will afluenced by the element whose ing we deplore. The keen d of the average mountaineer, ever, can discern readily be-n true and false. Our school our influence are more needed y than ever before. Illiteracy .isappearing, but standards of ig are changing so quickly for e people now that there is a ket for their products, whether arm or loom, that it will take a e steadying influence to keep young people from placing uninfluence upon the material gs and so neglecting the vital n of life. There are still re-homes lost up the valleys and en on the mountain sides that very little nearer to the varied of the community than they twenty years ago. In them :rty and disease must be met conquered. Their children t receive education. Some pro-)n for daily remunerative work will be an outlet to natural in.-Ltion and talents should be pro-d. A glimpse into a world be-t their limited horizon should be afforded them. These things we can do through our school with its extension classes, its health promotion, and its community service. Throughout the year interesting and outstanding events at the school have made the reading of the Little Pigeon News, the Gatlinburg News, and Miss Evelyn's monthly reports to the clubs graphic in the extreme. The meeting of the province vice presidents with the committee at the school at the end of August was of great pleasure and mutual benefit. This has been reflected through-out the year in the increased interest of the clubs in the school. We were most regretful to lose Emily Burton from the staff of Sugarlands. Her going removed one who had served the school loyally for twelve years, and done pioneer work in both Gatlinburg and Sugarlands. Pi Phi has lost an exceptional teacher, but she has gained a very wonderful member, and we have hopes of her returning to us next year. Tennessee A came in full force to initiate Emily into their chapter before she left, and the initiation service at the Sugarlands cottage will long be re-membered for its beauty and impressiveness. Mattie Huff, one of the school's first pupils, and the daughter of two of our stanchest friends, came on the teaching staff as assistant to the principal. She has more than proved the value of the early work of the school. During the Christmas vacation two of our ex-pupils were married in the living room of the teachers' cottage, and the beautiful wedding caused a great stir among the staff and in the community. They were both working for the school, and continued their duties in the same The September ARROW 31 whole-hearted way. A play put on by the teachers, the regular Christmas entertainment with presents for all the children, the interschool basketball games by both boys' and girls' teams, the school fair in the fall with an attendance of at least 1,500, and Old Timers' Day in the spring, have made considerable social life in the school. Weekly movies through the summer have also added to the entertainment for old and young. These are shown in the auditorium of the Industrial Building. Our influence is not restricted to our own community and county but has spread through the state. Our director and teachers have been active in county teachers' meetings, in the Southern Handicraft Guild, the Women's Institutes, and the Mountain Workers' Conference, and all educational activities that are planning for the betterment of the Southern Highlander. Delegates have been sent and papers read at different conferences, so that our school has a recognized place among the educational institutions and influences of the southern mountains. The county and state recognize our value, and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture, and domestic science and weaving teaching. The financial depression which was nationwide this year has made very little difference in the income of the school. When an institution is dependent upon voluntary contributions, there is almost certainly the chance that during times of financial stringency it will suffer and suffer heavily. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School car I-led on successfully, and even forged ahead during the depressing war period. We are hoping that it will not need to stand still, nor go backward during this time of depression. We feel sure that our loyalty to the philanthropic achievement of which we are justly proud will enable us to sacrifice to the point that it shall not suffer. The school has been handicapped in the past through the slowness with which returns have been made in the fall and winter months. These are the months when the largest payments for living, salaries, insurance, etc., must be made, and we are indeed grateful to those who appreciate this, plan their benefits early, and make prompt returns. The indebtedness entailed through the building of the Indus-trial Building, and the installation of the central heating plant with its fine boilerhouse, weighs heavily on the committee. However the constant use to which it is put for school and community purposes proves without the shadow of a doubt that there is a real need for the building, and we are glad to assume this additional responsibility, feeling sure that the fraternity will uphold us in this justifiable expenditure and loan, and knowing that they will do all in their power to wipe out this debt as promptly as possible. The committee has functioned monthly, and I trust efficiently. The treasurer, Grace Post, began her term of office with the handicap of having missed the annual meeting, but has taken hold of the finances in a most gratifying way, and given largely of time and energy to mastering the details of her job. Blanche Curtis has again The September ARROW d the Little Pigeon News in st acceptable manner, and done necessary secretarial work of ommittee. Rebecca White has a stupendous piece of work ,rds interesting isolated alum-She sent out 965 letters to iso-. alumnae in towns where there more than three and less than Pi Phis, enclosing material would interest and help in .ding the gospel of the Settle-: School. Mrs. White also a letter to all chapters and to alumnae clubs of Gamma, Ep-., Zeta, and Theta provinces, )sing material for programs Settlement School meetings. Lddition many inquiries from Tiduals and clubs for informaregarding the school were fully and fully answered. The eration between Mrs. White the Central Office and the ince vice presidents was very with the result that worth e lists were made. These will f value in the followup work ned for next year. The other Lber of the committee, Helen le, has not yet had the oppor-:y of visiting the school, but entered upon her duties entail-:he work of publicity and manaent of the films and slides, great enthusiasm. She is ning for new information leaf-and sheets for next year, to the needs of the clubs which ask for quantities of brief statements about the school to distribute at benefit bridges, theater nights, etc. There has been very little demand for the films or slides, but such requests have been arranged for. The chairman of the committee appreciates in this her first year of office more deeply than she can express the unselfish service that each member of the committee is rendering. The work would in-deed have been appalling had not the ready response to each call been so willing, and the spirit of cooperation so gracious. To the director of the school she expresses her heartfelt gratitude for the patience which she has shown during her efforts to grasp the various du-ties of her office. To the members of Grand Council and the other officers of the fraternity, and in particular to our Grand President, she wishes to voice the thanks of her-self and her committee, for the careful oversight of the work of the school, and the helpful suggestions that have made the duties lighter. To all members of the fraternity, whose interest . makes possible the continuance of the school, hearty appreciation is given. To the friends of the school, old and new, who have helped in many ways, we are deeply grateful. EDITH H. GORDON The September ARROW Report of Director of the_.Pi Beta Phi Settlement School 33 THE report of the school for the year of 1929-30 is a contradictory one. In some respects it has been one of the easiest and most satisfactory in the history of the school in other ways it has been one of the most difficult. With the building program of the last three years completed a world of worries ceased. The excitement due to the establishment of the National Park has calmed down; the past year, too, was unusually free from epidemics and illnesses and in every way we were able to continue along a steady routine line. But in contrast to these conditions in Gatlinburg the year for the Committee has been one of unusual difficulties. All know that the past year has been a hard one all over the country and the school was bound to feel the financial depression as did everything else. The fall and winter months were very trying ones but our school was no worse off than many, many others. As fast as money did come bills and salaries were paid. After the holidays the contributions began to come in and although the end of the year finds the total a little below that of the previous year we feel that it is remarkably large considering the financial depression. If we have gone through such a trying period this well surely we can hold to our present program through another year. Word comes to us from the Government that some work will be started in the new National Park by July 1; no doubt the first stepswill be for fire protection for the forest fires during the early spring did much damage to the Park land. The Gatlinburg school will be little affected by the Park; many families, however, have moved out of the upper Sugarlands and it is certain that the teachers' cottage there will be purchased by the Park. This will not cause our work to cease for the Park will lease us the property as long as we have use for it in connection with the school. With good roads, modern hotels, and the publicity being given this section the number of tourists is increasing rapidly. The usual time given to Gatlinburg by them is a few hours and it is impossible in that time to more than catch a glimpse of the place, the people and the school.. Many times I feel the highway, the modern aspect of things along the way, and the more prosperous look of the country disillusions the visitors and causes them to leave with some of the romance destroyed and a feeling that our work here is done. But let me assure those who may feel this way that a bit longer visit will cause a change of heart. It is progress that has made the very changes that perhaps you are regretting. There are still many boys and girls, men and women needing what the school gives and surely there is no more reason for us to cease operations now than for the hundreds of other institutions that are accomplishing something to say, "we have done well, there-fore let us stop where we are."

School The more systematic and well organized a thing is the more difficult it is to give an adequate re-port of it. Many pupils have had perfect attendance for the year; scarcely any. problems of discipline have come up, no epidemics have upset the school, and the whole spirit has been of the best. Much credit should be given Mr. Over-ton for this for in the past three years he has been principal of the school it has shown steady development that has been most gratifying. The enrollment stays just about the same. That is to be expected as we cannot take more pupils in the dormitories than we already have and the day school would naturally vary little from year to year. The seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades are in the Industrial Building, as other classes in home economics, agriculture, and farm shop work, and weaving. Mr. Overton and Miss Blair have these four grades and the past year Mat-tie Huff has assisted by taking two classes and a study period. Miss Williams, Miss McCutchan, and Miss Brabson had the first six grades; these are in the old school building and it is much more satisfactory to have the younger pupils in one building and the older ones in another. Of course being less crowded is an-other great advantage. But the primary room it is necessary here The September ARROW 35 to carry the primer class through an entire year so Miss Brabson had primer, first, and second grades and many days half the attendance of the entire school was in her room. With the lower grades so large and the upper ones so small, it is difficult to come to any satisfactory arrangement. The coming year we will take the second grade into the room with the third and put the fourth, fifth, and sixth together. We know this will relieve the primary teacher and we hope will work out all right for the other grades. More time was spent in supervised play and the program worked out by Mr. Overton and Miss Mc-Cutchan net with a ready response from the pupils. The basketball season was a splendid one. Al-though our teams played four year high schools they were able to make a good showing, the interest was keen, and the training the boys and girls had in sportsman-ship was of the finest. Our great trouble in athletics is having to overwork the boys and girls. A hard game Saturday night after a full day's work in the fields or in the woods, or scrubbing floors or washing, is too much physical exertion, especially as we have such small teams it is impossible to do much substituting. A play was given in February by the faculty. The proceeds were used in building an addition to the stage in the auditorium. Because of a play given by the F.F.T. boys late in the term the high school play at close of school was omitted. Eight pupils received certificates for the completion of the second year high school and eight finished the eighth grade. The county reimburses us for the salaries of the grade teachers. So far we have never received any high school money but there is prospect of some for next year. While it may not be more than the tuition we receive from the pupils it will be cash and will come in regularly and will make it much easier on the boys and girls who are working their way through school. Mr. Overton has been president of the Sevier County Teachers' Association for the entire year and has been a great help in planning interesting and helpful meetings each month and in keeping alive interest among the teachers of the county. We regret losing Miss Williams and Mr. Overton from our school and county. No better way of judging the work done in our school can be found than that of watching its pupils after they have left us and gone to other institutions. This past year we have had four in Murphy Institute, three in Sevier County High, one in Townsend High, one in Pittman Center, one in Chilhowee Institute. Without exception these pupils have made good grades and their standing in the school has been of the best. Report of the school would be far from complete this year with-out reference being made to the library. The books were moved from the hall of the old school building to one of the classrooms that had been vacated when the up-per grades moved to the new building. Two large reading tables were put in the room also. Miss McCullough, librarian from Evansville, Indiana, gave this work a fine start during the time she was 36 The September ARROW vacationing here in August and the interest did not lag during the year. Mr. Overton made calls for "Library Day" to which the teachers responded and new books were catalogued and old ones given to other schools or thrown away. Boxes of books, including the hymn books that had been in use for seventeen years, went to five different schools. All during the year books have come in as a result of this campaign and the library is in very good condition. There are about thirty-five hundred volumes of well selected and readable books and they are being used in both Gatlinburg and Sugarlands. Home Economics Mary Rachel Armstrong, a University of Tennessee graduate, has been our new home economics teacher and has given full time to that work. Each morning is taken up with high school home economic classes. The afternoons are given to community work. Each afternoon was spent in a different locality and the means of reaching these places was subject to change, depending on weather and roads. If the Ford or Chevrolet refused to go over Grindstone Mountain, stout boots and a willing spirit carried her the rest of the way. The classes were composed of people from children to middle aged women. In these less formal classes it is always difficult to tell just what is accomplished. Contacts are kept with the country people and that in itself is worth a great deal. The state will again reimburse us for. these classes and we feel that with the cooperation of the state and the interest taken by the local peoplewe should continue the classes if possible. Agriculture and Farm Shop The Smith-Hughes agriculture and farm shop has been carried on more along the lines of a few years ago. Our new teacher, Don Smith, started to work the first of July by getting acquainted with the community and its problems and projects. I am sure that the first two months he decided that he had come as a veterinarian instead of teacher for the calls to see sick horses and cows seemed world without end; perhaps it was as well to see things at their busiest and worst right at the start. The work in agriculture corresponds to that in home economics in that the mornings are spent in school and the afternoons in different communities. There have been classes in five different places, the territory extending from Banner, three miles away to wear's Valley eighteen miles distant. Like Miss Armstrong, Mr. Smith has let weather decide his means of transportation for roads have been bad much of the time. With each Gatlinburg agriculture boy carrying a home project that must be supervised and all these boys in other communities to look after one can readily see the pro-gram day by day is a full one and not easily kept up with. The F.F.T. took on new life and in the early spring the boys put on a play. The object of this was to raise enough money to send two delegates to the state convention at Nashville and Pi Phi was represented there by two young Future Farmers. The shop work is of a practical The September ARROW kind from fly traps to farm gates and from birdhouses to porch swings. While we try hard not to let. the repair or farm work take too much of the agriculture teacher's time the stock we have on the place and the repairing of gates, etc., furnish many a practical lesson for the school boys. Last year we added to our list of stock a few sheep and this year the new project will be bees. Dormitories The outstanding work of the school, according to many, is that done in connection with the boys and girls in the dormitories. Each year we have from twenty to twenty-five boys and girls living here who are ready for either eighth grade or high school but who live too far from any school giving those grades to make walking possible. There has to be a careful selection as we have many more applications than we have places. We do not plan to take pupils who could go to other places and pay board or who live near any other school. Only those willing and needing to work are considered. The past year we rented for the boys' dormitory a small cottage near the school. It was really too small for the family that had occupied it, six children and the mother and father, but into the same house we put one teacher, the housemother, and from ten to thirteen boys. Only two rooms had heat so during the winter all had to collect into these two small rooms for study hours and for all time they were in the house and awake. It was not a very satisfactory arrangement but the bestwe could do and the way we continue next year. The girls' cottage is qtlite fortable except for the room. This is badly overcrc as forty-five of us take our in this house. The past yet were compelled to use the room for dining room. No room in a house or a dorn makes the situation far from and we are planning our b( provide one for another yeas I have told so many, many the kind of work the boys and do I know you can picture The thing impossible to pictul less one has been here is the life they lead and the joy th( out of having their "leisure" that usually is such a proble: taken up.

Too much credit cannot be given her for the careful planning she has done this year to keep our expenditures as low as possible and make every penny count. Sevier County Health Unit The Sevier County Health Unit has been a wide-awake organization this past year and we are glad to be a part of it. The unit consists of a county health physician, a sanitary officer, an office clerk, a county nurse, the nurse at Pittman Center, a school eighteen miles from Sevierville and ours at Gatlinburg. Our connection with the unit continues to be rather puzzling to many. It really means that Pitt-man and our school, with the county court, pool a certain amount so that that sum can be matched by state and federal funds. The amount we put in is equal to that we would pay our nurse. We send our check to the state department and they pay the nurse. It may sound complicated but it is not and this cooperation means a unit for the county that would be impossible otherwise. In addition to the help given in school examinations and numerous other places the county health physician sees that we are supplied with vaccines and many other sup-plies free of charge, including health pamphlets and literature. The state also pays for the upkeep and depreciation of the nurse's car, saving us an expense that would be quite an item. Health Frances Moore has had a tremendously busy year. She has carried out an extensive and thorough school program that has touched The September ARROW 39 practically every school in the eleventh district. Children were weighed and measured, and in most cases the county health physician gave a physical examination. A good many defects were corrected and the cooperation given by some of the county teachers was a joy. Classes in home hygiene and care of the sick were carried in connection with the home economics classes in Gatlinburg and Sugar-lands. Two classes for "little mothers" were held in Gatlinburg, one in Sugarlands and a mothers' class in Elkmont. Immunization clinics for typhoid, smallpox and dyptheria were held all over the district, more than 700 innoculations being completed. And babies this has. been a baby year: 162 visits made to mothers, 197 letters distributed, and 193 visits made to preschool children. Two tonsil clinics were held during the year. Several patients were in the hospital for from a day or two to four or five weeks, as a result of automobile accidents. The same dentist from Knoxville comes one Saturday each month. Numerous trips are made to Knoxville to take patients in for examinations and treatment. While there is much done in school and in groups there are many, many sick calls that must be answered and this past winter and spring have brought an unusual number of distressing cases. Whether the long, severe winter, the scarcity of work, or just more familiarity with the country brought these to our attention is more than I can say but the fact remains that day after day brought almost more than the nurse could stand. It is our policy to give lit-tle in the line of food or clothing but to try to help people to help themselves. The policy is right, we are sure, but it would take harder hearts than ours to see some of these conditions and then be able to enjoy thoroughly our good foods and warm beds. We were glad when warm weather and gardens came. The amount of work done in connection with the Health Center would be an impossibility without the valuable assistance of Lillie Reagan. She has been in the office long enough to be well acquainted with the work and that with her faithfulness makes her a most valuable assistant. Weaving Weaving teachers are scarce and when Miss Redding left us a year ago we feared we might have a long search for someone to take her place. We were fortunate though for just as I was leaving Oregon last summer after convention I heard of Miss Strand. She came to us in October and came with a thorough knowledge of weaving and also with a real love of the mountains and its people. The work of the department continued much as it had under Miss Redding. The seventh and eighth grade girls had a double period class each morning; the morning was also used for office work, the women calling for sup-plies and advice. Usually the afternoons were given over to the necessary trips to the various homes and these were many. All the Arroweraft things are made in the homes and must be carefully supervised. As most of these trips are made on foot one needs to be The September ARROW pretty good hiker and not easily Iffed by weather. Once each month there has been meeting of the weavers and this both educational and social with 2. emphasis on the social. The )men take turns bringing and wing refreshments usually there e between twenty-five and thirty-'e present not including the bies. Alice McCarter has been the astant, helping Miss Strand when eded and weaving in the Arrow-aft Shop the remainder of the ne. Again the state has given sub-1ntial aid for this work. It comes rough the Smith-Hughes Voca-)nal Department and will amount is year to about $600. Arrowcraft Shop Miss Allen still in charge of the rrowcraft Shop, Veatress Parton id Alice McCarter able assistants, .izabeth Cooke in the office look-g after every penny that comes id goes and, last but not least, e splendid cooperation the clubs id chapters give, make a corn-nation that is bound to do busiss. The report of the Arrowcraft is year shows a business around 3,000 and we are proud to say at it has been carried on at a Zall profit. The aim of this deatment is primarily to provide Drk for people in this community at the same time training them make better and more beautiful ings. To carry the educational rd the business parts of this deirtment and come out even fiincially is really doing well. All is could never be accomplished ithout the wonderful support given by the Pi Phis all over the United States. No other school that I know of has this splendid market and I know no other could bring the personal contacts that means so much to those here who carry on the work. More than a hundred families are either self supporting or partially so because of the shop, the work they do is of a high grade and what all this means to them is evidenced in the better homes and general living conditions in so many places. Like the nurse the ones in this department come in close touch with the people and their pleasures and problems thus the influence and accomplishments are far more than can be seen in dollars and cents. It is surprising but true that in spite of hard times everywhere the Arrowcraft sales have held up and payments have been more prompt than in other years. This has meant much more than you can realize. All the year, as the checks came in, the money was immediately turned over to the people who were working so faithfully, and but for those checks, we could not have paid these people. The winter was unusually severe and other work scarce so I hardly know what the people would have done without their checks for weaving, baskets, and furniture. Already many of the club orders for next fall are in and by the first of August many orders will be shipped. This is a much more satisfactory way both for the clubs and the shop as Christmas time the stock is low and mails are slow. I do not need to add in closing that all visitors find their way to The September ARROW 41 the Arrowcraft Shop or that I do ers do in the homes, all is part of my best to keep that place until the work of the Center. There is the last knowing that if they once never a time if you are in Sugar-get there they won't see anything lands that you are not on duty or else on the place. subject to call but there is a de-light in coming close to the life of the community and a charm in having your own little family. In fact, since the Gatlinburg family has grown to such proportions we could not get along at all without .the Sugarlands home to slip off to every now and then. Mrs. Dowell is still housemother but the good meals she prepares for the two teachers are only part of her many duties. She helps with community activities and is always at home" to the many callers who drop in day after day for advice or for friendly chat. Eva Hathaway is principal and is successfully teaching the four upper grades. This year three of her pupils completed the eighth grade and will come to Gatlinburg for their first year high school work. Although it is only five miles away, we want them to stay in the dormitory for the training and experience they will receive. Emily Burton, our "veteran" primary teacher, had to leave us in November because of the serious illness and death of her father ; her place was taken by Lois Brewer, a Knoxville girl. Mary Rachel Armstrong had classes in home economics during the year. Frances Moore had clinics at the cottage and also supplemented Mary Rachel's course with the girls by giving practical lessons in home hygiene and care of the sick. Nothing has appealed to the boys more than the shop work Eva has given them. A few tools and some old planks that looked to me good for nothing were Wood Working Shop Even though Mr. Mattil has ceased to be on the pay roll he is still a valuable member of the staff. This year the wood working shop has been almost as popular a 'place with visitors as the Craft Shop. The clubs well know the crickets, sconces, bookshelves, and book ends that are made here but not all have seen the cherry and black walnut furniture that is being made. The training given the men who work in the shop is most valuable and the school appreciates Mr. Mattil carrying this. Many feel it should be a part of the school and it really is in almost every way but financially. With Mr. Mattil's interest in the school and the years he has been here it is no wonder we still call on him for all kinds of extras and he always gladly gives his time, as in former years. Emma Harper Turner Center Sugarlands Extension work has a real appeal, as any one of the special teachers or those in the Sugarlands will tell you. The Sugarlands family is a happy, congenial, and efficient one. School work must be the important part of the program but it is not all. The Sunday School that meets in the schoolhouse, the women who come to the cottage for their rug work, sewing, or just friendly calls, the visiting the teach42 The September ARROW the only equipment but things were made regardless. Later in the year through two Pi Phis who were interested in the school, more tools were gotten and darkness came many a night before the boys were ready to leave the little shop in the schoolhouse. During the summer the school girls have continued to have Sun-day School never failing to feel the sweeping of the schoolhouse after the meeting to be as important as the benediction. Even though the property will eventually be turned over to the Park our work will continue as long as there is need for it; and with the return of Mrs. Dowell, Eva, and Emily our Center will continue to develop. One of the happiest events of last year was the initiation of Emily Burton into Pi Beta Phi. Emily was called home early in November and the night before she left fourteen Tennessee A girls came to Gatlinburg from Chattanooga to take her into -their chap-ter. It was all so sudden, so thrilling and so wonderfully fitting for the twelve years Emily has been here have endeared her to all and the Arrow surely is being worn close to a loyal little Pi Phi heart. Pi Beta , Phi School is actively interested in the organization and development of a Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. In December, 1929, a meeting was held at the Spinning Wheel, Asheville, North Carolina, at which definite steps were taken toward the formation of the Guild, standards for membership, etc. Plans were also laid for an exhibit at the South-ern Mountain Conference the following March. The exhibits from more than thirty centers were proofof the varied and high grade handicraft work being done in the South-ern Mountains. There has been practically no visiting of other schools during the year by any members of the staff. This has been decidedly a "stay-at-home" year but we have tried to keep in touch with the larger program through attending the annual Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, through the Guild meeting in Asheville in December, and by the visitors from other centers who have come to us During the year many requests have come to us for more publicity material to be used by clubs and chapters and this need we should meet this summer. In the fall a set of kodak pictures was sent each council and committee member and each province president and vice president; these were easy to carry and seemed to meet with good response. The slides and films have been used but little during the year. The Gatlinburg News has been sent to about four hundred Pi Phis and perhaps two hundred local people. Letters from the school have been sent to Settlement School Chairman, national officers, and Pi Phis on the Gatlinburg News mailing list. Last summer a new septic tank was installed for the girls' dormitory and Stuart cottage, the heating and plumbing system in the girls' dormitory was reworked, and the teachers' cottage painted. This summer it is necessary to paint the grade school building, the barn, and freshen up some of the interiors. A new storeroom for groceries and for wood and coal must be built as well as a wacron The September ARROW and toolhouse. During the spring more native shrubbery was set out around the Sugarland's cottage and the Gatlinburg buildings; we have tried to improve the premises and have been rewarded by being told that we do have more of an air of refinement. There are a number of acres of woodland on our place and since the windstorm of a year ago and the chestnut blight that has been working for several years we find we have much dead timber. This should be gotten out while it is still good for lumber and we plan to have it logged and sawed this fall. Enough can be sold to pay this billbut we would not be wise to le all go. Seasoned lumber is alw needed about the place and thb the last chestnut that we will e have. In closing this, my twelfth nual report, I want to again expl my sincere appreciation for loyal support that is always gi' by the fraternity. The work in C linburg is a joy and one that is o excelled by your personal inter and cooperation in everything. EVELYN BISHG (NoTE: Report of Treasurer Settlement School will be fol following Alumnae Club report: EDITOR) Minutes of Annual Meeting of Grand Council July 8 16 1930 THE annual meeting of the Grand Council was held at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, July 8-16, dates which were chosen partly because the Settlement School Committee was also in session, thus making it possible to fulfill the constitutional requirement that a member of the Council, in this instance the Grand President, shall meet with the committee during part of each annual committee meeting. The Council greatly missed the Grand Treasurer who was excused because of an European trip. The reports from the chairmen of the standing committees were first read and studied, and from them the various recommendations were acted upon, and certain cies formulated. With regard to extension for the coming year, the chairman of the Extension Committee was in-structed to impart the following Lion to the groups concerned: a member of Grand Council s: be sent, the coming year, to ins] Alpha Upsilon of the Universitl Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, C ada; that Beta Theta of Mari College, Marietta, Ohio, shall definitely discouraged because location; that Ero Alphian Michigan State College, East I. sing, Michigan, shall receive official visitor in the fall and the ture progress of the group in titioning Pi Beta Phi shall be termined by this visit; that remaining official visits shall made to Gamma Sigma of the I versify of South Carolina, Col bia, and that Grand Council s act further on the basis of the ports of all visiting officers; t following the receipt of a 1( from the group during the Cot meeting, Mu Lambda of Duke 1 118 The September ARROW Wport of Treasurer o Settlement School REPORT =.A"= CRAFT SIIOP July 1, 1929 to June 30, 1930 Income Baskets Sales m 1,971.70 Miscellaneous and Brooms Sales 1,344.70 Chairs Sales ....'

        The September ARROW :ations should get abroad and a be believed by our own mem-. The mountaineer has much ear from the casual visitor who handicap him with a name ch is far different from actual s. We cannot be too emphatic crying that the integrity of mind body, the honesty of purpose life, the ambition and hard k that characterized the mouneers about Gatlinburg in the are still their outstanding qual This is true of the majority he people. Some there are, as all other communities, whose dards are low, and whose men-Nluipment is poor. These will afluenced by the element whose ing we deplore. The keen d of the average mountaineer, ever, can discern readily be-n true and false. Our school our influence are more needed y than ever before. Illiteracy .isappearing, but standards of ig are changing so quickly for e people now that there is a ket for their products, whether arm or loom, that it will take a e steadying influence to keep young people from placing uninfluence upon the material gs and so neglecting the vital n of life. There are still re-homes lost up the valleys and en on the mountain sides that very little nearer to the varied of the community than they twenty years ago. In them :rty and disease must be met conquered. Their children t receive education. Some pro-)n for daily remunerative work will be an outlet to natural in.-Ltion and talents should be pro-d. A glimpse into a world be-t their limited horizon should be afforded them. These things we can do through our school with its extension classes, its health promotion, and its community service. Throughout the year interesting and outstanding events at the school have made the reading of the Little Pigeon News, the Gatlinburg News, and Miss Evelyn's monthly reports to the clubs graphic in the extreme. The meeting of the province vice presidents with the committee at the school at the end of August was of great pleasure and mutual benefit. This has been reflected through-out the year in the increased interest of the clubs in the school. We were most regretful to lose Emily Burton from the staff of Sugarlands. Her going removed one who had served the school loyally for twelve years, and done pioneer work in both Gatlinburg and Sugarlands. Pi Phi has lost an exceptional teacher, but she has gained a very wonderful member, and we have hopes of her returning to us next year. Tennessee A came in full force to initiate Emily into their chapter before she left, and the initiation service at the Sugarlands cottage will long be re-membered for its beauty and impressiveness. Mattie Huff, one of the school's first pupils, and the daughter of two of our stanchest friends, came on the teaching staff as assistant to the principal. She has more than proved the value of the early work of the school. During the Christmas vacation two of our ex-pupils were married in the living room of the teachers' cottage, and the beautiful wedding caused a great stir among the staff and in the community. They were both working for the school, and continued their duties in the same The September ARROW 31 whole-hearted way. A play put on by the teachers, the regular Christmas entertainment with presents for all the children, the interschool basketball games by both boys' and girls' teams, the school fair in the fall with an attendance of at least 1,500, and Old Timers' Day in the spring, have made considerable social life in the school. Weekly movies through the summer have also added to the entertainment for old and young. These are shown in the auditorium of the Industrial Building. Our influence is not restricted to our own community and county but has spread through the state. Our director and teachers have been active in county teachers' meetings, in the Southern Handicraft Guild, the Women's Institutes, and the Mountain Workers' Conference, and all educational activities that are planning for the betterment of the Southern Highlander. Delegates have been sent and papers read at different conferences, so that our school has a recognized place among the educational institutions and influences of the southern mountains. The county and state recognize our value, and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture, and domestic science and weaving teaching. The financial depression which was nationwide this year has made very little difference in the income of the school. When an institution is dependent upon voluntary contributions, there is almost certainly the chance that during times of financial stringency it will suffer and suffer heavily. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School car I-led on successfully, and even forged ahead during the depressing war period. We are hoping that it will not need to stand still, nor go backward during this time of depression. We feel sure that our loyalty to the philanthropic achievement of which we are justly proud will enable us to sacrifice to the point that it shall not suffer. The school has been handicapped in the past through the slowness with which returns have been made in the fall and winter months. These are the months when the largest payments for living, salaries, insurance, etc., must be made, and we are indeed grateful to those who appreciate this, plan their benefits early, and make prompt returns. The indebtedness entailed through the building of the Indus-trial Building, and the installation of the central heating plant with its fine boilerhouse, weighs heavily on the committee. However the constant use to which it is put for school and community purposes proves without the shadow of a doubt that there is a real need for the building, and we are glad to assume this additional responsibility, feeling sure that the fraternity will uphold us in this justifiable expenditure and loan, and knowing that they will do all in their power to wipe out this debt as promptly as possible. The committee has functioned monthly, and I trust efficiently. The treasurer, Grace Post, began her term of office with the handicap of having missed the annual meeting, but has taken hold of the finances in a most gratifying way, and given largely of time and energy to mastering the details of her job. Blanche Curtis has again The September ARROW d the Little Pigeon News in st acceptable manner, and done necessary secretarial work of ommittee. Rebecca White has a stupendous piece of work ,rds interesting isolated alum-She sent out 965 letters to iso-. alumnae in towns where there more than three and less than Pi Phis, enclosing material would interest and help in .ding the gospel of the Settle-: School. Mrs. White also a letter to all chapters and to alumnae clubs of Gamma, Ep-., Zeta, and Theta provinces, )sing material for programs Settlement School meetings. Lddition many inquiries from Tiduals and clubs for informaregarding the school were fully and fully answered. The eration between Mrs. White the Central Office and the ince vice presidents was very with the result that worth e lists were made. These will f value in the followup work ned for next year. The other Lber of the committee, Helen le, has not yet had the oppor-:y of visiting the school, but entered upon her duties entail-:he work of publicity and manaent of the films and slides, great enthusiasm. She is ning for new information leaf-and sheets for next year, to the needs of the clubs which ask for quantities of brief statements about the school to distribute at benefit bridges, theater nights, etc. There has been very little demand for the films or slides, but such requests have been arranged for. The chairman of the committee appreciates in this her first year of office more deeply than she can express the unselfish service that each member of the committee is rendering. The work would in-deed have been appalling had not the ready response to each call been so willing, and the spirit of cooperation so gracious. To the director of the school she expresses her heartfelt gratitude for the patience which she has shown during her efforts to grasp the various du-ties of her office. To the members of Grand Council and the other officers of the fraternity, and in particular to our Grand President, she wishes to voice the thanks of her-self and her committee, for the careful oversight of the work of the school, and the helpful suggestions that have made the duties lighter. To all members of the fraternity, whose interest . makes possible the continuance of the school, hearty appreciation is given. To the friends of the school, old and new, who have helped in many ways, we are deeply grateful. EDITH H. GORDON The September ARROW Report of Director of the_.Pi Beta Phi Settlement School 33 THE report of the school for the year of 1929-30 is a contradictory one. In some respects it has been one of the easiest and most satisfactory in the history of the school in other ways it has been one of the most difficult. With the building program of the last three years completed a world of worries ceased. The excitement due to the establishment of the National Park has calmed down; the past year, too, was unusually free from epidemics and illnesses and in every way we were able to continue along a steady routine line. But in contrast to these conditions in Gatlinburg the year for the Committee has been one of unusual difficulties. All know that the past year has been a hard one all over the country and the school was bound to feel the financial depression as did everything else. The fall and winter months were very trying ones but our school was no worse off than many, many others. As fast as money did come bills and salaries were paid. After the holidays the contributions began to come in and although the end of the year finds the total a little below that of the previous year we feel that it is remarkably large considering the financial depression. If we have gone through such a trying period this well surely we can hold to our present program through another year. Word comes to us from the Government that some work will be started in the new National Park by July 1; no doubt the first stepswill be for fire protection for the forest fires during the early spring did much damage to the Park land. The Gatlinburg school will be little affected by the Park; many families, however, have moved out of the upper Sugarlands and it is certain that the teachers' cottage there will be purchased by the Park. This will not cause our work to cease for the Park will lease us the property as long as we have use for it in connection with the school. With good roads, modern hotels, and the publicity being given this section the number of tourists is increasing rapidly. The usual time given to Gatlinburg by them is a few hours and it is impossible in that time to more than catch a glimpse of the place, the people and the school.. Many times I feel the highway, the modern aspect of things along the way, and the more prosperous look of the country disillusions the visitors and causes them to leave with some of the romance destroyed and a feeling that our work here is done. But let me assure those who may feel this way that a bit longer visit will cause a change of heart. It is progress that has made the very changes that perhaps you are regretting. There are still many boys and girls, men and women needing what the school gives and surely there is no more reason for us to cease operations now than for the hundreds of other institutions that are accomplishing something to say, "we have done well, there-fore let us stop where we are."

School The more systematic and well organized a thing is the more difficult it is to give an adequate re-port of it. Many pupils have had perfect attendance for the year; scarcely any. problems of discipline have come up, no epidemics have upset the school, and the whole spirit has been of the best. Much credit should be given Mr. Over-ton for this for in the past three years he has been principal of the school it has shown steady development that has been most gratifying. The enrollment stays just about the same. That is to be expected as we cannot take more pupils in the dormitories than we already have and the day school would naturally vary little from year to year. The seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades are in the Industrial Building, as other classes in home economics, agriculture, and farm shop work, and weaving. Mr. Overton and Miss Blair have these four grades and the past year Mat-tie Huff has assisted by taking two classes and a study period. Miss Williams, Miss McCutchan, and Miss Brabson had the first six grades; these are in the old school building and it is much more satisfactory to have the younger pupils in one building and the older ones in another. Of course being less crowded is an-other great advantage. But the primary room it is necessary here The September ARROW 35 to carry the primer class through an entire year so Miss Brabson had primer, first, and second grades and many days half the attendance of the entire school was in her room. With the lower grades so large and the upper ones so small, it is difficult to come to any satisfactory arrangement. The coming year we will take the second grade into the room with the third and put the fourth, fifth, and sixth together. We know this will relieve the primary teacher and we hope will work out all right for the other grades. More time was spent in supervised play and the program worked out by Mr. Overton and Miss Mc-Cutchan net with a ready response from the pupils. The basketball season was a splendid one. Al-though our teams played four year high schools they were able to make a good showing, the interest was keen, and the training the boys and girls had in sportsman-ship was of the finest. Our great trouble in athletics is having to overwork the boys and girls. A hard game Saturday night after a full day's work in the fields or in the woods, or scrubbing floors or washing, is too much physical exertion, especially as we have such small teams it is impossible to do much substituting. A play was given in February by the faculty. The proceeds were used in building an addition to the stage in the auditorium. Because of a play given by the F.F.T. boys late in the term the high school play at close of school was omitted. Eight pupils received certificates for the completion of the second year high school and eight finished the eighth grade. The county reimburses us for the salaries of the grade teachers. So far we have never received any high school money but there is prospect of some for next year. While it may not be more than the tuition we receive from the pupils it will be cash and will come in regularly and will make it much easier on the boys and girls who are working their way through school. Mr. Overton has been president of the Sevier County Teachers' Association for the entire year and has been a great help in planning interesting and helpful meetings each month and in keeping alive interest among the teachers of the county. We regret losing Miss Williams and Mr. Overton from our school and county. No better way of judging the work done in our school can be found than that of watching its pupils after they have left us and gone to other institutions. This past year we have had four in Murphy Institute, three in Sevier County High, one in Townsend High, one in Pittman Center, one in Chilhowee Institute. Without exception these pupils have made good grades and their standing in the school has been of the best. Report of the school would be far from complete this year with-out reference being made to the library. The books were moved from the hall of the old school building to one of the classrooms that had been vacated when the up-per grades moved to the new building. Two large reading tables were put in the room also. Miss McCullough, librarian from Evansville, Indiana, gave this work a fine start during the time she was 36 The September ARROW vacationing here in August and the interest did not lag during the year. Mr. Overton made calls for "Library Day" to which the teachers responded and new books were catalogued and old ones given to other schools or thrown away. Boxes of books, including the hymn books that had been in use for seventeen years, went to five different schools. All during the year books have come in as a result of this campaign and the library is in very good condition. There are about thirty-five hundred volumes of well selected and readable books and they are being used in both Gatlinburg and Sugarlands. Home Economics Mary Rachel Armstrong, a University of Tennessee graduate, has been our new home economics teacher and has given full time to that work. Each morning is taken up with high school home economic classes. The afternoons are given to community work. Each afternoon was spent in a different locality and the means of reaching these places was subject to change, depending on weather and roads. If the Ford or Chevrolet refused to go over Grindstone Mountain, stout boots and a willing spirit carried her the rest of the way. The classes were composed of people from children to middle aged women. In these less formal classes it is always difficult to tell just what is accomplished. Contacts are kept with the country people and that in itself is worth a great deal. The state will again reimburse us for. these classes and we feel that with the cooperation of the state and the interest taken by the local peoplewe should continue the classes if possible. Agriculture and Farm Shop The Smith-Hughes agriculture and farm shop has been carried on more along the lines of a few years ago. Our new teacher, Don Smith, started to work the first of July by getting acquainted with the community and its problems and projects. I am sure that the first two months he decided that he had come as a veterinarian instead of teacher for the calls to see sick horses and cows seemed world without end; perhaps it was as well to see things at their busiest and worst right at the start. The work in agriculture corresponds to that in home economics in that the mornings are spent in school and the afternoons in different communities. There have been classes in five different places, the territory extending from Banner, three miles away to wear's Valley eighteen miles distant. Like Miss Armstrong, Mr. Smith has let weather decide his means of transportation for roads have been bad much of the time. With each Gatlinburg agriculture boy carrying a home project that must be supervised and all these boys in other communities to look after one can readily see the pro-gram day by day is a full one and not easily kept up with. The F.F.T. took on new life and in the early spring the boys put on a play. The object of this was to raise enough money to send two delegates to the state convention at Nashville and Pi Phi was represented there by two young Future Farmers. The shop work is of a practical The September ARROW kind from fly traps to farm gates and from birdhouses to porch swings. While we try hard not to let. the repair or farm work take too much of the agriculture teacher's time the stock we have on the place and the repairing of gates, etc., furnish many a practical lesson for the school boys. Last year we added to our list of stock a few sheep and this year the new project will be bees. Dormitories The outstanding work of the school, according to many, is that done in connection with the boys and girls in the dormitories. Each year we have from twenty to twenty-five boys and girls living here who are ready for either eighth grade or high school but who live too far from any school giving those grades to make walking possible. There has to be a careful selection as we have many more applications than we have places. We do not plan to take pupils who could go to other places and pay board or who live near any other school. Only those willing and needing to work are considered. The past year we rented for the boys' dormitory a small cottage near the school. It was really too small for the family that had occupied it, six children and the mother and father, but into the same house we put one teacher, the housemother, and from ten to thirteen boys. Only two rooms had heat so during the winter all had to collect into these two small rooms for study hours and for all time they were in the house and awake. It was not a very satisfactory arrangement but the bestwe could do and the way we continue next year. The girls' cottage is qtlite fortable except for the room. This is badly overcrc as forty-five of us take our in this house. The past yet were compelled to use the room for dining room. No room in a house or a dorn makes the situation far from and we are planning our b( provide one for another yeas I have told so many, many the kind of work the boys and do I know you can picture The thing impossible to pictul less one has been here is the life they lead and the joy th( out of having their "leisure" that usually is such a proble: taken up.

Too much credit cannot be given her for the careful planning she has done this year to keep our expenditures as low as possible and make every penny count. Sevier County Health Unit The Sevier County Health Unit has been a wide-awake organization this past year and we are glad to be a part of it. The unit consists of a county health physician, a sanitary officer, an office clerk, a county nurse, the nurse at Pittman Center, a school eighteen miles from Sevierville and ours at Gatlinburg. Our connection with the unit continues to be rather puzzling to many. It really means that Pitt-man and our school, with the county court, pool a certain amount so that that sum can be matched by state and federal funds. The amount we put in is equal to that we would pay our nurse. We send our check to the state department and they pay the nurse. It may sound complicated but it is not and this cooperation means a unit for the county that would be impossible otherwise. In addition to the help given in school examinations and numerous other places the county health physician sees that we are supplied with vaccines and many other sup-plies free of charge, including health pamphlets and literature. The state also pays for the upkeep and depreciation of the nurse's car, saving us an expense that would be quite an item. Health Frances Moore has had a tremendously busy year. She has carried out an extensive and thorough school program that has touched The September ARROW 39 practically every school in the eleventh district. Children were weighed and measured, and in most cases the county health physician gave a physical examination. A good many defects were corrected and the cooperation given by some of the county teachers was a joy. Classes in home hygiene and care of the sick were carried in connection with the home economics classes in Gatlinburg and Sugar-lands. Two classes for "little mothers" were held in Gatlinburg, one in Sugarlands and a mothers' class in Elkmont. Immunization clinics for typhoid, smallpox and dyptheria were held all over the district, more than 700 innoculations being completed. And babies this has. been a baby year: 162 visits made to mothers, 197 letters distributed, and 193 visits made to preschool children. Two tonsil clinics were held during the year. Several patients were in the hospital for from a day or two to four or five weeks, as a result of automobile accidents. The same dentist from Knoxville comes one Saturday each month. Numerous trips are made to Knoxville to take patients in for examinations and treatment. While there is much done in school and in groups there are many, many sick calls that must be answered and this past winter and spring have brought an unusual number of distressing cases. Whether the long, severe winter, the scarcity of work, or just more familiarity with the country brought these to our attention is more than I can say but the fact remains that day after day brought almost more than the nurse could stand. It is our policy to give lit-tle in the line of food or clothing but to try to help people to help themselves. The policy is right, we are sure, but it would take harder hearts than ours to see some of these conditions and then be able to enjoy thoroughly our good foods and warm beds. We were glad when warm weather and gardens came. The amount of work done in connection with the Health Center would be an impossibility without the valuable assistance of Lillie Reagan. She has been in the office long enough to be well acquainted with the work and that with her faithfulness makes her a most valuable assistant. Weaving Weaving teachers are scarce and when Miss Redding left us a year ago we feared we might have a long search for someone to take her place. We were fortunate though for just as I was leaving Oregon last summer after convention I heard of Miss Strand. She came to us in October and came with a thorough knowledge of weaving and also with a real love of the mountains and its people. The work of the department continued much as it had under Miss Redding. The seventh and eighth grade girls had a double period class each morning; the morning was also used for office work, the women calling for sup-plies and advice. Usually the afternoons were given over to the necessary trips to the various homes and these were many. All the Arroweraft things are made in the homes and must be carefully supervised. As most of these trips are made on foot one needs to be The September ARROW pretty good hiker and not easily Iffed by weather. Once each month there has been meeting of the weavers and this both educational and social with 2. emphasis on the social. The )men take turns bringing and wing refreshments usually there e between twenty-five and thirty-'e present not including the bies. Alice McCarter has been the astant, helping Miss Strand when eded and weaving in the Arrow-aft Shop the remainder of the ne. Again the state has given sub-1ntial aid for this work. It comes rough the Smith-Hughes Voca-)nal Department and will amount is year to about $600. Arrowcraft Shop Miss Allen still in charge of the rrowcraft Shop, Veatress Parton id Alice McCarter able assistants, .izabeth Cooke in the office look-g after every penny that comes id goes and, last but not least, e splendid cooperation the clubs id chapters give, make a corn-nation that is bound to do busiss. The report of the Arrowcraft is year shows a business around 3,000 and we are proud to say at it has been carried on at a Zall profit. The aim of this deatment is primarily to provide Drk for people in this community at the same time training them make better and more beautiful ings. To carry the educational rd the business parts of this deirtment and come out even fiincially is really doing well. All is could never be accomplished ithout the wonderful support given by the Pi Phis all over the United States. No other school that I know of has this splendid market and I know no other could bring the personal contacts that means so much to those here who carry on the work. More than a hundred families are either self supporting or partially so because of the shop, the work they do is of a high grade and what all this means to them is evidenced in the better homes and general living conditions in so many places. Like the nurse the ones in this department come in close touch with the people and their pleasures and problems thus the influence and accomplishments are far more than can be seen in dollars and cents. It is surprising but true that in spite of hard times everywhere the Arrowcraft sales have held up and payments have been more prompt than in other years. This has meant much more than you can realize. All the year, as the checks came in, the money was immediately turned over to the people who were working so faithfully, and but for those checks, we could not have paid these people. The winter was unusually severe and other work scarce so I hardly know what the people would have done without their checks for weaving, baskets, and furniture. Already many of the club orders for next fall are in and by the first of August many orders will be shipped. This is a much more satisfactory way both for the clubs and the shop as Christmas time the stock is low and mails are slow. I do not need to add in closing that all visitors find their way to The September ARROW 41 the Arrowcraft Shop or that I do ers do in the homes, all is part of my best to keep that place until the work of the Center. There is the last knowing that if they once never a time if you are in Sugar-get there they won't see anything lands that you are not on duty or else on the place. subject to call but there is a de-light in coming close to the life of the community and a charm in having your own little family. In fact, since the Gatlinburg family has grown to such proportions we could not get along at all without .the Sugarlands home to slip off to every now and then. Mrs. Dowell is still housemother but the good meals she prepares for the two teachers are only part of her many duties. She helps with community activities and is always at home" to the many callers who drop in day after day for advice or for friendly chat. Eva Hathaway is principal and is successfully teaching the four upper grades. This year three of her pupils completed the eighth grade and will come to Gatlinburg for their first year high school work. Although it is only five miles away, we want them to stay in the dormitory for the training and experience they will receive. Emily Burton, our "veteran" primary teacher, had to leave us in November because of the serious illness and death of her father ; her place was taken by Lois Brewer, a Knoxville girl. Mary Rachel Armstrong had classes in home economics during the year. Frances Moore had clinics at the cottage and also supplemented Mary Rachel's course with the girls by giving practical lessons in home hygiene and care of the sick. Nothing has appealed to the boys more than the shop work Eva has given them. A few tools and some old planks that looked to me good for nothing were Wood Working Shop Even though Mr. Mattil has ceased to be on the pay roll he is still a valuable member of the staff. This year the wood working shop has been almost as popular a 'place with visitors as the Craft Shop. The clubs well know the crickets, sconces, bookshelves, and book ends that are made here but not all have seen the cherry and black walnut furniture that is being made. The training given the men who work in the shop is most valuable and the school appreciates Mr. Mattil carrying this. Many feel it should be a part of the school and it really is in almost every way but financially. With Mr. Mattil's interest in the school and the years he has been here it is no wonder we still call on him for all kinds of extras and he always gladly gives his time, as in former years. Emma Harper Turner Center Sugarlands Extension work has a real appeal, as any one of the special teachers or those in the Sugarlands will tell you. The Sugarlands family is a happy, congenial, and efficient one. School work must be the important part of the program but it is not all. The Sunday School that meets in the schoolhouse, the women who come to the cottage for their rug work, sewing, or just friendly calls, the visiting the teach42 The September ARROW the only equipment but things were made regardless. Later in the year through two Pi Phis who were interested in the school, more tools were gotten and darkness came many a night before the boys were ready to leave the little shop in the schoolhouse. During the summer the school girls have continued to have Sun-day School never failing to feel the sweeping of the schoolhouse after the meeting to be as important as the benediction. Even though the property will eventually be turned over to the Park our work will continue as long as there is need for it; and with the return of Mrs. Dowell, Eva, and Emily our Center will continue to develop. One of the happiest events of last year was the initiation of Emily Burton into Pi Beta Phi. Emily was called home early in November and the night before she left fourteen Tennessee A girls came to Gatlinburg from Chattanooga to take her into -their chap-ter. It was all so sudden, so thrilling and so wonderfully fitting for the twelve years Emily has been here have endeared her to all and the Arrow surely is being worn close to a loyal little Pi Phi heart. Pi Beta , Phi School is actively interested in the organization and development of a Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. In December, 1929, a meeting was held at the Spinning Wheel, Asheville, North Carolina, at which definite steps were taken toward the formation of the Guild, standards for membership, etc. Plans were also laid for an exhibit at the South-ern Mountain Conference the following March. The exhibits from more than thirty centers were proofof the varied and high grade handicraft work being done in the South-ern Mountains. There has been practically no visiting of other schools during the year by any members of the staff. This has been decidedly a "stay-at-home" year but we have tried to keep in touch with the larger program through attending the annual Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, through the Guild meeting in Asheville in December, and by the visitors from other centers who have come to us During the year many requests have come to us for more publicity material to be used by clubs and chapters and this need we should meet this summer. In the fall a set of kodak pictures was sent each council and committee member and each province president and vice president; these were easy to carry and seemed to meet with good response. The slides and films have been used but little during the year. The Gatlinburg News has been sent to about four hundred Pi Phis and perhaps two hundred local people. Letters from the school have been sent to Settlement School Chairman, national officers, and Pi Phis on the Gatlinburg News mailing list. Last summer a new septic tank was installed for the girls' dormitory and Stuart cottage, the heating and plumbing system in the girls' dormitory was reworked, and the teachers' cottage painted. This summer it is necessary to paint the grade school building, the barn, and freshen up some of the interiors. A new storeroom for groceries and for wood and coal must be built as well as a wacron The September ARROW and toolhouse. During the spring more native shrubbery was set out around the Sugarland's cottage and the Gatlinburg buildings; we have tried to improve the premises and have been rewarded by being told that we do have more of an air of refinement. There are a number of acres of woodland on our place and since the windstorm of a year ago and the chestnut blight that has been working for several years we find we have much dead timber. This should be gotten out while it is still good for lumber and we plan to have it logged and sawed this fall. Enough can be sold to pay this billbut we would not be wise to le all go. Seasoned lumber is alw needed about the place and thb the last chestnut that we will e have. In closing this, my twelfth nual report, I want to again expl my sincere appreciation for loyal support that is always gi' by the fraternity. The work in C linburg is a joy and one that is o excelled by your personal inter and cooperation in everything. EVELYN BISHG (NoTE: Report of Treasurer Settlement School will be fol following Alumnae Club report: EDITOR) Minutes of Annual Meeting of Grand Council July 8 16 1930 THE annual meeting of the Grand Council was held at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, July 8-16, dates which were chosen partly because the Settlement School Committee was also in session, thus making it possible to fulfill the constitutional requirement that a member of the Council, in this instance the Grand President, shall meet with the committee during part of each annual committee meeting. The Council greatly missed the Grand Treasurer who was excused because of an European trip. The reports from the chairmen of the standing committees were first read and studied, and from them the various recommendations were acted upon, and certain cies formulated.

GORDON The September ARROW Report of Director of the_.Pi Beta Phi Settlement School 33 THE report of the school for the year of 1929-30 is a contradictory one. In some respects it has been one of the easiest and most satisfactory in the history of the school in other ways it has been one of the most difficult. With the building program of the last three years completed a world of worries ceased. The excitement due to the establishment of the National Park has calmed down; the past year, too, was unusually free from epidemics and illnesses and in every way we were able to continue along a steady routine line. But in contrast to these conditions in Gatlinburg the year for the Committee has been one of unusual difficulties. All know that the past year has been a hard one all over the country and the school was bound to feel the financial depression as did everything else. The fall and winter months were very trying ones but our school was no worse off than many, many others. As fast as money did come bills and salaries were paid. After the holidays the contributions began to come in and although the end of the year finds the total a little below that of the previous year we feel that it is remarkably large considering the financial depression. If we have gone through such a trying period this well surely we can hold to our present program through another year. Word comes to us from the Government that some work will be started in the new National Park by July 1; no doubt the first stepswill be for fire protection for the forest fires during the early spring did much damage to the Park land. The Gatlinburg school will be little affected by the Park; many families, however, have moved out of the upper Sugarlands and it is certain that the teachers' cottage there will be purchased by the Park. This will not cause our work to cease for the Park will lease us the property as long as we have use for it in connection with the school. With good roads, modern hotels, and the publicity being given this section the number of tourists is increasing rapidly. The usual time given to Gatlinburg by them is a few hours and it is impossible in that time to more than catch a glimpse of the place, the people and the school.. Many times I feel the highway, the modern aspect of things along the way, and the more prosperous look of the country disillusions the visitors and causes them to leave with some of the romance destroyed and a feeling that our work here is done. But let me assure those who may feel this way that a bit longer visit will cause a change of heart. It is progress that has made the very changes that perhaps you are regretting. There are still many boys and girls, men and women needing what the school gives and surely there is no more reason for us to cease operations now than for the hundreds of other institutions that are accomplishing something to say, "we have done well, there-fore let us stop where we are."

School The more systematic and well organized a thing is the more difficult it is to give an adequate re-port of it. Many pupils have had perfect attendance for the year; scarcely any. problems of discipline have come up, no epidemics have upset the school, and the whole spirit has been of the best. Much credit should be given Mr. Over-ton for this for in the past three years he has been principal of the school it has shown steady development that has been most gratifying. The enrollment stays just about the same. That is to be expected as we cannot take more pupils in the dormitories than we already have and the day school would naturally vary little from year to year. The seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades are in the Industrial Building, as other classes in home economics, agriculture, and farm shop work, and weaving. Mr. Overton and Miss Blair have these four grades and the past year Mat-tie Huff has assisted by taking two classes and a study period. Miss Williams, Miss McCutchan, and Miss Brabson had the first six grades; these are in the old school building and it is much more satisfactory to have the younger pupils in one building and the older ones in another. Of course being less crowded is an-other great advantage. But the primary room it is necessary here The September ARROW 35 to carry the primer class through an entire year so Miss Brabson had primer, first, and second grades and many days half the attendance of the entire school was in her room. With the lower grades so large and the upper ones so small, it is difficult to come to any satisfactory arrangement. The coming year we will take the second grade into the room with the third and put the fourth, fifth, and sixth together. We know this will relieve the primary teacher and we hope will work out all right for the other grades. More time was spent in supervised play and the program worked out by Mr. Overton and Miss Mc-Cutchan net with a ready response from the pupils. The basketball season was a splendid one. Al-though our teams played four year high schools they were able to make a good showing, the interest was keen, and the training the boys and girls had in sportsman-ship was of the finest. Our great trouble in athletics is having to overwork the boys and girls. A hard game Saturday night after a full day's work in the fields or in the woods, or scrubbing floors or washing, is too much physical exertion, especially as we have such small teams it is impossible to do much substituting. A play was given in February by the faculty. The proceeds were used in building an addition to the stage in the auditorium. Because of a play given by the F.F.T. boys late in the term the high school play at close of school was omitted. Eight pupils received certificates for the completion of the second year high school and eight finished the eighth grade. The county reimburses us for the salaries of the grade teachers. So far we have never received any high school money but there is prospect of some for next year. While it may not be more than the tuition we receive from the pupils it will be cash and will come in regularly and will make it much easier on the boys and girls who are working their way through school. Mr. Overton has been president of the Sevier County Teachers' Association for the entire year and has been a great help in planning interesting and helpful meetings each month and in keeping alive interest among the teachers of the county. We regret losing Miss Williams and Mr. Overton from our school and county. No better way of judging the work done in our school can be found than that of watching its pupils after they have left us and gone to other institutions. This past year we have had four in Murphy Institute, three in Sevier County High, one in Townsend High, one in Pittman Center, one in Chilhowee Institute. Without exception these pupils have made good grades and their standing in the school has been of the best. Report of the school would be far from complete this year with-out reference being made to the library. The books were moved from the hall of the old school building to one of the classrooms that had been vacated when the up-per grades moved to the new building. Two large reading tables were put in the room also. Miss McCullough, librarian from Evansville, Indiana, gave this work a fine start during the time she was 36 The September ARROW vacationing here in August and the interest did not lag during the year. Mr. Overton made calls for "Library Day" to which the teachers responded and new books were catalogued and old ones given to other schools or thrown away. Boxes of books, including the hymn books that had been in use for seventeen years, went to five different schools. All during the year books have come in as a result of this campaign and the library is in very good condition. There are about thirty-five hundred volumes of well selected and readable books and they are being used in both Gatlinburg and Sugarlands. Home Economics Mary Rachel Armstrong, a University of Tennessee graduate, has been our new home economics teacher and has given full time to that work. Each morning is taken up with high school home economic classes. The afternoons are given to community work. Each afternoon was spent in a different locality and the means of reaching these places was subject to change, depending on weather and roads. If the Ford or Chevrolet refused to go over Grindstone Mountain, stout boots and a willing spirit carried her the rest of the way. The classes were composed of people from children to middle aged women. In these less formal classes it is always difficult to tell just what is accomplished. Contacts are kept with the country people and that in itself is worth a great deal. The state will again reimburse us for. these classes and we feel that with the cooperation of the state and the interest taken by the local peoplewe should continue the classes if possible. Agriculture and Farm Shop The Smith-Hughes agriculture and farm shop has been carried on more along the lines of a few years ago. Our new teacher, Don Smith, started to work the first of July by getting acquainted with the community and its problems and projects. I am sure that the first two months he decided that he had come as a veterinarian instead of teacher for the calls to see sick horses and cows seemed world without end; perhaps it was as well to see things at their busiest and worst right at the start. The work in agriculture corresponds to that in home economics in that the mornings are spent in school and the afternoons in different communities. There have been classes in five different places, the territory extending from Banner, three miles away to wear's Valley eighteen miles distant. Like Miss Armstrong, Mr. Smith has let weather decide his means of transportation for roads have been bad much of the time. With each Gatlinburg agriculture boy carrying a home project that must be supervised and all these boys in other communities to look after one can readily see the pro-gram day by day is a full one and not easily kept up with. The F.F.T. took on new life and in the early spring the boys put on a play. The object of this was to raise enough money to send two delegates to the state convention at Nashville and Pi Phi was represented there by two young Future Farmers. The shop work is of a practical The September ARROW kind from fly traps to farm gates and from birdhouses to porch swings. While we try hard not to let. the repair or farm work take too much of the agriculture teacher's time the stock we have on the place and the repairing of gates, etc., furnish many a practical lesson for the school boys. Last year we added to our list of stock a few sheep and this year the new project will be bees. Dormitories The outstanding work of the school, according to many, is that done in connection with the boys and girls in the dormitories. Each year we have from twenty to twenty-five boys and girls living here who are ready for either eighth grade or high school but who live too far from any school giving those grades to make walking possible. There has to be a careful selection as we have many more applications than we have places. We do not plan to take pupils who could go to other places and pay board or who live near any other school. Only those willing and needing to work are considered. The past year we rented for the boys' dormitory a small cottage near the school. It was really too small for the family that had occupied it, six children and the mother and father, but into the same house we put one teacher, the housemother, and from ten to thirteen boys. Only two rooms had heat so during the winter all had to collect into these two small rooms for study hours and for all time they were in the house and awake. It was not a very satisfactory arrangement but the bestwe could do and the way we continue next year. The girls' cottage is qtlite fortable except for the room. This is badly overcrc as forty-five of us take our in this house. The past yet were compelled to use the room for dining room. No room in a house or a dorn makes the situation far from and we are planning our b( provide one for another yeas I have told so many, many the kind of work the boys and do I know you can picture The thing impossible to pictul less one has been here is the life they lead and the joy th( out of having their "leisure" that usually is such a proble: taken up.

Too much credit cannot be given her for the careful planning she has done this year to keep our expenditures as low as possible and make every penny count. Sevier County Health Unit The Sevier County Health Unit has been a wide-awake organization this past year and we are glad to be a part of it. The unit consists of a county health physician, a sanitary officer, an office clerk, a county nurse, the nurse at Pittman Center, a school eighteen miles from Sevierville and ours at Gatlinburg. Our connection with the unit continues to be rather puzzling to many. It really means that Pitt-man and our school, with the county court, pool a certain amount so that that sum can be matched by state and federal funds. The amount we put in is equal to that we would pay our nurse. We send our check to the state department and they pay the nurse. It may sound complicated but it is not and this cooperation means a unit for the county that would be impossible otherwise. In addition to the help given in school examinations and numerous other places the county health physician sees that we are supplied with vaccines and many other sup-plies free of charge, including health pamphlets and literature. The state also pays for the upkeep and depreciation of the nurse's car, saving us an expense that would be quite an item. Health Frances Moore has had a tremendously busy year. She has carried out an extensive and thorough school program that has touched The September ARROW 39 practically every school in the eleventh district. Children were weighed and measured, and in most cases the county health physician gave a physical examination. A good many defects were corrected and the cooperation given by some of the county teachers was a joy. Classes in home hygiene and care of the sick were carried in connection with the home economics classes in Gatlinburg and Sugar-lands. Two classes for "little mothers" were held in Gatlinburg, one in Sugarlands and a mothers' class in Elkmont. Immunization clinics for typhoid, smallpox and dyptheria were held all over the district, more than 700 innoculations being completed. And babies this has. been a baby year: 162 visits made to mothers, 197 letters distributed, and 193 visits made to preschool children. Two tonsil clinics were held during the year. Several patients were in the hospital for from a day or two to four or five weeks, as a result of automobile accidents. The same dentist from Knoxville comes one Saturday each month. Numerous trips are made to Knoxville to take patients in for examinations and treatment. While there is much done in school and in groups there are many, many sick calls that must be answered and this past winter and spring have brought an unusual number of distressing cases. Whether the long, severe winter, the scarcity of work, or just more familiarity with the country brought these to our attention is more than I can say but the fact remains that day after day brought almost more than the nurse could stand. It is our policy to give lit-tle in the line of food or clothing but to try to help people to help themselves. The policy is right, we are sure, but it would take harder hearts than ours to see some of these conditions and then be able to enjoy thoroughly our good foods and warm beds. We were glad when warm weather and gardens came. The amount of work done in connection with the Health Center would be an impossibility without the valuable assistance of Lillie Reagan. She has been in the office long enough to be well acquainted with the work and that with her faithfulness makes her a most valuable assistant. Weaving Weaving teachers are scarce and when Miss Redding left us a year ago we feared we might have a long search for someone to take her place. We were fortunate though for just as I was leaving Oregon last summer after convention I heard of Miss Strand. She came to us in October and came with a thorough knowledge of weaving and also with a real love of the mountains and its people. The work of the department continued much as it had under Miss Redding. The seventh and eighth grade girls had a double period class each morning; the morning was also used for office work, the women calling for sup-plies and advice. Usually the afternoons were given over to the necessary trips to the various homes and these were many. All the Arroweraft things are made in the homes and must be carefully supervised. As most of these trips are made on foot one needs to be The September ARROW pretty good hiker and not easily Iffed by weather. Once each month there has been meeting of the weavers and this both educational and social with 2. emphasis on the social. The )men take turns bringing and wing refreshments usually there e between twenty-five and thirty-'e present not including the bies. Alice McCarter has been the astant, helping Miss Strand when eded and weaving in the Arrow-aft Shop the remainder of the ne. Again the state has given sub-1ntial aid for this work. It comes rough the Smith-Hughes Voca-)nal Department and will amount is year to about $600. Arrowcraft Shop Miss Allen still in charge of the rrowcraft Shop, Veatress Parton id Alice McCarter able assistants, .izabeth Cooke in the office look-g after every penny that comes id goes and, last but not least, e splendid cooperation the clubs id chapters give, make a corn-nation that is bound to do busiss. The report of the Arrowcraft is year shows a business around 3,000 and we are proud to say at it has been carried on at a Zall profit. The aim of this deatment is primarily to provide Drk for people in this community at the same time training them make better and more beautiful ings. To carry the educational rd the business parts of this deirtment and come out even fiincially is really doing well. All is could never be accomplished ithout the wonderful support given by the Pi Phis all over the United States. No other school that I know of has this splendid market and I know no other could bring the personal contacts that means so much to those here who carry on the work. More than a hundred families are either self supporting or partially so because of the shop, the work they do is of a high grade and what all this means to them is evidenced in the better homes and general living conditions in so many places. Like the nurse the ones in this department come in close touch with the people and their pleasures and problems thus the influence and accomplishments are far more than can be seen in dollars and cents. It is surprising but true that in spite of hard times everywhere the Arrowcraft sales have held up and payments have been more prompt than in other years. This has meant much more than you can realize. All the year, as the checks came in, the money was immediately turned over to the people who were working so faithfully, and but for those checks, we could not have paid these people. The winter was unusually severe and other work scarce so I hardly know what the people would have done without their checks for weaving, baskets, and furniture. Already many of the club orders for next fall are in and by the first of August many orders will be shipped. This is a much more satisfactory way both for the clubs and the shop as Christmas time the stock is low and mails are slow. I do not need to add in closing that all visitors find their way to The September ARROW 41 the Arrowcraft Shop or that I do ers do in the homes, all is part of my best to keep that place until the work of the Center. There is the last knowing that if they once never a time if you are in Sugar-get there they won't see anything lands that you are not on duty or else on the place. subject to call but there is a de-light in coming close to the life of the community and a charm in having your own little family. In fact, since the Gatlinburg family has grown to such proportions we could not get along at all without .the Sugarlands home to slip off to every now and then. Mrs. Dowell is still housemother but the good meals she prepares for the two teachers are only part of her many duties. She helps with community activities and is always at home" to the many callers who drop in day after day for advice or for friendly chat. Eva Hathaway is principal and is successfully teaching the four upper grades. This year three of her pupils completed the eighth grade and will come to Gatlinburg for their first year high school work. Although it is only five miles away, we want them to stay in the dormitory for the training and experience they will receive. Emily Burton, our "veteran" primary teacher, had to leave us in November because of the serious illness and death of her father ; her place was taken by Lois Brewer, a Knoxville girl. Mary Rachel Armstrong had classes in home economics during the year. Frances Moore had clinics at the cottage and also supplemented Mary Rachel's course with the girls by giving practical lessons in home hygiene and care of the sick. Nothing has appealed to the boys more than the shop work Eva has given them. A few tools and some old planks that looked to me good for nothing were Wood Working Shop Even though Mr. Mattil has ceased to be on the pay roll he is still a valuable member of the staff. This year the wood working shop has been almost as popular a 'place with visitors as the Craft Shop. The clubs well know the crickets, sconces, bookshelves, and book ends that are made here but not all have seen the cherry and black walnut furniture that is being made. The training given the men who work in the shop is most valuable and the school appreciates Mr. Mattil carrying this. Many feel it should be a part of the school and it really is in almost every way but financially. With Mr. Mattil's interest in the school and the years he has been here it is no wonder we still call on him for all kinds of extras and he always gladly gives his time, as in former years. Emma Harper Turner Center Sugarlands Extension work has a real appeal, as any one of the special teachers or those in the Sugarlands will tell you. The Sugarlands family is a happy, congenial, and efficient one. School work must be the important part of the program but it is not all. The Sunday School that meets in the schoolhouse, the women who come to the cottage for their rug work, sewing, or just friendly calls, the visiting the teach42 The September ARROW the only equipment but things were made regardless. Later in the year through two Pi Phis who were interested in the school, more tools were gotten and darkness came many a night before the boys were ready to leave the little shop in the schoolhouse. During the summer the school girls have continued to have Sun-day School never failing to feel the sweeping of the schoolhouse after the meeting to be as important as the benediction. Even though the property will eventually be turned over to the Park our work will continue as long as there is need for it; and with the return of Mrs. Dowell, Eva, and Emily our Center will continue to develop. One of the happiest events of last year was the initiation of Emily Burton into Pi Beta Phi. Emily was called home early in November and the night before she left fourteen Tennessee A girls came to Gatlinburg from Chattanooga to take her into -their chap-ter. It was all so sudden, so thrilling and so wonderfully fitting for the twelve years Emily has been here have endeared her to all and the Arrow surely is being worn close to a loyal little Pi Phi heart. Pi Beta , Phi School is actively interested in the organization and development of a Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. In December, 1929, a meeting was held at the Spinning Wheel, Asheville, North Carolina, at which definite steps were taken toward the formation of the Guild, standards for membership, etc. Plans were also laid for an exhibit at the South-ern Mountain Conference the following March. The exhibits from more than thirty centers were proofof the varied and high grade handicraft work being done in the South-ern Mountains. There has been practically no visiting of other schools during the year by any members of the staff. This has been decidedly a "stay-at-home" year but we have tried to keep in touch with the larger program through attending the annual Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, through the Guild meeting in Asheville in December, and by the visitors from other centers who have come to us During the year many requests have come to us for more publicity material to be used by clubs and chapters and this need we should meet this summer. In the fall a set of kodak pictures was sent each council and committee member and each province president and vice president; these were easy to carry and seemed to meet with good response. The slides and films have been used but little during the year. The Gatlinburg News has been sent to about four hundred Pi Phis and perhaps two hundred local people. Letters from the school have been sent to Settlement School Chairman, national officers, and Pi Phis on the Gatlinburg News mailing list. Last summer a new septic tank was installed for the girls' dormitory and Stuart cottage, the heating and plumbing system in the girls' dormitory was reworked, and the teachers' cottage painted. This summer it is necessary to paint the grade school building, the barn, and freshen up some of the interiors. A new storeroom for groceries and for wood and coal must be built as well as a wacron The September ARROW and toolhouse. During the spring more native shrubbery was set out around the Sugarland's cottage and the Gatlinburg buildings; we have tried to improve the premises and have been rewarded by being told that we do have more of an air of refinement. There are a number of acres of woodland on our place and since the windstorm of a year ago and the chestnut blight that has been working for several years we find we have much dead timber. This should be gotten out while it is still good for lumber and we plan to have it logged and sawed this fall. Enough can be sold to pay this billbut we would not be wise to le all go. Seasoned lumber is alw needed about the place and thb the last chestnut that we will e have. In closing this, my twelfth nual report, I want to again expl my sincere appreciation for loyal support that is always gi' by the fraternity. The work in C linburg is a joy and one that is o excelled by your personal inter and cooperation in everything. EVELYN BISHG (NoTE: Report of Treasurer Settlement School will be fol following Alumnae Club report: EDITOR) Minutes of Annual Meeting of Grand Council July 8 16 1930 THE annual meeting of the Grand Council was held at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, July 8-16, dates which were chosen partly because the Settlement School Committee was also in session, thus making it possible to fulfill the constitutional requirement that a member of the Council, in this instance the Grand President, shall meet with the committee during part of each annual committee meeting. The Council greatly missed the Grand Treasurer who was excused because of an European trip. The reports from the chairmen of the standing committees were first read and studied, and from them the various recommendations were acted upon, and certain cies formulated. With regard to extension for the coming year, the chairman of the Extension Committee was in-structed to impart the following Lion to the groups concerned: a member of Grand Council s: be sent, the coming year, to ins] Alpha Upsilon of the Universitl Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, C ada; that Beta Theta of Mari College, Marietta, Ohio, shall definitely discouraged because location; that Ero Alphian Michigan State College, East I. sing, Michigan, shall receive official visitor in the fall and the ture progress of the group in titioning Pi Beta Phi shall be termined by this visit; that remaining official visits shall made to Gamma Sigma of the I versify of South Carolina, Col bia, and that Grand Council s act further on the basis of the ports of all visiting officers; t following the receipt of a 1( from the group during the Cot meeting, Mu Lambda of Duke 1 118 The September ARROW Wport of Treasurer o Settlement School REPORT =.A"= CRAFT SIIOP July 1, 1929 to June 30, 1930 Income Baskets Sales m 1,971.70 Miscellaneous and Brooms Sales 1,344.70 Chairs Sales ....'

School The more systematic and well organized a thing is the more difficult it is to give an adequate re-port of it. Many pupils have had perfect attendance for the year; scarcely any. problems of discipline have come up, no epidemics have upset the school, and the whole spirit has been of the best. Much credit should be given Mr. Over-ton for this for in the past three years he has been principal of the school it has shown steady development that has been most gratifying. The enrollment stays just about the same. That is to be expected as we cannot take more pupils in the dormitories than we already have and the day school would naturally vary little from year to year. The seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades are in the Industrial Building, as other classes in home economics, agriculture, and farm shop work, and weaving. Mr. Overton and Miss Blair have these four grades and the past year Mat-tie Huff has assisted by taking two classes and a study period. Miss Williams, Miss McCutchan, and Miss Brabson had the first six grades; these are in the old school building and it is much more satisfactory to have the younger pupils in one building and the older ones in another. Of course being less crowded is an-other great advantage. But the primary room it is necessary here The September ARROW 35 to carry the primer class through an entire year so Miss Brabson had primer, first, and second grades and many days half the attendance of the entire school was in her room. With the lower grades so large and the upper ones so small, it is difficult to come to any satisfactory arrangement. The coming year we will take the second grade into the room with the third and put the fourth, fifth, and sixth together. We know this will relieve the primary teacher and we hope will work out all right for the other grades. More time was spent in supervised play and the program worked out by Mr. Overton and Miss Mc-Cutchan net with a ready response from the pupils. The basketball season was a splendid one. Al-though our teams played four year high schools they were able to make a good showing, the interest was keen, and the training the boys and girls had in sportsman-ship was of the finest. Our great trouble in athletics is having to overwork the boys and girls. A hard game Saturday night after a full day's work in the fields or in the woods, or scrubbing floors or washing, is too much physical exertion, especially as we have such small teams it is impossible to do much substituting. A play was given in February by the faculty. The proceeds were used in building an addition to the stage in the auditorium. Because of a play given by the F.F.T. boys late in the term the high school play at close of school was omitted. Eight pupils received certificates for the completion of the second year high school and eight finished the eighth grade. The county reimburses us for the salaries of the grade teachers. So far we have never received any high school money but there is prospect of some for next year. While it may not be more than the tuition we receive from the pupils it will be cash and will come in regularly and will make it much easier on the boys and girls who are working their way through school. Mr. Overton has been president of the Sevier County Teachers' Association for the entire year and has been a great help in planning interesting and helpful meetings each month and in keeping alive interest among the teachers of the county. We regret losing Miss Williams and Mr. Overton from our school and county. No better way of judging the work done in our school can be found than that of watching its pupils after they have left us and gone to other institutions. This past year we have had four in Murphy Institute, three in Sevier County High, one in Townsend High, one in Pittman Center, one in Chilhowee Institute. Without exception these pupils have made good grades and their standing in the school has been of the best. Report of the school would be far from complete this year with-out reference being made to the library. The books were moved from the hall of the old school building to one of the classrooms that had been vacated when the up-per grades moved to the new building. Two large reading tables were put in the room also. Miss McCullough, librarian from Evansville, Indiana, gave this work a fine start during the time she was 36 The September ARROW vacationing here in August and the interest did not lag during the year. Mr. Overton made calls for "Library Day" to which the teachers responded and new books were catalogued and old ones given to other schools or thrown away. Boxes of books, including the hymn books that had been in use for seventeen years, went to five different schools. All during the year books have come in as a result of this campaign and the library is in very good condition. There are about thirty-five hundred volumes of well selected and readable books and they are being used in both Gatlinburg and Sugarlands. Home Economics Mary Rachel Armstrong, a University of Tennessee graduate, has been our new home economics teacher and has given full time to that work. Each morning is taken up with high school home economic classes. The afternoons are given to community work. Each afternoon was spent in a different locality and the means of reaching these places was subject to change, depending on weather and roads. If the Ford or Chevrolet refused to go over Grindstone Mountain, stout boots and a willing spirit carried her the rest of the way. The classes were composed of people from children to middle aged women. In these less formal classes it is always difficult to tell just what is accomplished. Contacts are kept with the country people and that in itself is worth a great deal. The state will again reimburse us for. these classes and we feel that with the cooperation of the state and the interest taken by the local peoplewe should continue the classes if possible. Agriculture and Farm Shop The Smith-Hughes agriculture and farm shop has been carried on more along the lines of a few years ago. Our new teacher, Don Smith, started to work the first of July by getting acquainted with the community and its problems and projects. I am sure that the first two months he decided that he had come as a veterinarian instead of teacher for the calls to see sick horses and cows seemed world without end; perhaps it was as well to see things at their busiest and worst right at the start. The work in agriculture corresponds to that in home economics in that the mornings are spent in school and the afternoons in different communities. There have been classes in five different places, the territory extending from Banner, three miles away to wear's Valley eighteen miles distant. Like Miss Armstrong, Mr. Smith has let weather decide his means of transportation for roads have been bad much of the time. With each Gatlinburg agriculture boy carrying a home project that must be supervised and all these boys in other communities to look after one can readily see the pro-gram day by day is a full one and not easily kept up with. The F.F.T. took on new life and in the early spring the boys put on a play. The object of this was to raise enough money to send two delegates to the state convention at Nashville and Pi Phi was represented there by two young Future Farmers. The shop work is of a practical The September ARROW kind from fly traps to farm gates and from birdhouses to porch swings. While we try hard not to let. the repair or farm work take too much of the agriculture teacher's time the stock we have on the place and the repairing of gates, etc., furnish many a practical lesson for the school boys. Last year we added to our list of stock a few sheep and this year the new project will be bees. Dormitories The outstanding work of the school, according to many, is that done in connection with the boys and girls in the dormitories. Each year we have from twenty to twenty-five boys and girls living here who are ready for either eighth grade or high school but who live too far from any school giving those grades to make walking possible. There has to be a careful selection as we have many more applications than we have places. We do not plan to take pupils who could go to other places and pay board or who live near any other school. Only those willing and needing to work are considered. The past year we rented for the boys' dormitory a small cottage near the school. It was really too small for the family that had occupied it, six children and the mother and father, but into the same house we put one teacher, the housemother, and from ten to thirteen boys. Only two rooms had heat so during the winter all had to collect into these two small rooms for study hours and for all time they were in the house and awake. It was not a very satisfactory arrangement but the bestwe could do and the way we continue next year. The girls' cottage is qtlite fortable except for the room. This is badly overcrc as forty-five of us take our in this house. The past yet were compelled to use the room for dining room. No room in a house or a dorn makes the situation far from and we are planning our b( provide one for another yeas I have told so many, many the kind of work the boys and do I know you can picture The thing impossible to pictul less one has been here is the life they lead and the joy th( out of having their "leisure" that usually is such a proble: taken up.

Too much credit cannot be given her for the careful planning she has done this year to keep our expenditures as low as possible and make every penny count. Sevier County Health Unit The Sevier County Health Unit has been a wide-awake organization this past year and we are glad to be a part of it. The unit consists of a county health physician, a sanitary officer, an office clerk, a county nurse, the nurse at Pittman Center, a school eighteen miles from Sevierville and ours at Gatlinburg. Our connection with the unit continues to be rather puzzling to many. It really means that Pitt-man and our school, with the county court, pool a certain amount so that that sum can be matched by state and federal funds. The amount we put in is equal to that we would pay our nurse. We send our check to the state department and they pay the nurse. It may sound complicated but it is not and this cooperation means a unit for the county that would be impossible otherwise. In addition to the help given in school examinations and numerous other places the county health physician sees that we are supplied with vaccines and many other sup-plies free of charge, including health pamphlets and literature. The state also pays for the upkeep and depreciation of the nurse's car, saving us an expense that would be quite an item. Health Frances Moore has had a tremendously busy year. She has carried out an extensive and thorough school program that has touched The September ARROW 39 practically every school in the eleventh district. Children were weighed and measured, and in most cases the county health physician gave a physical examination. A good many defects were corrected and the cooperation given by some of the county teachers was a joy. Classes in home hygiene and care of the sick were carried in connection with the home economics classes in Gatlinburg and Sugar-lands. Two classes for "little mothers" were held in Gatlinburg, one in Sugarlands and a mothers' class in Elkmont. Immunization clinics for typhoid, smallpox and dyptheria were held all over the district, more than 700 innoculations being completed. And babies this has. been a baby year: 162 visits made to mothers, 197 letters distributed, and 193 visits made to preschool children. Two tonsil clinics were held during the year. Several patients were in the hospital for from a day or two to four or five weeks, as a result of automobile accidents. The same dentist from Knoxville comes one Saturday each month. Numerous trips are made to Knoxville to take patients in for examinations and treatment. While there is much done in school and in groups there are many, many sick calls that must be answered and this past winter and spring have brought an unusual number of distressing cases. Whether the long, severe winter, the scarcity of work, or just more familiarity with the country brought these to our attention is more than I can say but the fact remains that day after day brought almost more than the nurse could stand. It is our policy to give lit-tle in the line of food or clothing but to try to help people to help themselves. The policy is right, we are sure, but it would take harder hearts than ours to see some of these conditions and then be able to enjoy thoroughly our good foods and warm beds. We were glad when warm weather and gardens came. The amount of work done in connection with the Health Center would be an impossibility without the valuable assistance of Lillie Reagan. She has been in the office long enough to be well acquainted with the work and that with her faithfulness makes her a most valuable assistant. Weaving Weaving teachers are scarce and when Miss Redding left us a year ago we feared we might have a long search for someone to take her place. We were fortunate though for just as I was leaving Oregon last summer after convention I heard of Miss Strand. She came to us in October and came with a thorough knowledge of weaving and also with a real love of the mountains and its people. The work of the department continued much as it had under Miss Redding. The seventh and eighth grade girls had a double period class each morning; the morning was also used for office work, the women calling for sup-plies and advice. Usually the afternoons were given over to the necessary trips to the various homes and these were many. All the Arroweraft things are made in the homes and must be carefully supervised. As most of these trips are made on foot one needs to be The September ARROW pretty good hiker and not easily Iffed by weather. Once each month there has been meeting of the weavers and this both educational and social with 2. emphasis on the social. The )men take turns bringing and wing refreshments usually there e between twenty-five and thirty-'e present not including the bies. Alice McCarter has been the astant, helping Miss Strand when eded and weaving in the Arrow-aft Shop the remainder of the ne. Again the state has given sub-1ntial aid for this work. It comes rough the Smith-Hughes Voca-)nal Department and will amount is year to about $600. Arrowcraft Shop Miss Allen still in charge of the rrowcraft Shop, Veatress Parton id Alice McCarter able assistants, .izabeth Cooke in the office look-g after every penny that comes id goes and, last but not least, e splendid cooperation the clubs id chapters give, make a corn-nation that is bound to do busiss. The report of the Arrowcraft is year shows a business around 3,000 and we are proud to say at it has been carried on at a Zall profit. The aim of this deatment is primarily to provide Drk for people in this community at the same time training them make better and more beautiful ings. To carry the educational rd the business parts of this deirtment and come out even fiincially is really doing well. All is could never be accomplished ithout the wonderful support given by the Pi Phis all over the United States. No other school that I know of has this splendid market and I know no other could bring the personal contacts that means so much to those here who carry on the work. More than a hundred families are either self supporting or partially so because of the shop, the work they do is of a high grade and what all this means to them is evidenced in the better homes and general living conditions in so many places. Like the nurse the ones in this department come in close touch with the people and their pleasures and problems thus the influence and accomplishments are far more than can be seen in dollars and cents. It is surprising but true that in spite of hard times everywhere the Arrowcraft sales have held up and payments have been more prompt than in other years. This has meant much more than you can realize. All the year, as the checks came in, the money was immediately turned over to the people who were working so faithfully, and but for those checks, we could not have paid these people. The winter was unusually severe and other work scarce so I hardly know what the people would have done without their checks for weaving, baskets, and furniture. Already many of the club orders for next fall are in and by the first of August many orders will be shipped. This is a much more satisfactory way both for the clubs and the shop as Christmas time the stock is low and mails are slow. I do not need to add in closing that all visitors find their way to The September ARROW 41 the Arrowcraft Shop or that I do ers do in the homes, all is part of my best to keep that place until the work of the Center. There is the last knowing that if they once never a time if you are in Sugar-get there they won't see anything lands that you are not on duty or else on the place. subject to call but there is a de-light in coming close to the life of the community and a charm in having your own little family. In fact, since the Gatlinburg family has grown to such proportions we could not get along at all without .the Sugarlands home to slip off to every now and then. Mrs. Dowell is still housemother but the good meals she prepares for the two teachers are only part of her many duties. She helps with community activities and is always at home" to the many callers who drop in day after day for advice or for friendly chat. Eva Hathaway is principal and is successfully teaching the four upper grades. This year three of her pupils completed the eighth grade and will come to Gatlinburg for their first year high school work. Although it is only five miles away, we want them to stay in the dormitory for the training and experience they will receive. Emily Burton, our "veteran" primary teacher, had to leave us in November because of the serious illness and death of her father ; her place was taken by Lois Brewer, a Knoxville girl. Mary Rachel Armstrong had classes in home economics during the year. Frances Moore had clinics at the cottage and also supplemented Mary Rachel's course with the girls by giving practical lessons in home hygiene and care of the sick. Nothing has appealed to the boys more than the shop work Eva has given them. A few tools and some old planks that looked to me good for nothing were Wood Working Shop Even though Mr. Mattil has ceased to be on the pay roll he is still a valuable member of the staff. This year the wood working shop has been almost as popular a 'place with visitors as the Craft Shop. The clubs well know the crickets, sconces, bookshelves, and book ends that are made here but not all have seen the cherry and black walnut furniture that is being made. The training given the men who work in the shop is most valuable and the school appreciates Mr. Mattil carrying this. Many feel it should be a part of the school and it really is in almost every way but financially. With Mr. Mattil's interest in the school and the years he has been here it is no wonder we still call on him for all kinds of extras and he always gladly gives his time, as in former years. Emma Harper Turner Center Sugarlands Extension work has a real appeal, as any one of the special teachers or those in the Sugarlands will tell you. The Sugarlands family is a happy, congenial, and efficient one. School work must be the important part of the program but it is not all. The Sunday School that meets in the schoolhouse, the women who come to the cottage for their rug work, sewing, or just friendly calls, the visiting the teach42 The September ARROW the only equipment but things were made regardless. Later in the year through two Pi Phis who were interested in the school, more tools were gotten and darkness came many a night before the boys were ready to leave the little shop in the schoolhouse. During the summer the school girls have continued to have Sun-day School never failing to feel the sweeping of the schoolhouse after the meeting to be as important as the benediction. Even though the property will eventually be turned over to the Park our work will continue as long as there is need for it; and with the return of Mrs. Dowell, Eva, and Emily our Center will continue to develop. One of the happiest events of last year was the initiation of Emily Burton into Pi Beta Phi. Emily was called home early in November and the night before she left fourteen Tennessee A girls came to Gatlinburg from Chattanooga to take her into -their chap-ter. It was all so sudden, so thrilling and so wonderfully fitting for the twelve years Emily has been here have endeared her to all and the Arrow surely is being worn close to a loyal little Pi Phi heart. Pi Beta , Phi School is actively interested in the organization and development of a Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. In December, 1929, a meeting was held at the Spinning Wheel, Asheville, North Carolina, at which definite steps were taken toward the formation of the Guild, standards for membership, etc. Plans were also laid for an exhibit at the South-ern Mountain Conference the following March. The exhibits from more than thirty centers were proofof the varied and high grade handicraft work being done in the South-ern Mountains. There has been practically no visiting of other schools during the year by any members of the staff. This has been decidedly a "stay-at-home" year but we have tried to keep in touch with the larger program through attending the annual Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, through the Guild meeting in Asheville in December, and by the visitors from other centers who have come to us During the year many requests have come to us for more publicity material to be used by clubs and chapters and this need we should meet this summer. In the fall a set of kodak pictures was sent each council and committee member and each province president and vice president; these were easy to carry and seemed to meet with good response. The slides and films have been used but little during the year. The Gatlinburg News has been sent to about four hundred Pi Phis and perhaps two hundred local people. Letters from the school have been sent to Settlement School Chairman, national officers, and Pi Phis on the Gatlinburg News mailing list. Last summer a new septic tank was installed for the girls' dormitory and Stuart cottage, the heating and plumbing system in the girls' dormitory was reworked, and the teachers' cottage painted. This summer it is necessary to paint the grade school building, the barn, and freshen up some of the interiors. A new storeroom for groceries and for wood and coal must be built as well as a wacron The September ARROW and toolhouse. During the spring more native shrubbery was set out around the Sugarland's cottage and the Gatlinburg buildings; we have tried to improve the premises and have been rewarded by being told that we do have more of an air of refinement. There are a number of acres of woodland on our place and since the windstorm of a year ago and the chestnut blight that has been working for several years we find we have much dead timber. This should be gotten out while it is still good for lumber and we plan to have it logged and sawed this fall. Enough can be sold to pay this billbut we would not be wise to le all go. Seasoned lumber is alw needed about the place and thb the last chestnut that we will e have. In closing this, my twelfth nual report, I want to again expl my sincere appreciation for loyal support that is always gi' by the fraternity. The work in C linburg is a joy and one that is o excelled by your personal inter and cooperation in everything. EVELYN BISHG (NoTE: Report of Treasurer Settlement School will be fol following Alumnae Club report: EDITOR) Minutes of Annual Meeting of Grand Council July 8 16 1930 THE annual meeting of the Grand Council was held at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, July 8-16, dates which were chosen partly because the Settlement School Committee was also in session, thus making it possible to fulfill the constitutional requirement that a member of the Council, in this instance the Grand President, shall meet with the committee during part of each annual committee meeting. The Council greatly missed the Grand Treasurer who was excused because of an European trip. The reports from the chairmen of the standing committees were first read and studied, and from them the various recommendations were acted upon, and certain cies formulated.

        36 The September ARROW vacationing here in August and the interest did not lag during the year. Mr. Overton made calls for "Library Day" to which the teachers responded and new books were catalogued and old ones given to other schools or thrown away. Boxes of books, including the hymn books that had been in use for seventeen years, went to five different schools. All during the year books have come in as a result of this campaign and the library is in very good condition. There are about thirty-five hundred volumes of well selected and readable books and they are being used in both Gatlinburg and Sugarlands. Home Economics Mary Rachel Armstrong, a University of Tennessee graduate, has been our new home economics teacher and has given full time to that work. Each morning is taken up with high school home economic classes. The afternoons are given to community work. Each afternoon was spent in a different locality and the means of reaching these places was subject to change, depending on weather and roads. If the Ford or Chevrolet refused to go over Grindstone Mountain, stout boots and a willing spirit carried her the rest of the way. The classes were composed of people from children to middle aged women. In these less formal classes it is always difficult to tell just what is accomplished. Contacts are kept with the country people and that in itself is worth a great deal. The state will again reimburse us for. these classes and we feel that with the cooperation of the state and the interest taken by the local peoplewe should continue the classes if possible. Agriculture and Farm Shop The Smith-Hughes agriculture and farm shop has been carried on more along the lines of a few years ago. Our new teacher, Don Smith, started to work the first of July by getting acquainted with the community and its problems and projects. I am sure that the first two months he decided that he had come as a veterinarian instead of teacher for the calls to see sick horses and cows seemed world without end; perhaps it was as well to see things at their busiest and worst right at the start. The work in agriculture corresponds to that in home economics in that the mornings are spent in school and the afternoons in different communities. There have been classes in five different places, the territory extending from Banner, three miles away to wear's Valley eighteen miles distant. Like Miss Armstrong, Mr. Smith has let weather decide his means of transportation for roads have been bad much of the time. With each Gatlinburg agriculture boy carrying a home project that must be supervised and all these boys in other communities to look after one can readily see the pro-gram day by day is a full one and not easily kept up with. The F.F.T. took on new life and in the early spring the boys put on a play. The object of this was to raise enough money to send two delegates to the state convention at Nashville and Pi Phi was represented there by two young Future Farmers. The shop work is of a practical The September ARROW kind from fly traps to farm gates and from birdhouses to porch swings. While we try hard not to let. the repair or farm work take too much of the agriculture teacher's time the stock we have on the place and the repairing of gates, etc., furnish many a practical lesson for the school boys. Last year we added to our list of stock a few sheep and this year the new project will be bees. Dormitories The outstanding work of the school, according to many, is that done in connection with the boys and girls in the dormitories. Each year we have from twenty to twenty-five boys and girls living here who are ready for either eighth grade or high school but who live too far from any school giving those grades to make walking possible. There has to be a careful selection as we have many more applications than we have places. We do not plan to take pupils who could go to other places and pay board or who live near any other school. Only those willing and needing to work are considered. The past year we rented for the boys' dormitory a small cottage near the school. It was really too small for the family that had occupied it, six children and the mother and father, but into the same house we put one teacher, the housemother, and from ten to thirteen boys. Only two rooms had heat so during the winter all had to collect into these two small rooms for study hours and for all time they were in the house and awake. It was not a very satisfactory arrangement but the bestwe could do and the way we continue next year. The girls' cottage is qtlite fortable except for the room. This is badly overcrc as forty-five of us take our in this house. The past yet were compelled to use the room for dining room. No room in a house or a dorn makes the situation far from and we are planning our b( provide one for another yeas I have told so many, many the kind of work the boys and do I know you can picture The thing impossible to pictul less one has been here is the life they lead and the joy th( out of having their "leisure" that usually is such a proble: taken up.

Too much credit cannot be given her for the careful planning she has done this year to keep our expenditures as low as possible and make every penny count. Sevier County Health Unit The Sevier County Health Unit has been a wide-awake organization this past year and we are glad to be a part of it. The unit consists of a county health physician, a sanitary officer, an office clerk, a county nurse, the nurse at Pittman Center, a school eighteen miles from Sevierville and ours at Gatlinburg. Our connection with the unit continues to be rather puzzling to many. It really means that Pitt-man and our school, with the county court, pool a certain amount so that that sum can be matched by state and federal funds. The amount we put in is equal to that we would pay our nurse. We send our check to the state department and they pay the nurse. It may sound complicated but it is not and this cooperation means a unit for the county that would be impossible otherwise. In addition to the help given in school examinations and numerous other places the county health physician sees that we are supplied with vaccines and many other sup-plies free of charge, including health pamphlets and literature. The state also pays for the upkeep and depreciation of the nurse's car, saving us an expense that would be quite an item. Health Frances Moore has had a tremendously busy year. She has carried out an extensive and thorough school program that has touched The September ARROW 39 practically every school in the eleventh district. Children were weighed and measured, and in most cases the county health physician gave a physical examination. A good many defects were corrected and the cooperation given by some of the county teachers was a joy. Classes in home hygiene and care of the sick were carried in connection with the home economics classes in Gatlinburg and Sugar-lands. Two classes for "little mothers" were held in Gatlinburg, one in Sugarlands and a mothers' class in Elkmont. Immunization clinics for typhoid, smallpox and dyptheria were held all over the district, more than 700 innoculations being completed. And babies this has. been a baby year: 162 visits made to mothers, 197 letters distributed, and 193 visits made to preschool children. Two tonsil clinics were held during the year. Several patients were in the hospital for from a day or two to four or five weeks, as a result of automobile accidents. The same dentist from Knoxville comes one Saturday each month. Numerous trips are made to Knoxville to take patients in for examinations and treatment. While there is much done in school and in groups there are many, many sick calls that must be answered and this past winter and spring have brought an unusual number of distressing cases. Whether the long, severe winter, the scarcity of work, or just more familiarity with the country brought these to our attention is more than I can say but the fact remains that day after day brought almost more than the nurse could stand. It is our policy to give lit-tle in the line of food or clothing but to try to help people to help themselves. The policy is right, we are sure, but it would take harder hearts than ours to see some of these conditions and then be able to enjoy thoroughly our good foods and warm beds. We were glad when warm weather and gardens came. The amount of work done in connection with the Health Center would be an impossibility without the valuable assistance of Lillie Reagan. She has been in the office long enough to be well acquainted with the work and that with her faithfulness makes her a most valuable assistant. Weaving Weaving teachers are scarce and when Miss Redding left us a year ago we feared we might have a long search for someone to take her place. We were fortunate though for just as I was leaving Oregon last summer after convention I heard of Miss Strand. She came to us in October and came with a thorough knowledge of weaving and also with a real love of the mountains and its people. The work of the department continued much as it had under Miss Redding. The seventh and eighth grade girls had a double period class each morning; the morning was also used for office work, the women calling for sup-plies and advice. Usually the afternoons were given over to the necessary trips to the various homes and these were many. All the Arroweraft things are made in the homes and must be carefully supervised. As most of these trips are made on foot one needs to be The September ARROW pretty good hiker and not easily Iffed by weather. Once each month there has been meeting of the weavers and this both educational and social with 2. emphasis on the social. The )men take turns bringing and wing refreshments usually there e between twenty-five and thirty-'e present not including the bies. Alice McCarter has been the astant, helping Miss Strand when eded and weaving in the Arrow-aft Shop the remainder of the ne. Again the state has given sub-1ntial aid for this work. It comes rough the Smith-Hughes Voca-)nal Department and will amount is year to about $600. Arrowcraft Shop Miss Allen still in charge of the rrowcraft Shop, Veatress Parton id Alice McCarter able assistants, .izabeth Cooke in the office look-g after every penny that comes id goes and, last but not least, e splendid cooperation the clubs id chapters give, make a corn-nation that is bound to do busiss. The report of the Arrowcraft is year shows a business around 3,000 and we are proud to say at it has been carried on at a Zall profit. The aim of this deatment is primarily to provide Drk for people in this community at the same time training them make better and more beautiful ings. To carry the educational rd the business parts of this deirtment and come out even fiincially is really doing well. All is could never be accomplished ithout the wonderful support given by the Pi Phis all over the United States. No other school that I know of has this splendid market and I know no other could bring the personal contacts that means so much to those here who carry on the work. More than a hundred families are either self supporting or partially so because of the shop, the work they do is of a high grade and what all this means to them is evidenced in the better homes and general living conditions in so many places. Like the nurse the ones in this department come in close touch with the people and their pleasures and problems thus the influence and accomplishments are far more than can be seen in dollars and cents. It is surprising but true that in spite of hard times everywhere the Arrowcraft sales have held up and payments have been more prompt than in other years. This has meant much more than you can realize. All the year, as the checks came in, the money was immediately turned over to the people who were working so faithfully, and but for those checks, we could not have paid these people. The winter was unusually severe and other work scarce so I hardly know what the people would have done without their checks for weaving, baskets, and furniture. Already many of the club orders for next fall are in and by the first of August many orders will be shipped. This is a much more satisfactory way both for the clubs and the shop as Christmas time the stock is low and mails are slow. I do not need to add in closing that all visitors find their way to The September ARROW 41 the Arrowcraft Shop or that I do ers do in the homes, all is part of my best to keep that place until the work of the Center. There is the last knowing that if they once never a time if you are in Sugar-get there they won't see anything lands that you are not on duty or else on the place. subject to call but there is a de-light in coming close to the life of the community and a charm in having your own little family. In fact, since the Gatlinburg family has grown to such proportions we could not get along at all without .the Sugarlands home to slip off to every now and then. Mrs. Dowell is still housemother but the good meals she prepares for the two teachers are only part of her many duties. She helps with community activities and is always at home" to the many callers who drop in day after day for advice or for friendly chat. Eva Hathaway is principal and is successfully teaching the four upper grades. This year three of her pupils completed the eighth grade and will come to Gatlinburg for their first year high school work. Although it is only five miles away, we want them to stay in the dormitory for the training and experience they will receive. Emily Burton, our "veteran" primary teacher, had to leave us in November because of the serious illness and death of her father ; her place was taken by Lois Brewer, a Knoxville girl. Mary Rachel Armstrong had classes in home economics during the year. Frances Moore had clinics at the cottage and also supplemented Mary Rachel's course with the girls by giving practical lessons in home hygiene and care of the sick. Nothing has appealed to the boys more than the shop work Eva has given them. A few tools and some old planks that looked to me good for nothing were Wood Working Shop Even though Mr. Mattil has ceased to be on the pay roll he is still a valuable member of the staff. This year the wood working shop has been almost as popular a 'place with visitors as the Craft Shop. The clubs well know the crickets, sconces, bookshelves, and book ends that are made here but not all have seen the cherry and black walnut furniture that is being made. The training given the men who work in the shop is most valuable and the school appreciates Mr. Mattil carrying this. Many feel it should be a part of the school and it really is in almost every way but financially. With Mr. Mattil's interest in the school and the years he has been here it is no wonder we still call on him for all kinds of extras and he always gladly gives his time, as in former years. Emma Harper Turner Center Sugarlands Extension work has a real appeal, as any one of the special teachers or those in the Sugarlands will tell you. The Sugarlands family is a happy, congenial, and efficient one. School work must be the important part of the program but it is not all. The Sunday School that meets in the schoolhouse, the women who come to the cottage for their rug work, sewing, or just friendly calls, the visiting the teach42 The September ARROW the only equipment but things were made regardless. Later in the year through two Pi Phis who were interested in the school, more tools were gotten and darkness came many a night before the boys were ready to leave the little shop in the schoolhouse. During the summer the school girls have continued to have Sun-day School never failing to feel the sweeping of the schoolhouse after the meeting to be as important as the benediction. Even though the property will eventually be turned over to the Park our work will continue as long as there is need for it; and with the return of Mrs. Dowell, Eva, and Emily our Center will continue to develop. One of the happiest events of last year was the initiation of Emily Burton into Pi Beta Phi. Emily was called home early in November and the night before she left fourteen Tennessee A girls came to Gatlinburg from Chattanooga to take her into -their chap-ter. It was all so sudden, so thrilling and so wonderfully fitting for the twelve years Emily has been here have endeared her to all and the Arrow surely is being worn close to a loyal little Pi Phi heart. Pi Beta , Phi School is actively interested in the organization and development of a Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. In December, 1929, a meeting was held at the Spinning Wheel, Asheville, North Carolina, at which definite steps were taken toward the formation of the Guild, standards for membership, etc. Plans were also laid for an exhibit at the South-ern Mountain Conference the following March. The exhibits from more than thirty centers were proofof the varied and high grade handicraft work being done in the South-ern Mountains. There has been practically no visiting of other schools during the year by any members of the staff. This has been decidedly a "stay-at-home" year but we have tried to keep in touch with the larger program through attending the annual Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, through the Guild meeting in Asheville in December, and by the visitors from other centers who have come to us During the year many requests have come to us for more publicity material to be used by clubs and chapters and this need we should meet this summer. In the fall a set of kodak pictures was sent each council and committee member and each province president and vice president; these were easy to carry and seemed to meet with good response. The slides and films have been used but little during the year. The Gatlinburg News has been sent to about four hundred Pi Phis and perhaps two hundred local people. Letters from the school have been sent to Settlement School Chairman, national officers, and Pi Phis on the Gatlinburg News mailing list. Last summer a new septic tank was installed for the girls' dormitory and Stuart cottage, the heating and plumbing system in the girls' dormitory was reworked, and the teachers' cottage painted. This summer it is necessary to paint the grade school building, the barn, and freshen up some of the interiors. A new storeroom for groceries and for wood and coal must be built as well as a wacron The September ARROW and toolhouse. During the spring more native shrubbery was set out around the Sugarland's cottage and the Gatlinburg buildings; we have tried to improve the premises and have been rewarded by being told that we do have more of an air of refinement. There are a number of acres of woodland on our place and since the windstorm of a year ago and the chestnut blight that has been working for several years we find we have much dead timber. This should be gotten out while it is still good for lumber and we plan to have it logged and sawed this fall. Enough can be sold to pay this billbut we would not be wise to le all go. Seasoned lumber is alw needed about the place and thb the last chestnut that we will e have. In closing this, my twelfth nual report, I want to again expl my sincere appreciation for loyal support that is always gi' by the fraternity. The work in C linburg is a joy and one that is o excelled by your personal inter and cooperation in everything. EVELYN BISHG (NoTE: Report of Treasurer Settlement School will be fol following Alumnae Club report: EDITOR) Minutes of Annual Meeting of Grand Council July 8 16 1930 THE annual meeting of the Grand Council was held at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, July 8-16, dates which were chosen partly because the Settlement School Committee was also in session, thus making it possible to fulfill the constitutional requirement that a member of the Council, in this instance the Grand President, shall meet with the committee during part of each annual committee meeting. The Council greatly missed the Grand Treasurer who was excused because of an European trip.

All current bills are paid from this office, all inrial business is handled here. year the work increases but  Cooke handles it gladly and ently and is always willing to with the numberless extras that come in the course of every day. Too much credit cannot be given her for the careful planning she has done this year to keep our expenditures as low as possible and make every penny count. Sevier County Health Unit The Sevier County Health Unit has been a wide-awake organization this past year and we are glad to be a part of it. The unit consists of a county health physician, a sanitary officer, an office clerk, a county nurse, the nurse at Pittman Center, a school eighteen miles from Sevierville and ours at Gatlinburg. Our connection with the unit continues to be rather puzzling to many. It really means that Pitt-man and our school, with the county court, pool a certain amount so that that sum can be matched by state and federal funds. The amount we put in is equal to that we would pay our nurse. We send our check to the state department and they pay the nurse. It may sound complicated but it is not and this cooperation means a unit for the county that would be impossible otherwise. In addition to the help given in school examinations and numerous other places the county health physician sees that we are supplied with vaccines and many other sup-plies free of charge, including health pamphlets and literature. The state also pays for the upkeep and depreciation of the nurse's car, saving us an expense that would be quite an item. Health Frances Moore has had a tremendously busy year. She has carried out an extensive and thorough school program that has touched The September ARROW 39 practically every school in the eleventh district. Children were weighed and measured, and in most cases the county health physician gave a physical examination. A good many defects were corrected and the cooperation given by some of the county teachers was a joy. Classes in home hygiene and care of the sick were carried in connection with the home economics classes in Gatlinburg and Sugar-lands. Two classes for "little mothers" were held in Gatlinburg, one in Sugarlands and a mothers' class in Elkmont. Immunization clinics for typhoid, smallpox and dyptheria were held all over the district, more than 700 innoculations being completed. And babies this has. been a baby year: 162 visits made to mothers, 197 letters distributed, and 193 visits made to preschool children. Two tonsil clinics were held during the year. Several patients were in the hospital for from a day or two to four or five weeks, as a result of automobile accidents. The same dentist from Knoxville comes one Saturday each month. Numerous trips are made to Knoxville to take patients in for examinations and treatment. While there is much done in school and in groups there are many, many sick calls that must be answered and this past winter and spring have brought an unusual number of distressing cases. Whether the long, severe winter, the scarcity of work, or just more familiarity with the country brought these to our attention is more than I can say but the fact remains that day after day brought almost more than the nurse could stand. It is our policy to give lit-tle in the line of food or clothing but to try to help people to help themselves. The policy is right, we are sure, but it would take harder hearts than ours to see some of these conditions and then be able to enjoy thoroughly our good foods and warm beds. We were glad when warm weather and gardens came. The amount of work done in connection with the Health Center would be an impossibility without the valuable assistance of Lillie Reagan. She has been in the office long enough to be well acquainted with the work and that with her faithfulness makes her a most valuable assistant. Weaving Weaving teachers are scarce and when Miss Redding left us a year ago we feared we might have a long search for someone to take her place. We were fortunate though for just as I was leaving Oregon last summer after convention I heard of Miss Strand. She came to us in October and came with a thorough knowledge of weaving and also with a real love of the mountains and its people. The work of the department continued much as it had under Miss Redding. The seventh and eighth grade girls had a double period class each morning; the morning was also used for office work, the women calling for sup-plies and advice. Usually the afternoons were given over to the necessary trips to the various homes and these were many. All the Arroweraft things are made in the homes and must be carefully supervised. As most of these trips are made on foot one needs to be The September ARROW pretty good hiker and not easily Iffed by weather. Once each month there has been meeting of the weavers and this both educational and social with 2. emphasis on the social. The )men take turns bringing and wing refreshments usually there e between twenty-five and thirty-'e present not including the bies. Alice McCarter has been the astant, helping Miss Strand when eded and weaving in the Arrow-aft Shop the remainder of the ne. Again the state has given sub-1ntial aid for this work. It comes rough the Smith-Hughes Voca-)nal Department and will amount is year to about $600. Arrowcraft Shop Miss Allen still in charge of the rrowcraft Shop, Veatress Parton id Alice McCarter able assistants, .izabeth Cooke in the office look-g after every penny that comes id goes and, last but not least, e splendid cooperation the clubs id chapters give, make a corn-nation that is bound to do busiss. The report of the Arrowcraft is year shows a business around 3,000 and we are proud to say at it has been carried on at a Zall profit. The aim of this deatment is primarily to provide Drk for people in this community at the same time training them make better and more beautiful ings. To carry the educational rd the business parts of this deirtment and come out even fiincially is really doing well. All is could never be accomplished ithout the wonderful support given by the Pi Phis all over the United States. No other school that I know of has this splendid market and I know no other could bring the personal contacts that means so much to those here who carry on the work. More than a hundred families are either self supporting or partially so because of the shop, the work they do is of a high grade and what all this means to them is evidenced in the better homes and general living conditions in so many places. Like the nurse the ones in this department come in close touch with the people and their pleasures and problems thus the influence and accomplishments are far more than can be seen in dollars and cents. It is surprising but true that in spite of hard times everywhere the Arrowcraft sales have held up and payments have been more prompt than in other years. This has meant much more than you can realize. All the year, as the checks came in, the money was immediately turned over to the people who were working so faithfully, and but for those checks, we could not have paid these people. The winter was unusually severe and other work scarce so I hardly know what the people would have done without their checks for weaving, baskets, and furniture. Already many of the club orders for next fall are in and by the first of August many orders will be shipped. This is a much more satisfactory way both for the clubs and the shop as Christmas time the stock is low and mails are slow. I do not need to add in closing that all visitors find their way to The September ARROW 41 the Arrowcraft Shop or that I do ers do in the homes, all is part of my best to keep that place until the work of the Center. There is the last knowing that if they once never a time if you are in Sugar-get there they won't see anything lands that you are not on duty or else on the place. subject to call but there is a de-light in coming close to the life of the community and a charm in having your own little family. In fact, since the Gatlinburg family has grown to such proportions we could not get along at all without .the Sugarlands home to slip off to every now and then. Mrs. Dowell is still housemother but the good meals she prepares for the two teachers are only part of her many duties. She helps with community activities and is always at home" to the many callers who drop in day after day for advice or for friendly chat. Eva Hathaway is principal and is successfully teaching the four upper grades. This year three of her pupils completed the eighth grade and will come to Gatlinburg for their first year high school work. Although it is only five miles away, we want them to stay in the dormitory for the training and experience they will receive. Emily Burton, our "veteran" primary teacher, had to leave us in November because of the serious illness and death of her father ; her place was taken by Lois Brewer, a Knoxville girl. Mary Rachel Armstrong had classes in home economics during the year. Frances Moore had clinics at the cottage and also supplemented Mary Rachel's course with the girls by giving practical lessons in home hygiene and care of the sick. Nothing has appealed to the boys more than the shop work Eva has given them. A few tools and some old planks that looked to me good for nothing were Wood Working Shop Even though Mr. Mattil has ceased to be on the pay roll he is still a valuable member of the staff. This year the wood working shop has been almost as popular a 'place with visitors as the Craft Shop. The clubs well know the crickets, sconces, bookshelves, and book ends that are made here but not all have seen the cherry and black walnut furniture that is being made. The training given the men who work in the shop is most valuable and the school appreciates Mr. Mattil carrying this. Many feel it should be a part of the school and it really is in almost every way but financially. With Mr. Mattil's interest in the school and the years he has been here it is no wonder we still call on him for all kinds of extras and he always gladly gives his time, as in former years. Emma Harper Turner Center Sugarlands Extension work has a real appeal, as any one of the special teachers or those in the Sugarlands will tell you. The Sugarlands family is a happy, congenial, and efficient one. School work must be the important part of the program but it is not all. The Sunday School that meets in the schoolhouse, the women who come to the cottage for their rug work, sewing, or just friendly calls, the visiting the teach42 The September ARROW the only equipment but things were made regardless. Later in the year through two Pi Phis who were interested in the school, more tools were gotten and darkness came many a night before the boys were ready to leave the little shop in the schoolhouse. During the summer the school girls have continued to have Sun-day School never failing to feel the sweeping of the schoolhouse after the meeting to be as important as the benediction. Even though the property will eventually be turned over to the Park our work will continue as long as there is need for it; and with the return of Mrs. Dowell, Eva, and Emily our Center will continue to develop. One of the happiest events of last year was the initiation of Emily Burton into Pi Beta Phi. Emily was called home early in November and the night before she left fourteen Tennessee A girls came to Gatlinburg from Chattanooga to take her into -their chap-ter. It was all so sudden, so thrilling and so wonderfully fitting for the twelve years Emily has been here have endeared her to all and the Arrow surely is being worn close to a loyal little Pi Phi heart. Pi Beta , Phi School is actively interested in the organization and development of a Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. In December, 1929, a meeting was held at the Spinning Wheel, Asheville, North Carolina, at which definite steps were taken toward the formation of the Guild, standards for membership, etc. Plans were also laid for an exhibit at the South-ern Mountain Conference the following March. The exhibits from more than thirty centers were proofof the varied and high grade handicraft work being done in the South-ern Mountains. There has been practically no visiting of other schools during the year by any members of the staff. This has been decidedly a "stay-at-home" year but we have tried to keep in touch with the larger program through attending the annual Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, through the Guild meeting in Asheville in December, and by the visitors from other centers who have come to us During the year many requests have come to us for more publicity material to be used by clubs and chapters and this need we should meet this summer. In the fall a set of kodak pictures was sent each council and committee member and each province president and vice president; these were easy to carry and seemed to meet with good response. The slides and films have been used but little during the year. The Gatlinburg News has been sent to about four hundred Pi Phis and perhaps two hundred local people. Letters from the school have been sent to Settlement School Chairman, national officers, and Pi Phis on the Gatlinburg News mailing list. Last summer a new septic tank was installed for the girls' dormitory and Stuart cottage, the heating and plumbing system in the girls' dormitory was reworked, and the teachers' cottage painted. This summer it is necessary to paint the grade school building, the barn, and freshen up some of the interiors. A new storeroom for groceries and for wood and coal must be built as well as a wacron The September ARROW and toolhouse. During the spring more native shrubbery was set out around the Sugarland's cottage and the Gatlinburg buildings; we have tried to improve the premises and have been rewarded by being told that we do have more of an air of refinement. There are a number of acres of woodland on our place and since the windstorm of a year ago and the chestnut blight that has been working for several years we find we have much dead timber. This should be gotten out while it is still good for lumber and we plan to have it logged and sawed this fall. Enough can be sold to pay this billbut we would not be wise to le all go. Seasoned lumber is alw needed about the place and thb the last chestnut that we will e have. In closing this, my twelfth nual report, I want to again expl my sincere appreciation for loyal support that is always gi' by the fraternity. The work in C linburg is a joy and one that is o excelled by your personal inter and cooperation in everything. EVELYN BISHG (NoTE: Report of Treasurer Settlement School will be fol following Alumnae Club report: EDITOR) Minutes of Annual Meeting of Grand Council July 8 16 1930 THE annual meeting of the Grand Council was held at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, July 8-16, dates which were chosen partly because the Settlement School Committee was also in session, thus making it possible to fulfill the constitutional requirement that a member of the Council, in this instance the Grand President, shall meet with the committee during part of each annual committee meeting.

        The September ARROW pretty good hiker and not easily Iffed by weather. Once each month there has been meeting of the weavers and this both educational and social with 2. emphasis on the social. The )men take turns bringing and wing refreshments usually there e between twenty-five and thirty-'e present not including the bies. Alice McCarter has been the astant, helping Miss Strand when eded and weaving in the Arrow-aft Shop the remainder of the ne. Again the state has given sub-1ntial aid for this work. It comes rough the Smith-Hughes Voca-)nal Department and will amount is year to about $600. Arrowcraft Shop Miss Allen still in charge of the rrowcraft Shop, Veatress Parton id Alice McCarter able assistants, .izabeth Cooke in the office look-g after every penny that comes id goes and, last but not least, e splendid cooperation the clubs id chapters give, make a corn-nation that is bound to do busiss. The report of the Arrowcraft is year shows a business around 3,000 and we are proud to say at it has been carried on at a Zall profit. The aim of this deatment is primarily to provide Drk for people in this community at the same time training them make better and more beautiful ings. To carry the educational rd the business parts of this deirtment and come out even fiincially is really doing well. All is could never be accomplished ithout the wonderful support given by the Pi Phis all over the United States. No other school that I know of has this splendid market and I know no other could bring the personal contacts that means so much to those here who carry on the work. More than a hundred families are either self supporting or partially so because of the shop, the work they do is of a high grade and what all this means to them is evidenced in the better homes and general living conditions in so many places. Like the nurse the ones in this department come in close touch with the people and their pleasures and problems thus the influence and accomplishments are far more than can be seen in dollars and cents. It is surprising but true that in spite of hard times everywhere the Arrowcraft sales have held up and payments have been more prompt than in other years. This has meant much more than you can realize. All the year, as the checks came in, the money was immediately turned over to the people who were working so faithfully, and but for those checks, we could not have paid these people. The winter was unusually severe and other work scarce so I hardly know what the people would have done without their checks for weaving, baskets, and furniture. Already many of the club orders for next fall are in and by the first of August many orders will be shipped. This is a much more satisfactory way both for the clubs and the shop as Christmas time the stock is low and mails are slow. I do not need to add in closing that all visitors find their way to The September ARROW 41 the Arrowcraft Shop or that I do ers do in the homes, all is part of my best to keep that place until the work of the Center. There is the last knowing that if they once never a time if you are in Sugar-get there they won't see anything lands that you are not on duty or else on the place. subject to call but there is a de-light in coming close to the life of the community and a charm in having your own little family. In fact, since the Gatlinburg family has grown to such proportions we could not get along at all without .the Sugarlands home to slip off to every now and then. Mrs. Dowell is still housemother but the good meals she prepares for the two teachers are only part of her many duties. She helps with community activities and is always at home" to the many callers who drop in day after day for advice or for friendly chat. Eva Hathaway is principal and is successfully teaching the four upper grades. This year three of her pupils completed the eighth grade and will come to Gatlinburg for their first year high school work. Although it is only five miles away, we want them to stay in the dormitory for the training and experience they will receive. Emily Burton, our "veteran" primary teacher, had to leave us in November because of the serious illness and death of her father ; her place was taken by Lois Brewer, a Knoxville girl. Mary Rachel Armstrong had classes in home economics during the year. Frances Moore had clinics at the cottage and also supplemented Mary Rachel's course with the girls by giving practical lessons in home hygiene and care of the sick. Nothing has appealed to the boys more than the shop work Eva has given them. A few tools and some old planks that looked to me good for nothing were Wood Working Shop Even though Mr. Mattil has ceased to be on the pay roll he is still a valuable member of the staff. This year the wood working shop has been almost as popular a 'place with visitors as the Craft Shop. The clubs well know the crickets, sconces, bookshelves, and book ends that are made here but not all have seen the cherry and black walnut furniture that is being made. The training given the men who work in the shop is most valuable and the school appreciates Mr. Mattil carrying this. Many feel it should be a part of the school and it really is in almost every way but financially. With Mr. Mattil's interest in the school and the years he has been here it is no wonder we still call on him for all kinds of extras and he always gladly gives his time, as in former years. Emma Harper Turner Center Sugarlands Extension work has a real appeal, as any one of the special teachers or those in the Sugarlands will tell you. The Sugarlands family is a happy, congenial, and efficient one. School work must be the important part of the program but it is not all. The Sunday School that meets in the schoolhouse, the women who come to the cottage for their rug work, sewing, or just friendly calls, the visiting the teach42 The September ARROW the only equipment but things were made regardless. Later in the year through two Pi Phis who were interested in the school, more tools were gotten and darkness came many a night before the boys were ready to leave the little shop in the schoolhouse. During the summer the school girls have continued to have Sun-day School never failing to feel the sweeping of the schoolhouse after the meeting to be as important as the benediction. Even though the property will eventually be turned over to the Park our work will continue as long as there is need for it; and with the return of Mrs. Dowell, Eva, and Emily our Center will continue to develop. One of the happiest events of last year was the initiation of Emily Burton into Pi Beta Phi. Emily was called home early in November and the night before she left fourteen Tennessee A girls came to Gatlinburg from Chattanooga to take her into -their chap-ter. It was all so sudden, so thrilling and so wonderfully fitting for the twelve years Emily has been here have endeared her to all and the Arrow surely is being worn close to a loyal little Pi Phi heart. Pi Beta , Phi School is actively interested in the organization and development of a Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. In December, 1929, a meeting was held at the Spinning Wheel, Asheville, North Carolina, at which definite steps were taken toward the formation of the Guild, standards for membership, etc. Plans were also laid for an exhibit at the South-ern Mountain Conference the following March. The exhibits from more than thirty centers were proofof the varied and high grade handicraft work being done in the South-ern Mountains. There has been practically no visiting of other schools during the year by any members of the staff. This has been decidedly a "stay-at-home" year but we have tried to keep in touch with the larger program through attending the annual Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, through the Guild meeting in Asheville in December, and by the visitors from other centers who have come to us During the year many requests have come to us for more publicity material to be used by clubs and chapters and this need we should meet this summer. In the fall a set of kodak pictures was sent each council and committee member and each province president and vice president; these were easy to carry and seemed to meet with good response. The slides and films have been used but little during the year. The Gatlinburg News has been sent to about four hundred Pi Phis and perhaps two hundred local people. Letters from the school have been sent to Settlement School Chairman, national officers, and Pi Phis on the Gatlinburg News mailing list. Last summer a new septic tank was installed for the girls' dormitory and Stuart cottage, the heating and plumbing system in the girls' dormitory was reworked, and the teachers' cottage painted. This summer it is necessary to paint the grade school building, the barn, and freshen up some of the interiors. A new storeroom for groceries and for wood and coal must be built as well as a wacron The September ARROW and toolhouse. During the spring more native shrubbery was set out around the Sugarland's cottage and the Gatlinburg buildings; we have tried to improve the premises and have been rewarded by being told that we do have more of an air of refinement. There are a number of acres of woodland on our place and since the windstorm of a year ago and the chestnut blight that has been working for several years we find we have much dead timber. This should be gotten out while it is still good for lumber and we plan to have it logged and sawed this fall. Enough can be sold to pay this billbut we would not be wise to le all go. Seasoned lumber is alw needed about the place and thb the last chestnut that we will e have. In closing this, my twelfth nual report, I want to again expl my sincere appreciation for loyal support that is always gi' by the fraternity. The work in C linburg is a joy and one that is o excelled by your personal inter and cooperation in everything. EVELYN BISHG (NoTE: Report of Treasurer Settlement School will be fol following Alumnae Club report: EDITOR) Minutes of Annual Meeting of Grand Council July 8 16 1930 THE annual meeting of the Grand Council was held at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, July 8-16, dates which were chosen partly because the Settlement School Committee was also in session, thus making it possible to fulfill the constitutional requirement that a member of the Council, in this instance the Grand President, shall meet with the committee during part of each annual committee meeting. The Council greatly missed the Grand Treasurer who was excused because of an European trip. The reports from the chairmen of the standing committees were first read and studied, and from them the various recommendations were acted upon, and certain cies formulated.

        42 The September ARROW the only equipment but things were made regardless. Later in the year through two Pi Phis who were interested in the school, more tools were gotten and darkness came many a night before the boys were ready to leave the little shop in the schoolhouse. During the summer the school girls have continued to have Sun-day School never failing to feel the sweeping of the schoolhouse after the meeting to be as important as the benediction. Even though the property will eventually be turned over to the Park our work will continue as long as there is need for it; and with the return of Mrs. Dowell, Eva, and Emily our Center will continue to develop. One of the happiest events of last year was the initiation of Emily Burton into Pi Beta Phi. Emily was called home early in November and the night before she left fourteen Tennessee A girls came to Gatlinburg from Chattanooga to take her into -their chap-ter. It was all so sudden, so thrilling and so wonderfully fitting for the twelve years Emily has been here have endeared her to all and the Arrow surely is being worn close to a loyal little Pi Phi heart. Pi Beta , Phi School is actively interested in the organization and development of a Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. In December, 1929, a meeting was held at the Spinning Wheel, Asheville, North Carolina, at which definite steps were taken toward the formation of the Guild, standards for membership, etc. Plans were also laid for an exhibit at the South-ern Mountain Conference the following March. The exhibits from more than thirty centers were proofof the varied and high grade handicraft work being done in the South-ern Mountains. There has been practically no visiting of other schools during the year by any members of the staff. This has been decidedly a "stay-at-home" year but we have tried to keep in touch with the larger program through attending the annual Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, through the Guild meeting in Asheville in December, and by the visitors from other centers who have come to us During the year many requests have come to us for more publicity material to be used by clubs and chapters and this need we should meet this summer. In the fall a set of kodak pictures was sent each council and committee member and each province president and vice president; these were easy to carry and seemed to meet with good response. The slides and films have been used but little during the year. The Gatlinburg News has been sent to about four hundred Pi Phis and perhaps two hundred local people. Letters from the school have been sent to Settlement School Chairman, national officers, and Pi Phis on the Gatlinburg News mailing list. Last summer a new septic tank was installed for the girls' dormitory and Stuart cottage, the heating and plumbing system in the girls' dormitory was reworked, and the teachers' cottage painted. This summer it is necessary to paint the grade school building, the barn, and freshen up some of the interiors. A new storeroom for groceries and for wood and coal must be built as well as a wacron The September ARROW and toolhouse. During the spring more native shrubbery was set out around the Sugarland's cottage and the Gatlinburg buildings; we have tried to improve the premises and have been rewarded by being told that we do have more of an air of refinement. There are a number of acres of woodland on our place and since the windstorm of a year ago and the chestnut blight that has been working for several years we find we have much dead timber. This should be gotten out while it is still good for lumber and we plan to have it logged and sawed this fall. Enough can be sold to pay this billbut we would not be wise to le all go. Seasoned lumber is alw needed about the place and thb the last chestnut that we will e have. In closing this, my twelfth nual report, I want to again expl my sincere appreciation for loyal support that is always gi' by the fraternity. The work in C linburg is a joy and one that is o excelled by your personal inter and cooperation in everything. EVELYN BISHG (NoTE: Report of Treasurer Settlement School will be fol following Alumnae Club report: EDITOR) Minutes of Annual Meeting of Grand Council July 8 16 1930 THE annual meeting of the Grand Council was held at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, July 8-16, dates which were chosen partly because the Settlement School Committee was also in session, thus making it possible to fulfill the constitutional requirement that a member of the Council, in this instance the Grand President, shall meet with the committee during part of each annual committee meeting. The Council greatly missed the Grand Treasurer who was excused because of an European trip. The reports from the chairmen of the standing committees were first read and studied, and from them the various recommendations were acted upon, and certain cies formulated. With regard to extension for the coming year, the chairman of the Extension Committee was in-structed to impart the following Lion to the groups concerned: a member of Grand Council s: be sent, the coming year, to ins] Alpha Upsilon of the Universitl Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, C ada; that Beta Theta of Mari College, Marietta, Ohio, shall definitely discouraged because location; that Ero Alphian Michigan State College, East I. sing, Michigan, shall receive official visitor in the fall and the ture progress of the group in titioning Pi Beta Phi shall be termined by this visit; that remaining official visits shall made to Gamma Sigma of the I versify of South Carolina, Col bia, and that Grand Council s act further on the basis of the ports of all visiting officers; t following the receipt of a 1( from the group during the Cot meeting, Mu Lambda of Duke 1 118 The September ARROW Wport of Treasurer o Settlement School REPORT =.A"= CRAFT SIIOP July 1, 1929 to June 30, 1930 Income Baskets Sales m 1,971.70 Miscellaneous and Brooms Sales 1,344.70 Chairs Sales ....'

Good health of teachers and pupils has meant full teaching periods in the school, ensuring the maximum of work accomplished for the minimum of effort expended. The older boys and girls have stayed through till the closing of the high school, much to the satisfaction of everyone, even if it meant crowding in the dormitories and dining room. The extension of the agricultural and domestic science classes to new centers in the county has been a source of great pride to the school and to the committee. Both the agriculture and domestic science teachers have willingly put up with great discomforts and difficulties entailed by a winter of deep snow and long continued frost making impassable roads, in order to carry on the weekly classes. The weaving teacher has continued the good work started by her predecessor. The Health Center has had one of its busiest years. The nurse has never spared herself. When a call came from a remote home far from the passable roads she has crone by horseback or on foot to relieve suffering and to save life. 7 Arrowcraft Shop has been cont. ally busy, and a larger public ever acclaiming the beauty and d ability of its products. The Sug lands extension has continued excellent program in school ; community. Day by day, the w of the school .is more and mor part of the life of the commun For the details of the work, I , refer you to the splendid report the Director giving the particul of each department. Those who are watching growth of the school with close terest are most anxious to r what changes in the district an be observed through the entra of the new highway into the cl munity. Crowds of casual and thinking visitors whose appre, tion of the mountaineers and tl heritage is limited to a superfi glance that does not carry bey the attempts to meet the so-ca progress on its own grounds them by with inaccurate comme Already damage has been d through the expression of tl thoughtless impressions in ne paper and magazine. The me taineer himself is the first to sent the insinuations that are unfounded, and those of us know his sterling qualities splendid potentialities are righter ly indignant that such misre The September ARROW :ations should get abroad and a be believed by our own mem-. The mountaineer has much ear from the casual visitor who handicap him with a name ch is far different from actual s. We cannot be too emphatic crying that the integrity of mind body, the honesty of purpose life, the ambition and hard k that characterized the mouneers about Gatlinburg in the are still their outstanding qual This is true of the majority he people. Some there are, as all other communities, whose dards are low, and whose men-Nluipment is poor. These will afluenced by the element whose ing we deplore. The keen d of the average mountaineer, ever, can discern readily be-n true and false. Our school our influence are more needed y than ever before. Illiteracy .isappearing, but standards of ig are changing so quickly for e people now that there is a ket for their products, whether arm or loom, that it will take a e steadying influence to keep young people from placing uninfluence upon the material gs and so neglecting the vital n of life. There are still re-homes lost up the valleys and en on the mountain sides that very little nearer to the varied of the community than they twenty years ago. In them :rty and disease must be met conquered. Their children t receive education. Some pro-)n for daily remunerative work will be an outlet to natural in.-Ltion and talents should be pro-d. A glimpse into a world be-t their limited horizon should be afforded them. These things we can do through our school with its extension classes, its health promotion, and its community service. Throughout the year interesting and outstanding events at the school have made the reading of the Little Pigeon News, the Gatlinburg News, and Miss Evelyn's monthly reports to the clubs graphic in the extreme. The meeting of the province vice presidents with the committee at the school at the end of August was of great pleasure and mutual benefit. This has been reflected through-out the year in the increased interest of the clubs in the school. We were most regretful to lose Emily Burton from the staff of Sugarlands. Her going removed one who had served the school loyally for twelve years, and done pioneer work in both Gatlinburg and Sugarlands. Pi Phi has lost an exceptional teacher, but she has gained a very wonderful member, and we have hopes of her returning to us next year. Tennessee A came in full force to initiate Emily into their chapter before she left, and the initiation service at the Sugarlands cottage will long be re-membered for its beauty and impressiveness. Mattie Huff, one of the school's first pupils, and the daughter of two of our stanchest friends, came on the teaching staff as assistant to the principal. She has more than proved the value of the early work of the school. During the Christmas vacation two of our ex-pupils were married in the living room of the teachers' cottage, and the beautiful wedding caused a great stir among the staff and in the community. They were both working for the school, and continued their duties in the same The September ARROW 31 whole-hearted way. A play put on by the teachers, the regular Christmas entertainment with presents for all the children, the interschool basketball games by both boys' and girls' teams, the school fair in the fall with an attendance of at least 1,500, and Old Timers' Day in the spring, have made considerable social life in the school. Weekly movies through the summer have also added to the entertainment for old and young. These are shown in the auditorium of the Industrial Building. Our influence is not restricted to our own community and county but has spread through the state. Our director and teachers have been active in county teachers' meetings, in the Southern Handicraft Guild, the Women's Institutes, and the Mountain Workers' Conference, and all educational activities that are planning for the betterment of the Southern Highlander. Delegates have been sent and papers read at different conferences, so that our school has a recognized place among the educational institutions and influences of the southern mountains. The county and state recognize our value, and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture, and domestic science and weaving teaching. The financial depression which was nationwide this year has made very little difference in the income of the school. When an institution is dependent upon voluntary contributions, there is almost certainly the chance that during times of financial stringency it will suffer and suffer heavily. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School car I-led on successfully, and even forged ahead during the depressing war period. We are hoping that it will not need to stand still, nor go backward during this time of depression. We feel sure that our loyalty to the philanthropic achievement of which we are justly proud will enable us to sacrifice to the point that it shall not suffer. The school has been handicapped in the past through the slowness with which returns have been made in the fall and winter months. These are the months when the largest payments for living, salaries, insurance, etc., must be made, and we are indeed grateful to those who appreciate this, plan their benefits early, and make prompt returns. The indebtedness entailed through the building of the Indus-trial Building, and the installation of the central heating plant with its fine boilerhouse, weighs heavily on the committee. However the constant use to which it is put for school and community purposes proves without the shadow of a doubt that there is a real need for the building, and we are glad to assume this additional responsibility, feeling sure that the fraternity will uphold us in this justifiable expenditure and loan, and knowing that they will do all in their power to wipe out this debt as promptly as possible. The committee has functioned monthly, and I trust efficiently. The treasurer, Grace Post, began her term of office with the handicap of having missed the annual meeting, but has taken hold of the finances in a most gratifying way, and given largely of time and energy to mastering the details of her job. Blanche Curtis has again The September ARROW d the Little Pigeon News in st acceptable manner, and done necessary secretarial work of ommittee. Rebecca White has a stupendous piece of work ,rds interesting isolated alum-She sent out 965 letters to iso-. alumnae in towns where there more than three and less than Pi Phis, enclosing material would interest and help in .ding the gospel of the Settle-: School. Mrs. White also a letter to all chapters and to alumnae clubs of Gamma, Ep-., Zeta, and Theta provinces, )sing material for programs Settlement School meetings. Lddition many inquiries from Tiduals and clubs for informaregarding the school were fully and fully answered. The eration between Mrs. White the Central Office and the ince vice presidents was very with the result that worth e lists were made. These will f value in the followup work ned for next year. The other Lber of the committee, Helen le, has not yet had the oppor-:y of visiting the school, but entered upon her duties entail-:he work of publicity and manaent of the films and slides, great enthusiasm. She is ning for new information leaf-and sheets for next year, to the needs of the clubs which ask for quantities of brief statements about the school to distribute at benefit bridges, theater nights, etc. There has been very little demand for the films or slides, but such requests have been arranged for. The chairman of the committee appreciates in this her first year of office more deeply than she can express the unselfish service that each member of the committee is rendering. The work would in-deed have been appalling had not the ready response to each call been so willing, and the spirit of cooperation so gracious. To the director of the school she expresses her heartfelt gratitude for the patience which she has shown during her efforts to grasp the various du-ties of her office. To the members of Grand Council and the other officers of the fraternity, and in particular to our Grand President, she wishes to voice the thanks of her-self and her committee, for the careful oversight of the work of the school, and the helpful suggestions that have made the duties lighter. To all members of the fraternity, whose interest . makes possible the continuance of the school, hearty appreciation is given. To the friends of the school, old and new, who have helped in many ways, we are deeply grateful. EDITH H. GORDON The September ARROW Report of Director of the_.Pi Beta Phi Settlement School 33 THE report of the school for the year of 1929-30 is a contradictory one. In some respects it has been one of the easiest and most satisfactory in the history of the school in other ways it has been one of the most difficult. With the building program of the last three years completed a world of worries ceased. The excitement due to the establishment of the National Park has calmed down; the past year, too, was unusually free from epidemics and illnesses and in every way we were able to continue along a steady routine line. But in contrast to these conditions in Gatlinburg the year for the Committee has been one of unusual difficulties. All know that the past year has been a hard one all over the country and the school was bound to feel the financial depression as did everything else. The fall and winter months were very trying ones but our school was no worse off than many, many others. As fast as money did come bills and salaries were paid. After the holidays the contributions began to come in and although the end of the year finds the total a little below that of the previous year we feel that it is remarkably large considering the financial depression. If we have gone through such a trying period this well surely we can hold to our present program through another year. Word comes to us from the Government that some work will be started in the new National Park by July 1; no doubt the first stepswill be for fire protection for the forest fires during the early spring did much damage to the Park land. The Gatlinburg school will be little affected by the Park; many families, however, have moved out of the upper Sugarlands and it is certain that the teachers' cottage there will be purchased by the Park. This will not cause our work to cease for the Park will lease us the property as long as we have use for it in connection with the school. With good roads, modern hotels, and the publicity being given this section the number of tourists is increasing rapidly. The usual time given to Gatlinburg by them is a few hours and it is impossible in that time to more than catch a glimpse of the place, the people and the school.. Many times I feel the highway, the modern aspect of things along the way, and the more prosperous look of the country disillusions the visitors and causes them to leave with some of the romance destroyed and a feeling that our work here is done. But let me assure those who may feel this way that a bit longer visit will cause a change of heart. It is progress that has made the very changes that perhaps you are regretting. There are still many boys and girls, men and women needing what the school gives and surely there is no more reason for us to cease operations now than for the hundreds of other institutions that are accomplishing something to say, "we have done well, there-fore let us stop where we are."

School The more systematic and well organized a thing is the more difficult it is to give an adequate re-port of it. Many pupils have had perfect attendance for the year; scarcely any. problems of discipline have come up, no epidemics have upset the school, and the whole spirit has been of the best. Much credit should be given Mr. Over-ton for this for in the past three years he has been principal of the school it has shown steady development that has been most gratifying. The enrollment stays just about the same. That is to be expected as we cannot take more pupils in the dormitories than we already have and the day school would naturally vary little from year to year. The seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades are in the Industrial Building, as other classes in home economics, agriculture, and farm shop work, and weaving. Mr. Overton and Miss Blair have these four grades and the past year Mat-tie Huff has assisted by taking two classes and a study period. Miss Williams, Miss McCutchan, and Miss Brabson had the first six grades; these are in the old school building and it is much more satisfactory to have the younger pupils in one building and the older ones in another. Of course being less crowded is an-other great advantage. But the primary room it is necessary here The September ARROW 35 to carry the primer class through an entire year so Miss Brabson had primer, first, and second grades and many days half the attendance of the entire school was in her room. With the lower grades so large and the upper ones so small, it is difficult to come to any satisfactory arrangement. The coming year we will take the second grade into the room with the third and put the fourth, fifth, and sixth together. We know this will relieve the primary teacher and we hope will work out all right for the other grades. More time was spent in supervised play and the program worked out by Mr. Overton and Miss Mc-Cutchan net with a ready response from the pupils. The basketball season was a splendid one. Al-though our teams played four year high schools they were able to make a good showing, the interest was keen, and the training the boys and girls had in sportsman-ship was of the finest. Our great trouble in athletics is having to overwork the boys and girls. A hard game Saturday night after a full day's work in the fields or in the woods, or scrubbing floors or washing, is too much physical exertion, especially as we have such small teams it is impossible to do much substituting. A play was given in February by the faculty. The proceeds were used in building an addition to the stage in the auditorium. Because of a play given by the F.F.T. boys late in the term the high school play at close of school was omitted. Eight pupils received certificates for the completion of the second year high school and eight finished the eighth grade. The county reimburses us for the salaries of the grade teachers. So far we have never received any high school money but there is prospect of some for next year. While it may not be more than the tuition we receive from the pupils it will be cash and will come in regularly and will make it much easier on the boys and girls who are working their way through school. Mr. Overton has been president of the Sevier County Teachers' Association for the entire year and has been a great help in planning interesting and helpful meetings each month and in keeping alive interest among the teachers of the county. We regret losing Miss Williams and Mr. Overton from our school and county. No better way of judging the work done in our school can be found than that of watching its pupils after they have left us and gone to other institutions. This past year we have had four in Murphy Institute, three in Sevier County High, one in Townsend High, one in Pittman Center, one in Chilhowee Institute. Without exception these pupils have made good grades and their standing in the school has been of the best. Report of the school would be far from complete this year with-out reference being made to the library. The books were moved from the hall of the old school building to one of the classrooms that had been vacated when the up-per grades moved to the new building. Two large reading tables were put in the room also. Miss McCullough, librarian from Evansville, Indiana, gave this work a fine start during the time she was 36 The September ARROW vacationing here in August and the interest did not lag during the year. Mr. Overton made calls for "Library Day" to which the teachers responded and new books were catalogued and old ones given to other schools or thrown away. Boxes of books, including the hymn books that had been in use for seventeen years, went to five different schools. All during the year books have come in as a result of this campaign and the library is in very good condition. There are about thirty-five hundred volumes of well selected and readable books and they are being used in both Gatlinburg and Sugarlands. Home Economics Mary Rachel Armstrong, a University of Tennessee graduate, has been our new home economics teacher and has given full time to that work. Each morning is taken up with high school home economic classes. The afternoons are given to community work. Each afternoon was spent in a different locality and the means of reaching these places was subject to change, depending on weather and roads. If the Ford or Chevrolet refused to go over Grindstone Mountain, stout boots and a willing spirit carried her the rest of the way. The classes were composed of people from children to middle aged women. In these less formal classes it is always difficult to tell just what is accomplished. Contacts are kept with the country people and that in itself is worth a great deal. The state will again reimburse us for. these classes and we feel that with the cooperation of the state and the interest taken by the local peoplewe should continue the classes if possible. Agriculture and Farm Shop The Smith-Hughes agriculture and farm shop has been carried on more along the lines of a few years ago. Our new teacher, Don Smith, started to work the first of July by getting acquainted with the community and its problems and projects. I am sure that the first two months he decided that he had come as a veterinarian instead of teacher for the calls to see sick horses and cows seemed world without end; perhaps it was as well to see things at their busiest and worst right at the start. The work in agriculture corresponds to that in home economics in that the mornings are spent in school and the afternoons in different communities. There have been classes in five different places, the territory extending from Banner, three miles away to wear's Valley eighteen miles distant. Like Miss Armstrong, Mr. Smith has let weather decide his means of transportation for roads have been bad much of the time. With each Gatlinburg agriculture boy carrying a home project that must be supervised and all these boys in other communities to look after one can readily see the pro-gram day by day is a full one and not easily kept up with. The F.F.T. took on new life and in the early spring the boys put on a play. The object of this was to raise enough money to send two delegates to the state convention at Nashville and Pi Phi was represented there by two young Future Farmers. The shop work is of a practical The September ARROW kind from fly traps to farm gates and from birdhouses to porch swings. While we try hard not to let. the repair or farm work take too much of the agriculture teacher's time the stock we have on the place and the repairing of gates, etc., furnish many a practical lesson for the school boys. Last year we added to our list of stock a few sheep and this year the new project will be bees. Dormitories The outstanding work of the school, according to many, is that done in connection with the boys and girls in the dormitories. Each year we have from twenty to twenty-five boys and girls living here who are ready for either eighth grade or high school but who live too far from any school giving those grades to make walking possible. There has to be a careful selection as we have many more applications than we have places. We do not plan to take pupils who could go to other places and pay board or who live near any other school. Only those willing and needing to work are considered. The past year we rented for the boys' dormitory a small cottage near the school. It was really too small for the family that had occupied it, six children and the mother and father, but into the same house we put one teacher, the housemother, and from ten to thirteen boys. Only two rooms had heat so during the winter all had to collect into these two small rooms for study hours and for all time they were in the house and awake. It was not a very satisfactory arrangement but the bestwe could do and the way we continue next year. The girls' cottage is qtlite fortable except for the room. This is badly overcrc as forty-five of us take our in this house. The past yet were compelled to use the room for dining room. No room in a house or a dorn makes the situation far from and we are planning our b( provide one for another yeas I have told so many, many the kind of work the boys and do I know you can picture The thing impossible to pictul less one has been here is the life they lead and the joy th( out of having their "leisure" that usually is such a proble: taken up.

Too much credit cannot be given her for the careful planning she has done this year to keep our expenditures as low as possible and make every penny count. Sevier County Health Unit The Sevier County Health Unit has been a wide-awake organization this past year and we are glad to be a part of it. The unit consists of a county health physician, a sanitary officer, an office clerk, a county nurse, the nurse at Pittman Center, a school eighteen miles from Sevierville and ours at Gatlinburg. Our connection with the unit continues to be rather puzzling to many. It really means that Pitt-man and our school, with the county court, pool a certain amount so that that sum can be matched by state and federal funds. The amount we put in is equal to that we would pay our nurse. We send our check to the state department and they pay the nurse. It may sound complicated but it is not and this cooperation means a unit for the county that would be impossible otherwise. In addition to the help given in school examinations and numerous other places the county health physician sees that we are supplied with vaccines and many other sup-plies free of charge, including health pamphlets and literature. The state also pays for the upkeep and depreciation of the nurse's car, saving us an expense that would be quite an item. Health Frances Moore has had a tremendously busy year. She has carried out an extensive and thorough school program that has touched The September ARROW 39 practically every school in the eleventh district. Children were weighed and measured, and in most cases the county health physician gave a physical examination. A good many defects were corrected and the cooperation given by some of the county teachers was a joy. Classes in home hygiene and care of the sick were carried in connection with the home economics classes in Gatlinburg and Sugar-lands. Two classes for "little mothers" were held in Gatlinburg, one in Sugarlands and a mothers' class in Elkmont. Immunization clinics for typhoid, smallpox and dyptheria were held all over the district, more than 700 innoculations being completed. And babies this has. been a baby year: 162 visits made to mothers, 197 letters distributed, and 193 visits made to preschool children. Two tonsil clinics were held during the year. Several patients were in the hospital for from a day or two to four or five weeks, as a result of automobile accidents. The same dentist from Knoxville comes one Saturday each month. Numerous trips are made to Knoxville to take patients in for examinations and treatment. While there is much done in school and in groups there are many, many sick calls that must be answered and this past winter and spring have brought an unusual number of distressing cases. Whether the long, severe winter, the scarcity of work, or just more familiarity with the country brought these to our attention is more than I can say but the fact remains that day after day brought almost more than the nurse could stand. It is our policy to give lit-tle in the line of food or clothing but to try to help people to help themselves. The policy is right, we are sure, but it would take harder hearts than ours to see some of these conditions and then be able to enjoy thoroughly our good foods and warm beds. We were glad when warm weather and gardens came. The amount of work done in connection with the Health Center would be an impossibility without the valuable assistance of Lillie Reagan. She has been in the office long enough to be well acquainted with the work and that with her faithfulness makes her a most valuable assistant. Weaving Weaving teachers are scarce and when Miss Redding left us a year ago we feared we might have a long search for someone to take her place. We were fortunate though for just as I was leaving Oregon last summer after convention I heard of Miss Strand. She came to us in October and came with a thorough knowledge of weaving and also with a real love of the mountains and its people. The work of the department continued much as it had under Miss Redding. The seventh and eighth grade girls had a double period class each morning; the morning was also used for office work, the women calling for sup-plies and advice. Usually the afternoons were given over to the necessary trips to the various homes and these were many. All the Arroweraft things are made in the homes and must be carefully supervised. As most of these trips are made on foot one needs to be The September ARROW pretty good hiker and not easily Iffed by weather. Once each month there has been meeting of the weavers and this both educational and social with 2. emphasis on the social. The )men take turns bringing and wing refreshments usually there e between twenty-five and thirty-'e present not including the bies. Alice McCarter has been the astant, helping Miss Strand when eded and weaving in the Arrow-aft Shop the remainder of the ne. Again the state has given sub-1ntial aid for this work. It comes rough the Smith-Hughes Voca-)nal Department and will amount is year to about $600. Arrowcraft Shop Miss Allen still in charge of the rrowcraft Shop, Veatress Parton id Alice McCarter able assistants, .izabeth Cooke in the office look-g after every penny that comes id goes and, last but not least, e splendid cooperation the clubs id chapters give, make a corn-nation that is bound to do busiss. The report of the Arrowcraft is year shows a business around 3,000 and we are proud to say at it has been carried on at a Zall profit. The aim of this deatment is primarily to provide Drk for people in this community at the same time training them make better and more beautiful ings. To carry the educational rd the business parts of this deirtment and come out even fiincially is really doing well. All is could never be accomplished ithout the wonderful support given by the Pi Phis all over the United States. No other school that I know of has this splendid market and I know no other could bring the personal contacts that means so much to those here who carry on the work. More than a hundred families are either self supporting or partially so because of the shop, the work they do is of a high grade and what all this means to them is evidenced in the better homes and general living conditions in so many places. Like the nurse the ones in this department come in close touch with the people and their pleasures and problems thus the influence and accomplishments are far more than can be seen in dollars and cents. It is surprising but true that in spite of hard times everywhere the Arrowcraft sales have held up and payments have been more prompt than in other years. This has meant much more than you can realize. All the year, as the checks came in, the money was immediately turned over to the people who were working so faithfully, and but for those checks, we could not have paid these people. The winter was unusually severe and other work scarce so I hardly know what the people would have done without their checks for weaving, baskets, and furniture. Already many of the club orders for next fall are in and by the first of August many orders will be shipped. This is a much more satisfactory way both for the clubs and the shop as Christmas time the stock is low and mails are slow. I do not need to add in closing that all visitors find their way to The September ARROW 41 the Arrowcraft Shop or that I do ers do in the homes, all is part of my best to keep that place until the work of the Center. There is the last knowing that if they once never a time if you are in Sugar-get there they won't see anything lands that you are not on duty or else on the place. subject to call but there is a de-light in coming close to the life of the community and a charm in having your own little family. In fact, since the Gatlinburg family has grown to such proportions we could not get along at all without .the Sugarlands home to slip off to every now and then. Mrs. Dowell is still housemother but the good meals she prepares for the two teachers are only part of her many duties. She helps with community activities and is always at home" to the many callers who drop in day after day for advice or for friendly chat. Eva Hathaway is principal and is successfully teaching the four upper grades. This year three of her pupils completed the eighth grade and will come to Gatlinburg for their first year high school work. Although it is only five miles away, we want them to stay in the dormitory for the training and experience they will receive. Emily Burton, our "veteran" primary teacher, had to leave us in November because of the serious illness and death of her father ; her place was taken by Lois Brewer, a Knoxville girl. Mary Rachel Armstrong had classes in home economics during the year. Frances Moore had clinics at the cottage and also supplemented Mary Rachel's course with the girls by giving practical lessons in home hygiene and care of the sick. Nothing has appealed to the boys more than the shop work Eva has given them. A few tools and some old planks that looked to me good for nothing were Wood Working Shop Even though Mr. Mattil has ceased to be on the pay roll he is still a valuable member of the staff. This year the wood working shop has been almost as popular a 'place with visitors as the Craft Shop. The clubs well know the crickets, sconces, bookshelves, and book ends that are made here but not all have seen the cherry and black walnut furniture that is being made. The training given the men who work in the shop is most valuable and the school appreciates Mr. Mattil carrying this. Many feel it should be a part of the school and it really is in almost every way but financially. With Mr. Mattil's interest in the school and the years he has been here it is no wonder we still call on him for all kinds of extras and he always gladly gives his time, as in former years. Emma Harper Turner Center Sugarlands Extension work has a real appeal, as any one of the special teachers or those in the Sugarlands will tell you. The Sugarlands family is a happy, congenial, and efficient one. School work must be the important part of the program but it is not all. The Sunday School that meets in the schoolhouse, the women who come to the cottage for their rug work, sewing, or just friendly calls, the visiting the teach42 The September ARROW the only equipment but things were made regardless. Later in the year through two Pi Phis who were interested in the school, more tools were gotten and darkness came many a night before the boys were ready to leave the little shop in the schoolhouse. During the summer the school girls have continued to have Sun-day School never failing to feel the sweeping of the schoolhouse after the meeting to be as important as the benediction. Even though the property will eventually be turned over to the Park our work will continue as long as there is need for it; and with the return of Mrs. Dowell, Eva, and Emily our Center will continue to develop. One of the happiest events of last year was the initiation of Emily Burton into Pi Beta Phi. Emily was called home early in November and the night before she left fourteen Tennessee A girls came to Gatlinburg from Chattanooga to take her into -their chap-ter. It was all so sudden, so thrilling and so wonderfully fitting for the twelve years Emily has been here have endeared her to all and the Arrow surely is being worn close to a loyal little Pi Phi heart. Pi Beta , Phi School is actively interested in the organization and development of a Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild. In December, 1929, a meeting was held at the Spinning Wheel, Asheville, North Carolina, at which definite steps were taken toward the formation of the Guild, standards for membership, etc. Plans were also laid for an exhibit at the South-ern Mountain Conference the following March. The exhibits from more than thirty centers were proofof the varied and high grade handicraft work being done in the South-ern Mountains. There has been practically no visiting of other schools during the year by any members of the staff. This has been decidedly a "stay-at-home" year but we have tried to keep in touch with the larger program through attending the annual Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, through the Guild meeting in Asheville in December, and by the visitors from other centers who have come to us During the year many requests have come to us for more publicity material to be used by clubs and chapters and this need we should meet this summer. In the fall a set of kodak pictures was sent each council and committee member and each province president and vice president; these were easy to carry and seemed to meet with good response. The slides and films have been used but little during the year. The Gatlinburg News has been sent to about four hundred Pi Phis and perhaps two hundred local people. Letters from the school have been sent to Settlement School Chairman, national officers, and Pi Phis on the Gatlinburg News mailing list. Last summer a new septic tank was installed for the girls' dormitory and Stuart cottage, the heating and plumbing system in the girls' dormitory was reworked, and the teachers' cottage painted. This summer it is necessary to paint the grade school building, the barn, and freshen up some of the interiors. A new storeroom for groceries and for wood and coal must be built as well as a wacron The September ARROW and toolhouse. During the spring more native shrubbery was set out around the Sugarland's cottage and the Gatlinburg buildings; we have tried to improve the premises and have been rewarded by being told that we do have more of an air of refinement. There are a number of acres of woodland on our place and since the windstorm of a year ago and the chestnut blight that has been working for several years we find we have much dead timber. This should be gotten out while it is still good for lumber and we plan to have it logged and sawed this fall. Enough can be sold to pay this billbut we would not be wise to le all go. Seasoned lumber is alw needed about the place and thb the last chestnut that we will e have. In closing this, my twelfth nual report, I want to again expl my sincere appreciation for loyal support that is always gi' by the fraternity. The work in C linburg is a joy and one that is o excelled by your personal inter and cooperation in everything. EVELYN BISHG (NoTE: Report of Treasurer Settlement School will be fol following Alumnae Club report: EDITOR) Minutes of Annual Meeting of Grand Council July 8 16 1930 THE annual meeting of the Grand Council was held at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, July 8-16, dates which were chosen partly because the Settlement School Committee was also in session, thus making it possible to fulfill the constitutional requirement that a member of the Council, in this instance the Grand President, shall meet with the committee during part of each annual committee meeting. The Council greatly missed the Grand Treasurer who was excused because of an European trip. The reports from the chairmen of the standing committees were first read and studied, and from them the various recommendations were acted upon, and certain cies formulated. With regard to extension for the coming year, the chairman of the Extension Committee was in-structed to impart the following Lion to the groups concerned: a member of Grand Council s: be sent, the coming year, to ins] Alpha Upsilon of the Universitl Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, C ada; that Beta Theta of Mari College, Marietta, Ohio, shall definitely discouraged because location; that Ero Alphian Michigan State College, East I. sing, Michigan, shall receive official visitor in the fall and the ture progress of the group in titioning Pi Beta Phi shall be termined by this visit; that remaining official visits shall made to Gamma Sigma of the I versify of South Carolina, Col bia, and that Grand Council s act further on the basis of the ports of all visiting officers; t following the receipt of a 1( from the group during the Cot meeting, Mu Lambda of Duke 1 118 The September ARROW Wport of Treasurer o Settlement School REPORT =.A"= CRAFT SIIOP July 1, 1929 to June 30, 1930 Income Baskets Sales m 1,971.70 Miscellaneous and Brooms Sales 1,344.70 Chairs Sales ....'
