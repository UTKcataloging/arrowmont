ALBERT A. KOENIG, Auditor. ANNUAL REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE, The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee submits the following report to the Grand Council of II B (I): The past year has been an important one in the history of our School as its first decade of' service to the community of Gatlinburg was completed in February, 1922. Remembering the small beginnings of the school and the attitude of the people ten years ago, it is gratifying in the extreme to read the following in Miss Bishop's annual report to the committee. "The general feeling in the Burg, and I feel it is justified, is that the past year has been a very successful one. The school spirit has been fine, the grade of work has been well up to standard and we have felt that there was more community cooperation than ever Read Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency 30 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI before. I can't say too much for the hard, conscientious work done by all the teachers and workers here. When some visitors from a distance told me last fall that they did not believe there was a school in the United States with the splendid teachers we had I agreed with them fully." As we begin the second decade of our history it seems most fitting that the new policy of an annual meeting of the full committee at the school should be inaugurated. The account of the work of the past year was presented to the committee in three written reports from the Head Resident, School Principal, and the Nurse. Miss Bishop reported as follows: Four teachers for the grades and high school, one for weaving, the nurse, a house mother, head resident, "Aunt Lizzie" and "Jim" to look after the outdoor work, made up our staff for the year. Six lived in the teachers' cottage and seven took their meals there. Miss Nicholson lived in the dormitory, planned the meals and the housework and had supervision of the six little girls (all we could accommodate) who lived there. By enclosing the rear screened porch, added room was obtained for children who stayed there on stormy nights. No house on the school property was available for the boys so five of them were boarded in families in the community. This unsatisfactory arrangement was the best that could be managed but only two of the boys finished the term. During the year, the cottage bought from the Andrew Ogle family was remodeled, repaired, furnished and equipped as a center for the health work. Nurses and doctors who have visited it pronounce it wonderfully well adapted to the splendid work our nurse is doing. A fine saddle horse has lately been purchased for the use. of the nurse. Six looms are in operation in the school but the greatest achievement has been in interesting the women of the community in weaving. Six new looms have been installed in' various homes and the girls and women have many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible we are arranging to take their products and, if the weaving prospers as the basket business has done in the past few years, it should eventually be a source of income to the school. Noon lunch was served to the youngest children during the winter. A little unfinished room in the basement was simply equipped and used for this purpose. The children enjoyed the lunches and nearly everyone showed a gain in weight at the end of the term. They also took more pride in the lunch they brought from home when they knew they were going to bring it to the table. Our school building is now too small and with the present outlook for new pupils, we will need to consider enlarged school and resident quarters and provision for an adequate water supply both for buildings and for fire protection. Read Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL C011IMITTEE 31 School opened August 15, 1921, with one hundred pupils including fourteen in high school. Attendance was more regular during the year and spirit good. The total enrollment for the year was one hundred and twenty-five. More than twenty-five additional came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed, but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had' so much better opportunities and instruction, proved too much for nearly all of them. However, in spite of the fact that school was in session until April 1, there were more than seventy-five who took the final examinations. Writing of the problems which came with this large influx of new pupils in the middle of the school year, Miss Helen Chew, the principal, said as follows: "To provide for these newcomers, especially those who have come at Christmas time, brings several problems, the housing proposition, more space, and an additional teacher. The first is possibly the most crying need, especially for the boys. This year we had six boys living out among the people. This gave us very little opportunity to care for them outside of school hours although Miss Evelyn very forcefully impressed their responsibility upon those* in whose homes they were staying. "Conditions in many mountain homes are not very encouraging for study and the work .of only one of the six was passing. Our man teacher has lived at the hotel, taking two of his meals at our house. This limited his relation with the boys upon whom he could have exerted a splendid influence, if brought together under dormitory conditions. Parents want more supervision for their boys if they are trusting them to an institution. It is proper guidance out of school that most boys need. "Most of the children entering' after Christmas, enter the middle grades, and during a certain time Miss Ditmar's room was too crowded for one teacher. We have suggested that a new arrangement be made in the grades, placing the first, second, and primer classes under one teacher, third, fourth and fifth with another, leaving the high school alone; this gives three grades to each teacher instead of four. To do this a new grade teacher would be necessary. This is advisable because this year we could not meet the needs of the in-coming pupils at Christmas time because of lack of space and classes suitable for their progress. Though not entirely, this can account for our not being able to hold many of them. "This increased enrollment means more class room also. Our school house is ideal for a small school but any growth makes it unsatisfactory; first, its size, and second, the noise which the thin partitions between the three large rooms make unavoidable. The Read Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI irk in the middle of these three rooms practically must stop at times, ,til certain activities in other rooms are over. "The need of more practical work as agriculture, cooking, sewing very apparent. Aside from the weaving, this side of the work has ^t developed in proportion to the other departments. These bjects have been taught but not systematically and practically. "Nine of our best pupils finished second year of high school ; most whom are too young, their parents feel, to leave home. In losing em from school we are taking the very heart and character from the per department. Some will continue their education but many ad the sum of their opportunities with us. Although the policy of .e school has been to specialize in the lower grades, yet to my mind e time has come to take a step forward and the people are asking it." Phyllis Higinbotham, our nurse, the only resident nurse in Sevier ounty, presented a most interesting report. During the year she s made a total of 994 visits including 346 visits to school children ad 98 office visits. One hundred and sixty-one cases have been .eated. When it is considered that most of these visits have been .ade on horseback over roads otherwise impassable, and many of iem on foot, the figures have an added meaning. Miss Higinbotham has assisted the doctor at two clinics for eye. nose and throat, held at our Jennie Nicol Memorial, and has operated with the doctors sent to study hookworm conditions, and ) treat the same. She gives high praise to the local doctors "who ave been most helpful and loyal, and have often made trips at great ersonal inconvenience, and more cost than reward." The members of the committee who were given definite duties by ae acting chairman last November, reported on their special work. iss Miller told of her activities on the endowment plan and methods sed to help active chapters in planning programs for meetings on ae Settlement School. Mrs. Curtis reported on ways and means for arning money suggested to the clubs and reported by the same. lrs. Rugg gave a brief explanation of her work for publicity and fiss Stuart explained financial matters in detail in connection with er report. Mrs. Dowell, recently appointed member, gave valuable reformation and suggestions as the result of her residence at the ahool during the past year. The sessions of the committee meeting were devoted to an intensive Ludy of the immediate and future problems of our school and a umber ,of recommendations to Grand Council will be presented as a ~ngible result. The acting chairman found it impossible to make the usual emi-annual visit to the School during school session but profited y a conference with the head resident and two members of the com Zead Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE 33 mittee early in the year. Miss Stuart's visit to Gatlinburg during the winter was most helpful. Mrs. Rugg spent the week previous to the committee meeting at the school inspecting the property, consulting with members of the local advisory board and county school officials and obtaining full information concerning our immediate needs. The committee greatly appreciates the spirit of cooperation shown by county school 'officials who came from Sevierville at great in-convenience to discuss problems of the school district. Conference-with members of the local advisory board has also been most helpful. The formal opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial and dedication of the tablet marking the building is the outstanding feature of the meeting. It is another red-letter day in the history of our work in Gatlinburg. The acting chairman wishes to express her appreciation of the loyalty and cooperation of the members of the committee and the Settlement School Staff during the year. Respectfully submitted, SARAH POMEROY RUGG, Acting Chairman.

IEPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION AGENCY 't has now been nine years since the first contribution was made to Settlement School from the Magazine Agency. In that time the 11 amount contributed has been $1,940.06. the largest amount for any year ($476.50) was sent in 1921. is past year the returns have not been so large, the amount being 1-5.11. This is accounted for by the economic pressure of the sent time. [n the coming year, however, we plan for greater activity than !r before, and we can expect returns, both because business con-ions are better, and because magazine prices are down to the pre-r level. Duilists show 400 subscribers during 1921-22. This, of course )resents many more subscriptions. Most of these have come from lividuals, and we wish to thank each and every one of them. Several clubs and chapters have contributed through their rep ad Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency REPORT ..OF SUBSCRIPTION AGENCY 39 resentatives, and to these we are most grateful. We hope that many more will cooperate in this way. Any clubs or chapters desiring a quantity of price lists will, be supplied upon request. Many reasons are given for not sending subscriptions to us: The most important one is that a subscriber has for years been sub-scribing through some other worthy agent dependent upon this business for a living. We recognize this reason as sound and sufficient, but we wish to make a suggestion. If you really wish to help the Settlement School, send us at least one subscription. This one will not greatly reduce the profit of your present agent and it will add a little to ours. We perhaps have stressed this point a great deal but it is because we are continually confronted with it and we hope we have found a solution satisfactory to all concerned., Please note the following: 1. Our agency furnishes every magazine and periodical published, domestic and foreign. 2. Renewals count the same as new subscriptions. 3. Please allow sufficient time for filling orders from two to three weeks. 4. "Club" rates are offered. 5. "Special" offers made by publishers can be ordered through the Agency. 6. Discounts are allowed to libraries. 7. Price lists sent and estimates and information are gladly furnished. Subscriptions received at any time all through the year. g. Many magazines make special rates on Christmas gift orders and send gift cards to the recipients. Please send such orders early. lo. Since publishers will not accept orders from agents unless accompanied by proper remittance, we must ask you to send remittince with the order making check or money order payable to B. G. Reisinger. We are doing a big work at Gatlinburg, and big work requires big money. You can contribute a part of it by sending us your magazine subscriptions. The officers . of the fraternity stand back of this enterprise and they are going to bring it to your attention again this season because they realize its possibilities if given adequate support. Again we thank all who have given their support in the past, and ask your continued patronage, and we anticipate many new subscribers. The Agency stands ready to serve you, and through you, our Settlement School. BLANCHE G. REISINGER, Maryland A, 235 E. Lafayette Ave., Baltimore, Md.

IEPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION AGENCY 't has now been nine years since the first contribution was made to Settlement School from the Magazine Agency. In that time the 11 amount contributed has been $1,940.06. the largest amount for any year ($476.50) was sent in 1921. is past year the returns have not been so large, the amount being 1-5.11. This is accounted for by the economic pressure of the sent time. [n the coming year, however, we plan for greater activity than !r before, and we can expect returns, both because business con-ions are better, and because magazine prices are down to the pre-r level. Duilists show 400 subscribers during 1921-22. This, of course )resents many more subscriptions. Most of these have come from lividuals, and we wish to thank each and every one of them. Several clubs and chapters have contributed through their rep ad Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency REPORT ..OF SUBSCRIPTION AGENCY 39 resentatives, and to these we are most grateful. We hope that many more will cooperate in this way. Any clubs or chapters desiring a quantity of price lists will, be supplied upon request. Many reasons are given for not sending subscriptions to us: The most important one is that a subscriber has for years been sub-scribing through some other worthy agent dependent upon this business for a living. We recognize this reason as sound and sufficient, but we wish to make a suggestion. If you really wish to help the Settlement School, send us at least one subscription. This one will not greatly reduce the profit of your present agent and it will add a little to ours. We perhaps have stressed this point a great deal but it is because we are continually confronted with it and we hope we have found a solution satisfactory to all concerned., Please note the following: 1. Our agency furnishes every magazine and periodical published, domestic and foreign. 2. Renewals count the same as new subscriptions. 3. Please allow sufficient time for filling orders from two to three weeks. 4. "Club" rates are offered. 5. "Special" offers made by publishers can be ordered through the Agency. 6. Discounts are allowed to libraries. 7. Price lists sent and estimates and information are gladly furnished. Subscriptions received at any time all through the year. g. Many magazines make special rates on Christmas gift orders and send gift cards to the recipients. Please send such orders early. lo. Since publishers will not accept orders from agents unless accompanied by proper remittance, we must ask you to send remittince with the order making check or money order payable to B. G. Reisinger. We are doing a big work at Gatlinburg, and big work requires big money. You can contribute a part of it by sending us your magazine subscriptions. The officers . of the fraternity stand back of this enterprise and they are going to bring it to your attention again this season because they realize its possibilities if given adequate support. Again we thank all who have given their support in the past, and ask your continued patronage, and we anticipate many new subscribers. The Agency stands ready to serve you, and through you, our Settlement School. BLANCHE G. REISINGER, Maryland A, 235 E. Lafayette Ave., Baltimore, Md.

        THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI irk in the middle of these three rooms practically must stop at times, ,til certain activities in other rooms are over. "The need of more practical work as agriculture, cooking, sewing very apparent. Aside from the weaving, this side of the work has ^t developed in proportion to the other departments. These bjects have been taught but not systematically and practically. "Nine of our best pupils finished second year of high school ; most whom are too young, their parents feel, to leave home. In losing em from school we are taking the very heart and character from the per department. Some will continue their education but many ad the sum of their opportunities with us. Although the policy of .e school has been to specialize in the lower grades, yet to my mind e time has come to take a step forward and the people are asking it." Phyllis Higinbotham, our nurse, the only resident nurse in Sevier ounty, presented a most interesting report. During the year she s made a total of 994 visits including 346 visits to school children ad 98 office visits. One hundred and sixty-one cases have been .eated. When it is considered that most of these visits have been .ade on horseback over roads otherwise impassable, and many of iem on foot, the figures have an added meaning. Miss Higinbotham has assisted the doctor at two clinics for eye. nose and throat, held at our Jennie Nicol Memorial, and has operated with the doctors sent to study hookworm conditions, and ) treat the same. She gives high praise to the local doctors "who ave been most helpful and loyal, and have often made trips at great ersonal inconvenience, and more cost than reward." The members of the committee who were given definite duties by ae acting chairman last November, reported on their special work. iss Miller told of her activities on the endowment plan and methods sed to help active chapters in planning programs for meetings on ae Settlement School. Mrs. Curtis reported on ways and means for arning money suggested to the clubs and reported by the same. lrs. Rugg gave a brief explanation of her work for publicity and fiss Stuart explained financial matters in detail in connection with er report. Mrs. Dowell, recently appointed member, gave valuable reformation and suggestions as the result of her residence at the ahool during the past year. The sessions of the committee meeting were devoted to an intensive Ludy of the immediate and future problems of our school and a umber ,of recommendations to Grand Council will be presented as a ~ngible result. The acting chairman found it impossible to make the usual emi-annual visit to the School during school session but profited y a conference with the head resident and two members of the com Zead Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE 33 mittee early in the year. Miss Stuart's visit to Gatlinburg during the winter was most helpful. Mrs. Rugg spent the week previous to the committee meeting at the school inspecting the property, consulting with members of the local advisory board and county school officials and obtaining full information concerning our immediate needs. The committee greatly appreciates the spirit of cooperation shown by county school 'officials who came from Sevierville at great in-convenience to discuss problems of the school district. Conference-with members of the local advisory board has also been most helpful. The formal opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial and dedication of the tablet marking the building is the outstanding feature of the meeting. It is another red-letter day in the history of our work in Gatlinburg. The acting chairman wishes to express her appreciation of the loyalty and cooperation of the members of the committee and the Settlement School Staff during the year.

ALBERT A. KOENIG, Auditor. ANNUAL REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE, The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee submits the following report to the Grand Council of II B (I): The past year has been an important one in the history of our School as its first decade of' service to the community of Gatlinburg was completed in February, 1922. Remembering the small beginnings of the school and the attitude of the people ten years ago, it is gratifying in the extreme to read the following in Miss Bishop's annual report to the committee. "The general feeling in the Burg, and I feel it is justified, is that the past year has been a very successful one. The school spirit has been fine, the grade of work has been well up to standard and we have felt that there was more community cooperation than ever Read Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency 30 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI before. I can't say too much for the hard, conscientious work done by all the teachers and workers here. When some visitors from a distance told me last fall that they did not believe there was a school in the United States with the splendid teachers we had I agreed with them fully." As we begin the second decade of our history it seems most fitting that the new policy of an annual meeting of the full committee at the school should be inaugurated. The account of the work of the past year was presented to the committee in three written reports from the Head Resident, School Principal, and the Nurse. Miss Bishop reported as follows: Four teachers for the grades and high school, one for weaving, the nurse, a house mother, head resident, "Aunt Lizzie" and "Jim" to look after the outdoor work, made up our staff for the year. Six lived in the teachers' cottage and seven took their meals there. Miss Nicholson lived in the dormitory, planned the meals and the housework and had supervision of the six little girls (all we could accommodate) who lived there. By enclosing the rear screened porch, added room was obtained for children who stayed there on stormy nights. No house on the school property was available for the boys so five of them were boarded in families in the community. This unsatisfactory arrangement was the best that could be managed but only two of the boys finished the term. During the year, the cottage bought from the Andrew Ogle family was remodeled, repaired, furnished and equipped as a center for the health work. Nurses and doctors who have visited it pronounce it wonderfully well adapted to the splendid work our nurse is doing. A fine saddle horse has lately been purchased for the use. of the nurse. Six looms are in operation in the school but the greatest achievement has been in interesting the women of the community in weaving. Six new looms have been installed in' various homes and the girls and women have many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible we are arranging to take their products and, if the weaving prospers as the basket business has done in the past few years, it should eventually be a source of income to the school. Noon lunch was served to the youngest children during the winter. A little unfinished room in the basement was simply equipped and used for this purpose. The children enjoyed the lunches and nearly everyone showed a gain in weight at the end of the term. They also took more pride in the lunch they brought from home when they knew they were going to bring it to the table. Our school building is now too small and with the present outlook for new pupils, we will need to consider enlarged school and resident quarters and provision for an adequate water supply both for buildings and for fire protection. Read Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL C011IMITTEE 31 School opened August 15, 1921, with one hundred pupils including fourteen in high school. Attendance was more regular during the year and spirit good. The total enrollment for the year was one hundred and twenty-five. More than twenty-five additional came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed, but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had' so much better opportunities and instruction, proved too much for nearly all of them. However, in spite of the fact that school was in session until April 1, there were more than seventy-five who took the final examinations. Writing of the problems which came with this large influx of new pupils in the middle of the school year, Miss Helen Chew, the principal, said as follows: "To provide for these newcomers, especially those who have come at Christmas time, brings several problems, the housing proposition, more space, and an additional teacher. The first is possibly the most crying need, especially for the boys. This year we had six boys living out among the people. This gave us very little opportunity to care for them outside of school hours although Miss Evelyn very forcefully impressed their responsibility upon those* in whose homes they were staying. "Conditions in many mountain homes are not very encouraging for study and the work .of only one of the six was passing. Our man teacher has lived at the hotel, taking two of his meals at our house. This limited his relation with the boys upon whom he could have exerted a splendid influence, if brought together under dormitory conditions. Parents want more supervision for their boys if they are trusting them to an institution. It is proper guidance out of school that most boys need. "Most of the children entering' after Christmas, enter the middle grades, and during a certain time Miss Ditmar's room was too crowded for one teacher. We have suggested that a new arrangement be made in the grades, placing the first, second, and primer classes under one teacher, third, fourth and fifth with another, leaving the high school alone; this gives three grades to each teacher instead of four. To do this a new grade teacher would be necessary. This is advisable because this year we could not meet the needs of the in-coming pupils at Christmas time because of lack of space and classes suitable for their progress. Though not entirely, this can account for our not being able to hold many of them. "This increased enrollment means more class room also. Our school house is ideal for a small school but any growth makes it unsatisfactory; first, its size, and second, the noise which the thin partitions between the three large rooms make unavoidable. The Read Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI irk in the middle of these three rooms practically must stop at times, ,til certain activities in other rooms are over. "The need of more practical work as agriculture, cooking, sewing very apparent. Aside from the weaving, this side of the work has ^t developed in proportion to the other departments. These bjects have been taught but not systematically and practically. "Nine of our best pupils finished second year of high school ; most whom are too young, their parents feel, to leave home. In losing em from school we are taking the very heart and character from the per department. Some will continue their education but many ad the sum of their opportunities with us. Although the policy of .e school has been to specialize in the lower grades, yet to my mind e time has come to take a step forward and the people are asking it." Phyllis Higinbotham, our nurse, the only resident nurse in Sevier ounty, presented a most interesting report. During the year she s made a total of 994 visits including 346 visits to school children ad 98 office visits. One hundred and sixty-one cases have been .eated. When it is considered that most of these visits have been .ade on horseback over roads otherwise impassable, and many of iem on foot, the figures have an added meaning. Miss Higinbotham has assisted the doctor at two clinics for eye. nose and throat, held at our Jennie Nicol Memorial, and has operated with the doctors sent to study hookworm conditions, and ) treat the same. She gives high praise to the local doctors "who ave been most helpful and loyal, and have often made trips at great ersonal inconvenience, and more cost than reward." The members of the committee who were given definite duties by ae acting chairman last November, reported on their special work. iss Miller told of her activities on the endowment plan and methods sed to help active chapters in planning programs for meetings on ae Settlement School. Mrs. Curtis reported on ways and means for arning money suggested to the clubs and reported by the same. lrs. Rugg gave a brief explanation of her work for publicity and fiss Stuart explained financial matters in detail in connection with er report. Mrs. Dowell, recently appointed member, gave valuable reformation and suggestions as the result of her residence at the ahool during the past year. The sessions of the committee meeting were devoted to an intensive Ludy of the immediate and future problems of our school and a umber ,of recommendations to Grand Council will be presented as a ~ngible result. The acting chairman found it impossible to make the usual emi-annual visit to the School during school session but profited y a conference with the head resident and two members of the com Zead Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE 33 mittee early in the year. Miss Stuart's visit to Gatlinburg during the winter was most helpful. Mrs. Rugg spent the week previous to the committee meeting at the school inspecting the property, consulting with members of the local advisory board and county school officials and obtaining full information concerning our immediate needs. The committee greatly appreciates the spirit of cooperation shown by county school 'officials who came from Sevierville at great in-convenience to discuss problems of the school district. Conference-with members of the local advisory board has also been most helpful. The formal opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial and dedication of the tablet marking the building is the outstanding feature of the meeting. It is another red-letter day in the history of our work in Gatlinburg. The acting chairman wishes to express her appreciation of the loyalty and cooperation of the members of the committee and the Settlement School Staff during the year. Respectfully submitted, SARAH POMEROY RUGG, Acting Chairman.

IEPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION AGENCY 't has now been nine years since the first contribution was made to Settlement School from the Magazine Agency. In that time the 11 amount contributed has been $1,940.06. the largest amount for any year ($476.50) was sent in 1921. is past year the returns have not been so large, the amount being 1-5.11. This is accounted for by the economic pressure of the sent time. [n the coming year, however, we plan for greater activity than !r before, and we can expect returns, both because business con-ions are better, and because magazine prices are down to the pre-r level. Duilists show 400 subscribers during 1921-22. This, of course )resents many more subscriptions. Most of these have come from lividuals, and we wish to thank each and every one of them. Several clubs and chapters have contributed through their rep ad Page 38 Order Magazine Subscriptions Through Our Agency REPORT ..OF SUBSCRIPTION AGENCY 39 resentatives, and to these we are most grateful. We hope that many more will cooperate in this way. Any clubs or chapters desiring a quantity of price lists will, be supplied upon request. Many reasons are given for not sending subscriptions to us: The most important one is that a subscriber has for years been sub-scribing through some other worthy agent dependent upon this business for a living. We recognize this reason as sound and sufficient, but we wish to make a suggestion. If you really wish to help the Settlement School, send us at least one subscription. This one will not greatly reduce the profit of your present agent and it will add a little to ours. We perhaps have stressed this point a great deal but it is because we are continually confronted with it and we hope we have found a solution satisfactory to all concerned., Please note the following: 1. Our agency furnishes every magazine and periodical published, domestic and foreign. 2. Renewals count the same as new subscriptions. 3. Please allow sufficient time for filling orders from two to three weeks. 4. "Club" rates are offered. 5. "Special" offers made by publishers can be ordered through the Agency. 6. Discounts are allowed to libraries. 7. Price lists sent and estimates and information are gladly furnished. Subscriptions received at any time all through the year. g. Many magazines make special rates on Christmas gift orders and send gift cards to the recipients. Please send such orders early. lo. Since publishers will not accept orders from agents unless accompanied by proper remittance, we must ask you to send remittince with the order making check or money order payable to B. G. Reisinger. We are doing a big work at Gatlinburg, and big work requires big money. You can contribute a part of it by sending us your magazine subscriptions. The officers . of the fraternity stand back of this enterprise and they are going to bring it to your attention again this season because they realize its possibilities if given adequate support. Again we thank all who have given their support in the past, and ask your continued patronage, and we anticipate many new subscribers. The Agency stands ready to serve you, and through you, our Settlement School. BLANCHE G. REISINGER, Maryland A, 235 E. Lafayette Ave., Baltimore, Md.
