        18 Marianne Reid Wild continued as editor of the section of "What Others Are Saying," which kept Pi Phis aware of the news of other Greek fraternities. The regular information issue of The ARROW was discontinued in 1976. A less expensive Information Bulletin, compiled by Central Office, was substituted. Four issues of The ARROW continued to be published. The editor, following in the footsteps of herTHE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI predecessor, also served as chairman of the Operation Brass Tacks Committee for the National Panhellenic Editors' Conference. In 1975, she became a member of the Executive Board of the Conference. NPC's skit presentation during the Greek Bicentennial celebration in Williamsburg, Va., in December, 1976, was written by The ARROW editor, at the request of the NPC Bicentennial Committee. ~i 'Phi 'rienhhip gs Unicjue anal XoyaI "The right course is to choose for a friend one who is frank, sociable and sympathetic that is, one who is likely to be influenced by the same motives as yourself since all these qualities induce to loyalty . . . Since happiness is our best and highest aim we must, if we would attain it, give our attention to virtue, without which we can obtain neither friendship nor any other desirable thing." Cicero The one outstanding thing about Pi Beta Phi is, for me, the opportunity to form lasting friendships. These are friends who are honest with me and with themselves. They are interested in each other and excited with each other's accomplishments without any element of envy. There is a diversity of interests, yet, as Cicero said, they are influenced by the same motives as myself. Pi Phi's standards and ideas are high, as is the quality of friendship and loyalty found in Pi Phi. Cicero's idea of virtue is even expressed by the original founders as they stated an interest in "exerting an influence of virtue and charity." All these qualities are instrumental in producing a unique kind of friendship and loyalty in Pi Phi. It is a feeling which, though starting strongly, grows even greater during pledgeship. It is a feeling which reaffirms the correctness of the decision to pledge Pi Phi. It is a feeling which makes it inconceivable to have done anything else. The final result is one of happiness and pride a happiness which has grown steadily over a period of time and thus is more likely to endure; and a deep pride in being a part of the friendship in Pi Phi, for as Stevenson wrote, "of what shall a man be proud, if he is not proud of his friends?" by Melissa McKee, Oklahoma Beta ...X rro w o t clhe Settlement School HE Centennial Project which was to develop an Arts and Crafts Center at Gatlin-burg, Tennessee, took shape in 1966 when Grand Council appointed a planning board, interviewed architects, and adopted the name of the project: "Arrow in the Smokies." At this time it was hoped that "Arrow in the Smokies" would become one of the few craft centers pioneering in the enrichment and promotion of craft design, while preserving the fine aspects of the traditional crafts. The personnel of the Planning Board was as follows: Evelyn Peters Kyle, Chairman and Grand Vice President of Philanthropies Olivia Smith Moore, Grand Treasurer Louise Rosser Kemp, Grand Treasurer-in-training Marian Heard, Director of Summer Craft Workshop Henrietta McCutchan Huff, Gatlinburg, Tennessee Carol Estes, Del Mar, California Elizabeth Yelm Kingman, Omaha, Nebraska. The first meeting of the Planning Board was planned for February, 1967. The formation of the Board of Control and the permanent Executive Committee to be in charge of the day-by-day running of the Center, plus the appointment of the Director were among the plans discussed. It was determined that the Settlement School Committee would be called the Board of Governors, composed of a chair-man, a secretary, a treasurer, representatives from the University of Tennessee, and the Grand Vice President of Philanthropies. The Craft Center and the Summer Craft Workshop were to be conducted in cooperation with the University of . Tennessee and would be ac-credited by the University. The chairman of the Executive Committee would also serve as chairman of ways and means. The secretary would serve as chairman of promotion and publicity. Each member of the Board of Governors would serve on an active committee. When the plans for the new philanthropy were formulated, the first Board of Governors was appointed: Chairman and Chairman of the Ways and Means, Betty Kingman Vice Chairman, Shirley Jones Mann Secretary and Chairman of the Promotion and Publicity Comm., Henrietta McCutchan Huff Treasurer, Olivia Smith Moore Director of Summer Craft Workshop, Marian Heard Dr. Mills, Head of the Related Arts and Crafts Interior Design Department at the University of Tennessee. Slowed by the advent of a new Board and changes in operating personnel, the new phase in the continuation of the Fraternity's philanthropy progressed rather slowly, in 1967-1968. Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers took over the duties of Arrowcraft Manager in October, as a temporary position until a new manager could be found. Marian Mueller Prince, who had been Settlement School Director for a number of years, continued her administration. After January 1, 1968, when it became apparent there was no Pi Phi yet available to take over, the ability and devotion of these two Pi Phis filled the Fraternity's special needs. Miss Marian Heard, as Director of the craft workshop, conducted a successful summer workshop in the summer of 1967. Subjects taught at this accredited Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee summer program were weaving, textile design, ceramics, enameling, jewelry, recreational crafts, and stitchery. With the Chairman's close association in the museum field and its publications she became aware of the growing importance of the crafts as activities which enhanced the very fabric of civilized society in all aspects. The new artistic explosion had been making itself felt even more in the areas of advertising, industrial design, and interior decoration. In addition, a growing awareness of creative projects which are based on artistic knowledge was reflected in increased attendance at museums in their tours and their arts and crafts classes, and was also reflected in the arts taught in the elementary schools of the nation. A new resident manager was found in April and took over her duties on June first. She was Mrs. Lucile Woodworth. She assumed both the duties of the past Settlement School director and the Arrowcraft manager. She coordinated all administrative activities of "Arrow in the Smokies" under the Board of Governors. 19 20 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Mr. Hubert Bebb, of Gatlinburg, was appointed as the architect for "Arrow in the Smokies" buildings. He completed plans for the exhibit mall which was constructed along the grass strip at the front of the Pi Beta Phi property adjoining the Arrowcraft Shop. In 1968, the twenty-third annual Summer Craft Workshop under the leadership of Marian Heard was composed of teachers, vocational rehabilitation workers, mental health therapists, senior citizens leaders, graduate students, regular college students, citizens, and senior citizens. Their ages ranged from 16 to 80. During the three sessions, there were 72 students enrolled in each. Canada and England were represented as well as 32 from the United States. In 1968, Arrowcraft products were sold by 202 alumnae clubs in varying amounts from small individual sales to very large club sales. Of special note were two sales. Anchorage, Alaska, with a membership of 19 filed an incomplete report of $1,048.30 in sales and Yuba Sutter, California, with 9 members sold $1,025.00. The name for the Fraternity's philanthropy was changed from "Arrow in the Smokies" to Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts in July of 1968. In June, 1969, the National Officers' Work-shop in Gatlinburg gave all present an opportunity to be part of the dedication of the Emma Harper Turner classroom building at Arrowmont. On October 18, 1969, the corner stone was laid for the new classroom building while Grand Council and Arrowmont Board of Goveriors met in Gatlinburg. Standing in the roofless concrete second floor level court, Grand Council in hard hats wielded mortar with a trowel to seal in the engraved corner-stone with accompaniment of prayers of thanksgiving and hope. The articles which were placed in the cornerstone were as follows: History of Settlement School Settlement School publicity, pamphlets Whig Rose book mark' 1969 Arrowcraft catalogue and Arrowcraft pamphlet 1969 Summer Craft Workshop brochure The new Arrowmont brochure Dean Odland's 10th annual letter to alumnae and friends A copy of the booklet "These Shining Things" compiled by Evelyn Peters Kyle A copy of the booklet, "They Stand Tall," a biography of May L. Keller and Amy Burnham Onken, compiled by Marianne Reid Wild and Ruth Williams Hansen Pages from the Information Arrow (1969) giving: Grand Council Members Board of Governors Members Staff of Arrowmont Annual Report of Chairman, Elizabeth Y. Kingman Annual Report of Executive Coordinator, Lucile Woodworth. The committee work of the Board of Governors was mainly in the areas of communication and funding making the concept and work of Arrowmont understood and inspiring, still an uphill job because of the need to replace the old idea of the grade school with the new idea of a unique craft school. The BOG committees were as follows: Academic, Communication with Actives and Alumnae both in Canada and the U.S., Consultants, Cookbook sales, Objectives of the school, Personnel, Policies of the Governors, Program and Promotion, Property Advisory, Public Relations, Scholarships, Slide Programs, Ways and Means, and Special Gifts in the name of individuals or clubs. The 1970 year was one of important "firsts." Arrowmont leaders expected to inaugurate the school on a year round basis, so the center had to have winter staffing for the first time. The staff had to prove that they could support the challenge of this unique complex in Gatlinburg, an idea which had long been evolving through dedicated Pi Phis with vision, and kept alive by faith, hard work, and generosity. It could flower into significance if it was backed by the same Pi Phi attitudes of optimism and purposeful giving, expressed with increased awareness. Because it fostered some of the most positive thinking and activity in the U.S., who could predict where its influence would stop? Arrowmont was PI PHI implementing itself in , education and creativity. The training of the mind, eye, and hand generated beauty and satisfaction. The beautiful new Arrowmont was completed. The donations that were made and the shingles that were bought had helped get the Centennial program underway. The new year-round program was to begin and 25 years of experience in this field and a reputation of excellence in arts and crafts had promoted growth, but the results would reach into every THE ARROW OF P9 BETA PHI community of the country. In 1970, a slide program was made available for everyone and it was hoped that facilities in use year new slides showing the modern would be viewed by every club and chapter. The Summer Workshops were doubled in length with outstanding teachers from many sections of the country participating. The Arrowcraft Shop had had its face lifted. Working conditions improved with additional shipping areas and enlarged storage space. The sales room was also updated hoping that this would make for more efficient operations. The 1969-1970 year was a banner year as clubs and chapters continued to hold Settlement School sales. Visitors flocked to the door of Arrowcraft since it was recognized as the outstanding craft shop in the area. The weaving was a big drawing card, and the sixty-two weavers were kept busy. It was hard to realize that over 20,000 tote bags and 15,000 Daisy Chain mats were woven and sold during this year and that this was just a part of the weaving production. In addition, seventy other craftsmen were kept busy producing other crafts. In 1970-1971, financial support from clubs, chapters, and other Pi Phi members continued to strengthen the national philanthropy. Every Pi Phi who visited or attended school left with pride and determination to spread the word of Arrowmont's work and needs. The former Emma Harper Turner building was leased to Community Tectonics as of December, 1970. They restored the building and made a beautiful addition to the Pi Beta Phi Compound. Other additional income came from renting the Red Barn every weekend when school was not in session to religious groups, college groups including Pi Phis from the University of Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Memphis, and South Carolina, craftsmen from Craftsman's Fair, and Wildflower Pilgrimage leaders. Arrowmont had permanent winter boarders, teachers from Pi Beta Phi Elementary School plus many paying guests at Staff House. Arrowmont honors had been numerous. Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, was named Alumni Distinguished Service Professor at the President's Honors Banquet at the University of Tennessee. Tennessee Art Commission award Pi Beta Phi a commendation for Arrowmont work. They also had given $2000 to hold a workshop for Craftsmen for 21 the State of Tennessee the next year. Arrowmont had been chosen for the meeting place of National Council of Education for Ceramic Arts in March, 1972, and 500 to 600 potters attended. Persis Grayson, one of the Arrowmont teachers, had been made president of Handweavers Guild of America. Harland Bartholomew and Associates had just submitted new comprehensive plans for the City of Gatlinburg. In the letter of transmittal for the plan was the following statement: The cultural center of the city should be Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. Continued construction of motels, shops and `attractions' may soon reach a point in which congestions and commercialism might begin to outweigh the things that have made the town so attractive to visitors in the past. This tremendous economic pressure might be counterbalanced by a strong cultural force in the community. Many local groups used the facilities for meeting and were interested and enthused about the Arrowmont program. Bus tours brought visitors to Arrowcraft, and many were asking to see Arrowmont. This year the representatives of Junior Colleges of Southeast were in Gatlinburg for convention and asked to tour and hear about the Pi Beta Phi philanthropic work. Chapters and clubs indicated a general solicitude for sincere friendship, real objects of life, happiness of humanity, and mental, moral, and social advancement exemplified in the diversity of community and campus welfare projects as well as increased interest in Fraternity philanthropies. This was apparent in the growth of concern and contributions for Arrowmont, Holt House, and the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Fund in 1971-1972. Much credit should go to the alumnae province presidents who gave clubs a better under-standing of the worth and need of Arrowmont in particular. Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts held a distinctive reputation for instruction under the fine directorship of Marian G. Heard and her splendid staff. A year around program had not been realized due to lack of operating funds, but summer craft workshop classes were full to overflowing with applicants turned away for lack of housing and dining facilities. This noteworthy project which attracted students from all areas of the country and numerous 22 foreign countries was wholly supported by Pi Beta Phis. There was no doubt about the role which Arrowmont played as a major philanthropy when the far reaching impact of craft instruction was evaluated. By learning or improving skills, students in turn were able to enrich otherwise colorless lives of many people by the joy of creating with their hands. No small part of the instruction led to creating a source of earning a livelihood. The Arrowcraft shop enjoyed an outstanding year of production and sales in 1971-1972. A surge of clubs' spring sales kept the shop busy filling orders and, in order to fill heavy Christmas orders, even the administrator and office staff helped out in various capacities. The shop personnel worked under the handicap of crowded conditions but their interest and loyalty made it possible for mountain crafts-men to rely upon Arrowcraft for their livelihood. One such family, including the father, depended upon weaving as its sole income. Several changes in personnel had occurred, but the work of the Fraternity in Gatlinburg continued to expand. The Arrowcraft Shop added new crafts to its inventory while maintaining the weaving department at a high level of activity. The 1972 Summer Craft School conducted three two-week courses and four one-week courses to provide opportunities for more people to come to the classes. The financial support by the members of the Fraternity had increased each year and administrators were counting on their increasing interest, enthusiasm, and understanding of the Arrowmont goals. In October, Lucile McCutchan Woodworth resigned as Executive Coordinator. Helen Anderson Lewis became Resident Administrator, and continued in that capacity. In April, the Board of Governors offered Mrs. Lewis a contract as Administrator and she accepted. Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts, was successful in conducting additional craft workshops during the year. It was anticipated that the number of workshops would increase in her time. Through her efforts, Arrowmont's fame was spreading throughout the craft world to those who would learn more about that world and its opportunities for service. The scholarships given by the chapters, clubs, and provinces served as a firsthand BROW OF PI BETA PHI liaison between Arrowmont and members of the Fraternity. The community of each donating group was richly served when the scholar-ship recipient returned to use his or her newly learned skills in philanthropic or educational areas. The list of Arrowmont students and staff was divided into provinces and sent to each province officer for distribution to the clubs and chapters. It was hoped that each group would contact those in its area. This could be a two-fold education; the student or staff member would learn that Pi Phis in his or her own community were among those responsible for the existence of Arrowmont, and the Pi Phis would learn more about the work done by their contributions. Arrowcraft had a very good year in 1971-1972 with total sales exceeding those of 197 -1971. Two hundred fifty-one clubs and thirty-seven chapters sold Arrowcraft. There were fewer returns of merchandise and in most cases, the clubs and chapters responded to the Director's request to pay their bills promptly after their sales. The Red Barn continued to be a popular place for weekend retreats. Bookings were made for weekends months ahead. The Barn was set up with 34 beds and 6 rollaway beds. In 1971, two beds in the teachers' cottage and one bed in Pollard, plus another rollaway in Staff House, were added. This made a total of 102 beds for staff, faculty, and students during the summer. In addition, two beds were placed in the vacant room in the Administrative office building for Helen and Bob Russell, Helen serving as librarian at Arrowmont during the summer of 1972. A successful workshop program was realized in 1972 with 123 students registering for each of the first two sessions. Most classes were completely filled, and it was necessary to turn some people away for lack of space in classes, or for lack of housing. Faculty members were outstanding craftsmen as well as excellent teachers, many having taught at Arrowmont in past years. A fine teacher, Peter Collingwood, from England, a well known authority on weaving, was one of the teachers. In March 1972, Arrowmont was host to the NCECA Conference which drew over 600 people. Arrowmont did not house this group, but did use all the rooms at Arrowmont for workshops and forums. In April, Arrowmont put on a three day workshop for the Tennessee THE THE ARROW OF N BETA PHI 23 Arts Commission. This time, all facilities were used to full capacity. In May, the Center housed and fed some thirty-five leaders of the annual Wildflower Pilgrimage. The alumni of the College of Home Economics of the University of Tennessee held a forum and luncheon at Arrowmont during the craft work-shop period. Also during April, 1972, the Board of Governors of Arrowmont held a two day meeting. While Gatlinburg community was expanding in great proportions, Pi Beta Phi continued to hold its respected position and recognition for its high ideals as expressed through Arrowmont and Arrowcraft and their outstanding staffs. In September, 1972, Summer Craft School, 821 students were enrolled representing thirty-seven states and five foreign countries. The 1973 session included three two-week courses and four one-week courses under the direction of Marian Heard, Director. Woodworking was offered as a new course this year as well as a course in kiln building. The ceramic studio had been conducted by Marian Heard. Donations, in lieu of scholarships, had been emphasized during this year due to the ever increasing demand for places by regular students and the needed funds to help defray high costs of operating expense. Arrowmont contributions were up in 1972-1973, and formed a great source of income for the operation of the school. Contributions from the Pi Phi owners of the Kansas State Travel Agency continued and increased with more Pi Phis using their prompt service. Two hundred fifty-two clubs and thirty-nine chapters sold Arrowcraft merchandise during 1972-1973, with total purchase figure of $201,146.30, an increase over the previous year in total sales as well as in the number of clubs and chapters placing orders. For the first time, Arrowmont was the recipient of a scholarship to be given to one of its students; also the Rotary Club of Gatlinburg gave a $200 scholarship which was awarded to Sister Consolata Agyapong of Ghana. Arrowmont and the University of Tennessee joined forces and had a beautiful exhibit at the Craftsmen's Fair held in Ashville, N.C., in October where Arrowcraft had some merchandise for sale in the central booth. The summer session for 1973 was again most successful with nine hundred fifty-three students attending from forty-two states andthree foreign countries. Paul Rossiter, retired manager of the Doubleday Book Store in New Orleans, established a book store at Arrowmont. He returned for the summer of 1974 and enlarged his inventory. Because of limited housing, many students were forced to live off campus and dining facilities were inadequate. With the installation of a commercial dish-washer and disposal, the situation was relieved somewhat in 1974, facilitating two shift dining. The 1974 summer session included three two-week sessions and four one-week sessions under the direction of Marian Heard. Additional specialized craft workshops had numbered four during this year. Caroline Riddle, Florida Beta, became the new administrator for Arrowmont and Arrow-craft on September 1, 1973, having worked since spring with the retiring administrator, Helen Lewis. Mrs. Riddle brought to the job a strong background in art education, personnel administration, and philanthropic service. The annual meeting of the Board of Governors was held in Gatlinburg, October 4-7, 1973. New members of the Board were Caroline Mills Riddle, Florida Beta, became Administrator of Arrowmont-Arrowcraft in September, 1973. Miss Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamma, retired in August, 1977, after heading the Settlement School craft program for more than thirty years. Cecile Kendall of Corpus Christi, Texas, Mary Jean Fowler of Houston, Texas, and Helen Lewis, Gatlinburg, Tenn. Retiring were Betty Hall, Henrietta Huff, Betty Kingman, and Olivia Smith Moore. A donation to Arrowmont was made by the Board honoring Olivia Smith Moore for her many years of service to Pi Beta Phi. The Board also presented Helen Lewis with a pewter pitcher upon her retirement as administrator. The individual members of the Board functioned well in their particular capacities. During 1973-1974, a General Mills coupon plan was launched to provide funds for the purchase of needed potters' wheels and looms for Arrowmont. A generous cash donation from Marian Heard and Sandy Blain assisted with the building of a much desired salt kiln for the ceramics department. The fascia board around the Emma Harper Turner building had been contracted for completion. The frame THE ARROW OF PI BETA PNI THE ARROW OF Pi Mil ETA P cottage on the grounds, occupied by Mr. Arlie Watson until his death, was made to house eight graduate students, relieving eight beds for other summer school students. A $4,000 gift from the Dallas Club honoring one of its members, Edythe Mulveyhill Brack, former Grand Council member, enabled the establishment of a photographic studio at Arrowmont. Arrowmont held three special workshops in the spring of 1974: Tennessee Crafts Work-shop, March 21-21, 1974; Environmental Arts Conference, April 2-5, 1974; and Southern Highland Handicraft Guild Workshop and Annual Meeting, April 24-27, 1974. Arrowcraft continued to operate smoothly and profitably in 1974. Two hundred forty-nine clubs sold Arrowcraft; forty-seven chapters sold Arrowcraft also. Club sales in May, 1974, totalled $168,008.70; chapter sales, $5,348.09. Due to price changes from increased material and labor costs, a new bright catalog was published in the summer of 1974, which included several new woven items, the result of suggestions from Pi Phis. An Arrowcraft Design Award was initiated and was publicized to the clubs, chapters, schools, and colleges. Each of three awards was a $100 design purchase, the design to become the property of Arrowcraft for production and marketing. In establishing the award it was hoped to serve two purposes: better understanding and renewed interest in Arrow-craft by Pi Phis and a source of fresh, new design ideas for Arrowcraft. On May 8, 1974, sixteen weavers were honored by a tea at the Staff House. Nella Hill presented sterling silver Stuart Nye pins to each weaver completing twenty-five years of weaving for Arrowcraft. There were seventy weavers, some mothers and daughters, weaving for Arrowcraft at this time and twenty-five pins for a period of twenty years were awarded because an event honoring the weavers had not been held since 1966. One weaver at the tea, Mae Lethco, first wove for Arrowcraft in 1929. Also, for the first time in a number of years Arrowmont offered a course for the Gatlinburg community. Forty-one women and one man signed up for ten weeks of textile techniques during the winter, exploring such crafts as batik, tie-dye, printing, stitchery, quilting, looping, mining, etc. Arrowmont also workedwith the Great Smoky Mountain Park to pro-vide craftsmen to give demonstrations at the Sugarland Visitors Center during summer months. Graduate Assistants gave demonstrations in weaving and pottery. Mrs. Rossiter gave such effective demonstrations and talks on spinning that she came back at the inivitation of the Park to demonstrate for the Park Interpreters' meeting. In the summer of 1975, 971 students at-tended the Arrowmont summer sessions. Thirty-nine states and five foreign countries were represented. Additions to the Arrowmont kitchen and dining facilities were hot and cold buffet carts, a dish caddy, refrigerator, freezer, and a large ice machine. The Betty Crocker coupons which had been collected were used to purchase a three-tiered skutt kiln. Generous donations from the St. Alumnae Club made possible the comp of the Edythe Brack photographic studio contributions from the Dallas Club pure the photographic equipment and the studio was opened for classes in the sump 1976. The Arrowcraft Shop celebrated its Fi Anniversary in 1976. With the incr volume of sales, the need for expa facilities were necessary. Final plans for a square foot addition were approved in tk of 1976. Little did members of the Fraternity r when the Arrowmont School of Arts and ( was adopted as the Centennial Project t would influence so many lives throughot United States and many countries aroun world. This wood relief sculpture was donated to Arrowmont by Joseph Falsetti who taught the first courses new wood studio in June, 1973. Two students in the advanced class assisted him in creating this piece. 26 THE ARROW P ETA PHI From the first rumblings of bulldozers, cement mixers, hammers, and saws, in 1969 to. . . . . .. the realization of a dream when the Emma Harper Turner Building was dedicated in 1970 this is Arrowmont. The Can ' in roject INCE the Canadian Project provided a loan fund for students in the eight schools of social work in Canada, by 1967, the Loan Fund had become self-sustaining. The Canadian Philanthropies Committee grew out of the Canadian Project Fund and administered two projects, the Loan Fund for Social Work students and the Northern Libraries Project. In 1967-1968, the inclusion of the new School of Social Welfare at the University of Calgary brought the number of schools eligible for Loan Funds to nine. The University of British Columbia and the University of Manitoba both agreed to release $500 so that a $1000 Loan Fund could begin in Calgary. A sum of $100 was sent to the Maritime School of Social Work where the fund was used extensively. At the 1967 Convention it was the unanimous decision of the Canadian delegates to adopt the Northern Library Project. Money was sent to supply books to the libraries of the Yukon and Northwest Territories. The Canadian government supplied an adequate budget for the purchase of books, but there was no money available for "extras" such as expensive reference volumes. In July, 1967, a check for $1000 was presented to the Commissioners of the Territories to be divided equally between the libraries. In 1968-1969, the library systems were expanding rapidly in the north where radios and books were man's best friend. Money donated by Pi Phis was used to purchase books that normally would take years to acquire. The Regional Librarian for the Northwest Territories used Pi Phi contributions to build up a fine collection of Artica. The Regional Librarian in the Yukon Territories used the contributions for developing a reference collection. The "Arrow in the Arctic" project continued to contribute to the quality of life of northern Canadian citizens. With the $1000 donations made in 1971 to the Northwest Territory Libraries, a Videorecorder was purchased for use at the Rankin Inlet Library. It proved extremely valuable in taping films of Eskimo storytellers, to show in various communities. In 1972, a $1000 donation was made to the T.ugunngi, the Eskimo story teller, fascinates her listeners with her tales of native traditions and culture. Yukon Library Services. The money was to go to an Indian Resource Center to provide supply books, pamphlets, and periodicals. An addition had been made to the library in White-horse and a children's librarian was added to the staff. Seven hundred dollars was contributed to the libraries in 1969-1970 and the Schools of Social Work found Pi Phi contributions a very useful resource for helping Social Work students in need of short term loans. The Loan Fund for students in Social Work was increased from $150 to $300 maximum in 1971 on a two year trial basis. As a result, the fund was used to a greater extent and the record of payments was improved by 1973. Libraries in Canada's northland continued to benefit during 1973-1974. The sum of $450 was sent to the library services in the Yukon Territories. This money enabled one librarian to employ a person who spoke and read Green-land Eskimo to translate the titles and summarize the contents of some acquired books written in Greenland Eskimo. The library of periodicals, pamphlets, and books, started by Pi Phi contributions in the Indian Brotherhood centers in the Yukon, was given government approval and received funds from this source. The loan funds for social work students which the Canadian Project had established at nine Canadian Universities were under study in 1973-1974. While some universities considered the funds useful, others had not made use of the funds for some time. In 1974, more 27

        20 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Mr. Hubert Bebb, of Gatlinburg, was appointed as the architect for "Arrow in the Smokies" buildings. He completed plans for the exhibit mall which was constructed along the grass strip at the front of the Pi Beta Phi property adjoining the Arrowcraft Shop.

Arrowmont was PI PHI implementing itself in , education and creativity. The training of the mind, eye, and hand generated beauty and satisfaction. The beautiful new Arrowmont was completed. The donations that were made and the shingles that were bought had helped get the Centennial program underway. The new year-round program was to begin and 25 years of experience in this field and a reputation of excellence in arts and crafts had promoted growth, but the results would reach into every THE ARROW OF P9 BETA PHI community of the country. In 1970, a slide program was made available for everyone and it was hoped that facilities in use year new slides showing the modern would be viewed by every club and chapter. The Summer Workshops were doubled in length with outstanding teachers from many sections of the country participating. The Arrowcraft Shop had had its face lifted. Working conditions improved with additional shipping areas and enlarged storage space. The sales room was also updated hoping that this would make for more efficient operations. The 1969-1970 year was a banner year as clubs and chapters continued to hold Settlement School sales. Visitors flocked to the door of Arrowcraft since it was recognized as the outstanding craft shop in the area. The weaving was a big drawing card, and the sixty-two weavers were kept busy. It was hard to realize that over 20,000 tote bags and 15,000 Daisy Chain mats were woven and sold during this year and that this was just a part of the weaving production. In addition, seventy other craftsmen were kept busy producing other crafts. In 1970-1971, financial support from clubs, chapters, and other Pi Phi members continued to strengthen the national philanthropy. Every Pi Phi who visited or attended school left with pride and determination to spread the word of Arrowmont's work and needs. The former Emma Harper Turner building was leased to Community Tectonics as of December, 1970. They restored the building and made a beautiful addition to the Pi Beta Phi Compound. Other additional income came from renting the Red Barn every weekend when school was not in session to religious groups, college groups including Pi Phis from the University of Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Memphis, and South Carolina, craftsmen from Craftsman's Fair, and Wildflower Pilgrimage leaders. Arrowmont had permanent winter boarders, teachers from Pi Beta Phi Elementary School plus many paying guests at Staff House. Arrowmont honors had been numerous. Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, was named Alumni Distinguished Service Professor at the President's Honors Banquet at the University of Tennessee. Tennessee Art Commission award Pi Beta Phi a commendation for Arrowmont work. They also had given $2000 to hold a workshop for Craftsmen for 21 the State of Tennessee the next year. Arrowmont had been chosen for the meeting place of National Council of Education for Ceramic Arts in March, 1972, and 500 to 600 potters attended. Persis Grayson, one of the Arrowmont teachers, had been made president of Handweavers Guild of America. Harland Bartholomew and Associates had just submitted new comprehensive plans for the City of Gatlinburg. In the letter of transmittal for the plan was the following statement: The cultural center of the city should be Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. Continued construction of motels, shops and `attractions' may soon reach a point in which congestions and commercialism might begin to outweigh the things that have made the town so attractive to visitors in the past. This tremendous economic pressure might be counterbalanced by a strong cultural force in the community. Many local groups used the facilities for meeting and were interested and enthused about the Arrowmont program. Bus tours brought visitors to Arrowcraft, and many were asking to see Arrowmont. This year the representatives of Junior Colleges of Southeast were in Gatlinburg for convention and asked to tour and hear about the Pi Beta Phi philanthropic work. Chapters and clubs indicated a general solicitude for sincere friendship, real objects of life, happiness of humanity, and mental, moral, and social advancement exemplified in the diversity of community and campus welfare projects as well as increased interest in Fraternity philanthropies. This was apparent in the growth of concern and contributions for Arrowmont, Holt House, and the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Fund in 1971-1972. Much credit should go to the alumnae province presidents who gave clubs a better under-standing of the worth and need of Arrowmont in particular. Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts held a distinctive reputation for instruction under the fine directorship of Marian G. Heard and her splendid staff. A year around program had not been realized due to lack of operating funds, but summer craft workshop classes were full to overflowing with applicants turned away for lack of housing and dining facilities. This noteworthy project which attracted students from all areas of the country and numerous 22 foreign countries was wholly supported by Pi Beta Phis. There was no doubt about the role which Arrowmont played as a major philanthropy when the far reaching impact of craft instruction was evaluated. By learning or improving skills, students in turn were able to enrich otherwise colorless lives of many people by the joy of creating with their hands. No small part of the instruction led to creating a source of earning a livelihood. The Arrowcraft shop enjoyed an outstanding year of production and sales in 1971-1972. A surge of clubs' spring sales kept the shop busy filling orders and, in order to fill heavy Christmas orders, even the administrator and office staff helped out in various capacities. The shop personnel worked under the handicap of crowded conditions but their interest and loyalty made it possible for mountain crafts-men to rely upon Arrowcraft for their livelihood. One such family, including the father, depended upon weaving as its sole income. Several changes in personnel had occurred, but the work of the Fraternity in Gatlinburg continued to expand. The Arrowcraft Shop added new crafts to its inventory while maintaining the weaving department at a high level of activity. The 1972 Summer Craft School conducted three two-week courses and four one-week courses to provide opportunities for more people to come to the classes. The financial support by the members of the Fraternity had increased each year and administrators were counting on their increasing interest, enthusiasm, and understanding of the Arrowmont goals. In October, Lucile McCutchan Woodworth resigned as Executive Coordinator. Helen Anderson Lewis became Resident Administrator, and continued in that capacity. In April, the Board of Governors offered Mrs. Lewis a contract as Administrator and she accepted. Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts, was successful in conducting additional craft workshops during the year. It was anticipated that the number of workshops would increase in her time. Through her efforts, Arrowmont's fame was spreading throughout the craft world to those who would learn more about that world and its opportunities for service. The scholarships given by the chapters, clubs, and provinces served as a firsthand BROW OF PI BETA PHI liaison between Arrowmont and members of the Fraternity. The community of each donating group was richly served when the scholar-ship recipient returned to use his or her newly learned skills in philanthropic or educational areas. The list of Arrowmont students and staff was divided into provinces and sent to each province officer for distribution to the clubs and chapters. It was hoped that each group would contact those in its area. This could be a two-fold education; the student or staff member would learn that Pi Phis in his or her own community were among those responsible for the existence of Arrowmont, and the Pi Phis would learn more about the work done by their contributions. Arrowcraft had a very good year in 1971-1972 with total sales exceeding those of 197 -1971. Two hundred fifty-one clubs and thirty-seven chapters sold Arrowcraft. There were fewer returns of merchandise and in most cases, the clubs and chapters responded to the Director's request to pay their bills promptly after their sales. The Red Barn continued to be a popular place for weekend retreats. Bookings were made for weekends months ahead. The Barn was set up with 34 beds and 6 rollaway beds. In 1971, two beds in the teachers' cottage and one bed in Pollard, plus another rollaway in Staff House, were added. This made a total of 102 beds for staff, faculty, and students during the summer. In addition, two beds were placed in the vacant room in the Administrative office building for Helen and Bob Russell, Helen serving as librarian at Arrowmont during the summer of 1972. A successful workshop program was realized in 1972 with 123 students registering for each of the first two sessions. Most classes were completely filled, and it was necessary to turn some people away for lack of space in classes, or for lack of housing. Faculty members were outstanding craftsmen as well as excellent teachers, many having taught at Arrowmont in past years. A fine teacher, Peter Collingwood, from England, a well known authority on weaving, was one of the teachers. In March 1972, Arrowmont was host to the NCECA Conference which drew over 600 people. Arrowmont did not house this group, but did use all the rooms at Arrowmont for workshops and forums. In April, Arrowmont put on a three day workshop for the Tennessee THE THE ARROW OF N BETA PHI 23 Arts Commission. This time, all facilities were used to full capacity. In May, the Center housed and fed some thirty-five leaders of the annual Wildflower Pilgrimage. The alumni of the College of Home Economics of the University of Tennessee held a forum and luncheon at Arrowmont during the craft work-shop period. Also during April, 1972, the Board of Governors of Arrowmont held a two day meeting. While Gatlinburg community was expanding in great proportions, Pi Beta Phi continued to hold its respected position and recognition for its high ideals as expressed through Arrowmont and Arrowcraft and their outstanding staffs. In September, 1972, Summer Craft School, 821 students were enrolled representing thirty-seven states and five foreign countries. The 1973 session included three two-week courses and four one-week courses under the direction of Marian Heard, Director. Woodworking was offered as a new course this year as well as a course in kiln building. The ceramic studio had been conducted by Marian Heard. Donations, in lieu of scholarships, had been emphasized during this year due to the ever increasing demand for places by regular students and the needed funds to help defray high costs of operating expense. Arrowmont contributions were up in 1972-1973, and formed a great source of income for the operation of the school. Contributions from the Pi Phi owners of the Kansas State Travel Agency continued and increased with more Pi Phis using their prompt service. Two hundred fifty-two clubs and thirty-nine chapters sold Arrowcraft merchandise during 1972-1973, with total purchase figure of $201,146.30, an increase over the previous year in total sales as well as in the number of clubs and chapters placing orders. For the first time, Arrowmont was the recipient of a scholarship to be given to one of its students; also the Rotary Club of Gatlinburg gave a $200 scholarship which was awarded to Sister Consolata Agyapong of Ghana. Arrowmont and the University of Tennessee joined forces and had a beautiful exhibit at the Craftsmen's Fair held in Ashville, N.C., in October where Arrowcraft had some merchandise for sale in the central booth. The summer session for 1973 was again most successful with nine hundred fifty-three students attending from forty-two states andthree foreign countries. Paul Rossiter, retired manager of the Doubleday Book Store in New Orleans, established a book store at Arrowmont. He returned for the summer of 1974 and enlarged his inventory. Because of limited housing, many students were forced to live off campus and dining facilities were inadequate. With the installation of a commercial dish-washer and disposal, the situation was relieved somewhat in 1974, facilitating two shift dining. The 1974 summer session included three two-week sessions and four one-week sessions under the direction of Marian Heard. Additional specialized craft workshops had numbered four during this year. Caroline Riddle, Florida Beta, became the new administrator for Arrowmont and Arrow-craft on September 1, 1973, having worked since spring with the retiring administrator, Helen Lewis. Mrs. Riddle brought to the job a strong background in art education, personnel administration, and philanthropic service. The annual meeting of the Board of Governors was held in Gatlinburg, October 4-7, 1973. New members of the Board were Caroline Mills Riddle, Florida Beta, became Administrator of Arrowmont-Arrowcraft in September, 1973.

A donation to Arrowmont was made by the Board honoring Olivia Smith Moore for her many years of service to Pi Beta Phi. The Board also presented Helen Lewis with a pewter pitcher upon her retirement as administrator. The individual members of the Board functioned well in their particular capacities. During 1973-1974, a General Mills coupon plan was launched to provide funds for the purchase of needed potters' wheels and looms for Arrowmont. A generous cash donation from Marian Heard and Sandy Blain assisted with the building of a much desired salt kiln for the ceramics department. The fascia board around the Emma Harper Turner building had been contracted for completion. The frame THE ARROW OF PI BETA PNI THE ARROW OF Pi Mil ETA P cottage on the grounds, occupied by Mr. Arlie Watson until his death, was made to house eight graduate students, relieving eight beds for other summer school students. A $4,000 gift from the Dallas Club honoring one of its members, Edythe Mulveyhill Brack, former Grand Council member, enabled the establishment of a photographic studio at Arrowmont. Arrowmont held three special workshops in the spring of 1974: Tennessee Crafts Work-shop, March 21-21, 1974; Environmental Arts Conference, April 2-5, 1974; and Southern Highland Handicraft Guild Workshop and Annual Meeting, April 24-27, 1974. Arrowcraft continued to operate smoothly and profitably in 1974. Two hundred forty-nine clubs sold Arrowcraft; forty-seven chapters sold Arrowcraft also. Club sales in May, 1974, totalled $168,008.70; chapter sales, $5,348.09.

An Arrowcraft Design Award was initiated and was publicized to the clubs, chapters, schools, and colleges. Each of three awards was a $100 design purchase, the design to become the property of Arrowcraft for production and marketing. In establishing the award it was hoped to serve two purposes: better understanding and renewed interest in Arrow-craft by Pi Phis and a source of fresh, new design ideas for Arrowcraft. On May 8, 1974, sixteen weavers were honored by a tea at the Staff House. Nella Hill presented sterling silver Stuart Nye pins to each weaver completing twenty-five years of weaving for Arrowcraft. There were seventy weavers, some mothers and daughters, weaving for Arrowcraft at this time and twenty-five pins for a period of twenty years were awarded because an event honoring the weavers had not been held since 1966. One weaver at the tea, Mae Lethco, first wove for Arrowcraft in 1929. Also, for the first time in a number of years Arrowmont offered a course for the Gatlinburg community. Forty-one women and one man signed up for ten weeks of textile techniques during the winter, exploring such crafts as batik, tie-dye, printing, stitchery, quilting, looping, mining, etc. Arrowmont also workedwith the Great Smoky Mountain Park to pro-vide craftsmen to give demonstrations at the Sugarland Visitors Center during summer months.

The Can ' in roject INCE the Canadian Project provided a loan fund for students in the eight schools of social work in Canada, by 1967, the Loan Fund had become self-sustaining. The Canadian Philanthropies Committee grew out of the Canadian Project Fund and administered two projects, the Loan Fund for Social Work students and the Northern Libraries Project. In 1967-1968, the inclusion of the new School of Social Welfare at the University of Calgary brought the number of schools eligible for Loan Funds to nine. The University of British Columbia and the University of Manitoba both agreed to release $500 so that a $1000 Loan Fund could begin in Calgary. A sum of $100 was sent to the Maritime School of Social Work where the fund was used extensively. At the 1967 Convention it was the unanimous decision of the Canadian delegates to adopt the Northern Library Project. Money was sent to supply books to the libraries of the Yukon and Northwest Territories. The Canadian government supplied an adequate budget for the purchase of books, but there was no money available for "extras" such as expensive reference volumes. In July, 1967, a check for $1000 was presented to the Commissioners of the Territories to be divided equally between the libraries. In 1968-1969, the library systems were expanding rapidly in the north where radios and books were man's best friend. Money donated by Pi Phis was used to purchase books that normally would take years to acquire. The Regional Librarian for the Northwest Territories used Pi Phi contributions to build up a fine collection of Artica. The Regional Librarian in the Yukon Territories used the contributions for developing a reference collection. The "Arrow in the Arctic" project continued to contribute to the quality of life of northern Canadian citizens. With the $1000 donations made in 1971 to the Northwest Territory Libraries, a Videorecorder was purchased for use at the Rankin Inlet Library. It proved extremely valuable in taping films of Eskimo storytellers, to show in various communities. In 1972, a $1000 donation was made to the T.ugunngi, the Eskimo story teller, fascinates her listeners with her tales of native traditions and culture. Yukon Library Services. The money was to go to an Indian Resource Center to provide supply books, pamphlets, and periodicals. An addition had been made to the library in White-horse and a children's librarian was added to the staff. Seven hundred dollars was contributed to the libraries in 1969-1970 and the Schools of Social Work found Pi Phi contributions a very useful resource for helping Social Work students in need of short term loans. The Loan Fund for students in Social Work was increased from $150 to $300 maximum in 1971 on a two year trial basis. As a result, the fund was used to a greater extent and the record of payments was improved by 1973. Libraries in Canada's northland continued to benefit during 1973-1974. The sum of $450 was sent to the library services in the Yukon Territories. This money enabled one librarian to employ a person who spoke and read Green-land Eskimo to translate the titles and summarize the contents of some acquired books written in Greenland Eskimo. The library of periodicals, pamphlets, and books, started by Pi Phi contributions in the Indian Brotherhood centers in the Yukon, was given government approval and received funds from this source. The loan funds for social work students which the Canadian Project had established at nine Canadian Universities were under study in 1973-1974. While some universities considered the funds useful, others had not made use of the funds for some time. In 1974, more 27

A sum of $100 was sent to the Maritime School of Social Work where the fund was used extensively. At the 1967 Convention it was the unanimous decision of the Canadian delegates to adopt the Northern Library Project. Money was sent to supply books to the libraries of the Yukon and Northwest Territories. The Canadian government supplied an adequate budget for the purchase of books, but there was no money available for "extras" such as expensive reference volumes. In July, 1967, a check for $1000 was presented to the Commissioners of the Territories to be divided equally between the libraries. In 1968-1969, the library systems were expanding rapidly in the north where radios and books were man's best friend. Money donated by Pi Phis was used to purchase books that normally would take years to acquire. The Regional Librarian for the Northwest Territories used Pi Phi contributions to build up a fine collection of Artica. The Regional Librarian in the Yukon Territories used the contributions for developing a reference collection. The "Arrow in the Arctic" project continued to contribute to the quality of life of northern Canadian citizens. With the $1000 donations made in 1971 to the Northwest Territory Libraries, a Videorecorder was purchased for use at the Rankin Inlet Library. It proved extremely valuable in taping films of Eskimo storytellers, to show in various communities. In 1972, a $1000 donation was made to the T.ugunngi, the Eskimo story teller, fascinates her listeners with her tales of native traditions and culture. Yukon Library Services. The money was to go to an Indian Resource Center to provide supply books, pamphlets, and periodicals. An addition had been made to the library in White-horse and a children's librarian was added to the staff. Seven hundred dollars was contributed to the libraries in 1969-1970 and the Schools of Social Work found Pi Phi contributions a very useful resource for helping Social Work students in need of short term loans. The Loan Fund for students in Social Work was increased from $150 to $300 maximum in 1971 on a two year trial basis. As a result, the fund was used to a greater extent and the record of payments was improved by 1973. Libraries in Canada's northland continued to benefit during 1973-1974. The sum of $450 was sent to the library services in the Yukon Territories. This money enabled one librarian to employ a person who spoke and read Green-land Eskimo to translate the titles and summarize the contents of some acquired books written in Greenland Eskimo. The library of periodicals, pamphlets, and books, started by Pi Phi contributions in the Indian Brotherhood centers in the Yukon, was given government approval and received funds from this source. The loan funds for social work students which the Canadian Project had established at nine Canadian Universities were under study in 1973-1974. While some universities considered the funds useful, others had not made use of the funds for some time. In 1974, more 27

        Miss Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamma, retired in August, 1977, after heading the Settlement School craft program for more than thirty years. Cecile Kendall of Corpus Christi, Texas, Mary Jean Fowler of Houston, Texas, and Helen Lewis, Gatlinburg, Tenn. Retiring were Betty Hall, Henrietta Huff, Betty Kingman, and Olivia Smith Moore. A donation to Arrowmont was made by the Board honoring Olivia Smith Moore for her many years of service to Pi Beta Phi. The Board also presented Helen Lewis with a pewter pitcher upon her retirement as administrator. The individual members of the Board functioned well in their particular capacities. During 1973-1974, a General Mills coupon plan was launched to provide funds for the purchase of needed potters' wheels and looms for Arrowmont. A generous cash donation from Marian Heard and Sandy Blain assisted with the building of a much desired salt kiln for the ceramics department. The fascia board around the Emma Harper Turner building had been contracted for completion. The frame THE ARROW OF PI BETA PNI THE ARROW OF Pi Mil ETA P cottage on the grounds, occupied by Mr. Arlie Watson until his death, was made to house eight graduate students, relieving eight beds for other summer school students. A $4,000 gift from the Dallas Club honoring one of its members, Edythe Mulveyhill Brack, former Grand Council member, enabled the establishment of a photographic studio at Arrowmont. Arrowmont held three special workshops in the spring of 1974: Tennessee Crafts Work-shop, March 21-21, 1974; Environmental Arts Conference, April 2-5, 1974; and Southern Highland Handicraft Guild Workshop and Annual Meeting, April 24-27, 1974. Arrowcraft continued to operate smoothly and profitably in 1974. Two hundred forty-nine clubs sold Arrowcraft; forty-seven chapters sold Arrowcraft also. Club sales in May, 1974, totalled $168,008.70; chapter sales, $5,348.09. Due to price changes from increased material and labor costs, a new bright catalog was published in the summer of 1974, which included several new woven items, the result of suggestions from Pi Phis. An Arrowcraft Design Award was initiated and was publicized to the clubs, chapters, schools, and colleges. Each of three awards was a $100 design purchase, the design to become the property of Arrowcraft for production and marketing. In establishing the award it was hoped to serve two purposes: better understanding and renewed interest in Arrow-craft by Pi Phis and a source of fresh, new design ideas for Arrowcraft. On May 8, 1974, sixteen weavers were honored by a tea at the Staff House. Nella Hill presented sterling silver Stuart Nye pins to each weaver completing twenty-five years of weaving for Arrowcraft. There were seventy weavers, some mothers and daughters, weaving for Arrowcraft at this time and twenty-five pins for a period of twenty years were awarded because an event honoring the weavers had not been held since 1966. One weaver at the tea, Mae Lethco, first wove for Arrowcraft in 1929. Also, for the first time in a number of years Arrowmont offered a course for the Gatlinburg community. Forty-one women and one man signed up for ten weeks of textile techniques during the winter, exploring such crafts as batik, tie-dye, printing, stitchery, quilting, looping, mining, etc. Arrowmont also workedwith the Great Smoky Mountain Park to pro-vide craftsmen to give demonstrations at the Sugarland Visitors Center during summer months. Graduate Assistants gave demonstrations in weaving and pottery. Mrs. Rossiter gave such effective demonstrations and talks on spinning that she came back at the inivitation of the Park to demonstrate for the Park Interpreters' meeting. In the summer of 1975, 971 students at-tended the Arrowmont summer sessions. Thirty-nine states and five foreign countries were represented. Additions to the Arrowmont kitchen and dining facilities were hot and cold buffet carts, a dish caddy, refrigerator, freezer, and a large ice machine. The Betty Crocker coupons which had been collected were used to purchase a three-tiered skutt kiln. Generous donations from the St. Alumnae Club made possible the comp of the Edythe Brack photographic studio contributions from the Dallas Club pure the photographic equipment and the studio was opened for classes in the sump 1976.

The regular information issue of The ARROW was discontinued in 1976. A less expensive Information Bulletin, compiled by Central Office, was substituted. Four issues of The ARROW continued to be published. The editor, following in the footsteps of herTHE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI predecessor, also served as chairman of the Operation Brass Tacks Committee for the National Panhellenic Editors' Conference. In 1975, she became a member of the Executive Board of the Conference.

Since happiness is our best and highest aim we must, if we would attain it, give our attention to virtue, without which we can obtain neither friendship nor any other desirable thing." Cicero The one outstanding thing about Pi Beta Phi is, for me, the opportunity to form lasting friendships. These are friends who are honest with me and with themselves. They are interested in each other and excited with each other's accomplishments without any element of envy. There is a diversity of interests, yet, as Cicero said, they are influenced by the same motives as myself. Pi Phi's standards and ideas are high, as is the quality of friendship and loyalty found in Pi Phi. Cicero's idea of virtue is even expressed by the original founders as they stated an interest in "exerting an influence of virtue and charity." All these qualities are instrumental in producing a unique kind of friendship and loyalty in Pi Phi. It is a feeling which, though starting strongly, grows even greater during pledgeship. It is a feeling which reaffirms the correctness of the decision to pledge Pi Phi. It is a feeling which makes it inconceivable to have done anything else. The final result is one of happiness and pride a happiness which has grown steadily over a period of time and thus is more likely to endure; and a deep pride in being a part of the friendship in Pi Phi, for as Stevenson wrote, "of what shall a man be proud, if he is not proud of his friends?" by Melissa McKee, Oklahoma Beta ...X rro w o t clhe Settlement School HE Centennial Project which was to develop an Arts and Crafts Center at Gatlin-burg, Tennessee, took shape in 1966 when Grand Council appointed a planning board, interviewed architects, and adopted the name of the project: "Arrow in the Smokies." At this time it was hoped that "Arrow in the Smokies" would become one of the few craft centers pioneering in the enrichment and promotion of craft design, while preserving the fine aspects of the traditional crafts. The personnel of the Planning Board was as follows: Evelyn Peters Kyle, Chairman and Grand Vice President of Philanthropies Olivia Smith Moore, Grand Treasurer Louise Rosser Kemp, Grand Treasurer-in-training Marian Heard, Director of Summer Craft Workshop Henrietta McCutchan Huff, Gatlinburg, Tennessee Carol Estes, Del Mar, California Elizabeth Yelm Kingman, Omaha, Nebraska. The first meeting of the Planning Board was planned for February, 1967. The formation of the Board of Control and the permanent Executive Committee to be in charge of the day-by-day running of the Center, plus the appointment of the Director were among the plans discussed. It was determined that the Settlement School Committee would be called the Board of Governors, composed of a chair-man, a secretary, a treasurer, representatives from the University of Tennessee, and the Grand Vice President of Philanthropies. The Craft Center and the Summer Craft Workshop were to be conducted in cooperation with the University of . Tennessee and would be ac-credited by the University. The chairman of the Executive Committee would also serve as chairman of ways and means. The secretary would serve as chairman of promotion and publicity. Each member of the Board of Governors would serve on an active committee. When the plans for the new philanthropy were formulated, the first Board of Governors was appointed: Chairman and Chairman of the Ways and Means, Betty Kingman Vice Chairman, Shirley Jones Mann Secretary and Chairman of the Promotion and Publicity Comm., Henrietta McCutchan Huff Treasurer, Olivia Smith Moore Director of Summer Craft Workshop, Marian Heard Dr. Mills, Head of the Related Arts and Crafts Interior Design Department at the University of Tennessee. Slowed by the advent of a new Board and changes in operating personnel, the new phase in the continuation of the Fraternity's philanthropy progressed rather slowly, in 1967-1968. Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers took over the duties of Arrowcraft Manager in October, as a temporary position until a new manager could be found. Marian Mueller Prince, who had been Settlement School Director for a number of years, continued her administration. After January 1, 1968, when it became apparent there was no Pi Phi yet available to take over, the ability and devotion of these two Pi Phis filled the Fraternity's special needs. Miss Marian Heard, as Director of the craft workshop, conducted a successful summer workshop in the summer of 1967. Subjects taught at this accredited Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee summer program were weaving, textile design, ceramics, enameling, jewelry, recreational crafts, and stitchery. With the Chairman's close association in the museum field and its publications she became aware of the growing importance of the crafts as activities which enhanced the very fabric of civilized society in all aspects. The new artistic explosion had been making itself felt even more in the areas of advertising, industrial design, and interior decoration. In addition, a growing awareness of creative projects which are based on artistic knowledge was reflected in increased attendance at museums in their tours and their arts and crafts classes, and was also reflected in the arts taught in the elementary schools of the nation. A new resident manager was found in April and took over her duties on June first. She was Mrs. Lucile Woodworth. She assumed both the duties of the past Settlement School director and the Arrowcraft manager. She coordinated all administrative activities of "Arrow in the Smokies" under the Board of Governors. 19 20 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Mr. Hubert Bebb, of Gatlinburg, was appointed as the architect for "Arrow in the Smokies" buildings. He completed plans for the exhibit mall which was constructed along the grass strip at the front of the Pi Beta Phi property adjoining the Arrowcraft Shop. In 1968, the twenty-third annual Summer Craft Workshop under the leadership of Marian Heard was composed of teachers, vocational rehabilitation workers, mental health therapists, senior citizens leaders, graduate students, regular college students, citizens, and senior citizens. Their ages ranged from 16 to 80. During the three sessions, there were 72 students enrolled in each. Canada and England were represented as well as 32 from the United States. In 1968, Arrowcraft products were sold by 202 alumnae clubs in varying amounts from small individual sales to very large club sales. Of special note were two sales. Anchorage, Alaska, with a membership of 19 filed an incomplete report of $1,048.30 in sales and Yuba Sutter, California, with 9 members sold $1,025.00. The name for the Fraternity's philanthropy was changed from "Arrow in the Smokies" to Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts in July of 1968. In June, 1969, the National Officers' Work-shop in Gatlinburg gave all present an opportunity to be part of the dedication of the Emma Harper Turner classroom building at Arrowmont. On October 18, 1969, the corner stone was laid for the new classroom building while Grand Council and Arrowmont Board of Goveriors met in Gatlinburg. Standing in the roofless concrete second floor level court, Grand Council in hard hats wielded mortar with a trowel to seal in the engraved corner-stone with accompaniment of prayers of thanksgiving and hope. The articles which were placed in the cornerstone were as follows: History of Settlement School Settlement School publicity, pamphlets Whig Rose book mark' 1969 Arrowcraft catalogue and Arrowcraft pamphlet 1969 Summer Craft Workshop brochure The new Arrowmont brochure Dean Odland's 10th annual letter to alumnae and friends A copy of the booklet "These Shining Things" compiled by Evelyn Peters Kyle A copy of the booklet, "They Stand Tall," a biography of May L. Keller and Amy Burnham Onken, compiled by Marianne Reid Wild and Ruth Williams Hansen Pages from the Information Arrow (1969) giving: Grand Council Members Board of Governors Members Staff of Arrowmont Annual Report of Chairman, Elizabeth Y. Kingman Annual Report of Executive Coordinator, Lucile Woodworth. The committee work of the Board of Governors was mainly in the areas of communication and funding making the concept and work of Arrowmont understood and inspiring, still an uphill job because of the need to replace the old idea of the grade school with the new idea of a unique craft school. The BOG committees were as follows: Academic, Communication with Actives and Alumnae both in Canada and the U.S., Consultants, Cookbook sales, Objectives of the school, Personnel, Policies of the Governors, Program and Promotion, Property Advisory, Public Relations, Scholarships, Slide Programs, Ways and Means, and Special Gifts in the name of individuals or clubs. The 1970 year was one of important "firsts." Arrowmont leaders expected to inaugurate the school on a year round basis, so the center had to have winter staffing for the first time. The staff had to prove that they could support the challenge of this unique complex in Gatlinburg, an idea which had long been evolving through dedicated Pi Phis with vision, and kept alive by faith, hard work, and generosity. It could flower into significance if it was backed by the same Pi Phi attitudes of optimism and purposeful giving, expressed with increased awareness. Because it fostered some of the most positive thinking and activity in the U.S., who could predict where its influence would stop? Arrowmont was PI PHI implementing itself in , education and creativity. The training of the mind, eye, and hand generated beauty and satisfaction. The beautiful new Arrowmont was completed. The donations that were made and the shingles that were bought had helped get the Centennial program underway. The new year-round program was to begin and 25 years of experience in this field and a reputation of excellence in arts and crafts had promoted growth, but the results would reach into every THE ARROW OF P9 BETA PHI community of the country. In 1970, a slide program was made available for everyone and it was hoped that facilities in use year new slides showing the modern would be viewed by every club and chapter. The Summer Workshops were doubled in length with outstanding teachers from many sections of the country participating. The Arrowcraft Shop had had its face lifted. Working conditions improved with additional shipping areas and enlarged storage space. The sales room was also updated hoping that this would make for more efficient operations. The 1969-1970 year was a banner year as clubs and chapters continued to hold Settlement School sales. Visitors flocked to the door of Arrowcraft since it was recognized as the outstanding craft shop in the area. The weaving was a big drawing card, and the sixty-two weavers were kept busy. It was hard to realize that over 20,000 tote bags and 15,000 Daisy Chain mats were woven and sold during this year and that this was just a part of the weaving production. In addition, seventy other craftsmen were kept busy producing other crafts. In 1970-1971, financial support from clubs, chapters, and other Pi Phi members continued to strengthen the national philanthropy. Every Pi Phi who visited or attended school left with pride and determination to spread the word of Arrowmont's work and needs. The former Emma Harper Turner building was leased to Community Tectonics as of December, 1970. They restored the building and made a beautiful addition to the Pi Beta Phi Compound. Other additional income came from renting the Red Barn every weekend when school was not in session to religious groups, college groups including Pi Phis from the University of Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Memphis, and South Carolina, craftsmen from Craftsman's Fair, and Wildflower Pilgrimage leaders. Arrowmont had permanent winter boarders, teachers from Pi Beta Phi Elementary School plus many paying guests at Staff House. Arrowmont honors had been numerous. Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, was named Alumni Distinguished Service Professor at the President's Honors Banquet at the University of Tennessee. Tennessee Art Commission award Pi Beta Phi a commendation for Arrowmont work. They also had given $2000 to hold a workshop for Craftsmen for 21 the State of Tennessee the next year. Arrowmont had been chosen for the meeting place of National Council of Education for Ceramic Arts in March, 1972, and 500 to 600 potters attended. Persis Grayson, one of the Arrowmont teachers, had been made president of Handweavers Guild of America. Harland Bartholomew and Associates had just submitted new comprehensive plans for the City of Gatlinburg. In the letter of transmittal for the plan was the following statement: The cultural center of the city should be Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. Continued construction of motels, shops and `attractions' may soon reach a point in which congestions and commercialism might begin to outweigh the things that have made the town so attractive to visitors in the past. This tremendous economic pressure might be counterbalanced by a strong cultural force in the community. Many local groups used the facilities for meeting and were interested and enthused about the Arrowmont program. Bus tours brought visitors to Arrowcraft, and many were asking to see Arrowmont. This year the representatives of Junior Colleges of Southeast were in Gatlinburg for convention and asked to tour and hear about the Pi Beta Phi philanthropic work. Chapters and clubs indicated a general solicitude for sincere friendship, real objects of life, happiness of humanity, and mental, moral, and social advancement exemplified in the diversity of community and campus welfare projects as well as increased interest in Fraternity philanthropies. This was apparent in the growth of concern and contributions for Arrowmont, Holt House, and the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Fund in 1971-1972. Much credit should go to the alumnae province presidents who gave clubs a better under-standing of the worth and need of Arrowmont in particular. Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts held a distinctive reputation for instruction under the fine directorship of Marian G. Heard and her splendid staff. A year around program had not been realized due to lack of operating funds, but summer craft workshop classes were full to overflowing with applicants turned away for lack of housing and dining facilities. This noteworthy project which attracted students from all areas of the country and numerous 22 foreign countries was wholly supported by Pi Beta Phis. There was no doubt about the role which Arrowmont played as a major philanthropy when the far reaching impact of craft instruction was evaluated. By learning or improving skills, students in turn were able to enrich otherwise colorless lives of many people by the joy of creating with their hands. No small part of the instruction led to creating a source of earning a livelihood. The Arrowcraft shop enjoyed an outstanding year of production and sales in 1971-1972. A surge of clubs' spring sales kept the shop busy filling orders and, in order to fill heavy Christmas orders, even the administrator and office staff helped out in various capacities. The shop personnel worked under the handicap of crowded conditions but their interest and loyalty made it possible for mountain crafts-men to rely upon Arrowcraft for their livelihood. One such family, including the father, depended upon weaving as its sole income. Several changes in personnel had occurred, but the work of the Fraternity in Gatlinburg continued to expand. The Arrowcraft Shop added new crafts to its inventory while maintaining the weaving department at a high level of activity. The 1972 Summer Craft School conducted three two-week courses and four one-week courses to provide opportunities for more people to come to the classes. The financial support by the members of the Fraternity had increased each year and administrators were counting on their increasing interest, enthusiasm, and understanding of the Arrowmont goals. In October, Lucile McCutchan Woodworth resigned as Executive Coordinator. Helen Anderson Lewis became Resident Administrator, and continued in that capacity. In April, the Board of Governors offered Mrs. Lewis a contract as Administrator and she accepted. Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts, was successful in conducting additional craft workshops during the year. It was anticipated that the number of workshops would increase in her time. Through her efforts, Arrowmont's fame was spreading throughout the craft world to those who would learn more about that world and its opportunities for service. The scholarships given by the chapters, clubs, and provinces served as a firsthand BROW OF PI BETA PHI liaison between Arrowmont and members of the Fraternity. The community of each donating group was richly served when the scholar-ship recipient returned to use his or her newly learned skills in philanthropic or educational areas. The list of Arrowmont students and staff was divided into provinces and sent to each province officer for distribution to the clubs and chapters. It was hoped that each group would contact those in its area. This could be a two-fold education; the student or staff member would learn that Pi Phis in his or her own community were among those responsible for the existence of Arrowmont, and the Pi Phis would learn more about the work done by their contributions. Arrowcraft had a very good year in 1971-1972 with total sales exceeding those of 197 -1971. Two hundred fifty-one clubs and thirty-seven chapters sold Arrowcraft. There were fewer returns of merchandise and in most cases, the clubs and chapters responded to the Director's request to pay their bills promptly after their sales. The Red Barn continued to be a popular place for weekend retreats. Bookings were made for weekends months ahead. The Barn was set up with 34 beds and 6 rollaway beds. In 1971, two beds in the teachers' cottage and one bed in Pollard, plus another rollaway in Staff House, were added. This made a total of 102 beds for staff, faculty, and students during the summer. In addition, two beds were placed in the vacant room in the Administrative office building for Helen and Bob Russell, Helen serving as librarian at Arrowmont during the summer of 1972. A successful workshop program was realized in 1972 with 123 students registering for each of the first two sessions. Most classes were completely filled, and it was necessary to turn some people away for lack of space in classes, or for lack of housing. Faculty members were outstanding craftsmen as well as excellent teachers, many having taught at Arrowmont in past years.

The Can ' in roject INCE the Canadian Project provided a loan fund for students in the eight schools of social work in Canada, by 1967, the Loan Fund had become self-sustaining. The Canadian Philanthropies Committee grew out of the Canadian Project Fund and administered two projects, the Loan Fund for Social Work students and the Northern Libraries Project. In 1967-1968, the inclusion of the new School of Social Welfare at the University of Calgary brought the number of schools eligible for Loan Funds to nine. The University of British Columbia and the University of Manitoba both agreed to release $500 so that a $1000 Loan Fund could begin in Calgary. A sum of $100 was sent to the Maritime School of Social Work where the fund was used extensively. At the 1967 Convention it was the unanimous decision of the Canadian delegates to adopt the Northern Library Project. Money was sent to supply books to the libraries of the Yukon and Northwest Territories. The Canadian government supplied an adequate budget for the purchase of books, but there was no money available for "extras" such as expensive reference volumes. In July, 1967, a check for $1000 was presented to the Commissioners of the Territories to be divided equally between the libraries. In 1968-1969, the library systems were expanding rapidly in the north where radios and books were man's best friend. Money donated by Pi Phis was used to purchase books that normally would take years to acquire. The Regional Librarian for the Northwest Territories used Pi Phi contributions to build up a fine collection of Artica. The Regional Librarian in the Yukon Territories used the contributions for developing a reference collection. The "Arrow in the Arctic" project continued to contribute to the quality of life of northern Canadian citizens. With the $1000 donations made in 1971 to the Northwest Territory Libraries, a Videorecorder was purchased for use at the Rankin Inlet Library. It proved extremely valuable in taping films of Eskimo storytellers, to show in various communities. In 1972, a $1000 donation was made to the T.ugunngi, the Eskimo story teller, fascinates her listeners with her tales of native traditions and culture. Yukon Library Services. The money was to go to an Indian Resource Center to provide supply books, pamphlets, and periodicals. An addition had been made to the library in White-horse and a children's librarian was added to the staff. Seven hundred dollars was contributed to the libraries in 1969-1970 and the Schools of Social Work found Pi Phi contributions a very useful resource for helping Social Work students in need of short term loans. The Loan Fund for students in Social Work was increased from $150 to $300 maximum in 1971 on a two year trial basis. As a result, the fund was used to a greater extent and the record of payments was improved by 1973. Libraries in Canada's northland continued to benefit during 1973-1974. The sum of $450 was sent to the library services in the Yukon Territories. This money enabled one librarian to employ a person who spoke and read Green-land Eskimo to translate the titles and summarize the contents of some acquired books written in Greenland Eskimo. The library of periodicals, pamphlets, and books, started by Pi Phi contributions in the Indian Brotherhood centers in the Yukon, was given government approval and received funds from this source. The loan funds for social work students which the Canadian Project had established at nine Canadian Universities were under study in 1973-1974. While some universities considered the funds useful, others had not made use of the funds for some time. In 1974, more 27
