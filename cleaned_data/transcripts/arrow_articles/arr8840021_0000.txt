Patricia Neal Tours Arrowmont "It makes me proud to be a Pi Phi !" Patricia Neal, Academy Award winning ac-tress and an Illinois Epsilon Pi Phi, gave her own rave notices to Arrowmont, on her first visit to Gatlinburg, last April, since she was 16 years old. Accompanied by her husband, Raold Dahl, noted writer of horror stories and fine children's books, and her teacher-therapist, Valerie Eaton-Griffith, Pat was greatly impressed with the physical plant at Arrowmont. She wished she could have seen the school while it was in session, so that she could see the students and teachers at their work. Her therapist even ex-pressed the desire to attend an Arrowmont session to take a course or two. Miss Neal had returned to the United States from her home in England to participate in a conference on brain injury in Savannah, Ga. She took a few days to visit Knoxville, Gatlin-burg, and other scenes of her childhood and youth.

As Mrs. Pearle Whaley Ownby, Mrs. Emma Maples Pollack, Mrs. Emma Reagan Ow*, and Mrs. Lucinda Oakley Ogle shared their reminiscences, each expressed her gratitude, not only for what the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School had meant to her personally but also for the benefits it brought to the community of Gatlin-burg. Board member Henrietta McCutchan Huff, Missouri Beta, who came to the Settlement School as a teacher and stayed on as the bride of one of Gatlinburg's leading citizens, introduced the four guests. Pearl Whaley Ownby was the wife of the late Steve Whaley and their six children attended our school. Mr. Whaley was a member of the local advisory committee for Settlement School, and gave a large sum of money for the purchase of land for the school. On December 19, 1919, he wrote the following letter for The ARROW: Standing: Betty Bailey Hall, Chairman, Arrowmont Board of Governors, Lucinda Oakley Ogle, Emma Reagan Ownby. Seated: Emma Maples Pollack, Pearle Whaley Ownby. I take this pleasure to congratulate you for what your school has done for our community and the advancement and improvement on our boys and girls. I think it is wonderful how they can perform on the stage, debate subjects and recite recitations. A great number of them could not read or write, in fact many of them did not know anything when you came to us with your Blessed School. I can't express the gratitude of my heart for what you have already done for our children. My good wife and I are working hard on our little mountain farm to clothe and feed our little ones. W'as it not for your school we never could educate them in the world. I feel very glad that I helped you with a little mite of money to establish your school. I wish I was able to help with more. Your good work is just begun. There are many . . . children yet that must he brought into your school. Many of them are poor and without much clothes, yet these precious minds must be developed by somebody, or else they will grow to the stature of ignorant manhood and womanhood. I feel you all need help in a financial way but wherever is it to come from? Probably somebody will get a vision of the great work you are doing and lend a helping hand to develop our boys and girls. Another of the luncheon guests, Emma Maples Pollack, was one of the school's early students. Because Miss Martha Hill, the first teacher, was afraid to stay alone, Emma Maples (a young girl of 9) lived with her that first year. Emma's father, Squire I. L. Maples, lived beside the road just a short distance from the first teacher's cottage, now called Pollard Cottage. He also gave a large sum of money to help buy the land for Settlement School. On March 11, 1920, Emma wrote the following account for The ARROW: How I wish each of you Pi Beta Phis knew just how much the dear old Pi Beta Phi School has meant to our community and the many girls and boys of this section of the Great Smokies. In the year 1912 the school was first started with one teacher, Miss Martha Hill from Nashville. The Pi Beta Phis purchased their land from Mr. E. E. Ogle which had a three room THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 23 cottage, a barn and a store. I lived in this cottage with Miss Hill for a year. Soon the dear little Pi Beta Phi school began to grow. The people saw what the school was doing ,for the boys and girls who attended. In 1914 the Pi Beta Phis went to work and built a six roomed school house with all the desks necessary, and running water, good heating system, and were equipped for manual training and domestic science, and year by year we have more teachers till now we have four. In .1916 they finished up an eleven roomed house for the teachers. The girls and boys enjoy open house in this building on Friday nights. We sometimes sing and play games. The Pi Beta Phis now use the old cottage for a girls' dormitory and recently have remodeled the Stuart cottage for which they use as a boys' dormitory. The School has not only inthused the people to build good roads . . . so the children can come to school in more ease, but inthused the girls and boys to look forward in life to bigger and better things. We sincerely hope with the help of the Pi Beta his we can some day have a high school. Mrs. Lucinda Oakley Ogle, another luncheon guest, was the first dormitory student when she was eleven years old. Recently she has compiled maps of the area as it used to be and has helped to write a history of the section. In anticipation of the Board of Governors' luncheon, she penned the . following' reminiscence: I, Lucinda, was eleven years old, never had gone to school, but Grandfather Oakley had taught me a little. I was the baby sitter for our family of twelve children. My older brother and I were walking five miles (to school) . . . When the weather got so bad I stopped going. Miss Evelyn Bishop and little Emily P. Bur-ton came and persuaded my parents to let me come and live with them. They put me in a cot in the hall. This was not my home for long. The Teachers Cottage had no central heat at that time, I don't think, because Miss Lucy Michelson, the weaving teacher, would have me sleep with her. She called me her little heating stove. All I remember of her is her cold feet. I did weaving for my keep and helped Aunt Lizzie Reagan in the kitchen. The weaving was sent to sorority places to be' sold. Later more girls were brought to keep at what we' called the girls' dormitory. My sister, Martha, was one of these. In six years I had finished all the grades we had at that time, through the second year of high school. Nothing else to do, I got more interested in boys. In November, 1926, I was a child-bride. I married my school days' sweetheart and I have never regretted it for one minute either. But I have never forgotten or quit being thankful for what the school did for me. One important thing, it helped prepare us all for the invasion of tourists so we could make a better living. Many thanks to the Pi Phis for always. Mrs. Emma Reagan Ownby's first husband, Otha Reagan, was the maintenance supervisor at the Settlement School from 1924 to 1935. Emma wove for Arrowcraft Shop for 25 years. When the Great Smoky National Park was started, she built one of the first motels on Roaring Fork Road. Their son, V. Hal Reagan, now operates the motel. Attention! A full-time Administrator for Arrowmont is needed. Applicants should have broad business experience since the Administrator will serve as personnel and public relations director. It is preferable that applicants be members of Pi Beta Phi, but other applicants, both men and women, will be considered. For further information, please write to: Mrs. Adin H.

Gunston Hall on the Potomac, historic home of colonial patriot George Mason, one of the Virginia delegates Arrowcraft Goes Colonial Gunston Hall So fa Arrowcraft has stepped into the pages of colonial history through the doorway of Gunston Hall, the home of an early patriot, George Ma-son, who authored the Virginia Declaration of Rights on which the first ten amendments of the United States Constitution are based. Located 15 miles south of Alexandria, Virginia, Gunston Hall was completed in 1758. It is now owned by the state and is supervised by the National Society of Colonial Dames through a board of regents. Early last year when the board wished to or-der some hand-woven wool with which to reupholster a Chippendale camel-back sofa at Gunston Hall, they consulted Mary Frances David-son, who has taught vegetable dyeing at Pi Beta Phi-UT summer workshops for many years. She agreed to dye the wool, and it was arranged, through Arrowmont, for Blanche Huskey, long-time Arrowcraft weaver, to do the weaving. Nella Hill, Arrowcraft designer, labored to du-plicate the original pattern, which had a cotton warp and a woolen weft. Since this could not be copied accurately, the fabric was woven with all woolen threads. Madder was ordered from Australia in order to obtain the correct shade of red. Mary Frances's biggest problem was finding a large enough container in which to do the dyeing. For the weft she needed to dye eight pounds of wool all at the same time in a pot which would hold enough water to give it a proper A drawing of the "Camelback" sofa at Gunston Hall which was recently reupholstered with handwoven Arrowcraft wool.

She carried it to the Staff House kitchen, and she and Lucile Woodworth stirred the wool over the Arrowmont stove. After the thread was dyed and dried, Mrs. Huskey wove it into a fabric 12 yards long and 34 inches wide, with 30 thread ends to the inch. The job took about two weeks. And then the upholsterer took over. Now, whenever Pi Phis visit Mount Vernon to see the home of George Washington, they should follow through by driving a few miles further south to visit the home of one of his dear friends, George Mason, and to admire the hand-woven Arrowcraft fabric on his Chippendale sofa.

Knox County Teacher Uses Craft Therapy Most of us will be lucky. We will never lose the use of our arms or legs. We will never be-come blind. We will never be permanently bed-ridden. But what about those who are not so lucky? Who will help them? Can we? We can't all become doctors or nurses or even therapists. So what can we do ? We can remember people like Sarah Lawson, an arts and crafts hospital teacher from the Knox County school system in Tennessee. We can make it possible for others to follow in her footsteps. Miss Lawson, who holds a Distinguished Service Award from the Tennessee Federation of Councils for Exceptional Children, has aug A boy, paralyzed except for head and neck movements, making mosaics by using a tool in his mouth, while Miss Sarah Lawson supervises. mented her craft training at Pi Phi-UT summer workshops, although she has an M.S. degree from UT and has taken advanced training in special education at Syracuse University. She has taught arts and crafts to hospitalized children in Knoxville's five hospitals for many years. In order to give the young people as many creative experiences as possible, Miss Lawson must often improvise special methods. Handicapped herself, she has a special understanding for their problems. She has served as president of the Special Education Teachers of Knox County and is a member of Alpha Delta Kappa teachers' sorority. Pi Beta Phi, through Arrowmont, continues to offer encouragement and inspiration to hundreds of temporary students who, like Miss Lawson, will utilize their Arrowmont experiences in their personal, enduring efforts to brighten the lives of the handicapped. Miss Lawson instructs a high-school girl who is creating a stitchery wall-hanging. Arrowcraft Afghans Make Flashy Fashions Pat Wright Bercel, California Alpha, above left, didn't need an afghan. But she loved the textures and colors of the lovely coverlets in the Arrowcraft sale. So she bought them anyway and took them to her dressmaker, who converted them into the fashionable skirts modelled, in the accompanying photograph, by Pat and Shirley Gage Lesnett, California Delta. From the fabric left over from the skirts, the dressmaker created a stole to match the skirt Shirley is wearing and a vest to go with the one Pat is modelling (not shown.) The skirts are belted with luggage bands, also from Arrowcraft. Woolen fringe adds a finishing touch to both outfits. The skirt Shirley is modelling is in shades of green and rust. Pat is wearing a white skirt, highlighted with rust-colored threads. Spectacular Egyptian necklaces and Arrow-craft tote bags complete the outfits, which might inspire other imaginative Pi Phis to explore new uses for Arrowcraft products. Teacher Praises uality o f Courses (Ed. Note: The following letter was sent to Henrietta McCutchan Huff after last summer's workshop. Our purpose for quoting it here is obvious.) Dear Mrs. Huff : This is my opportunity to thank the Albuquerque (N.M.) Pi Phi Alumni Club for awarding me their 1971 scholarship to Arrowmont and at the same time give you a little in-formation about me and my trip to Gatlinburg. As a Minnesota Alpha I was familiar with Arrowmont but really didn't realize all that it had to offer until I arrived for my two weeks in Au-gust. I took the crafts media and jewelry courses for graduate credit and found them to be a tremendous help in my work. I teach art at an Albuquerque high school, and this year we incorporated an extensive crafts course into our pro-gram. The 30 to 40 slides I took at Arrowmont have been shown to many people, from my students to the local Pi Phi alumnae club. The beauty of the school, its surroundings, plus the quality and concentration of the courses made my two weeks at Arrowmont a fabulous experience. Sincerely, Mrs. A. T. (Barbara) Schwyzer Helen Lewis, Acting Settlement School Administrator, demonstrates technique for attaching labels to Arrow-craft items. Every label is hand-sewn to the article. This work is done in the back room of the Arrowcraft Shop. Boulder Triad Sponsors Sant A most interesting project was undertaken last December by the Boulder (Colo.) Alum= Club, when that group, along with Theta and Kappa alumnae, brought Santa Claus to Boulder for two weekends. Santa's Boulder home was historic Bergheim House, owned by the city. Santa came with his colorful entourage of elves, storybook characters, and Mrs. Santa. Hundreds of volunteers worked nearly a full year to make sure all was ready for this special visitor. Barbara Clingman Galna, club president, was general chairman. Other Pi Phis on the steering committee were Sue Sayre leuter, Cirrelda Barnard Mills, and Carol Richardson Smythe. The alum= clubs were the chief sponsors and were ably assisted by the Jaycees, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, church youth groups and many businesses in the community. Many groups, such as the children from Headstart, were admitted free. While the adults browsed in their special boutique, the children frolicked between their playroom, the puppet show, the children's boutique where all items sold for-a dollar or less, had their picture taken with Santa in his sleigh, and visited Mrs. Santa in the candy kitchen where each child received a candy cane. Children from the Presbyterian Preschool in Boulder visited Santa's House and were enthralled with the show playing at the puppet theater. Mrs. Santa, who had a basket full of candy canes for the kids, was there through courtesy of Mrs. Lucille Andrews, Pi Phi house-mother. by SHIRLEY SCOTT EVINGER Boulder Alumnae Clu, Winnie the Pooh welcomes an excited young lady tc Santa's house.

Gunston Hall on the Potomac, historic home of colonial patriot George Mason, one of the Virginia delegates Arrowcraft Goes Colonial Gunston Hall So fa Arrowcraft has stepped into the pages of colonial history through the doorway of Gunston Hall, the home of an early patriot, George Ma-son, who authored the Virginia Declaration of Rights on which the first ten amendments of the United States Constitution are based. Located 15 miles south of Alexandria, Virginia, Gunston Hall was completed in 1758. It is now owned by the state and is supervised by the National Society of Colonial Dames through a board of regents. Early last year when the board wished to or-der some hand-woven wool with which to reupholster a Chippendale camel-back sofa at Gunston Hall, they consulted Mary Frances David-son, who has taught vegetable dyeing at Pi Beta Phi-UT summer workshops for many years. She agreed to dye the wool, and it was arranged, through Arrowmont, for Blanche Huskey, long-time Arrowcraft weaver, to do the weaving. Nella Hill, Arrowcraft designer, labored to du-plicate the original pattern, which had a cotton warp and a woolen weft. Since this could not be copied accurately, the fabric was woven with all woolen threads. Madder was ordered from Australia in order to obtain the correct shade of red. Mary Frances's biggest problem was finding a large enough container in which to do the dyeing. For the weft she needed to dye eight pounds of wool all at the same time in a pot which would hold enough water to give it a proper A drawing of the "Camelback" sofa at Gunston Hall which was recently reupholstered with handwoven Arrowcraft wool.

She carried it to the Staff House kitchen, and she and Lucile Woodworth stirred the wool over the Arrowmont stove. After the thread was dyed and dried, Mrs. Huskey wove it into a fabric 12 yards long and 34 inches wide, with 30 thread ends to the inch. The job took about two weeks. And then the upholsterer took over. Now, whenever Pi Phis visit Mount Vernon to see the home of George Washington, they should follow through by driving a few miles further south to visit the home of one of his dear friends, George Mason, and to admire the hand-woven Arrowcraft fabric on his Chippendale sofa.

But what about those who are not so lucky? Who will help them? Can we? We can't all become doctors or nurses or even therapists. So what can we do ? We can remember people like Sarah Lawson, an arts and crafts hospital teacher from the Knox County school system in Tennessee. We can make it possible for others to follow in her footsteps.

She has taught arts and crafts to hospitalized children in Knoxville's five hospitals for many years. In order to give the young people as many creative experiences as possible, Miss Lawson must often improvise special methods. Handicapped herself, she has a special understanding for their problems. She has served as president of the Special Education Teachers of Knox County and is a member of Alpha Delta Kappa teachers' sorority. Pi Beta Phi, through Arrowmont, continues to offer encouragement and inspiration to hundreds of temporary students who, like Miss Lawson, will utilize their Arrowmont experiences in their personal, enduring efforts to brighten the lives of the handicapped.

Patricia Neal Tours Arrowmont "It makes me proud to be a Pi Phi !" Patricia Neal, Academy Award winning ac-tress and an Illinois Epsilon Pi Phi, gave her own rave notices to Arrowmont, on her first visit to Gatlinburg, last April, since she was 16 years old. Accompanied by her husband, Raold Dahl, noted writer of horror stories and fine children's books, and her teacher-therapist, Valerie Eaton-Griffith, Pat was greatly impressed with the physical plant at Arrowmont. She wished she could have seen the school while it was in session, so that she could see the students and teachers at their work. Her therapist even ex-pressed the desire to attend an Arrowmont session to take a course or two. Miss Neal had returned to the United States from her home in England to participate in a conference on brain injury in Savannah, Ga. She took a few days to visit Knoxville, Gatlin-burg, and other scenes of her childhood and youth.

As Mrs. Pearle Whaley Ownby, Mrs. Emma Maples Pollack, Mrs. Emma Reagan Ow*, and Mrs. Lucinda Oakley Ogle shared their reminiscences, each expressed her gratitude, not only for what the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School had meant to her personally but also for the benefits it brought to the community of Gatlin-burg. Board member Henrietta McCutchan Huff, Missouri Beta, who came to the Settlement School as a teacher and stayed on as the bride of one of Gatlinburg's leading citizens, introduced the four guests. Pearl Whaley Ownby was the wife of the late Steve Whaley and their six children attended our school. Mr. Whaley was a member of the local advisory committee for Settlement School, and gave a large sum of money for the purchase of land for the school. On December 19, 1919, he wrote the following letter for The ARROW: Standing: Betty Bailey Hall, Chairman, Arrowmont Board of Governors, Lucinda Oakley Ogle, Emma Reagan Ownby. Seated: Emma Maples Pollack, Pearle Whaley Ownby. I take this pleasure to congratulate you for what your school has done for our community and the advancement and improvement on our boys and girls. I think it is wonderful how they can perform on the stage, debate subjects and recite recitations. A great number of them could not read or write, in fact many of them did not know anything when you came to us with your Blessed School. I can't express the gratitude of my heart for what you have already done for our children. My good wife and I are working hard on our little mountain farm to clothe and feed our little ones. W'as it not for your school we never could educate them in the world. I feel very glad that I helped you with a little mite of money to establish your school. I wish I was able to help with more. Your good work is just begun. There are many . . . children yet that must he brought into your school. Many of them are poor and without much clothes, yet these precious minds must be developed by somebody, or else they will grow to the stature of ignorant manhood and womanhood. I feel you all need help in a financial way but wherever is it to come from? Probably somebody will get a vision of the great work you are doing and lend a helping hand to develop our boys and girls. Another of the luncheon guests, Emma Maples Pollack, was one of the school's early students. Because Miss Martha Hill, the first teacher, was afraid to stay alone, Emma Maples (a young girl of 9) lived with her that first year. Emma's father, Squire I. L. Maples, lived beside the road just a short distance from the first teacher's cottage, now called Pollard Cottage. He also gave a large sum of money to help buy the land for Settlement School. On March 11, 1920, Emma wrote the following account for The ARROW: How I wish each of you Pi Beta Phis knew just how much the dear old Pi Beta Phi School has meant to our community and the many girls and boys of this section of the Great Smokies. In the year 1912 the school was first started with one teacher, Miss Martha Hill from Nashville. The Pi Beta Phis purchased their land from Mr. E. E. Ogle which had a three room THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 23 cottage, a barn and a store. I lived in this cottage with Miss Hill for a year. Soon the dear little Pi Beta Phi school began to grow. The people saw what the school was doing ,for the boys and girls who attended. In 1914 the Pi Beta Phis went to work and built a six roomed school house with all the desks necessary, and running water, good heating system, and were equipped for manual training and domestic science, and year by year we have more teachers till now we have four. In .1916 they finished up an eleven roomed house for the teachers. The girls and boys enjoy open house in this building on Friday nights. We sometimes sing and play games. The Pi Beta Phis now use the old cottage for a girls' dormitory and recently have remodeled the Stuart cottage for which they use as a boys' dormitory. The School has not only inthused the people to build good roads . . . so the children can come to school in more ease, but inthused the girls and boys to look forward in life to bigger and better things. We sincerely hope with the help of the Pi Beta his we can some day have a high school. Mrs. Lucinda Oakley Ogle, another luncheon guest, was the first dormitory student when she was eleven years old. Recently she has compiled maps of the area as it used to be and has helped to write a history of the section. In anticipation of the Board of Governors' luncheon, she penned the . following' reminiscence: I, Lucinda, was eleven years old, never had gone to school, but Grandfather Oakley had taught me a little. I was the baby sitter for our family of twelve children. My older brother and I were walking five miles (to school) . . . When the weather got so bad I stopped going. Miss Evelyn Bishop and little Emily P. Bur-ton came and persuaded my parents to let me come and live with them. They put me in a cot in the hall. This was not my home for long. The Teachers Cottage had no central heat at that time, I don't think, because Miss Lucy Michelson, the weaving teacher, would have me sleep with her. She called me her little heating stove. All I remember of her is her cold feet. I did weaving for my keep and helped Aunt Lizzie Reagan in the kitchen. The weaving was sent to sorority places to be' sold. Later more girls were brought to keep at what we' called the girls' dormitory. My sister, Martha, was one of these. In six years I had finished all the grades we had at that time, through the second year of high school. Nothing else to do, I got more interested in boys. In November, 1926, I was a child-bride. I married my school days' sweetheart and I have never regretted it for one minute either. But I have never forgotten or quit being thankful for what the school did for me. One important thing, it helped prepare us all for the invasion of tourists so we could make a better living. Many thanks to the Pi Phis for always. Mrs. Emma Reagan Ownby's first husband, Otha Reagan, was the maintenance supervisor at the Settlement School from 1924 to 1935. Emma wove for Arrowcraft Shop for 25 years. When the Great Smoky National Park was started, she built one of the first motels on Roaring Fork Road. Their son, V. Hal Reagan, now operates the motel. Attention!
