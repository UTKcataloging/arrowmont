WORK AMONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINEERS 427 WORK AMONG THE SOUTHERN MOUN TAINEERS Two meetings of the New York Alumnae Club reported by Florence E. Hubbard, New York Beta I " REPORT OF THE SPEECH OF THE REVEREND H. P. VAUGHN OF UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY I think that this is a splendid thing that you have undertaken. A fraternity needs an objective. We have neglected the big things. We have not in the past paid enough attention to the other side of the question : What are you going to do with knowledge? What are you going to do with influence? I am doubly interested in these people. There is a tradition in our family that I belong to the mountains. My father was a mountaineer, born in the mountains of Carolina, and when I got among them I felt like I was back home. I was not a missionary, but a college man out for the summer acting as an agent. I took life about as easy as the mountaineers. First of all, they are hospitable. There were several of us who contracted to meet on Sunday and relate our experience, and when I got back the first week and the boys began to tell how much they had spent, I felt ashamed. I thought I had been imposing on people. My total expenses for the week were twenty cents. I don't know why I spent that 1 I enjoyed being with the people so much I felt like I was home, and they felt so, too. They felt it was an offense to offer them anything. There is a book published in the last few years by Davenport, called "Primitive Traits in Religious Revivals." In that book there is the best scientific discussion of the mountain people. Many books have been published by missionaries, and so forth, but they have been more or less superficial. This, however, has gotten at the root of that interesting phenomenon, the Kentucky revival. ' The people are largely Scotch-Irish. It is said that they are so fond of theological discussion that .if the potato crop should fail any year they could live on the shorter catechism. They are also an emotional type of people, and responded readily to the religious movement. They had to be alert and ready to defend themselves. They were fearless of anything they could put their fingers on, anything that 428 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI they actually knew about, but when powerful preachers came down and preached about devils and hell, it completely swept them away. They had back in their consciousness the feeling that they were violating everything when they refused to carry out the teachings of Knox and Calvin. They knew that they were doing wrong. Then they became alarmed and there was a stampede. It is to be hoped that no such thing will ever occur again. I am a minister and not trying to discount religious revivals but religion and morality must go hand in hand. They are a motor emotional people, with a tendency toward the dogmatic. When they get anything in their heads they stick to it. Great preachers, philosophers, and thinkers will come from the mountain people. Some of their most interesting discussions are religious. You have to be careful about words with them, because they define words. One man, for instance, lost out because he tried to have them repeat, in the creed, the words, "Holy Catholic Church." They replied, "Not for us." It is a fight between Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists. No others need apply. Most of the people that I saw lived along the French Broad River, from Morristown, Tenn., to Asheville, N. C. They live in the open air, and the women at forty, mothers of large families, look scarcely more than twenty. The families in the mountains are scarcely ever less than ten. One man, who considered himself peculiarly unfortunate because he had no children, explained it to me in this way: "A man and his wife and six children can hoe eight rows of corn at a time. I, with my wife and no children, can hoe only two rows. Don't you see that they are four times as well off as I am?" They do not have a broad outlook upon life because they are cut loose from things. There is only one decent railroad that goes south from Hot Springs. That was put in at great expense by the government. Their only other way of communicating with the outside world is through the county newspaper, and I want to say right here, all honor to the county newspaper! It usually has more common sense and a broader outlook on life than most of our city papers. It is unprejudiced. There is no boss behind it to say what shall be printed and what shall not be printed. These men and women actually read the newspaper and think about what they read. I found one man, who couldn't read but had had the newspaper read WORK AMONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINEERS 429 to him, who could upset all our talking on the tariff because he had done some thinking. They think consecutively and I hope that in the work that is done down there you will take into consideration their logical type of mind and the fact that they work things through to an end. I want to tell you about the most interesting character I met. No man ever impressed me more than John Williams. Af ter I had gotten away from the railroad about fifteen miles I began to find I could take no more orders for books. No one wanted to buy. But presently people began to say, "We can't buy this, but John Williams will buy one." So I became interested in John Williams. About three o'clock I came to his house. There was a woman outside picking berries, and I walked up to the gate and asked if I might spend the night there. The woman looked up. "Stranger, did you see that briar-patch below the house? That's the supper-table. If you can put up with that, come in." Presently a wagon stopped at the gate and I saw a man of fifty or more climb down. As he started to get down, he saw that there was a stranger there. "Hello, stranger." And I replied, "Hello." "Can I spend the night here ?" I said, "Stranger, did you see that briar-patch below the house? That's the supper-table. If you can put up with that, come in." That was John. Williams. We talked until one o'clock, and we are friends to this day. He was one of the sunniest fellows. He had a wife and fourteen children, and two rooms in his house. Talk about the tenement-house proposition! With all out-of-doors to spare they build these little two-room shacks. I hope you will teach them to build beautiful log-houses. They can do it. There were fourteen children and no education. Then one day a woman from the Presbyterian Home Mission Board started a school about ten miles away. John Williams could not afford to send his children there to board, neither could they go back and forth every day, so he bought eight acres of land as close as he could get to the schoolhouse. This was a couple of miles away, but they didn't mind walking that. They built a log-cabin with a loft. He could 430 THE A.R.R OW OF PI BETA PHI furnish food, and tuition was free, and in this way he sent seven of his children to school. He told how' proud he was of his little boy Henry, who made the greatest progress of any child in school. I was much interested to see Henry, and presently, as we were seated at the supper-table (not in the briar-patch, by the way) little Henry came in. He had been to school one year. He was four inches taller than I, weighed 175 pounds, and had a really distinguished moustache. Don't forget that these people are influenced more by their environment than you are ever going to influence them. Any school you put up is going to be affected by their personality. Take them into consideration or you will be discouraged. They should be taught soil cultivation, dairying, sheep-growing, fruit-farming, as well as house-building. Millions are going away from there. There are four millions of these mountaineers, with only eighteen to a square mile. Why should they not be prepared to stay right there and build up industries? They can do it and they ought to do it. The people who leave the mountains, those who go to the cotton mills, are not the best type. They have very large families and put their children into the mills, while the men stay at home, and do nothing. Most of them become drunk. They look upon their children simply as so many "hands." The children suffer in the mills and many of them die. A man who had lost one of his children complained bitterly, "God's been hard on me. He took one of my best hands." There was no thought of the child but he had lost fifty cents a day! The possibilities among the mountaineers themselves are the best we have to-day. You will find that there has already been something done. There are schools there, forty, fifty, or one hundred and fifty miles apart, and let it be said to their everlasting honor, you can't go within ten miles of a school without knowing it. The Farm School, close to Asheville, N. C., is the only one doing anything for the boys. Public opinion says that there must be compulsory education, but that is extremely hard in this mountain region. With this chance that you have to go in there and build a school that is worth while I think that you are going to get at the very best element in our population. You have a great opportunity before you. WORK AMONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINEERS 431 ADDRESS OF DR. WALTER H. PAGE OF THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD, EDITOR OF THE WORLD'S WORK Mr. Page spoke first of the beauty of the southern Appalachians, and said that they were sure to become one of the most beautiful play-grounds in the world, a play-ground for the people of all the southern and southeastern states and the Mississippi Valley. The problem of the country is to be solved by development and transportation, and the problem of the people can be solved, too, and is not far off from being solved. "Frankly," he said, "I should not establish a school there if I had the money to do it. Send your money and your workers there, by all means, but don't start a school." He then traced briefly the history of these people, and told how they came from England, and are of good, unmixed stock, in short, real people; yet, on the other hand, he said, there is the tale that when the emigrants were going over the mountains the roads were rough and the wagons broke down. The energetic ones mended their wagons and went on, the laziest didn't mend theirs, and stopped, and these are the southern mountaineers. "There are varying degrees of poverty, but the people are all poor. There is little tillable land. The people are not industrious. They love to shoot and hunt and roam. They have not the means of making a living according to modern conditions, and live the life of a frontiersman one hundred and fifty years ago. They have excited the pity and interest and charity of generation after generation. Missionaries have gone among them and many, many schools have been established there. 'Let us see what happens in the case of a school. With a few exceptions, when a boy is educated, little or much, of course he goes away. There is nothing there for an educated man to do. To a great extent this is true of the women also. The school has taken people away. Therefore if they had been taken away before they were educated it would have accomplished the same thing. Ten are educated, nine go away. You could have bought railroad tickets down into the valleys at much less expense. Education means emigration it ought to mean it. There is a school at Asheville for mountain girls, where they are taught industries, and where every effort is made to send them back into the mountains. They all try to get away; they don't want to go back. 432 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI "The cotton mills do their part in getting the people away from the mountains. Conditions in the mills may be good or bad, but the fact remains that they get the people away. Just as soon as the roads and railroads go through there they also will bring the people down. "I think all this is in the right direction. My cure for the thing is transportation opening the country. Even the people that stay in the mountains will give up the miserable life they are leading when the roads bring to them knowledge of a better life. The school is simply machinery for dispersing them. "In eastern Tennessee there are to-day more colleges in proportion to population than anywhere else on the surface of the earth, more colleges in proportion to population than there are in Massachusetts, ten times as many as there are here in New York. Don't go down and establish another. Many of them are doing good work, but most of them are starving. Their men are coming to New York and begging for ,money. A public school grows all the time, never dies out, is never forgotten, is always rich. A private school never is. The state can afford to keep a school. A private individual can't. As the long neglected public school system of that country develops it-self, it is going to do the same thing that you want to do, with this difference the state establishes a school and it is endowed forever. You establish a school and you wear yourselves out begging for it. "All the states are waking up. There have been more high schools built in Virginia in the last ten years than existed in all the southern states ten years ago. The states will have enough in time. They are slow, but it is going to happen. "The method I am going to propose lacks one quality: it would not be a lasting monument of your society. Teach them how to multiply their own crops on their own land. All the rest will follow." Mr. Page then told of the work of Dr. S. A. Knapp of Washing-ton, who had conceived the idea of literally fooling the farmers into raising larger crops. He asked us to get entirely out of our minds any idea of a school, anything like formal teaching, to forget for the moment that things could be taught by books, and to think simply of the men sent out by Dr. Knapp to show the mountaineers in a practical way what could be done by intelligent farming, hard work, and good seed. A man would go to one of these farmers, for ex-ample, and tell him that thegovernment wanted to try an experiment WORK AMONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINEERS 433 on his land, and would finally get him to cultivate two acres out of his ten under the direction of this agent. Then, when the crop was ready, the agent would "happen" in that neighborhood again, and find that the two acres yielded as much cotton as the other eight; instead of the usual one-third of a bale per acre, there would be two bales per acre. Then he would get all the farmers in the neighbor-hood together and confess that the government was not at all interested in any special experiment, but that it wanted to show what could be done by scientific methods. There have been places in the South that have been absolutely changed within the last couple of years by this means. The people raised better crops, they made more money, they built better houses, they voted in favor of a school tax, they developed prosperous communities. The men who are interested in this work realize what can be accomplished. They are absolutely devoted to it. "The very apostles themselves had no higher zeal than these agents who go about fooling the old clodhopper into improving his land." "But all this didn't reach the women. Dr. "Knapp knew that the women in the farm-house was still a drudge. "How can we get something parallel to this farm work inside of the isolated country house?" he questioned. He found a way and has begun the work, and that is the work that I most humbly and respectfully commend to you. I believe it is the best way. The boy can go away. The woman needs your sympathy. You can't get far with a school or a settlement. Dr. Knapp solved it with a tin can. That is the whole basis of civilization! "He sends a man into a neighborhood and works on this primary fact: the country woman is in need of money. The agent tells her that there is a way to make money and that is to can tomatoes. Now you can't get vegetables in the mountains. They don't grow them. There, right on the most fertile soil in the country, they send to Chicago for canned vegetables. But when the agent comes along and puts the idea into their heads they think it a good scheme. They agree to it. Then, after a few months, it occurs to them that they haven't any tomatoes to can! A demonstrator comes along and shows them how to plant them. When the crop is ready they get together in somebody's kitchen to can them, and begin to get acquainted. They never were acquainted before, never visited, never saw each other except at church and funerals. Now their social life 434 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI has actually begun all around a tomato can. Next season they begin to wonder why they can't grow something else. "You can't go into these people's homes and tell them how to do things. They think they know how as well as anybody else. But go about it in the right way and you can awaken them. If I were you I should do that. Ten thousand dollars in the hands of devoted people, natives, I should think, would regenerate and reform thousands and thousands of families who now have no social life and whose family and economic life is so low that it excites our profoundest pity. That is the way that the woman who is cut off from civilization can best be reached. I trust you will pardon me the rudeness of daring to advise you not to do what you have in mind, because it cannot last a hundred years, because there are already hundreds of schools and they have to be maintained artifically. The South is going to be one of the richest agricultural regions of the whole earth and you have a chance to help in its development. The states of Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, are now making more rapid progress in public educational work than public educational work has ever made within the same length of time. North Carolina has built a school-house at the rate of one a day for the last five years, but they don't get into the homes of these people. Try improving civilization with a tin tomato can!" IN THE BEGINNING Mrs. George W. Murdock (Clarissa L. Fowler, Pennsylvania B) who had charge of the recent meeting of the Denver Alumnae Club which was devoted to the history of the fraternity, wrote to each of the founders in the hope that from these dear women she might learn something of interest as to the early days of I. C. Sorosis. Four of these letters are so interesting and shed such a pleasing light on the days of old that, with Mrs. Murdock's permission, they are here printed. The first letter is from Mrs. Turnbull (Jennie Horne) : 2510 North 32nd St., Philadelphia, Pa. DEAR MRS. MURDOCK: Your letter reached me this morning. After reading it I asked myself: What shall I write that will be of interest? I shall be only too glad if what I write will answer the purpose. Why was I. C. Sorosis founded? In the fall of 1867 a young woman IN THE BEGINNING from another institution entered Monmouth College. She was a membe: of what was then known as the "A" fraternity. The badge was a simple square black pin with the letter "A" in gold upon it. At the beginning of the wrote: term of college in that year she undertook to get some girls to become member: of the sorosis. Two joined, and all the winter she and they urged others of u to unite. Early in the spring we decided that the only way to avoid thei: entreaties without being rude was to form a club of our own. We though over this for a week, day by day feeling more favorable toward such plan: A meeting of the twelve was held; the matter was thoroughly discussed pt., and con when we adjourned to meet one week from that night. We me according to appointment, organized, elected our officers, appointed committee for constitution and other things, selected what we wanted for our badge and in less than two weeks had the pins ready to wear to chapel and astoun( not only the faculty but also the entire body of students with the exception of us twelve "I. Cs." The look that came over the faces of the three girl who were wearing "A" pins is beyond description, and excitement ran high The fact of our being organized had been kept a profound secret. Our meetin; together from time to time did not excite any curiosity for the twelve of u had always been such close friends that it was no unusual thing to see u together on the campus and elsewhere enjoying ourselves. Thus no suspic ions were aroused and the consternation was the greater when we appearand wearing the beautiful arrow, with the letters "I. C.," over our hearts. Th guessing and coaxing that followed I shall never forget. It seemed strang that no one ever guessed quite right. Before wearing our pins we decide that in conversation with others whenever we could we would use "I. C., that is, in place of saying "yes" as many do when listening to one talk, we woul say "I. C.," thus throwing the curious ones of their guard as to the meanin of the letters. Those were happy days oh! so happy and I only hope the girls now hav as good times as we had I am sure they do. I had other things I thougl: to write of but maybe some of the other founders will mention these. Of th house-party lasting a whole week, in the country at the home of one of 6 girls and too of the pin that was stolen by the roommate of one of the gir] and what a time we had getting it so many things might be told for you meeting that would be new to you and of interest. Hoping you will have good meeting and wishing you all success, I am yours in Pi Phi loyalty, (MRS.) JEAN M. TURNBULL. February 9, 1911. The second letter came from Ada Bruen, now Mrs. Grier. HE memory played her false in assigning to Kappa Kappa Gamma date earlier than that of the founding of I. C. Kappa's history stat( that the society was founded in October, 1870, nearly three yea] after I. C.

        430 THE A.R.R OW OF PI BETA PHI furnish food, and tuition was free, and in this way he sent seven of his children to school. He told how' proud he was of his little boy Henry, who made the greatest progress of any child in school. I was much interested to see Henry, and presently, as we were seated at the supper-table (not in the briar-patch, by the way) little Henry came in. He had been to school one year. He was four inches taller than I, weighed 175 pounds, and had a really distinguished moustache. Don't forget that these people are influenced more by their environment than you are ever going to influence them. Any school you put up is going to be affected by their personality. Take them into consideration or you will be discouraged. They should be taught soil cultivation, dairying, sheep-growing, fruit-farming, as well as house-building. Millions are going away from there. There are four millions of these mountaineers, with only eighteen to a square mile. Why should they not be prepared to stay right there and build up industries? They can do it and they ought to do it. The people who leave the mountains, those who go to the cotton mills, are not the best type. They have very large families and put their children into the mills, while the men stay at home, and do nothing. Most of them become drunk. They look upon their children simply as so many "hands." The children suffer in the mills and many of them die. A man who had lost one of his children complained bitterly, "God's been hard on me. He took one of my best hands." There was no thought of the child but he had lost fifty cents a day! The possibilities among the mountaineers themselves are the best we have to-day. You will find that there has already been something done. There are schools there, forty, fifty, or one hundred and fifty miles apart, and let it be said to their everlasting honor, you can't go within ten miles of a school without knowing it. The Farm School, close to Asheville, N. C., is the only one doing anything for the boys. Public opinion says that there must be compulsory education, but that is extremely hard in this mountain region. With this chance that you have to go in there and build a school that is worth while I think that you are going to get at the very best element in our population. You have a great opportunity before you. WORK AMONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINEERS 431 ADDRESS OF DR. WALTER H. PAGE OF THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD, EDITOR OF THE WORLD'S WORK Mr. Page spoke first of the beauty of the southern Appalachians, and said that they were sure to become one of the most beautiful play-grounds in the world, a play-ground for the people of all the southern and southeastern states and the Mississippi Valley. The problem of the country is to be solved by development and transportation, and the problem of the people can be solved, too, and is not far off from being solved. "Frankly," he said, "I should not establish a school there if I had the money to do it. Send your money and your workers there, by all means, but don't start a school." He then traced briefly the history of these people, and told how they came from England, and are of good, unmixed stock, in short, real people; yet, on the other hand, he said, there is the tale that when the emigrants were going over the mountains the roads were rough and the wagons broke down. The energetic ones mended their wagons and went on, the laziest didn't mend theirs, and stopped, and these are the southern mountaineers. "There are varying degrees of poverty, but the people are all poor. There is little tillable land. The people are not industrious. They love to shoot and hunt and roam. They have not the means of making a living according to modern conditions, and live the life of a frontiersman one hundred and fifty years ago. They have excited the pity and interest and charity of generation after generation. Missionaries have gone among them and many, many schools have been established there. 'Let us see what happens in the case of a school. With a few exceptions, when a boy is educated, little or much, of course he goes away. There is nothing there for an educated man to do. To a great extent this is true of the women also. The school has taken people away. Therefore if they had been taken away before they were educated it would have accomplished the same thing. Ten are educated, nine go away. You could have bought railroad tickets down into the valleys at much less expense. Education means emigration it ought to mean it. There is a school at Asheville for mountain girls, where they are taught industries, and where every effort is made to send them back into the mountains. They all try to get away; they don't want to go back. 432 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI "The cotton mills do their part in getting the people away from the mountains. Conditions in the mills may be good or bad, but the fact remains that they get the people away. Just as soon as the roads and railroads go through there they also will bring the people down. "I think all this is in the right direction. My cure for the thing is transportation opening the country. Even the people that stay in the mountains will give up the miserable life they are leading when the roads bring to them knowledge of a better life. The school is simply machinery for dispersing them. "In eastern Tennessee there are to-day more colleges in proportion to population than anywhere else on the surface of the earth, more colleges in proportion to population than there are in Massachusetts, ten times as many as there are here in New York. Don't go down and establish another. Many of them are doing good work, but most of them are starving. Their men are coming to New York and begging for ,money. A public school grows all the time, never dies out, is never forgotten, is always rich. A private school never is. The state can afford to keep a school. A private individual can't. As the long neglected public school system of that country develops it-self, it is going to do the same thing that you want to do, with this difference the state establishes a school and it is endowed forever. You establish a school and you wear yourselves out begging for it. "All the states are waking up. There have been more high schools built in Virginia in the last ten years than existed in all the southern states ten years ago. The states will have enough in time. They are slow, but it is going to happen. "The method I am going to propose lacks one quality: it would not be a lasting monument of your society. Teach them how to multiply their own crops on their own land. All the rest will follow." Mr. Page then told of the work of Dr. S. A. Knapp of Washing-ton, who had conceived the idea of literally fooling the farmers into raising larger crops. He asked us to get entirely out of our minds any idea of a school, anything like formal teaching, to forget for the moment that things could be taught by books, and to think simply of the men sent out by Dr. Knapp to show the mountaineers in a practical way what could be done by intelligent farming, hard work, and good seed. A man would go to one of these farmers, for ex-ample, and tell him that thegovernment wanted to try an experiment WORK AMONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINEERS 433 on his land, and would finally get him to cultivate two acres out of his ten under the direction of this agent. Then, when the crop was ready, the agent would "happen" in that neighborhood again, and find that the two acres yielded as much cotton as the other eight; instead of the usual one-third of a bale per acre, there would be two bales per acre. Then he would get all the farmers in the neighbor-hood together and confess that the government was not at all interested in any special experiment, but that it wanted to show what could be done by scientific methods. There have been places in the South that have been absolutely changed within the last couple of years by this means. The people raised better crops, they made more money, they built better houses, they voted in favor of a school tax, they developed prosperous communities. The men who are interested in this work realize what can be accomplished. They are absolutely devoted to it. "The very apostles themselves had no higher zeal than these agents who go about fooling the old clodhopper into improving his land." "But all this didn't reach the women. Dr. "Knapp knew that the women in the farm-house was still a drudge. "How can we get something parallel to this farm work inside of the isolated country house?" he questioned. He found a way and has begun the work, and that is the work that I most humbly and respectfully commend to you. I believe it is the best way. The boy can go away. The woman needs your sympathy.

In the fall of 1867 a young woman IN THE BEGINNING from another institution entered Monmouth College. She was a membe: of what was then known as the "A" fraternity. The badge was a simple square black pin with the letter "A" in gold upon it. At the beginning of the wrote: term of college in that year she undertook to get some girls to become member: of the sorosis. Two joined, and all the winter she and they urged others of u to unite. Early in the spring we decided that the only way to avoid thei: entreaties without being rude was to form a club of our own. We though over this for a week, day by day feeling more favorable toward such plan: A meeting of the twelve was held; the matter was thoroughly discussed pt., and con when we adjourned to meet one week from that night. We me according to appointment, organized, elected our officers, appointed committee for constitution and other things, selected what we wanted for our badge and in less than two weeks had the pins ready to wear to chapel and astoun( not only the faculty but also the entire body of students with the exception of us twelve "I. Cs." The look that came over the faces of the three girl who were wearing "A" pins is beyond description, and excitement ran high The fact of our being organized had been kept a profound secret. Our meetin; together from time to time did not excite any curiosity for the twelve of u had always been such close friends that it was no unusual thing to see u together on the campus and elsewhere enjoying ourselves. Thus no suspic ions were aroused and the consternation was the greater when we appearand wearing the beautiful arrow, with the letters "I. C.," over our hearts. Th guessing and coaxing that followed I shall never forget. It seemed strang that no one ever guessed quite right. Before wearing our pins we decide that in conversation with others whenever we could we would use "I. C., that is, in place of saying "yes" as many do when listening to one talk, we woul say "I. C.," thus throwing the curious ones of their guard as to the meanin of the letters. Those were happy days oh! so happy and I only hope the girls now hav as good times as we had I am sure they do. I had other things I thougl: to write of but maybe some of the other founders will mention these. Of th house-party lasting a whole week, in the country at the home of one of 6 girls and too of the pin that was stolen by the roommate of one of the gir] and what a time we had getting it so many things might be told for you meeting that would be new to you and of interest. Hoping you will have good meeting and wishing you all success, I am yours in Pi Phi loyalty, (MRS.) JEAN M. TURNBULL. February 9, 1911. The second letter came from Ada Bruen, now Mrs. Grier.

WORK AMONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINEERS 427 WORK AMONG THE SOUTHERN MOUN TAINEERS Two meetings of the New York Alumnae Club reported by Florence E. Hubbard, New York Beta I " REPORT OF THE SPEECH OF THE REVEREND H. P. VAUGHN OF UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY I think that this is a splendid thing that you have undertaken. A fraternity needs an objective. We have neglected the big things. We have not in the past paid enough attention to the other side of the question : What are you going to do with knowledge? What are you going to do with influence? I am doubly interested in these people. There is a tradition in our family that I belong to the mountains. My father was a mountaineer, born in the mountains of Carolina, and when I got among them I felt like I was back home. I was not a missionary, but a college man out for the summer acting as an agent. I took life about as easy as the mountaineers. First of all, they are hospitable. There were several of us who contracted to meet on Sunday and relate our experience, and when I got back the first week and the boys began to tell how much they had spent, I felt ashamed. I thought I had been imposing on people. My total expenses for the week were twenty cents. I don't know why I spent that 1 I enjoyed being with the people so much I felt like I was home, and they felt so, too. They felt it was an offense to offer them anything. There is a book published in the last few years by Davenport, called "Primitive Traits in Religious Revivals." In that book there is the best scientific discussion of the mountain people. Many books have been published by missionaries, and so forth, but they have been more or less superficial. This, however, has gotten at the root of that interesting phenomenon, the Kentucky revival. ' The people are largely Scotch-Irish. It is said that they are so fond of theological discussion that .if the potato crop should fail any year they could live on the shorter catechism. They are also an emotional type of people, and responded readily to the religious movement. They had to be alert and ready to defend themselves. They were fearless of anything they could put their fingers on, anything that 428 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI they actually knew about, but when powerful preachers came down and preached about devils and hell, it completely swept them away. They had back in their consciousness the feeling that they were violating everything when they refused to carry out the teachings of Knox and Calvin. They knew that they were doing wrong. Then they became alarmed and there was a stampede. It is to be hoped that no such thing will ever occur again. I am a minister and not trying to discount religious revivals but religion and morality must go hand in hand. They are a motor emotional people, with a tendency toward the dogmatic. When they get anything in their heads they stick to it. Great preachers, philosophers, and thinkers will come from the mountain people. Some of their most interesting discussions are religious. You have to be careful about words with them, because they define words. One man, for instance, lost out because he tried to have them repeat, in the creed, the words, "Holy Catholic Church." They replied, "Not for us." It is a fight between Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists. No others need apply. Most of the people that I saw lived along the French Broad River, from Morristown, Tenn., to Asheville, N. C. They live in the open air, and the women at forty, mothers of large families, look scarcely more than twenty. The families in the mountains are scarcely ever less than ten. One man, who considered himself peculiarly unfortunate because he had no children, explained it to me in this way: "A man and his wife and six children can hoe eight rows of corn at a time. I, with my wife and no children, can hoe only two rows. Don't you see that they are four times as well off as I am?" They do not have a broad outlook upon life because they are cut loose from things. There is only one decent railroad that goes south from Hot Springs. That was put in at great expense by the government. Their only other way of communicating with the outside world is through the county newspaper, and I want to say right here, all honor to the county newspaper! It usually has more common sense and a broader outlook on life than most of our city papers. It is unprejudiced. There is no boss behind it to say what shall be printed and what shall not be printed. These men and women actually read the newspaper and think about what they read. I found one man, who couldn't read but had had the newspaper read WORK AMONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINEERS 429 to him, who could upset all our talking on the tariff because he had done some thinking. They think consecutively and I hope that in the work that is done down there you will take into consideration their logical type of mind and the fact that they work things through to an end. I want to tell you about the most interesting character I met. No man ever impressed me more than John Williams. Af ter I had gotten away from the railroad about fifteen miles I began to find I could take no more orders for books. No one wanted to buy. But presently people began to say, "We can't buy this, but John Williams will buy one." So I became interested in John Williams. About three o'clock I came to his house. There was a woman outside picking berries, and I walked up to the gate and asked if I might spend the night there. The woman looked up. "Stranger, did you see that briar-patch below the house? That's the supper-table. If you can put up with that, come in." Presently a wagon stopped at the gate and I saw a man of fifty or more climb down. As he started to get down, he saw that there was a stranger there. "Hello, stranger." And I replied, "Hello." "Can I spend the night here ?" I said, "Stranger, did you see that briar-patch below the house? That's the supper-table. If you can put up with that, come in." That was John. Williams. We talked until one o'clock, and we are friends to this day. He was one of the sunniest fellows. He had a wife and fourteen children, and two rooms in his house. Talk about the tenement-house proposition! With all out-of-doors to spare they build these little two-room shacks. I hope you will teach them to build beautiful log-houses. They can do it. There were fourteen children and no education. Then one day a woman from the Presbyterian Home Mission Board started a school about ten miles away. John Williams could not afford to send his children there to board, neither could they go back and forth every day, so he bought eight acres of land as close as he could get to the schoolhouse. This was a couple of miles away, but they didn't mind walking that. They built a log-cabin with a loft. He could 430 THE A.R.R OW OF PI BETA PHI furnish food, and tuition was free, and in this way he sent seven of his children to school. He told how' proud he was of his little boy Henry, who made the greatest progress of any child in school. I was much interested to see Henry, and presently, as we were seated at the supper-table (not in the briar-patch, by the way) little Henry came in. He had been to school one year. He was four inches taller than I, weighed 175 pounds, and had a really distinguished moustache. Don't forget that these people are influenced more by their environment than you are ever going to influence them. Any school you put up is going to be affected by their personality. Take them into consideration or you will be discouraged. They should be taught soil cultivation, dairying, sheep-growing, fruit-farming, as well as house-building. Millions are going away from there. There are four millions of these mountaineers, with only eighteen to a square mile. Why should they not be prepared to stay right there and build up industries? They can do it and they ought to do it. The people who leave the mountains, those who go to the cotton mills, are not the best type. They have very large families and put their children into the mills, while the men stay at home, and do nothing. Most of them become drunk. They look upon their children simply as so many "hands." The children suffer in the mills and many of them die. A man who had lost one of his children complained bitterly, "God's been hard on me. He took one of my best hands." There was no thought of the child but he had lost fifty cents a day! The possibilities among the mountaineers themselves are the best we have to-day. You will find that there has already been something done. There are schools there, forty, fifty, or one hundred and fifty miles apart, and let it be said to their everlasting honor, you can't go within ten miles of a school without knowing it. The Farm School, close to Asheville, N. C., is the only one doing anything for the boys. Public opinion says that there must be compulsory education, but that is extremely hard in this mountain region. With this chance that you have to go in there and build a school that is worth while I think that you are going to get at the very best element in our population. You have a great opportunity before you. WORK AMONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINEERS 431 ADDRESS OF DR. WALTER H. PAGE OF THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD, EDITOR OF THE WORLD'S WORK Mr. Page spoke first of the beauty of the southern Appalachians, and said that they were sure to become one of the most beautiful play-grounds in the world, a play-ground for the people of all the southern and southeastern states and the Mississippi Valley. The problem of the country is to be solved by development and transportation, and the problem of the people can be solved, too, and is not far off from being solved. "Frankly," he said, "I should not establish a school there if I had the money to do it. Send your money and your workers there, by all means, but don't start a school." He then traced briefly the history of these people, and told how they came from England, and are of good, unmixed stock, in short, real people; yet, on the other hand, he said, there is the tale that when the emigrants were going over the mountains the roads were rough and the wagons broke down. The energetic ones mended their wagons and went on, the laziest didn't mend theirs, and stopped, and these are the southern mountaineers. "There are varying degrees of poverty, but the people are all poor. There is little tillable land. The people are not industrious. They love to shoot and hunt and roam. They have not the means of making a living according to modern conditions, and live the life of a frontiersman one hundred and fifty years ago. They have excited the pity and interest and charity of generation after generation. Missionaries have gone among them and many, many schools have been established there. 'Let us see what happens in the case of a school. With a few exceptions, when a boy is educated, little or much, of course he goes away. There is nothing there for an educated man to do. To a great extent this is true of the women also. The school has taken people away. Therefore if they had been taken away before they were educated it would have accomplished the same thing. Ten are educated, nine go away. You could have bought railroad tickets down into the valleys at much less expense. Education means emigration it ought to mean it. There is a school at Asheville for mountain girls, where they are taught industries, and where every effort is made to send them back into the mountains. They all try to get away; they don't want to go back. 432 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI "The cotton mills do their part in getting the people away from the mountains. Conditions in the mills may be good or bad, but the fact remains that they get the people away. Just as soon as the roads and railroads go through there they also will bring the people down. "I think all this is in the right direction. My cure for the thing is transportation opening the country. Even the people that stay in the mountains will give up the miserable life they are leading when the roads bring to them knowledge of a better life. The school is simply machinery for dispersing them. "In eastern Tennessee there are to-day more colleges in proportion to population than anywhere else on the surface of the earth, more colleges in proportion to population than there are in Massachusetts, ten times as many as there are here in New York. Don't go down and establish another. Many of them are doing good work, but most of them are starving. Their men are coming to New York and begging for ,money. A public school grows all the time, never dies out, is never forgotten, is always rich. A private school never is. The state can afford to keep a school. A private individual can't. As the long neglected public school system of that country develops it-self, it is going to do the same thing that you want to do, with this difference the state establishes a school and it is endowed forever. You establish a school and you wear yourselves out begging for it. "All the states are waking up. There have been more high schools built in Virginia in the last ten years than existed in all the southern states ten years ago. The states will have enough in time. They are slow, but it is going to happen. "The method I am going to propose lacks one quality: it would not be a lasting monument of your society. Teach them how to multiply their own crops on their own land. All the rest will follow." Mr. Page then told of the work of Dr. S. A. Knapp of Washing-ton, who had conceived the idea of literally fooling the farmers into raising larger crops. He asked us to get entirely out of our minds any idea of a school, anything like formal teaching, to forget for the moment that things could be taught by books, and to think simply of the men sent out by Dr. Knapp to show the mountaineers in a practical way what could be done by intelligent farming, hard work, and good seed. A man would go to one of these farmers, for ex-ample, and tell him that thegovernment wanted to try an experiment WORK AMONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINEERS 433 on his land, and would finally get him to cultivate two acres out of his ten under the direction of this agent. Then, when the crop was ready, the agent would "happen" in that neighborhood again, and find that the two acres yielded as much cotton as the other eight; instead of the usual one-third of a bale per acre, there would be two bales per acre. Then he would get all the farmers in the neighbor-hood together and confess that the government was not at all interested in any special experiment, but that it wanted to show what could be done by scientific methods. There have been places in the South that have been absolutely changed within the last couple of years by this means. The people raised better crops, they made more money, they built better houses, they voted in favor of a school tax, they developed prosperous communities. The men who are interested in this work realize what can be accomplished. They are absolutely devoted to it. "The very apostles themselves had no higher zeal than these agents who go about fooling the old clodhopper into improving his land." "But all this didn't reach the women. Dr. "Knapp knew that the women in the farm-house was still a drudge. "How can we get something parallel to this farm work inside of the isolated country house?" he questioned. He found a way and has begun the work, and that is the work that I most humbly and respectfully commend to you. I believe it is the best way. The boy can go away. The woman needs your sympathy. You can't get far with a school or a settlement. Dr. Knapp solved it with a tin can. That is the whole basis of civilization! "He sends a man into a neighborhood and works on this primary fact: the country woman is in need of money. The agent tells her that there is a way to make money and that is to can tomatoes. Now you can't get vegetables in the mountains. They don't grow them. There, right on the most fertile soil in the country, they send to Chicago for canned vegetables. But when the agent comes along and puts the idea into their heads they think it a good scheme. They agree to it. Then, after a few months, it occurs to them that they haven't any tomatoes to can! A demonstrator comes along and shows them how to plant them. When the crop is ready they get together in somebody's kitchen to can them, and begin to get acquainted. They never were acquainted before, never visited, never saw each other except at church and funerals. Now their social life 434 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI has actually begun all around a tomato can. Next season they begin to wonder why they can't grow something else. "You can't go into these people's homes and tell them how to do things. They think they know how as well as anybody else. But go about it in the right way and you can awaken them. If I were you I should do that. Ten thousand dollars in the hands of devoted people, natives, I should think, would regenerate and reform thousands and thousands of families who now have no social life and whose family and economic life is so low that it excites our profoundest pity. That is the way that the woman who is cut off from civilization can best be reached. I trust you will pardon me the rudeness of daring to advise you not to do what you have in mind, because it cannot last a hundred years, because there are already hundreds of schools and they have to be maintained artifically. The South is going to be one of the richest agricultural regions of the whole earth and you have a chance to help in its development. The states of Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, are now making more rapid progress in public educational work than public educational work has ever made within the same length of time. North Carolina has built a school-house at the rate of one a day for the last five years, but they don't get into the homes of these people. Try improving civilization with a tin tomato can!" IN THE BEGINNING Mrs. George W. Murdock (Clarissa L. Fowler, Pennsylvania B) who had charge of the recent meeting of the Denver Alumnae Club which was devoted to the history of the fraternity, wrote to each of the founders in the hope that from these dear women she might learn something of interest as to the early days of I. C. Sorosis. Four of these letters are so interesting and shed such a pleasing light on the days of old that, with Mrs. Murdock's permission, they are here printed. The first letter is from Mrs. Turnbull (Jennie Horne) : 2510 North 32nd St., Philadelphia, Pa. DEAR MRS. MURDOCK: Your letter reached me this morning.
