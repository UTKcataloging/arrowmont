        40 THE ARROW. OF PI BETA PHI REPORT OF ARROW MAILING CLERK The Arrow Mailing Clerk submits the following report to the Grand Council: The work of the ARRow Mailing Clerk has been of the kind necessary in such an office. The mailing list has been kept up to date together with the card catalogue, as nearly as possible. The blue slips have been clipped and sent on to the cataloguer and Alumnae Editor, cards have been made out for initiates and annual subscribers, money has been collected and sent to the Grand Treasurer, and an endless search has been made for the lost members. It is a lamentable fact that there are about 300 of these at present. The Mailing Clerk wishes to thank those -who have 'Neen so patient with the errors that occur. Every effort is made to give efficient service and if THE ARRow does not go to the proper address, or if two copies come even to different addresses you will be doing the fraternity a favor by notifying the Mailing Clerk. The Mailing Clerk hopes that the next Convention may be welcomed in the East, and regrets exceedingly the impossibility of being present at Estes Park. Respectfully submitted, FLORENCE CLT:M TEMPLE. REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT :.C'IOOL COMMITTEE To Grand Council: It is always difficult in a report to convey the spirit back of the facts and figures cited, but I cannot imagine it being so difficult in any report as it is in this one of the chairman of the Settlement School Committee, for the year just closing, 1922-1923. The report at Convention usually includes the work of the years since the previous Convention, but as the report of the chairman for 1921-1922 was published in detail in the Secret ARROW of October, 1922, I shall not repeat what can be found in that. Our chairmen come and go, committee members come and go, and various members of the staff at Gatlinburg render their year or years of service and then go back to the fraternity at large and into the work, carrying the enthusiasm that any time spent on Little Pigeon instils into them. But the work goes on, animated by a force that is hard to name but one that is ,so vital that we all feel its power. It is much larger and greater than the Spirit of Pi Beta Phi that our pictures in the Settlement School program show as hovering over the Mountain Cabin, although she is a symbol of the spirit of Service and Enlightment and Progress that is an element in this intangible force of which I speak. No chairman can make any report without a very great feeling of debt to all the chairmen and eomlmittees and teachers who have gone REPORTS OF OFFICERS 47 before her, We are, each one of us, links in the splendid chain, and no one of us could have done anything without the work of those who have preceded us. From the starting point of that memorable meeting of the Washington alumnae club, each year has seen something of very special note in the development of the work, something that marks a very real advance; not one year has seen a backward step taken. The very notable achievement of the past year has been the installation of the Vocational Agricultural Department. Each department has new matters of interest for us, as shown by the reports of the Head Resident and the Staff, but the organization of the agricultural work into a department, with a competent director came about this past year. The staff has numbered nine:, Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident; Phyllis Higinbotham, public health nurse; O. J. Mattil, director of the Vocational Agricultural Department; Helen K. Chew, principal of the school and teacher in the Junior High School; Marion Folsom, grade work ; D. C. Denton, teacher in the Junior High School and director of athletics; Emily Burton, primary grades; Anna Dowell, sewing, and house mother in the Pollard Cottage for girls; Ireti-e Linkous, weaving and household manager of Teachers' Cottagre. In addition, Aunt Lizzie Reagan and her nephew, J. T. Reagan are regular assistants in the house and on the property of the School. The finances of the School will be given in detail in report of the treasurer, but I want to state here that the forward step taken in the other parts of our work has been taken in our finances also. The treasurer reports that the contributions for this year show an increase over last year ; and we all thought that last year, with Mrs. Rugg as cur splendid chairman, was a record one. We have met the demands of our budget, with the exception of the sum included for a new industrial high school building. Plans for that building, to be erected in units as needed, are under consideration, and may be seen in the exhibition of School work. If there is any one outstanding disappoint ment in the chairman's mind it is that no large sums of money havo been contributed by individual Pi Phis, as will be necessary, I believE before this building can be completed. The current expenses increas so heavily from year to year with the necessary enlargement of tb work that it is hard to see how we can finance so important and s large an expense as new buildings entail without individual gif larger than those that come to us through club contributions. TI chairman has this year taken this raatter up with the vice-presiden and with individual Pi Phis, and has met with enthusiastic respon and cooperation, but, so far, with no money returns. Many of o members are giving in large sums to other causes, all worthy a splendid, and it is earnestly hoped that some of them may be led see this social and educational work of ours as equally worthy a splendid, and so, some year, make a large offering to it. The money given by the various clubs can hardly be considere( 4S THE XRROW OF PI BETA PHI measure of their interest. Some clubs which may not show so large a total amount or so large a per capita contribution have been building up an intelligent knowledge and interest that is sure to bear fruit in succeeding years. The two clubs that send the largest amounts, the Cleveland alumnae club and the New York alumnae club, will continue their friendly rivalry, I hope, to the good of the School treasury. I should like to mention each individual club that has made its contribution and that has written me of its interest. Most of the clubs send their funds direct to their province vice-presidents, according to rule, without making any suggestions as to how the money shall be expended. It is the policy and the urgent request of the committee that this shall be done. It has the budget to meet. The Committee, how-ever, decided at its last annual meeting to stress the need of a moving picture apparatus in its appeal for funds this year, and that appeal seemed to strike a responsive chord in the hearts of many clubs. Several wrote the chairman concerning it. The Indianapolis alumnae club, however, was the first club to make a definite offer. It has therefore the honor of furnishing the machine for the moving picture entertainments that are already delighting the School and the community on Little Pigeon. The Boston alumnae club, as a memorial to. Jennie Allyn, whose interest in 'and work for the School and the fraternity are so well known to us all, sent a case of surgeon's instruments to the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center that Phyllis Higinbotham, the nurse, already reports has been most useful and appreciated by herself and the doctors. The Des Moines alumnae club wrote that whatever of its contribution was needed for the seating of the new auditorium should be used for that purpose, or for any other purpose more important. Miss Bishop reports that the Moving Picture entertainment crowds may necessitate securing the seating this summer. Other clubs have sent to Miss Bishop and Miss Higinbotham and Miss Chew many things of service, in addition to their regular money contributions, which I wish I could acknowledge by name in this report. But it is hoped that the clubs will appreciate the need of contributions being made without absolute conditions being imposed. While no direct responsibility is fixed upon the active chapters for the support of the Settlement School, more and more chapters are contributing to it. Since three-fourths of their contributions go into the endowment fund, they can feel that they are doing much to in-sure the permanence of the School. The members of the Committee have been busy in their particular fields, and their reports show much accomplished. The treasurer would find her work easier if all clubs would send their contributions to their respective province vice-presidents. Occasionally some con-fusion arises when this is not done. The ways and means member, Mrs. Curtis, has assisted clubs with suggestions as to ways of raising money whenever desired. The success of the Cleveland club in securing funds for, the School makes her REPORTS OF OFFICERS 49 an authority on such matters. She has also had charge of routing the Settlement School slides. She reports that a small proportion of clubs avail themselves of this means of information and entertainment. All clubs that have reported on their use of the slides are most enthusiastic. It is hoped that clubs will write for dates very early this next year. Mrs. Stark, the new member of the committee, was asked to make a survey of the industrial work done by schools similar to ours. She has gathered together valuable material that will be of great help in considering the development of this department. The endowment member of the committee, who is also the chair-man, has given a great deal of time and thought to her work. but with r ..o financial returns. There is not a wide-spread feeling, as yet, in the fraternity that there should be an endowment ; consequently the building up of an endowment organization has gone slowly. Material has been prepared and sent out to the vice-presidents to be used at their discretion. With the heavy current expenses, it was decided by the Committee not to make an open campaign for endowment. Mrs. Rugg, the publicity member of the committee, has brought the School to the fraternity in the very interesting articles in Tim Arnow that she has obtained from the members of the School staff or that she has written herself. Her supplementary leaflet to the Historical Sketch of the School has brought that history up to date. Several hundred of these sketches with the leaflets enclosed were sent out to the vice-presidents for distribution. She has also given help to all clubs and chapters desiring it in the preparation of Settlement School programs. A very comprehensive bibliography, compiled at her direction by Dorothy Cleaveland, based on an earlier one by Alice Mathews, is shortly to be printed. It will be of great service to all interested in understanding conditions in the southern highlands, and will also be of help in the making of Settlement School programs. She has also been instrumental in getting out books of kodak pictures of the School for the use of the province presidents in their chapter visits. Elizabeth Shepard Lough, of the New York alumnae club, assisted in this work. The chairman has tried to perform the duties usual to her office At the last committee meeting, it was voted to erect an industrial high school building as soon as practicable. Building conditions in the mountains as well as elsewhere have been very difficult. Plans hav( been made by Miss Aida Wilson, Iowa r, who, with her sister, Elmint. Wilson, drew the plans for the very satisfactory Teachers' cottage erected during the chairmanship of Mrs. Helmick. These plans, wits such modifications as they will undergo to meet particular needs, prb vide for the erection of an auditorium first. It is hoped that som member of the fraternity will wish to furnish the funds for the build ing of this auditorium as a memorial to some one interested in ou: own Settlement School or in the cause of education for those wit] limited opportunities. 50 THE ARROW or Pf BETA PHI There have been many permanent improvements made this year in the property, notably the building of a cement water reservoir with a capacity of 10,000 gallons. Our fire hazard has been appreciably lessened thereby. Among the many duties and pleasures that have come to me be-cause of my office, none have been more appreciated than the visits to the Washington Alumnae club, the Connecticut Alumnae club, and the Philadelphia Alumnae club. I have been sorry that my work has made it impossible for me to .accept invitations extended by other clubs farther away. The fraternity spirit and Settlement School interest I found in these clubs were very splendid. All that I have so far reported seems to me purely preliminary to the matters of greatest interest to us all, the reports from the School itself. I shall begin with the report from our newest department. In order to insure competent development of agricultural work in schools that were favorably situated for it, the Smith-Hughes Act of Congress provided for federal aid, to be given through state agencies for such work. As our School fully measured up to the requirements, we have received this year the federal-state aid. Mr. O. J. Mattil, a graduate of the University of Tennessee, a young man of experience in general community service as well as in the special vocational agricultural work contemplated was obtained. He has proved a great asset in the School and community life. A summary of his report follows: Courses have been given in animal husbandry and horticulture adapted to local conditions. In addition to regular class room instruction, field trips, laboratory experiments, and shop work, each boy carried a special home project, of which he was required to make a special study. Some of these projects, have been the raising of poultry flocks, pigs, hot beds, small fruits, 5 acres of corn, young orchards, potatoes, and gardens. In order to introduce pure bred stock, plans were devised whereby it could be furnished the boys without initial cost to them. Chain clubs were formed, members of which received pure bred stock, and returned to the School a per cent of the in-crease; these animals were then given to other boys, and so the chain was extended link by link. The farm shop work course was given with the idea of teaching the boys the use of tools in the construction, upkeep, and repair of things around the farm. Wood work, rope, and iron work, tool sharpening, filing, and setting saws were all included in the course. A few of the articles made were mail boxes, tool boxes, tool racks, saw horses, book racks, supply shelves, stitching horse, lumber racks. Many articles were made for) the use of the School, such as a warping reel for the weaving department, footstools, fruit ladders, pig troughs, fruit drying frames, and coops. Work on the School farm was also done under the supervision of the agricultural director, such as fence building, setting out small REPORTS OF OFFICERS 51 fruits, apple, peach, plum, ,and cherry trees ; roads were graded; a flock of chickens was raised. The outstanding community services rendered were: "Culled 5 poultry flocks, assisted in building 6 poultry houses, held 9 community meetings, held a community fair, judgment at Pitman Center Community Fair, started an endless chain pig club, assisted in pruning 7S8 fruit trees and in spraying 70 fruit trees, treated 175 chickens, 2 cows, and 2 pigs, made 36 project visits, 73 other visits, received 26 inquiries, and traveled by automobile 922 miles and 234 miles by horse, and made 21 visits to rural schools." Mr. Mattil closes his report to the committee as follows: "No wonderful things have been accomplished during the past year in Vocational Agriculture work, but I feel optimistic of the outlook. People are more and more taking hold of the work, and I believe with time it will gain a good foothold; at least some sound movements have been launched for a good foundation." To those who have watched the work of the agricultural Director, it seems as if some wonderful things had been accomplished. The fact that the community has received the advice and practical help of the Director as the various farmers and their families have is in itself a wonderful thing. The work of Phyllis Higinbotham at the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center and throughout the community continues to be of in-estimable value. This past year has been an especially hard one; there has been an unusual amount of sickness both in the community and among the teachers. There have been 269 cases treated during the year. The nurse has assisted in 13 operations, 5 of them at the hospital. She made 1,171 visits, and has traveled (in four months) 525 miles. She made 22 calls at night after eight o'clock. Note in the treasurer's report the amount of fees collected. It is not large as dollars go, but represents the desire of the people to pay what they can for the services which they so highly appreciate. "During two weeks in May, Dr. Lane from the State Board of Health was in Gatlinburg, giving treatment to those who had Hook-worm disease when examined the previous August. Dr. Ogle, a Knoxville dentist, came over for some work. He examined the children of our School, and did some extracting free of charge. He said that with a few exceptions, the children's teeth were remarkably sound, a condition due, probably, to the plain diet. We borrowed a barber's chair, the only one in the village, and a recent addition at that, and it served the purpose well. Dr. Smith, of the Government TrachOma Hospital, spent two days going through six schools in the district. Be ifound a number of cases of trachoma. Thirteen-boys, girls, and one woman, were taken to the Government Hospital for treatment. Dr. Potter, a surgeon from Knoxville, was at the School in October, and performed two tonsil operations. 52 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI In addition to an intensely interesting itemized statement from Miss Higinbotham, from which the foregoing extracts have been taken, she writes as follows: "The hospital has been used more and more this last year. The increasing demand for medicines has necessitated our keeping a miniature drug store and a card index' of the treatment the people are getting, in order to renew the medicine without bothering the doctors every time. Then the doctors are sending or calling frequently for supplies and instruments when away from home and in need of some-thing unexpected. During the year, we have had to supply the sterile dressings for the operations performed. Thanks to the clubs and individual members, the hospital has been pretty well equipped. The Boston club sent, as a memorial to Jennie Allyn, one of the army kits of instruments, which is wonderfully equipped for general surgery. Dr. Chandler, through Mrs. Chandler, sent several sterilizers and a number of instruments. The Ontario club has supplied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, breast binders, old linen. It has also given the laboratory equipment, a microscope complete, with all attachments. The Des Moines club has given an army dental chair and equipment that is most acceptable. "There have been cases that the doctors would have liked to bring to the hospital this year that we could not receive, as we could not care for them. The different members of the staff have helped whenever a patient was there, having to relieve me for meals, calls, and trips, and to help with the dressings. But while they are always glad to help, they have their own duties and cannot always give the time needed at the hospital when patients are there. At present we are considering the plan of engaging a practical woman to help with the work at the hospital and the case of any patients that are taken in. We hope also to train her so that she can act as a practical nurse in the homes, where so often just such a person is needed. Miss Evelyn Bishop, the head resident, incorporates in her report of the whole work that of Miss Helen Chew, the principal of the school. "The three kinds of industrial work this year have been the weaving, sewing, and basketry. Irene Linkous, who has given us a most successful year of work, has been in charge of the weaving. Nearly all of the girls in School were taking it for the first time; consequently not much work was done for sale. Each girl wove a dress, and nearly every one made it up herself. The best result of the work done in School is that after the girls leave, they have looms in their own homes, and are able to weave for themselves and also to make things for sale, and thus get a little money for them-selves and their babies. Miss Linkous has also had the care of the Teachers' Cottage, with Aunt Lizzie Reagan to help her. "The sewing has been in charge of Mrs. Anna Dowell. The class has completed a full year of sewing, it having been thought ad REPORTS OF OFFICERS 53 visable to continue the sewing during the second term rather than to take up cooking. The girls learned different stitches, darning, patching, mending ; they made plain clothes; and in the spring, all made attractive gingham dresses. The work was systematic, practical, and thorough, and the girls were very much interested. Mrs. Dowell was also in charge of the six girls who lived in the Mary Pollard Cottage. The girls there did the house work under Mrs. Dowell's supervision. "D. C. Denton, who taught mathematics and history in the Junior High School, also had charge of athletics. He and Mr. Mattil organized a basket ball team, and accompanied the team on their several trips for games with neighboring schools. Although this was the first year these boys have played they have made an excellent showing ; and they thoroughly appreciated the new suits purchased for them. Marion Folsom, who taught the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades completed her very successful first year at the School. She was ready at all times to assist in school undertakings, and won the confidence and liking of the community. Emily Burton continued her very satisfactory work with the primary grades. She now ranks as the teacher who has been longest with us. The community and the children all feel that "Miss Emily" has become a very real part of their lives. Helen Chew has been a most efficient principal. She has taught in the Junior High School classes, and has had general oversight of the school. Her work in organizing the School curriculum, drawing up plans for the future development, and in cooperating in all community activities has made her a most valuable member of the staff. "During the year the total enrollment has been 131 pupils. Even with an unusual amount of sickness this year, the attendance has kept up remarkably. Some of the county schools had to close because of the flu epidemic. Each year the teachers are more strict in regard to examinations, and so some of the boys and girls who had had to drop out for a while on account of sickness or to help on the farms returned for the final examinations. "Noon lunches were planned and prepared by Miss Linkous, and were served during the winter term to the children of the primary grades. The girls in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades set the tables, washed the dishes, and assisted in every way they could. The dormitory problem, is still one of our most difficult ones. The need for dormitories for both boys ,and girls is so great that in the opinion of the staff it takes precedence over other building needs. This past year, first four, and then six girls were housed in the Mary Pollard Cottage, with Mrs. Dowell as house mother. Miss Chew wrote in one of her reports to the chairman that the girls living with Mrs. Dowell were the only ones in the School who were getting a home atmosphere and an informational background of any sort, such as constitute so large a part of the education of all of us. The mothers are 54 THE A.RROW OF PI BETA PHI many of them anxious to have their girls come to live under such supervision. During the autumn term, the boys, under the supervision of Mr. Denton, lived at the Whaley Hotel and home. After Christmas they went to live in a very desirable little cottage recently purchased by Miss Bishop and Miss Higinbotham. A sister of Aunt Lizzie, Mrs. Ownby, kept house for them. This was the happiest solution of the living problem for the boys that we have yet found. The Stuart Cottage, in which Jim Reagan, the superintendent of the work on the place, has been living, will soon be free for dormitory use, as Jim is building a cottage for himself on land adjoining the School property. The expected consolidation of two or three schools with the Pi Beta Phi School did not take place, one of the principal reasons being the impossibility of transportation. Roads have been in process of construction during so much of the year that the children could not have come from some of the localities. Then, too, a local pride has made some of the communities wish to retain their own little school, inefficient as it may be. The influence of the Settlement School and the teachers, however, is not dependent upon the boys and girls coming down to Gatlinburg. It may never be wise or possible to effect any large degree of consolidation in so mountainous a country as ours. Our teachers can go to them. The people of the Sugarlands, a district about seven miles from Gatlinburg, have urged Miss Chew to come up there and teach their school this summer, and she has promised to do it. She gives her services to this splendid work. When we are able to build the proposed school building it may be that the consolidation of the upper grades can be brought about, and the grades for the little ones taught in their own schools, under supervision. The supervision undertaken this last year, to which the committee voted financial cooperation, has proved a success. This work of Miss Chew this summer then, is not only a very fine service, but is an experiment that may lead the Committee to feel that the sending out of II (1) teachers to isolated communities is a step to be taken as soon as funds can be obtained for it. It is hard for me not to give you the reports with every bit of their detail. It is a very live place, the II B 4 Settlement School at Gatlinburg. Three of the staff, the head resident, the nurse, and the agricultural director, are in residence the whole year. They carry on their work in the School, the immediate community, and in far out-lying districts, and also represent us at meetings of school and health associations in Nashville and Knoxville. There are no union hours to their days; daylight saving or standard time has no special significance for them. Note the miles they have traveled, the visits made at night, the hundred and one things they have done. What have we done: Given a few dollars? Let us give until our dollars measure up a little more satisfactorily to their efforts. Respectfully submitted, KATE B. MILLER REPORTS OF OFFICERS 55 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING Following is the report of the second annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee held at Gatlinburg, June 6-13, 1923. As stated in THE ARRow for October 1922, Grand Council voted to em-power the committee to administer the Settlement School funds and authorized the Committee to engage the School staff and to develop the property. This year the Committee accordingly took the following action : Land-The title to the seven 'acres known as the "Sims land" was reported clear. The remainder of the Ogle mortgage on the Andy Ogle land was paid, thus clearing the title. The titles to all the property are now clear. Buildings-Extensive repairs and improvements on the Mary Pollard and Stuart Cottages were authorized. It was decided to have an electrician from the East Tennessee Electric Company inspect all lines and wiring. Two fire extinguishers are to be installed in each building and adequate hose for fire protection purchased. Hereafter in constructing of buildings as nearly fireproof roofing as possible will be used. Department of Public Health-It was announced that state aid will be furnished this department under the provisions of the Shepard-Towner Act upon application and such application was authorized. It was decided that we become active in establishing a regular semi-annual dental clinic to be conducted by a competent dentist. Miss Higinbotham was given the title of Head Nurse. The Head Resident with the approval of the Head Nurse, was empowered to engage an assistant to the Head Nurse. Miss Nesbit, the State Supervisor of Pub-lie Health nurses spent Sunday with us and in informal consultation gave us much valuable advice concerning public health work. School-As soon as it is deemed advisable we are to have nine months school for the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth grades. The Head Resident has been instructed to secure, if possible, state aid from the Smith-Hughes Department of Home Economics. Five scholar-ships are to be available for the year 1923-24, this number to be in-creased if necessity demands. The entire teaching staff was reelected for the school year 1923 24 and the Head Resident was empowered to make necessary changes in the event of State aid being secured for home economies. One afternoon, the Committee made a trip of inspection to the Sugarlands and Bracken schoolhouges. The summer term at Sugarlands will be taught by a number of our staff at the request of the people. The Head Resident has been requested to start a card catalogue containing full information of all students ever connected with our school. Agricultural Department-Mr. Mattil, the Smith-Hughes Agriculturalist has proved most efficient in organizing his new department. This year the chief improvement in this department will be the erec5G Tzrr~ Ai mow OF PI BETA PHI tion of a barn adequate for the housing of our livestock. Financial-Under the direction of the Treasurer the budget for the year 1923-24 was prepared and later accepted. It was decided to place the interest from the Endowment Fund for the year 1923-24 in the Endowment Fund. The Committee favors a continuance of this policy for the next five years. Publicity-It was decided to issue new pamphlets giving information about the Settlement School. The publication of an illustrated leaflet containing prices and information concerning the Fireside Industries was authorized. It was decided that the Principal be responsible for the sending of a weekly letter concerning school interests to Montgomery's Vindicator. Previous to adjournment the Committee moved to send a vote of thanks to Kate Miller for her work on the Committee and express regret for her resignation. Respectfully submitted, SA_RAH POMEROY RUGG Chairman of Settlement School Committee REPORT OF TREASURER OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL TO THE GRAND COUNCIL OF PI BETA PHI FRATERNITY: Pursuant to engagement we have audited the books and records of Miss M.

        4S THE XRROW OF PI BETA PHI measure of their interest. Some clubs which may not show so large a total amount or so large a per capita contribution have been building up an intelligent knowledge and interest that is sure to bear fruit in succeeding years. The two clubs that send the largest amounts, the Cleveland alumnae club and the New York alumnae club, will continue their friendly rivalry, I hope, to the good of the School treasury. I should like to mention each individual club that has made its contribution and that has written me of its interest. Most of the clubs send their funds direct to their province vice-presidents, according to rule, without making any suggestions as to how the money shall be expended. It is the policy and the urgent request of the committee that this shall be done. It has the budget to meet. The Committee, how-ever, decided at its last annual meeting to stress the need of a moving picture apparatus in its appeal for funds this year, and that appeal seemed to strike a responsive chord in the hearts of many clubs. Several wrote the chairman concerning it. The Indianapolis alumnae club, however, was the first club to make a definite offer. It has therefore the honor of furnishing the machine for the moving picture entertainments that are already delighting the School and the community on Little Pigeon. The Boston alumnae club, as a memorial to. Jennie Allyn, whose interest in 'and work for the School and the fraternity are so well known to us all, sent a case of surgeon's instruments to the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center that Phyllis Higinbotham, the nurse, already reports has been most useful and appreciated by herself and the doctors. The Des Moines alumnae club wrote that whatever of its contribution was needed for the seating of the new auditorium should be used for that purpose, or for any other purpose more important. Miss Bishop reports that the Moving Picture entertainment crowds may necessitate securing the seating this summer. Other clubs have sent to Miss Bishop and Miss Higinbotham and Miss Chew many things of service, in addition to their regular money contributions, which I wish I could acknowledge by name in this report. But it is hoped that the clubs will appreciate the need of contributions being made without absolute conditions being imposed. While no direct responsibility is fixed upon the active chapters for the support of the Settlement School, more and more chapters are contributing to it. Since three-fourths of their contributions go into the endowment fund, they can feel that they are doing much to in-sure the permanence of the School. The members of the Committee have been busy in their particular fields, and their reports show much accomplished. The treasurer would find her work easier if all clubs would send their contributions to their respective province vice-presidents. Occasionally some con-fusion arises when this is not done. The ways and means member, Mrs. Curtis, has assisted clubs with suggestions as to ways of raising money whenever desired. The success of the Cleveland club in securing funds for, the School makes her REPORTS OF OFFICERS 49 an authority on such matters. She has also had charge of routing the Settlement School slides. She reports that a small proportion of clubs avail themselves of this means of information and entertainment. All clubs that have reported on their use of the slides are most enthusiastic. It is hoped that clubs will write for dates very early this next year. Mrs. Stark, the new member of the committee, was asked to make a survey of the industrial work done by schools similar to ours. She has gathered together valuable material that will be of great help in considering the development of this department. The endowment member of the committee, who is also the chair-man, has given a great deal of time and thought to her work. but with r ..o financial returns. There is not a wide-spread feeling, as yet, in the fraternity that there should be an endowment ; consequently the building up of an endowment organization has gone slowly. Material has been prepared and sent out to the vice-presidents to be used at their discretion. With the heavy current expenses, it was decided by the Committee not to make an open campaign for endowment. Mrs. Rugg, the publicity member of the committee, has brought the School to the fraternity in the very interesting articles in Tim Arnow that she has obtained from the members of the School staff or that she has written herself. Her supplementary leaflet to the Historical Sketch of the School has brought that history up to date. Several hundred of these sketches with the leaflets enclosed were sent out to the vice-presidents for distribution. She has also given help to all clubs and chapters desiring it in the preparation of Settlement School programs. A very comprehensive bibliography, compiled at her direction by Dorothy Cleaveland, based on an earlier one by Alice Mathews, is shortly to be printed. It will be of great service to all interested in understanding conditions in the southern highlands, and will also be of help in the making of Settlement School programs. She has also been instrumental in getting out books of kodak pictures of the School for the use of the province presidents in their chapter visits. Elizabeth Shepard Lough, of the New York alumnae club, assisted in this work. The chairman has tried to perform the duties usual to her office At the last committee meeting, it was voted to erect an industrial high school building as soon as practicable. Building conditions in the mountains as well as elsewhere have been very difficult. Plans hav( been made by Miss Aida Wilson, Iowa r, who, with her sister, Elmint. Wilson, drew the plans for the very satisfactory Teachers' cottage erected during the chairmanship of Mrs. Helmick. These plans, wits such modifications as they will undergo to meet particular needs, prb vide for the erection of an auditorium first. It is hoped that som member of the fraternity will wish to furnish the funds for the build ing of this auditorium as a memorial to some one interested in ou: own Settlement School or in the cause of education for those wit] limited opportunities. 50 THE ARROW or Pf BETA PHI There have been many permanent improvements made this year in the property, notably the building of a cement water reservoir with a capacity of 10,000 gallons. Our fire hazard has been appreciably lessened thereby. Among the many duties and pleasures that have come to me be-cause of my office, none have been more appreciated than the visits to the Washington Alumnae club, the Connecticut Alumnae club, and the Philadelphia Alumnae club. I have been sorry that my work has made it impossible for me to .accept invitations extended by other clubs farther away. The fraternity spirit and Settlement School interest I found in these clubs were very splendid. All that I have so far reported seems to me purely preliminary to the matters of greatest interest to us all, the reports from the School itself. I shall begin with the report from our newest department. In order to insure competent development of agricultural work in schools that were favorably situated for it, the Smith-Hughes Act of Congress provided for federal aid, to be given through state agencies for such work. As our School fully measured up to the requirements, we have received this year the federal-state aid. Mr. O. J. Mattil, a graduate of the University of Tennessee, a young man of experience in general community service as well as in the special vocational agricultural work contemplated was obtained. He has proved a great asset in the School and community life. A summary of his report follows: Courses have been given in animal husbandry and horticulture adapted to local conditions. In addition to regular class room instruction, field trips, laboratory experiments, and shop work, each boy carried a special home project, of which he was required to make a special study. Some of these projects, have been the raising of poultry flocks, pigs, hot beds, small fruits, 5 acres of corn, young orchards, potatoes, and gardens. In order to introduce pure bred stock, plans were devised whereby it could be furnished the boys without initial cost to them. Chain clubs were formed, members of which received pure bred stock, and returned to the School a per cent of the in-crease; these animals were then given to other boys, and so the chain was extended link by link. The farm shop work course was given with the idea of teaching the boys the use of tools in the construction, upkeep, and repair of things around the farm. Wood work, rope, and iron work, tool sharpening, filing, and setting saws were all included in the course. A few of the articles made were mail boxes, tool boxes, tool racks, saw horses, book racks, supply shelves, stitching horse, lumber racks. Many articles were made for) the use of the School, such as a warping reel for the weaving department, footstools, fruit ladders, pig troughs, fruit drying frames, and coops. Work on the School farm was also done under the supervision of the agricultural director, such as fence building, setting out small REPORTS OF OFFICERS 51 fruits, apple, peach, plum, ,and cherry trees ; roads were graded; a flock of chickens was raised. The outstanding community services rendered were: "Culled 5 poultry flocks, assisted in building 6 poultry houses, held 9 community meetings, held a community fair, judgment at Pitman Center Community Fair, started an endless chain pig club, assisted in pruning 7S8 fruit trees and in spraying 70 fruit trees, treated 175 chickens, 2 cows, and 2 pigs, made 36 project visits, 73 other visits, received 26 inquiries, and traveled by automobile 922 miles and 234 miles by horse, and made 21 visits to rural schools." Mr. Mattil closes his report to the committee as follows: "No wonderful things have been accomplished during the past year in Vocational Agriculture work, but I feel optimistic of the outlook. People are more and more taking hold of the work, and I believe with time it will gain a good foothold; at least some sound movements have been launched for a good foundation." To those who have watched the work of the agricultural Director, it seems as if some wonderful things had been accomplished. The fact that the community has received the advice and practical help of the Director as the various farmers and their families have is in itself a wonderful thing. The work of Phyllis Higinbotham at the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center and throughout the community continues to be of in-estimable value. This past year has been an especially hard one; there has been an unusual amount of sickness both in the community and among the teachers. There have been 269 cases treated during the year. The nurse has assisted in 13 operations, 5 of them at the hospital. She made 1,171 visits, and has traveled (in four months) 525 miles. She made 22 calls at night after eight o'clock. Note in the treasurer's report the amount of fees collected. It is not large as dollars go, but represents the desire of the people to pay what they can for the services which they so highly appreciate. "During two weeks in May, Dr. Lane from the State Board of Health was in Gatlinburg, giving treatment to those who had Hook-worm disease when examined the previous August. Dr. Ogle, a Knoxville dentist, came over for some work. He examined the children of our School, and did some extracting free of charge. He said that with a few exceptions, the children's teeth were remarkably sound, a condition due, probably, to the plain diet. We borrowed a barber's chair, the only one in the village, and a recent addition at that, and it served the purpose well. Dr. Smith, of the Government TrachOma Hospital, spent two days going through six schools in the district. Be ifound a number of cases of trachoma. Thirteen-boys, girls, and one woman, were taken to the Government Hospital for treatment. Dr. Potter, a surgeon from Knoxville, was at the School in October, and performed two tonsil operations. 52 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI In addition to an intensely interesting itemized statement from Miss Higinbotham, from which the foregoing extracts have been taken, she writes as follows: "The hospital has been used more and more this last year. The increasing demand for medicines has necessitated our keeping a miniature drug store and a card index' of the treatment the people are getting, in order to renew the medicine without bothering the doctors every time. Then the doctors are sending or calling frequently for supplies and instruments when away from home and in need of some-thing unexpected. During the year, we have had to supply the sterile dressings for the operations performed. Thanks to the clubs and individual members, the hospital has been pretty well equipped. The Boston club sent, as a memorial to Jennie Allyn, one of the army kits of instruments, which is wonderfully equipped for general surgery. Dr. Chandler, through Mrs. Chandler, sent several sterilizers and a number of instruments. The Ontario club has supplied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, breast binders, old linen. It has also given the laboratory equipment, a microscope complete, with all attachments. The Des Moines club has given an army dental chair and equipment that is most acceptable. "There have been cases that the doctors would have liked to bring to the hospital this year that we could not receive, as we could not care for them. The different members of the staff have helped whenever a patient was there, having to relieve me for meals, calls, and trips, and to help with the dressings. But while they are always glad to help, they have their own duties and cannot always give the time needed at the hospital when patients are there. At present we are considering the plan of engaging a practical woman to help with the work at the hospital and the case of any patients that are taken in. We hope also to train her so that she can act as a practical nurse in the homes, where so often just such a person is needed. Miss Evelyn Bishop, the head resident, incorporates in her report of the whole work that of Miss Helen Chew, the principal of the school. "The three kinds of industrial work this year have been the weaving, sewing, and basketry. Irene Linkous, who has given us a most successful year of work, has been in charge of the weaving. Nearly all of the girls in School were taking it for the first time; consequently not much work was done for sale. Each girl wove a dress, and nearly every one made it up herself. The best result of the work done in School is that after the girls leave, they have looms in their own homes, and are able to weave for themselves and also to make things for sale, and thus get a little money for them-selves and their babies. Miss Linkous has also had the care of the Teachers' Cottage, with Aunt Lizzie Reagan to help her. "The sewing has been in charge of Mrs. Anna Dowell. The class has completed a full year of sewing, it having been thought ad REPORTS OF OFFICERS 53 visable to continue the sewing during the second term rather than to take up cooking. The girls learned different stitches, darning, patching, mending ; they made plain clothes; and in the spring, all made attractive gingham dresses. The work was systematic, practical, and thorough, and the girls were very much interested. Mrs. Dowell was also in charge of the six girls who lived in the Mary Pollard Cottage. The girls there did the house work under Mrs. Dowell's supervision. "D. C. Denton, who taught mathematics and history in the Junior High School, also had charge of athletics. He and Mr. Mattil organized a basket ball team, and accompanied the team on their several trips for games with neighboring schools. Although this was the first year these boys have played they have made an excellent showing ; and they thoroughly appreciated the new suits purchased for them. Marion Folsom, who taught the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades completed her very successful first year at the School. She was ready at all times to assist in school undertakings, and won the confidence and liking of the community. Emily Burton continued her very satisfactory work with the primary grades. She now ranks as the teacher who has been longest with us. The community and the children all feel that "Miss Emily" has become a very real part of their lives. Helen Chew has been a most efficient principal. She has taught in the Junior High School classes, and has had general oversight of the school. Her work in organizing the School curriculum, drawing up plans for the future development, and in cooperating in all community activities has made her a most valuable member of the staff. "During the year the total enrollment has been 131 pupils. Even with an unusual amount of sickness this year, the attendance has kept up remarkably. Some of the county schools had to close because of the flu epidemic. Each year the teachers are more strict in regard to examinations, and so some of the boys and girls who had had to drop out for a while on account of sickness or to help on the farms returned for the final examinations. "Noon lunches were planned and prepared by Miss Linkous, and were served during the winter term to the children of the primary grades. The girls in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades set the tables, washed the dishes, and assisted in every way they could. The dormitory problem, is still one of our most difficult ones. The need for dormitories for both boys ,and girls is so great that in the opinion of the staff it takes precedence over other building needs. This past year, first four, and then six girls were housed in the Mary Pollard Cottage, with Mrs. Dowell as house mother. Miss Chew wrote in one of her reports to the chairman that the girls living with Mrs. Dowell were the only ones in the School who were getting a home atmosphere and an informational background of any sort, such as constitute so large a part of the education of all of us. The mothers are 54 THE A.RROW OF PI BETA PHI many of them anxious to have their girls come to live under such supervision. During the autumn term, the boys, under the supervision of Mr. Denton, lived at the Whaley Hotel and home. After Christmas they went to live in a very desirable little cottage recently purchased by Miss Bishop and Miss Higinbotham. A sister of Aunt Lizzie, Mrs. Ownby, kept house for them. This was the happiest solution of the living problem for the boys that we have yet found. The Stuart Cottage, in which Jim Reagan, the superintendent of the work on the place, has been living, will soon be free for dormitory use, as Jim is building a cottage for himself on land adjoining the School property. The expected consolidation of two or three schools with the Pi Beta Phi School did not take place, one of the principal reasons being the impossibility of transportation. Roads have been in process of construction during so much of the year that the children could not have come from some of the localities. Then, too, a local pride has made some of the communities wish to retain their own little school, inefficient as it may be. The influence of the Settlement School and the teachers, however, is not dependent upon the boys and girls coming down to Gatlinburg. It may never be wise or possible to effect any large degree of consolidation in so mountainous a country as ours. Our teachers can go to them. The people of the Sugarlands, a district about seven miles from Gatlinburg, have urged Miss Chew to come up there and teach their school this summer, and she has promised to do it. She gives her services to this splendid work. When we are able to build the proposed school building it may be that the consolidation of the upper grades can be brought about, and the grades for the little ones taught in their own schools, under supervision. The supervision undertaken this last year, to which the committee voted financial cooperation, has proved a success. This work of Miss Chew this summer then, is not only a very fine service, but is an experiment that may lead the Committee to feel that the sending out of II (1) teachers to isolated communities is a step to be taken as soon as funds can be obtained for it. It is hard for me not to give you the reports with every bit of their detail. It is a very live place, the II B 4 Settlement School at Gatlinburg. Three of the staff, the head resident, the nurse, and the agricultural director, are in residence the whole year. They carry on their work in the School, the immediate community, and in far out-lying districts, and also represent us at meetings of school and health associations in Nashville and Knoxville. There are no union hours to their days; daylight saving or standard time has no special significance for them. Note the miles they have traveled, the visits made at night, the hundred and one things they have done. What have we done: Given a few dollars? Let us give until our dollars measure up a little more satisfactorily to their efforts. Respectfully submitted, KATE B. MILLER REPORTS OF OFFICERS 55 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING Following is the report of the second annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee held at Gatlinburg, June 6-13, 1923. As stated in THE ARRow for October 1922, Grand Council voted to em-power the committee to administer the Settlement School funds and authorized the Committee to engage the School staff and to develop the property. This year the Committee accordingly took the following action : Land-The title to the seven 'acres known as the "Sims land" was reported clear. The remainder of the Ogle mortgage on the Andy Ogle land was paid, thus clearing the title. The titles to all the property are now clear. Buildings-Extensive repairs and improvements on the Mary Pollard and Stuart Cottages were authorized. It was decided to have an electrician from the East Tennessee Electric Company inspect all lines and wiring. Two fire extinguishers are to be installed in each building and adequate hose for fire protection purchased. Hereafter in constructing of buildings as nearly fireproof roofing as possible will be used. Department of Public Health-It was announced that state aid will be furnished this department under the provisions of the Shepard-Towner Act upon application and such application was authorized. It was decided that we become active in establishing a regular semi-annual dental clinic to be conducted by a competent dentist. Miss Higinbotham was given the title of Head Nurse. The Head Resident with the approval of the Head Nurse, was empowered to engage an assistant to the Head Nurse. Miss Nesbit, the State Supervisor of Pub-lie Health nurses spent Sunday with us and in informal consultation gave us much valuable advice concerning public health work. School-As soon as it is deemed advisable we are to have nine months school for the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth grades. The Head Resident has been instructed to secure, if possible, state aid from the Smith-Hughes Department of Home Economics. Five scholar-ships are to be available for the year 1923-24, this number to be in-creased if necessity demands. The entire teaching staff was reelected for the school year 1923 24 and the Head Resident was empowered to make necessary changes in the event of State aid being secured for home economies. One afternoon, the Committee made a trip of inspection to the Sugarlands and Bracken schoolhouges. The summer term at Sugarlands will be taught by a number of our staff at the request of the people. The Head Resident has been requested to start a card catalogue containing full information of all students ever connected with our school. Agricultural Department-Mr. Mattil, the Smith-Hughes Agriculturalist has proved most efficient in organizing his new department. This year the chief improvement in this department will be the erec5G Tzrr~ Ai mow OF PI BETA PHI tion of a barn adequate for the housing of our livestock. Financial-Under the direction of the Treasurer the budget for the year 1923-24 was prepared and later accepted. It was decided to place the interest from the Endowment Fund for the year 1923-24 in the Endowment Fund. The Committee favors a continuance of this policy for the next five years. Publicity-It was decided to issue new pamphlets giving information about the Settlement School. The publication of an illustrated leaflet containing prices and information concerning the Fireside Industries was authorized. It was decided that the Principal be responsible for the sending of a weekly letter concerning school interests to Montgomery's Vindicator. Previous to adjournment the Committee moved to send a vote of thanks to Kate Miller for her work on the Committee and express regret for her resignation.

        50 THE ARROW or Pf BETA PHI There have been many permanent improvements made this year in the property, notably the building of a cement water reservoir with a capacity of 10,000 gallons. Our fire hazard has been appreciably lessened thereby. Among the many duties and pleasures that have come to me be-cause of my office, none have been more appreciated than the visits to the Washington Alumnae club, the Connecticut Alumnae club, and the Philadelphia Alumnae club. I have been sorry that my work has made it impossible for me to .accept invitations extended by other clubs farther away. The fraternity spirit and Settlement School interest I found in these clubs were very splendid. All that I have so far reported seems to me purely preliminary to the matters of greatest interest to us all, the reports from the School itself. I shall begin with the report from our newest department. In order to insure competent development of agricultural work in schools that were favorably situated for it, the Smith-Hughes Act of Congress provided for federal aid, to be given through state agencies for such work. As our School fully measured up to the requirements, we have received this year the federal-state aid. Mr. O. J. Mattil, a graduate of the University of Tennessee, a young man of experience in general community service as well as in the special vocational agricultural work contemplated was obtained. He has proved a great asset in the School and community life. A summary of his report follows: Courses have been given in animal husbandry and horticulture adapted to local conditions. In addition to regular class room instruction, field trips, laboratory experiments, and shop work, each boy carried a special home project, of which he was required to make a special study. Some of these projects, have been the raising of poultry flocks, pigs, hot beds, small fruits, 5 acres of corn, young orchards, potatoes, and gardens. In order to introduce pure bred stock, plans were devised whereby it could be furnished the boys without initial cost to them. Chain clubs were formed, members of which received pure bred stock, and returned to the School a per cent of the in-crease; these animals were then given to other boys, and so the chain was extended link by link. The farm shop work course was given with the idea of teaching the boys the use of tools in the construction, upkeep, and repair of things around the farm. Wood work, rope, and iron work, tool sharpening, filing, and setting saws were all included in the course. A few of the articles made were mail boxes, tool boxes, tool racks, saw horses, book racks, supply shelves, stitching horse, lumber racks. Many articles were made for) the use of the School, such as a warping reel for the weaving department, footstools, fruit ladders, pig troughs, fruit drying frames, and coops. Work on the School farm was also done under the supervision of the agricultural director, such as fence building, setting out small REPORTS OF OFFICERS 51 fruits, apple, peach, plum, ,and cherry trees ; roads were graded; a flock of chickens was raised. The outstanding community services rendered were: "Culled 5 poultry flocks, assisted in building 6 poultry houses, held 9 community meetings, held a community fair, judgment at Pitman Center Community Fair, started an endless chain pig club, assisted in pruning 7S8 fruit trees and in spraying 70 fruit trees, treated 175 chickens, 2 cows, and 2 pigs, made 36 project visits, 73 other visits, received 26 inquiries, and traveled by automobile 922 miles and 234 miles by horse, and made 21 visits to rural schools." Mr. Mattil closes his report to the committee as follows: "No wonderful things have been accomplished during the past year in Vocational Agriculture work, but I feel optimistic of the outlook. People are more and more taking hold of the work, and I believe with time it will gain a good foothold; at least some sound movements have been launched for a good foundation." To those who have watched the work of the agricultural Director, it seems as if some wonderful things had been accomplished. The fact that the community has received the advice and practical help of the Director as the various farmers and their families have is in itself a wonderful thing. The work of Phyllis Higinbotham at the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center and throughout the community continues to be of in-estimable value. This past year has been an especially hard one; there has been an unusual amount of sickness both in the community and among the teachers. There have been 269 cases treated during the year. The nurse has assisted in 13 operations, 5 of them at the hospital. She made 1,171 visits, and has traveled (in four months) 525 miles. She made 22 calls at night after eight o'clock. Note in the treasurer's report the amount of fees collected. It is not large as dollars go, but represents the desire of the people to pay what they can for the services which they so highly appreciate. "During two weeks in May, Dr. Lane from the State Board of Health was in Gatlinburg, giving treatment to those who had Hook-worm disease when examined the previous August. Dr. Ogle, a Knoxville dentist, came over for some work. He examined the children of our School, and did some extracting free of charge. He said that with a few exceptions, the children's teeth were remarkably sound, a condition due, probably, to the plain diet. We borrowed a barber's chair, the only one in the village, and a recent addition at that, and it served the purpose well. Dr. Smith, of the Government TrachOma Hospital, spent two days going through six schools in the district. Be ifound a number of cases of trachoma. Thirteen-boys, girls, and one woman, were taken to the Government Hospital for treatment. Dr. Potter, a surgeon from Knoxville, was at the School in October, and performed two tonsil operations. 52 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI In addition to an intensely interesting itemized statement from Miss Higinbotham, from which the foregoing extracts have been taken, she writes as follows: "The hospital has been used more and more this last year. The increasing demand for medicines has necessitated our keeping a miniature drug store and a card index' of the treatment the people are getting, in order to renew the medicine without bothering the doctors every time. Then the doctors are sending or calling frequently for supplies and instruments when away from home and in need of some-thing unexpected. During the year, we have had to supply the sterile dressings for the operations performed. Thanks to the clubs and individual members, the hospital has been pretty well equipped. The Boston club sent, as a memorial to Jennie Allyn, one of the army kits of instruments, which is wonderfully equipped for general surgery. Dr. Chandler, through Mrs. Chandler, sent several sterilizers and a number of instruments. The Ontario club has supplied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, breast binders, old linen. It has also given the laboratory equipment, a microscope complete, with all attachments. The Des Moines club has given an army dental chair and equipment that is most acceptable. "There have been cases that the doctors would have liked to bring to the hospital this year that we could not receive, as we could not care for them. The different members of the staff have helped whenever a patient was there, having to relieve me for meals, calls, and trips, and to help with the dressings. But while they are always glad to help, they have their own duties and cannot always give the time needed at the hospital when patients are there. At present we are considering the plan of engaging a practical woman to help with the work at the hospital and the case of any patients that are taken in. We hope also to train her so that she can act as a practical nurse in the homes, where so often just such a person is needed. Miss Evelyn Bishop, the head resident, incorporates in her report of the whole work that of Miss Helen Chew, the principal of the school. "The three kinds of industrial work this year have been the weaving, sewing, and basketry. Irene Linkous, who has given us a most successful year of work, has been in charge of the weaving. Nearly all of the girls in School were taking it for the first time; consequently not much work was done for sale. Each girl wove a dress, and nearly every one made it up herself. The best result of the work done in School is that after the girls leave, they have looms in their own homes, and are able to weave for themselves and also to make things for sale, and thus get a little money for them-selves and their babies. Miss Linkous has also had the care of the Teachers' Cottage, with Aunt Lizzie Reagan to help her. "The sewing has been in charge of Mrs. Anna Dowell. The class has completed a full year of sewing, it having been thought ad REPORTS OF OFFICERS 53 visable to continue the sewing during the second term rather than to take up cooking. The girls learned different stitches, darning, patching, mending ; they made plain clothes; and in the spring, all made attractive gingham dresses. The work was systematic, practical, and thorough, and the girls were very much interested. Mrs. Dowell was also in charge of the six girls who lived in the Mary Pollard Cottage. The girls there did the house work under Mrs. Dowell's supervision. "D. C. Denton, who taught mathematics and history in the Junior High School, also had charge of athletics. He and Mr. Mattil organized a basket ball team, and accompanied the team on their several trips for games with neighboring schools. Although this was the first year these boys have played they have made an excellent showing ; and they thoroughly appreciated the new suits purchased for them. Marion Folsom, who taught the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades completed her very successful first year at the School. She was ready at all times to assist in school undertakings, and won the confidence and liking of the community. Emily Burton continued her very satisfactory work with the primary grades. She now ranks as the teacher who has been longest with us. The community and the children all feel that "Miss Emily" has become a very real part of their lives. Helen Chew has been a most efficient principal. She has taught in the Junior High School classes, and has had general oversight of the school. Her work in organizing the School curriculum, drawing up plans for the future development, and in cooperating in all community activities has made her a most valuable member of the staff. "During the year the total enrollment has been 131 pupils. Even with an unusual amount of sickness this year, the attendance has kept up remarkably. Some of the county schools had to close because of the flu epidemic. Each year the teachers are more strict in regard to examinations, and so some of the boys and girls who had had to drop out for a while on account of sickness or to help on the farms returned for the final examinations. "Noon lunches were planned and prepared by Miss Linkous, and were served during the winter term to the children of the primary grades. The girls in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades set the tables, washed the dishes, and assisted in every way they could. The dormitory problem, is still one of our most difficult ones. The need for dormitories for both boys ,and girls is so great that in the opinion of the staff it takes precedence over other building needs. This past year, first four, and then six girls were housed in the Mary Pollard Cottage, with Mrs. Dowell as house mother. Miss Chew wrote in one of her reports to the chairman that the girls living with Mrs. Dowell were the only ones in the School who were getting a home atmosphere and an informational background of any sort, such as constitute so large a part of the education of all of us. The mothers are 54 THE A.RROW OF PI BETA PHI many of them anxious to have their girls come to live under such supervision. During the autumn term, the boys, under the supervision of Mr. Denton, lived at the Whaley Hotel and home. After Christmas they went to live in a very desirable little cottage recently purchased by Miss Bishop and Miss Higinbotham. A sister of Aunt Lizzie, Mrs. Ownby, kept house for them. This was the happiest solution of the living problem for the boys that we have yet found. The Stuart Cottage, in which Jim Reagan, the superintendent of the work on the place, has been living, will soon be free for dormitory use, as Jim is building a cottage for himself on land adjoining the School property. The expected consolidation of two or three schools with the Pi Beta Phi School did not take place, one of the principal reasons being the impossibility of transportation. Roads have been in process of construction during so much of the year that the children could not have come from some of the localities. Then, too, a local pride has made some of the communities wish to retain their own little school, inefficient as it may be. The influence of the Settlement School and the teachers, however, is not dependent upon the boys and girls coming down to Gatlinburg. It may never be wise or possible to effect any large degree of consolidation in so mountainous a country as ours. Our teachers can go to them. The people of the Sugarlands, a district about seven miles from Gatlinburg, have urged Miss Chew to come up there and teach their school this summer, and she has promised to do it. She gives her services to this splendid work. When we are able to build the proposed school building it may be that the consolidation of the upper grades can be brought about, and the grades for the little ones taught in their own schools, under supervision. The supervision undertaken this last year, to which the committee voted financial cooperation, has proved a success. This work of Miss Chew this summer then, is not only a very fine service, but is an experiment that may lead the Committee to feel that the sending out of II (1) teachers to isolated communities is a step to be taken as soon as funds can be obtained for it. It is hard for me not to give you the reports with every bit of their detail. It is a very live place, the II B 4 Settlement School at Gatlinburg. Three of the staff, the head resident, the nurse, and the agricultural director, are in residence the whole year. They carry on their work in the School, the immediate community, and in far out-lying districts, and also represent us at meetings of school and health associations in Nashville and Knoxville. There are no union hours to their days; daylight saving or standard time has no special significance for them. Note the miles they have traveled, the visits made at night, the hundred and one things they have done. What have we done: Given a few dollars? Let us give until our dollars measure up a little more satisfactorily to their efforts. Respectfully submitted, KATE B. MILLER REPORTS OF OFFICERS 55 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING Following is the report of the second annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee held at Gatlinburg, June 6-13, 1923. As stated in THE ARRow for October 1922, Grand Council voted to em-power the committee to administer the Settlement School funds and authorized the Committee to engage the School staff and to develop the property. This year the Committee accordingly took the following action : Land-The title to the seven 'acres known as the "Sims land" was reported clear. The remainder of the Ogle mortgage on the Andy Ogle land was paid, thus clearing the title. The titles to all the property are now clear. Buildings-Extensive repairs and improvements on the Mary Pollard and Stuart Cottages were authorized. It was decided to have an electrician from the East Tennessee Electric Company inspect all lines and wiring. Two fire extinguishers are to be installed in each building and adequate hose for fire protection purchased. Hereafter in constructing of buildings as nearly fireproof roofing as possible will be used. Department of Public Health-It was announced that state aid will be furnished this department under the provisions of the Shepard-Towner Act upon application and such application was authorized. It was decided that we become active in establishing a regular semi-annual dental clinic to be conducted by a competent dentist. Miss Higinbotham was given the title of Head Nurse. The Head Resident with the approval of the Head Nurse, was empowered to engage an assistant to the Head Nurse. Miss Nesbit, the State Supervisor of Pub-lie Health nurses spent Sunday with us and in informal consultation gave us much valuable advice concerning public health work. School-As soon as it is deemed advisable we are to have nine months school for the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth grades. The Head Resident has been instructed to secure, if possible, state aid from the Smith-Hughes Department of Home Economics. Five scholar-ships are to be available for the year 1923-24, this number to be in-creased if necessity demands. The entire teaching staff was reelected for the school year 1923 24 and the Head Resident was empowered to make necessary changes in the event of State aid being secured for home economies. One afternoon, the Committee made a trip of inspection to the Sugarlands and Bracken schoolhouges. The summer term at Sugarlands will be taught by a number of our staff at the request of the people. The Head Resident has been requested to start a card catalogue containing full information of all students ever connected with our school. Agricultural Department-Mr. Mattil, the Smith-Hughes Agriculturalist has proved most efficient in organizing his new department. This year the chief improvement in this department will be the erec5G Tzrr~ Ai mow OF PI BETA PHI tion of a barn adequate for the housing of our livestock. Financial-Under the direction of the Treasurer the budget for the year 1923-24 was prepared and later accepted. It was decided to place the interest from the Endowment Fund for the year 1923-24 in the Endowment Fund. The Committee favors a continuance of this policy for the next five years. Publicity-It was decided to issue new pamphlets giving information about the Settlement School. The publication of an illustrated leaflet containing prices and information concerning the Fireside Industries was authorized. It was decided that the Principal be responsible for the sending of a weekly letter concerning school interests to Montgomery's Vindicator. Previous to adjournment the Committee moved to send a vote of thanks to Kate Miller for her work on the Committee and express regret for her resignation. Respectfully submitted, SA_RAH POMEROY RUGG Chairman of Settlement School Committee REPORT OF TREASURER OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL TO THE GRAND COUNCIL OF PI BETA PHI FRATERNITY: Pursuant to engagement we have audited the books and records of Miss M.

        52 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI In addition to an intensely interesting itemized statement from Miss Higinbotham, from which the foregoing extracts have been taken, she writes as follows: "The hospital has been used more and more this last year. The increasing demand for medicines has necessitated our keeping a miniature drug store and a card index' of the treatment the people are getting, in order to renew the medicine without bothering the doctors every time. Then the doctors are sending or calling frequently for supplies and instruments when away from home and in need of some-thing unexpected. During the year, we have had to supply the sterile dressings for the operations performed. Thanks to the clubs and individual members, the hospital has been pretty well equipped. The Boston club sent, as a memorial to Jennie Allyn, one of the army kits of instruments, which is wonderfully equipped for general surgery. Dr. Chandler, through Mrs. Chandler, sent several sterilizers and a number of instruments. The Ontario club has supplied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, breast binders, old linen. It has also given the laboratory equipment, a microscope complete, with all attachments. The Des Moines club has given an army dental chair and equipment that is most acceptable. "There have been cases that the doctors would have liked to bring to the hospital this year that we could not receive, as we could not care for them. The different members of the staff have helped whenever a patient was there, having to relieve me for meals, calls, and trips, and to help with the dressings. But while they are always glad to help, they have their own duties and cannot always give the time needed at the hospital when patients are there. At present we are considering the plan of engaging a practical woman to help with the work at the hospital and the case of any patients that are taken in. We hope also to train her so that she can act as a practical nurse in the homes, where so often just such a person is needed. Miss Evelyn Bishop, the head resident, incorporates in her report of the whole work that of Miss Helen Chew, the principal of the school. "The three kinds of industrial work this year have been the weaving, sewing, and basketry. Irene Linkous, who has given us a most successful year of work, has been in charge of the weaving. Nearly all of the girls in School were taking it for the first time; consequently not much work was done for sale. Each girl wove a dress, and nearly every one made it up herself. The best result of the work done in School is that after the girls leave, they have looms in their own homes, and are able to weave for themselves and also to make things for sale, and thus get a little money for them-selves and their babies. Miss Linkous has also had the care of the Teachers' Cottage, with Aunt Lizzie Reagan to help her. "The sewing has been in charge of Mrs. Anna Dowell. The class has completed a full year of sewing, it having been thought ad REPORTS OF OFFICERS 53 visable to continue the sewing during the second term rather than to take up cooking. The girls learned different stitches, darning, patching, mending ; they made plain clothes; and in the spring, all made attractive gingham dresses. The work was systematic, practical, and thorough, and the girls were very much interested. Mrs. Dowell was also in charge of the six girls who lived in the Mary Pollard Cottage. The girls there did the house work under Mrs. Dowell's supervision. "D. C. Denton, who taught mathematics and history in the Junior High School, also had charge of athletics. He and Mr. Mattil organized a basket ball team, and accompanied the team on their several trips for games with neighboring schools. Although this was the first year these boys have played they have made an excellent showing ; and they thoroughly appreciated the new suits purchased for them. Marion Folsom, who taught the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades completed her very successful first year at the School. She was ready at all times to assist in school undertakings, and won the confidence and liking of the community. Emily Burton continued her very satisfactory work with the primary grades. She now ranks as the teacher who has been longest with us. The community and the children all feel that "Miss Emily" has become a very real part of their lives. Helen Chew has been a most efficient principal. She has taught in the Junior High School classes, and has had general oversight of the school. Her work in organizing the School curriculum, drawing up plans for the future development, and in cooperating in all community activities has made her a most valuable member of the staff. "During the year the total enrollment has been 131 pupils. Even with an unusual amount of sickness this year, the attendance has kept up remarkably. Some of the county schools had to close because of the flu epidemic. Each year the teachers are more strict in regard to examinations, and so some of the boys and girls who had had to drop out for a while on account of sickness or to help on the farms returned for the final examinations. "Noon lunches were planned and prepared by Miss Linkous, and were served during the winter term to the children of the primary grades. The girls in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades set the tables, washed the dishes, and assisted in every way they could. The dormitory problem, is still one of our most difficult ones. The need for dormitories for both boys ,and girls is so great that in the opinion of the staff it takes precedence over other building needs. This past year, first four, and then six girls were housed in the Mary Pollard Cottage, with Mrs. Dowell as house mother. Miss Chew wrote in one of her reports to the chairman that the girls living with Mrs. Dowell were the only ones in the School who were getting a home atmosphere and an informational background of any sort, such as constitute so large a part of the education of all of us. The mothers are 54 THE A.RROW OF PI BETA PHI many of them anxious to have their girls come to live under such supervision. During the autumn term, the boys, under the supervision of Mr. Denton, lived at the Whaley Hotel and home. After Christmas they went to live in a very desirable little cottage recently purchased by Miss Bishop and Miss Higinbotham. A sister of Aunt Lizzie, Mrs. Ownby, kept house for them. This was the happiest solution of the living problem for the boys that we have yet found. The Stuart Cottage, in which Jim Reagan, the superintendent of the work on the place, has been living, will soon be free for dormitory use, as Jim is building a cottage for himself on land adjoining the School property. The expected consolidation of two or three schools with the Pi Beta Phi School did not take place, one of the principal reasons being the impossibility of transportation. Roads have been in process of construction during so much of the year that the children could not have come from some of the localities. Then, too, a local pride has made some of the communities wish to retain their own little school, inefficient as it may be. The influence of the Settlement School and the teachers, however, is not dependent upon the boys and girls coming down to Gatlinburg. It may never be wise or possible to effect any large degree of consolidation in so mountainous a country as ours. Our teachers can go to them. The people of the Sugarlands, a district about seven miles from Gatlinburg, have urged Miss Chew to come up there and teach their school this summer, and she has promised to do it. She gives her services to this splendid work. When we are able to build the proposed school building it may be that the consolidation of the upper grades can be brought about, and the grades for the little ones taught in their own schools, under supervision. The supervision undertaken this last year, to which the committee voted financial cooperation, has proved a success. This work of Miss Chew this summer then, is not only a very fine service, but is an experiment that may lead the Committee to feel that the sending out of II (1) teachers to isolated communities is a step to be taken as soon as funds can be obtained for it. It is hard for me not to give you the reports with every bit of their detail. It is a very live place, the II B 4 Settlement School at Gatlinburg. Three of the staff, the head resident, the nurse, and the agricultural director, are in residence the whole year. They carry on their work in the School, the immediate community, and in far out-lying districts, and also represent us at meetings of school and health associations in Nashville and Knoxville. There are no union hours to their days; daylight saving or standard time has no special significance for them. Note the miles they have traveled, the visits made at night, the hundred and one things they have done. What have we done: Given a few dollars? Let us give until our dollars measure up a little more satisfactorily to their efforts. Respectfully submitted, KATE B. MILLER REPORTS OF OFFICERS 55 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING Following is the report of the second annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee held at Gatlinburg, June 6-13, 1923. As stated in THE ARRow for October 1922, Grand Council voted to em-power the committee to administer the Settlement School funds and authorized the Committee to engage the School staff and to develop the property. This year the Committee accordingly took the following action : Land-The title to the seven 'acres known as the "Sims land" was reported clear. The remainder of the Ogle mortgage on the Andy Ogle land was paid, thus clearing the title. The titles to all the property are now clear. Buildings-Extensive repairs and improvements on the Mary Pollard and Stuart Cottages were authorized. It was decided to have an electrician from the East Tennessee Electric Company inspect all lines and wiring. Two fire extinguishers are to be installed in each building and adequate hose for fire protection purchased. Hereafter in constructing of buildings as nearly fireproof roofing as possible will be used. Department of Public Health-It was announced that state aid will be furnished this department under the provisions of the Shepard-Towner Act upon application and such application was authorized. It was decided that we become active in establishing a regular semi-annual dental clinic to be conducted by a competent dentist. Miss Higinbotham was given the title of Head Nurse. The Head Resident with the approval of the Head Nurse, was empowered to engage an assistant to the Head Nurse. Miss Nesbit, the State Supervisor of Pub-lie Health nurses spent Sunday with us and in informal consultation gave us much valuable advice concerning public health work. School-As soon as it is deemed advisable we are to have nine months school for the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth grades. The Head Resident has been instructed to secure, if possible, state aid from the Smith-Hughes Department of Home Economics. Five scholar-ships are to be available for the year 1923-24, this number to be in-creased if necessity demands. The entire teaching staff was reelected for the school year 1923 24 and the Head Resident was empowered to make necessary changes in the event of State aid being secured for home economies. One afternoon, the Committee made a trip of inspection to the Sugarlands and Bracken schoolhouges. The summer term at Sugarlands will be taught by a number of our staff at the request of the people. The Head Resident has been requested to start a card catalogue containing full information of all students ever connected with our school. Agricultural Department-Mr. Mattil, the Smith-Hughes Agriculturalist has proved most efficient in organizing his new department. This year the chief improvement in this department will be the erec5G Tzrr~ Ai mow OF PI BETA PHI tion of a barn adequate for the housing of our livestock. Financial-Under the direction of the Treasurer the budget for the year 1923-24 was prepared and later accepted. It was decided to place the interest from the Endowment Fund for the year 1923-24 in the Endowment Fund. The Committee favors a continuance of this policy for the next five years. Publicity-It was decided to issue new pamphlets giving information about the Settlement School. The publication of an illustrated leaflet containing prices and information concerning the Fireside Industries was authorized. It was decided that the Principal be responsible for the sending of a weekly letter concerning school interests to Montgomery's Vindicator. Previous to adjournment the Committee moved to send a vote of thanks to Kate Miller for her work on the Committee and express regret for her resignation. Respectfully submitted, SA_RAH POMEROY RUGG Chairman of Settlement School Committee REPORT OF TREASURER OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL TO THE GRAND COUNCIL OF PI BETA PHI FRATERNITY: Pursuant to engagement we have audited the books and records of Miss M. B. Stuart, Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the year ended April 30, 1923 and we present herewith our report.

        54 THE A.RROW OF PI BETA PHI many of them anxious to have their girls come to live under such supervision. During the autumn term, the boys, under the supervision of Mr. Denton, lived at the Whaley Hotel and home. After Christmas they went to live in a very desirable little cottage recently purchased by Miss Bishop and Miss Higinbotham. A sister of Aunt Lizzie, Mrs. Ownby, kept house for them. This was the happiest solution of the living problem for the boys that we have yet found. The Stuart Cottage, in which Jim Reagan, the superintendent of the work on the place, has been living, will soon be free for dormitory use, as Jim is building a cottage for himself on land adjoining the School property. The expected consolidation of two or three schools with the Pi Beta Phi School did not take place, one of the principal reasons being the impossibility of transportation. Roads have been in process of construction during so much of the year that the children could not have come from some of the localities. Then, too, a local pride has made some of the communities wish to retain their own little school, inefficient as it may be. The influence of the Settlement School and the teachers, however, is not dependent upon the boys and girls coming down to Gatlinburg. It may never be wise or possible to effect any large degree of consolidation in so mountainous a country as ours. Our teachers can go to them. The people of the Sugarlands, a district about seven miles from Gatlinburg, have urged Miss Chew to come up there and teach their school this summer, and she has promised to do it. She gives her services to this splendid work. When we are able to build the proposed school building it may be that the consolidation of the upper grades can be brought about, and the grades for the little ones taught in their own schools, under supervision. The supervision undertaken this last year, to which the committee voted financial cooperation, has proved a success. This work of Miss Chew this summer then, is not only a very fine service, but is an experiment that may lead the Committee to feel that the sending out of II (1) teachers to isolated communities is a step to be taken as soon as funds can be obtained for it. It is hard for me not to give you the reports with every bit of their detail. It is a very live place, the II B 4 Settlement School at Gatlinburg. Three of the staff, the head resident, the nurse, and the agricultural director, are in residence the whole year. They carry on their work in the School, the immediate community, and in far out-lying districts, and also represent us at meetings of school and health associations in Nashville and Knoxville. There are no union hours to their days; daylight saving or standard time has no special significance for them. Note the miles they have traveled, the visits made at night, the hundred and one things they have done. What have we done: Given a few dollars? Let us give until our dollars measure up a little more satisfactorily to their efforts. Respectfully submitted, KATE B. MILLER REPORTS OF OFFICERS 55 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING Following is the report of the second annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee held at Gatlinburg, June 6-13, 1923. As stated in THE ARRow for October 1922, Grand Council voted to em-power the committee to administer the Settlement School funds and authorized the Committee to engage the School staff and to develop the property. This year the Committee accordingly took the following action : Land-The title to the seven 'acres known as the "Sims land" was reported clear. The remainder of the Ogle mortgage on the Andy Ogle land was paid, thus clearing the title. The titles to all the property are now clear. Buildings-Extensive repairs and improvements on the Mary Pollard and Stuart Cottages were authorized. It was decided to have an electrician from the East Tennessee Electric Company inspect all lines and wiring. Two fire extinguishers are to be installed in each building and adequate hose for fire protection purchased. Hereafter in constructing of buildings as nearly fireproof roofing as possible will be used. Department of Public Health-It was announced that state aid will be furnished this department under the provisions of the Shepard-Towner Act upon application and such application was authorized. It was decided that we become active in establishing a regular semi-annual dental clinic to be conducted by a competent dentist. Miss Higinbotham was given the title of Head Nurse. The Head Resident with the approval of the Head Nurse, was empowered to engage an assistant to the Head Nurse. Miss Nesbit, the State Supervisor of Pub-lie Health nurses spent Sunday with us and in informal consultation gave us much valuable advice concerning public health work. School-As soon as it is deemed advisable we are to have nine months school for the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth grades. The Head Resident has been instructed to secure, if possible, state aid from the Smith-Hughes Department of Home Economics. Five scholar-ships are to be available for the year 1923-24, this number to be in-creased if necessity demands. The entire teaching staff was reelected for the school year 1923 24 and the Head Resident was empowered to make necessary changes in the event of State aid being secured for home economies. One afternoon, the Committee made a trip of inspection to the Sugarlands and Bracken schoolhouges. The summer term at Sugarlands will be taught by a number of our staff at the request of the people. The Head Resident has been requested to start a card catalogue containing full information of all students ever connected with our school. Agricultural Department-Mr. Mattil, the Smith-Hughes Agriculturalist has proved most efficient in organizing his new department. This year the chief improvement in this department will be the erec5G Tzrr~ Ai mow OF PI BETA PHI tion of a barn adequate for the housing of our livestock. Financial-Under the direction of the Treasurer the budget for the year 1923-24 was prepared and later accepted. It was decided to place the interest from the Endowment Fund for the year 1923-24 in the Endowment Fund. The Committee favors a continuance of this policy for the next five years. Publicity-It was decided to issue new pamphlets giving information about the Settlement School. The publication of an illustrated leaflet containing prices and information concerning the Fireside Industries was authorized. It was decided that the Principal be responsible for the sending of a weekly letter concerning school interests to Montgomery's Vindicator. Previous to adjournment the Committee moved to send a vote of thanks to Kate Miller for her work on the Committee and express regret for her resignation.

OF PI BETA PHI REPORT OF ARROW MAILING CLERK The Arrow Mailing Clerk submits the following report to the Grand Council: The work of the ARRow Mailing Clerk has been of the kind necessary in such an office. The mailing list has been kept up to date together with the card catalogue, as nearly as possible. The blue slips have been clipped and sent on to the cataloguer and Alumnae Editor, cards have been made out for initiates and annual subscribers, money has been collected and sent to the Grand Treasurer, and an endless search has been made for the lost members. It is a lamentable fact that there are about 300 of these at present. The Mailing Clerk wishes to thank those -who have 'Neen so patient with the errors that occur. Every effort is made to give efficient service and if THE ARRow does not go to the proper address, or if two copies come even to different addresses you will be doing the fraternity a favor by notifying the Mailing Clerk. The Mailing Clerk hopes that the next Convention may be welcomed in the East, and regrets exceedingly the impossibility of being present at Estes Park. Respectfully submitted, FLORENCE CLT:M TEMPLE. REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT :.C'IOOL COMMITTEE To Grand Council: It is always difficult in a report to convey the spirit back of the facts and figures cited, but I cannot imagine it being so difficult in any report as it is in this one of the chairman of the Settlement School Committee, for the year just closing, 1922-1923. The report at Convention usually includes the work of the years since the previous Convention, but as the report of the chairman for 1921-1922 was published in detail in the Secret ARROW of October, 1922, I shall not repeat what can be found in that. Our chairmen come and go, committee members come and go, and various members of the staff at Gatlinburg render their year or years of service and then go back to the fraternity at large and into the work, carrying the enthusiasm that any time spent on Little Pigeon instils into them. But the work goes on, animated by a force that is hard to name but one that is ,so vital that we all feel its power. It is much larger and greater than the Spirit of Pi Beta Phi that our pictures in the Settlement School program show as hovering over the Mountain Cabin, although she is a symbol of the spirit of Service and Enlightment and Progress that is an element in this intangible force of which I speak. No chairman can make any report without a very great feeling of debt to all the chairmen and eomlmittees and teachers who have gone REPORTS OF OFFICERS 47 before her, We are, each one of us, links in the splendid chain, and no one of us could have done anything without the work of those who have preceded us. From the starting point of that memorable meeting of the Washington alumnae club, each year has seen something of very special note in the development of the work, something that marks a very real advance; not one year has seen a backward step taken. The very notable achievement of the past year has been the installation of the Vocational Agricultural Department. Each department has new matters of interest for us, as shown by the reports of the Head Resident and the Staff, but the organization of the agricultural work into a department, with a competent director came about this past year. The staff has numbered nine:, Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident; Phyllis Higinbotham, public health nurse; O. J. Mattil, director of the Vocational Agricultural Department; Helen K. Chew, principal of the school and teacher in the Junior High School; Marion Folsom, grade work ; D. C. Denton, teacher in the Junior High School and director of athletics; Emily Burton, primary grades; Anna Dowell, sewing, and house mother in the Pollard Cottage for girls; Ireti-e Linkous, weaving and household manager of Teachers' Cottagre. In addition, Aunt Lizzie Reagan and her nephew, J. T. Reagan are regular assistants in the house and on the property of the School. The finances of the School will be given in detail in report of the treasurer, but I want to state here that the forward step taken in the other parts of our work has been taken in our finances also. The treasurer reports that the contributions for this year show an increase over last year ; and we all thought that last year, with Mrs. Rugg as cur splendid chairman, was a record one. We have met the demands of our budget, with the exception of the sum included for a new industrial high school building. Plans for that building, to be erected in units as needed, are under consideration, and may be seen in the exhibition of School work. If there is any one outstanding disappoint ment in the chairman's mind it is that no large sums of money havo been contributed by individual Pi Phis, as will be necessary, I believE before this building can be completed. The current expenses increas so heavily from year to year with the necessary enlargement of tb work that it is hard to see how we can finance so important and s large an expense as new buildings entail without individual gif larger than those that come to us through club contributions. TI chairman has this year taken this raatter up with the vice-presiden and with individual Pi Phis, and has met with enthusiastic respon and cooperation, but, so far, with no money returns. Many of o members are giving in large sums to other causes, all worthy a splendid, and it is earnestly hoped that some of them may be led see this social and educational work of ours as equally worthy a splendid, and so, some year, make a large offering to it. The money given by the various clubs can hardly be considere( 4S THE XRROW OF PI BETA PHI measure of their interest. Some clubs which may not show so large a total amount or so large a per capita contribution have been building up an intelligent knowledge and interest that is sure to bear fruit in succeeding years. The two clubs that send the largest amounts, the Cleveland alumnae club and the New York alumnae club, will continue their friendly rivalry, I hope, to the good of the School treasury. I should like to mention each individual club that has made its contribution and that has written me of its interest. Most of the clubs send their funds direct to their province vice-presidents, according to rule, without making any suggestions as to how the money shall be expended. It is the policy and the urgent request of the committee that this shall be done. It has the budget to meet. The Committee, how-ever, decided at its last annual meeting to stress the need of a moving picture apparatus in its appeal for funds this year, and that appeal seemed to strike a responsive chord in the hearts of many clubs. Several wrote the chairman concerning it. The Indianapolis alumnae club, however, was the first club to make a definite offer. It has therefore the honor of furnishing the machine for the moving picture entertainments that are already delighting the School and the community on Little Pigeon. The Boston alumnae club, as a memorial to. Jennie Allyn, whose interest in 'and work for the School and the fraternity are so well known to us all, sent a case of surgeon's instruments to the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center that Phyllis Higinbotham, the nurse, already reports has been most useful and appreciated by herself and the doctors. The Des Moines alumnae club wrote that whatever of its contribution was needed for the seating of the new auditorium should be used for that purpose, or for any other purpose more important. Miss Bishop reports that the Moving Picture entertainment crowds may necessitate securing the seating this summer. Other clubs have sent to Miss Bishop and Miss Higinbotham and Miss Chew many things of service, in addition to their regular money contributions, which I wish I could acknowledge by name in this report. But it is hoped that the clubs will appreciate the need of contributions being made without absolute conditions being imposed. While no direct responsibility is fixed upon the active chapters for the support of the Settlement School, more and more chapters are contributing to it. Since three-fourths of their contributions go into the endowment fund, they can feel that they are doing much to in-sure the permanence of the School. The members of the Committee have been busy in their particular fields, and their reports show much accomplished. The treasurer would find her work easier if all clubs would send their contributions to their respective province vice-presidents. Occasionally some con-fusion arises when this is not done. The ways and means member, Mrs. Curtis, has assisted clubs with suggestions as to ways of raising money whenever desired. The success of the Cleveland club in securing funds for, the School makes her REPORTS OF OFFICERS 49 an authority on such matters. She has also had charge of routing the Settlement School slides. She reports that a small proportion of clubs avail themselves of this means of information and entertainment. All clubs that have reported on their use of the slides are most enthusiastic. It is hoped that clubs will write for dates very early this next year. Mrs. Stark, the new member of the committee, was asked to make a survey of the industrial work done by schools similar to ours. She has gathered together valuable material that will be of great help in considering the development of this department. The endowment member of the committee, who is also the chair-man, has given a great deal of time and thought to her work. but with r ..o financial returns. There is not a wide-spread feeling, as yet, in the fraternity that there should be an endowment ; consequently the building up of an endowment organization has gone slowly. Material has been prepared and sent out to the vice-presidents to be used at their discretion. With the heavy current expenses, it was decided by the Committee not to make an open campaign for endowment. Mrs. Rugg, the publicity member of the committee, has brought the School to the fraternity in the very interesting articles in Tim Arnow that she has obtained from the members of the School staff or that she has written herself. Her supplementary leaflet to the Historical Sketch of the School has brought that history up to date. Several hundred of these sketches with the leaflets enclosed were sent out to the vice-presidents for distribution. She has also given help to all clubs and chapters desiring it in the preparation of Settlement School programs. A very comprehensive bibliography, compiled at her direction by Dorothy Cleaveland, based on an earlier one by Alice Mathews, is shortly to be printed. It will be of great service to all interested in understanding conditions in the southern highlands, and will also be of help in the making of Settlement School programs. She has also been instrumental in getting out books of kodak pictures of the School for the use of the province presidents in their chapter visits. Elizabeth Shepard Lough, of the New York alumnae club, assisted in this work. The chairman has tried to perform the duties usual to her office At the last committee meeting, it was voted to erect an industrial high school building as soon as practicable. Building conditions in the mountains as well as elsewhere have been very difficult. Plans hav( been made by Miss Aida Wilson, Iowa r, who, with her sister, Elmint. Wilson, drew the plans for the very satisfactory Teachers' cottage erected during the chairmanship of Mrs. Helmick. These plans, wits such modifications as they will undergo to meet particular needs, prb vide for the erection of an auditorium first. It is hoped that som member of the fraternity will wish to furnish the funds for the build ing of this auditorium as a memorial to some one interested in ou: own Settlement School or in the cause of education for those wit] limited opportunities. 50 THE ARROW or Pf BETA PHI There have been many permanent improvements made this year in the property, notably the building of a cement water reservoir with a capacity of 10,000 gallons. Our fire hazard has been appreciably lessened thereby. Among the many duties and pleasures that have come to me be-cause of my office, none have been more appreciated than the visits to the Washington Alumnae club, the Connecticut Alumnae club, and the Philadelphia Alumnae club. I have been sorry that my work has made it impossible for me to .accept invitations extended by other clubs farther away. The fraternity spirit and Settlement School interest I found in these clubs were very splendid. All that I have so far reported seems to me purely preliminary to the matters of greatest interest to us all, the reports from the School itself. I shall begin with the report from our newest department. In order to insure competent development of agricultural work in schools that were favorably situated for it, the Smith-Hughes Act of Congress provided for federal aid, to be given through state agencies for such work. As our School fully measured up to the requirements, we have received this year the federal-state aid. Mr. O. J. Mattil, a graduate of the University of Tennessee, a young man of experience in general community service as well as in the special vocational agricultural work contemplated was obtained. He has proved a great asset in the School and community life. A summary of his report follows: Courses have been given in animal husbandry and horticulture adapted to local conditions. In addition to regular class room instruction, field trips, laboratory experiments, and shop work, each boy carried a special home project, of which he was required to make a special study. Some of these projects, have been the raising of poultry flocks, pigs, hot beds, small fruits, 5 acres of corn, young orchards, potatoes, and gardens. In order to introduce pure bred stock, plans were devised whereby it could be furnished the boys without initial cost to them. Chain clubs were formed, members of which received pure bred stock, and returned to the School a per cent of the in-crease; these animals were then given to other boys, and so the chain was extended link by link. The farm shop work course was given with the idea of teaching the boys the use of tools in the construction, upkeep, and repair of things around the farm. Wood work, rope, and iron work, tool sharpening, filing, and setting saws were all included in the course. A few of the articles made were mail boxes, tool boxes, tool racks, saw horses, book racks, supply shelves, stitching horse, lumber racks. Many articles were made for) the use of the School, such as a warping reel for the weaving department, footstools, fruit ladders, pig troughs, fruit drying frames, and coops. Work on the School farm was also done under the supervision of the agricultural director, such as fence building, setting out small REPORTS OF OFFICERS 51 fruits, apple, peach, plum, ,and cherry trees ; roads were graded; a flock of chickens was raised. The outstanding community services rendered were: "Culled 5 poultry flocks, assisted in building 6 poultry houses, held 9 community meetings, held a community fair, judgment at Pitman Center Community Fair, started an endless chain pig club, assisted in pruning 7S8 fruit trees and in spraying 70 fruit trees, treated 175 chickens, 2 cows, and 2 pigs, made 36 project visits, 73 other visits, received 26 inquiries, and traveled by automobile 922 miles and 234 miles by horse, and made 21 visits to rural schools." Mr. Mattil closes his report to the committee as follows: "No wonderful things have been accomplished during the past year in Vocational Agriculture work, but I feel optimistic of the outlook. People are more and more taking hold of the work, and I believe with time it will gain a good foothold; at least some sound movements have been launched for a good foundation." To those who have watched the work of the agricultural Director, it seems as if some wonderful things had been accomplished. The fact that the community has received the advice and practical help of the Director as the various farmers and their families have is in itself a wonderful thing. The work of Phyllis Higinbotham at the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center and throughout the community continues to be of in-estimable value. This past year has been an especially hard one; there has been an unusual amount of sickness both in the community and among the teachers. There have been 269 cases treated during the year. The nurse has assisted in 13 operations, 5 of them at the hospital. She made 1,171 visits, and has traveled (in four months) 525 miles. She made 22 calls at night after eight o'clock. Note in the treasurer's report the amount of fees collected. It is not large as dollars go, but represents the desire of the people to pay what they can for the services which they so highly appreciate. "During two weeks in May, Dr. Lane from the State Board of Health was in Gatlinburg, giving treatment to those who had Hook-worm disease when examined the previous August. Dr. Ogle, a Knoxville dentist, came over for some work. He examined the children of our School, and did some extracting free of charge. He said that with a few exceptions, the children's teeth were remarkably sound, a condition due, probably, to the plain diet. We borrowed a barber's chair, the only one in the village, and a recent addition at that, and it served the purpose well. Dr. Smith, of the Government TrachOma Hospital, spent two days going through six schools in the district. Be ifound a number of cases of trachoma. Thirteen-boys, girls, and one woman, were taken to the Government Hospital for treatment. Dr. Potter, a surgeon from Knoxville, was at the School in October, and performed two tonsil operations. 52 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI In addition to an intensely interesting itemized statement from Miss Higinbotham, from which the foregoing extracts have been taken, she writes as follows: "The hospital has been used more and more this last year. The increasing demand for medicines has necessitated our keeping a miniature drug store and a card index' of the treatment the people are getting, in order to renew the medicine without bothering the doctors every time. Then the doctors are sending or calling frequently for supplies and instruments when away from home and in need of some-thing unexpected. During the year, we have had to supply the sterile dressings for the operations performed. Thanks to the clubs and individual members, the hospital has been pretty well equipped. The Boston club sent, as a memorial to Jennie Allyn, one of the army kits of instruments, which is wonderfully equipped for general surgery. Dr. Chandler, through Mrs. Chandler, sent several sterilizers and a number of instruments. The Ontario club has supplied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, breast binders, old linen. It has also given the laboratory equipment, a microscope complete, with all attachments. The Des Moines club has given an army dental chair and equipment that is most acceptable. "There have been cases that the doctors would have liked to bring to the hospital this year that we could not receive, as we could not care for them. The different members of the staff have helped whenever a patient was there, having to relieve me for meals, calls, and trips, and to help with the dressings. But while they are always glad to help, they have their own duties and cannot always give the time needed at the hospital when patients are there. At present we are considering the plan of engaging a practical woman to help with the work at the hospital and the case of any patients that are taken in. We hope also to train her so that she can act as a practical nurse in the homes, where so often just such a person is needed. Miss Evelyn Bishop, the head resident, incorporates in her report of the whole work that of Miss Helen Chew, the principal of the school. "The three kinds of industrial work this year have been the weaving, sewing, and basketry. Irene Linkous, who has given us a most successful year of work, has been in charge of the weaving. Nearly all of the girls in School were taking it for the first time; consequently not much work was done for sale. Each girl wove a dress, and nearly every one made it up herself. The best result of the work done in School is that after the girls leave, they have looms in their own homes, and are able to weave for themselves and also to make things for sale, and thus get a little money for them-selves and their babies. Miss Linkous has also had the care of the Teachers' Cottage, with Aunt Lizzie Reagan to help her. "The sewing has been in charge of Mrs. Anna Dowell. The class has completed a full year of sewing, it having been thought ad REPORTS OF OFFICERS 53 visable to continue the sewing during the second term rather than to take up cooking. The girls learned different stitches, darning, patching, mending ; they made plain clothes; and in the spring, all made attractive gingham dresses. The work was systematic, practical, and thorough, and the girls were very much interested. Mrs. Dowell was also in charge of the six girls who lived in the Mary Pollard Cottage. The girls there did the house work under Mrs. Dowell's supervision. "D. C. Denton, who taught mathematics and history in the Junior High School, also had charge of athletics. He and Mr. Mattil organized a basket ball team, and accompanied the team on their several trips for games with neighboring schools. Although this was the first year these boys have played they have made an excellent showing ; and they thoroughly appreciated the new suits purchased for them. Marion Folsom, who taught the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades completed her very successful first year at the School. She was ready at all times to assist in school undertakings, and won the confidence and liking of the community. Emily Burton continued her very satisfactory work with the primary grades. She now ranks as the teacher who has been longest with us. The community and the children all feel that "Miss Emily" has become a very real part of their lives. Helen Chew has been a most efficient principal. She has taught in the Junior High School classes, and has had general oversight of the school. Her work in organizing the School curriculum, drawing up plans for the future development, and in cooperating in all community activities has made her a most valuable member of the staff. "During the year the total enrollment has been 131 pupils. Even with an unusual amount of sickness this year, the attendance has kept up remarkably. Some of the county schools had to close because of the flu epidemic. Each year the teachers are more strict in regard to examinations, and so some of the boys and girls who had had to drop out for a while on account of sickness or to help on the farms returned for the final examinations. "Noon lunches were planned and prepared by Miss Linkous, and were served during the winter term to the children of the primary grades. The girls in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades set the tables, washed the dishes, and assisted in every way they could. The dormitory problem, is still one of our most difficult ones. The need for dormitories for both boys ,and girls is so great that in the opinion of the staff it takes precedence over other building needs. This past year, first four, and then six girls were housed in the Mary Pollard Cottage, with Mrs. Dowell as house mother. Miss Chew wrote in one of her reports to the chairman that the girls living with Mrs. Dowell were the only ones in the School who were getting a home atmosphere and an informational background of any sort, such as constitute so large a part of the education of all of us. The mothers are 54 THE A.RROW OF PI BETA PHI many of them anxious to have their girls come to live under such supervision. During the autumn term, the boys, under the supervision of Mr. Denton, lived at the Whaley Hotel and home. After Christmas they went to live in a very desirable little cottage recently purchased by Miss Bishop and Miss Higinbotham. A sister of Aunt Lizzie, Mrs. Ownby, kept house for them. This was the happiest solution of the living problem for the boys that we have yet found. The Stuart Cottage, in which Jim Reagan, the superintendent of the work on the place, has been living, will soon be free for dormitory use, as Jim is building a cottage for himself on land adjoining the School property. The expected consolidation of two or three schools with the Pi Beta Phi School did not take place, one of the principal reasons being the impossibility of transportation. Roads have been in process of construction during so much of the year that the children could not have come from some of the localities. Then, too, a local pride has made some of the communities wish to retain their own little school, inefficient as it may be. The influence of the Settlement School and the teachers, however, is not dependent upon the boys and girls coming down to Gatlinburg. It may never be wise or possible to effect any large degree of consolidation in so mountainous a country as ours. Our teachers can go to them. The people of the Sugarlands, a district about seven miles from Gatlinburg, have urged Miss Chew to come up there and teach their school this summer, and she has promised to do it. She gives her services to this splendid work. When we are able to build the proposed school building it may be that the consolidation of the upper grades can be brought about, and the grades for the little ones taught in their own schools, under supervision. The supervision undertaken this last year, to which the committee voted financial cooperation, has proved a success. This work of Miss Chew this summer then, is not only a very fine service, but is an experiment that may lead the Committee to feel that the sending out of II (1) teachers to isolated communities is a step to be taken as soon as funds can be obtained for it. It is hard for me not to give you the reports with every bit of their detail. It is a very live place, the II B 4 Settlement School at Gatlinburg. Three of the staff, the head resident, the nurse, and the agricultural director, are in residence the whole year. They carry on their work in the School, the immediate community, and in far out-lying districts, and also represent us at meetings of school and health associations in Nashville and Knoxville. There are no union hours to their days; daylight saving or standard time has no special significance for them. Note the miles they have traveled, the visits made at night, the hundred and one things they have done. What have we done: Given a few dollars? Let us give until our dollars measure up a little more satisfactorily to their efforts. Respectfully submitted, KATE B. MILLER REPORTS OF OFFICERS 55 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING Following is the report of the second annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee held at Gatlinburg, June 6-13, 1923. As stated in THE ARRow for October 1922, Grand Council voted to em-power the committee to administer the Settlement School funds and authorized the Committee to engage the School staff and to develop the property. This year the Committee accordingly took the following action : Land-The title to the seven 'acres known as the "Sims land" was reported clear. The remainder of the Ogle mortgage on the Andy Ogle land was paid, thus clearing the title. The titles to all the property are now clear. Buildings-Extensive repairs and improvements on the Mary Pollard and Stuart Cottages were authorized. It was decided to have an electrician from the East Tennessee Electric Company inspect all lines and wiring. Two fire extinguishers are to be installed in each building and adequate hose for fire protection purchased. Hereafter in constructing of buildings as nearly fireproof roofing as possible will be used. Department of Public Health-It was announced that state aid will be furnished this department under the provisions of the Shepard-Towner Act upon application and such application was authorized. It was decided that we become active in establishing a regular semi-annual dental clinic to be conducted by a competent dentist. Miss Higinbotham was given the title of Head Nurse. The Head Resident with the approval of the Head Nurse, was empowered to engage an assistant to the Head Nurse. Miss Nesbit, the State Supervisor of Pub-lie Health nurses spent Sunday with us and in informal consultation gave us much valuable advice concerning public health work. School-As soon as it is deemed advisable we are to have nine months school for the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth grades. The Head Resident has been instructed to secure, if possible, state aid from the Smith-Hughes Department of Home Economics. Five scholar-ships are to be available for the year 1923-24, this number to be in-creased if necessity demands.
