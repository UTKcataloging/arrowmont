ANDY HUFF On December 13, Andy Huff died at his hotel, The Mountain View, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. As all Pi Phis who have had the opportunity of visiting Gatlinburg know, his knowledge of the community and faith in its people contributed immeasurably to the development of the entire Smoky Mountain vicinity. Mr. Huff went to Gatlinburg at the age of 19 and lived there the remaining 52 years of Andy Huff with 13 of his 14 grandchildren and Mrs. Huff . his life. He was in the lumbering business until 1929 when the government put restrictions on the cutting of lumber in that area. Meanwhile, his vision and clear judgment had prompted him to build the first small two-story hotel in the neighborhood and in 1928, the present, modern, resort-structure replaced the original building. With his very good friend "Uncle Steve" Whaley, Mr. Huff was a leading figure in the establishment of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, in writing of her first discouraging meeting in Gatlinburg said, "Several days after the first mass meeting, I was on my way down the tortuous mountain side holding on to the sides of the old buck-board, when there came into sight a man pacing up and down. His horse was hitched to a sapling beside the road. It was Andy Huff. He stopped me and, placing his big, strong hands on the dash-board, announced that he had come to stop my leaving `these parts' until I had given a solemn promise that the Pi Phis would bring a school to Gatlinburg for his children. Of all the indelible impressions these people made upon me in the first days of our life among them, this early plea of Andy Huff stands out as the greatest force actuating my years of daily work for them and for Pi Beta Phi in this mountain school." He has always been an intimate part of the Settlement School's existence there. Not long ago he told a visiting Pi Phi, "I aim never to let a day go by without doing something for Pi Phi." From its beginning, Mr. and Mrs. Huff actively supported the school in every way. Their two sons, Jack and Jim and their three daughters, Mattie, Estella and Blanche, all attended the school. Mattie (Mrs. Larson) later became a Pi Phi at Ames, Iowa, and is now with her husband managing a large cafe and Tourist camp, Rocky Waters, not far from her father's hotel. Just last summer, Mr. Huff was over-heard saying to one of his guests, "Now if you want a really good meal, go up to Mattie's." Estella Huff Cox and her husband were both members of the Settlement School staff before opening their tourist camp in Gatlinburg. Blanche Huff Arthur was also a Pi Phi pledge at Ames. Her husband is well known to the Pi Phi Committees for his excellent surveying work. The two Huff boys, jack and Jim, married Pi Phis. Jack and his wife have a scenic mountain lodge on the top of Mount Le Conte and Jim and his wife have a Duncan-Hines approved tourist camp in the Burg. Mr. Huff's first wife, Martha Whaley, died in 1933 after a long illness. Some years later, Mr. Huff married Miss Mary King who survives him. Also surviving are 14 grandchildren and his now school-age grandchildren attend the Pi Phi school. 256 THE MARCH ARROW .25'7 BARBARA HUFF Barbara Huff is the oldest grandchild of Andy Huff. She entered the University of Tennessee in the fall of '48, having graduated from the Pi Beta Phi high school in Gatlinburg the previous June.' Barbara pledged Pi Phi and, in due time, was voted the best pledge in Tennessee Gamma. This honor won for her the recognition pin with the tiny pearl in the shaft. At Greek week banquet, she was elected "goddess of the Greeks" by all of the pledges of the men's fraternities. She was one of six members of the "Aloha Oe" committee, a committee in charge of the presentation of annual awards at an impresssive senior farewell ceremony. She is a member of the university social and activities committee for 1949-50. This committee has the responsibility of planning the social and activities calendar for the university year. She is house-president of Heusen Hall a freshman dormitory for 1949-50. She was political representative for her chapter in campus politics as well as historian for her pledge group and publicity chairman for her chapter. She is a member of the Y.W.C.A. and Home Economics Club and advertising manager for the Tennesean and worked on the school paper and school year-book. She found time to play basketball, her favorite sport, and took part in the intramurals. With all of this outstanding activity record, she had time for study. She is majoring in Home Economics and ended the year with a B plus average. Barbara Huff, Tennessee Gamma Pi Phi Nurse, Marjorie Chalmers PI BETA PHI HEALTH CENTER November 1, 1949, marked another mile-stone for Pi Phi nurse, Marjorie Chalmers. On that day she began her fifteenth year of service at the Pi Beta Phi Health Center in Gatlin-burg. For the past year and a half, old and new neighbors, friends and patients have been coming to see Nurse Chalmers in our new and modern Jennie Nicol memorial Health Center, and Arlie Watson, our ever-cheerful, helpful maintenance man and his wife, Josie, now live in the little old Ogle cottage which had seen hard service as the official Health Center since 1922. Over this short span of time Gatlinburg has grown. Its location at the Gateway to the beautiful National Park, bringing its yearly influx of tourists, has been the main contributing factor and our Settlement School program has expanded to meet the new and varied problems of a growing but still needy community. Nurse Marjorie continues to make helpful friendly calls to almost inaccessible places such as "up Baskins Way" or "Turkey's Nest" but the Health Program has gradually evolved into one where the emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of preventive medicine and health education. Every morning from 7:30 to 9:30 Marjorie is in her office to take care of first-aid cases, mostly school children who saunter in and out of the back door of Health Center. In addition to her service for our two Gatlinburg schools, Marjorie serves three rural county schools ; The Glades, Carter-town and Banner. Including the ....... . 58 THE MARCH ARROW Gatlinburg Elementary and High Schools, between 600 and 700 school children and one-half to two-thirds as many pre-school children are cared for by Pi Phi Health Center. There are about 70 to 80 rural schools in the out-lying area that have no service given by a regular nurse. Fortunately for Marjorie's time and strength, the, three rural schools under Pi Phi health supervision open before the Gatlinburg schools so that she is able to make preliminary inspections there to get their records and, as Marjorie says, "Get them used to her." Then she goes back with her scales and measurers to give the regular physical examinations. One record is made out for every child of school age in the area, including dates for their inoculations, and a record is sent home to the parents. Her records are most valuable because the children have a way of wanting an inoculation whether they need one or not. After the preliminary fall work in the Country and Gatlinburg schools, Nurse Marjorie makes ,?egular inspection calls, shows health movies, and gives health talks. She is convinced now that the youngsters save all of their boils, stubbed toes, and minor cuts and bruises for her visits. She spreads the dressings on the table and, as she works, gives demonstration talks. At the pre-school round-up for the Gatlin-burg Elementary and High Schools, she now has the assistance of Dr. Schilling, Gatlinburg doctor, and Dr. Wadley, Gatlinburg dentist, as well as the organizational help of the Gatlin-burg Parent-Teachers association. This past fall, Mrs. G. Herbert Smith, Settlement School Committee member, who had gone to Gatlin-burg to supervise the making of a new movie of the school, found herself much to her surprise, assisting at the physical examination clinic. Duties have a way of over-lapping at the Pi Phi school. Dental defects, as usual, head the list of corrections. 14 children were supplied with glasses last year and during the first two months of this school year 950 preventive inoculations have been given with serum furnished by the state. Also, some allergy shots have been given under the Doctor's direction. Then, too, there is the crippled children's work. These 'children are taken to the children's clinic in Knoxville, Marjorie transports them and makes arrangements for the funds for the corrections if the families are unable to manage the expense. The Sigma Phi Gamma fund for correction last year provided dentistry for two children, furnished tooth brushes and tooth paste to the students in the rural schools as well as for a few needy ones in Gatlinburg. It also paid together with some money from the local. Lions Club for eye examinations for eleven children and provided glasses for nine. There was enough left over in the fund to supply the medication for vitamin deficiency for two children. Friday afternoons are given over to clinics at Health center for both children and adults and, at these clinics, consultations may range all of the way from preventive medicine through love to death and taxes. During the year, with the help of the local phy5ician and dentist again, there are dental clinics, chest clinics, and nutrition clinics. In addition to our school medical work Pi Beta Phi through Marjorie has a finger in the community-health "pie" such as keeping a watchful eye on Community pest control and other such community health council problems. The Gatlinburg Press, a fine weekly newspaper, was started in Gatlinburg in October, 1947, and Marjorie has missed only one week since that time with her informative health columns. Last May, Marj orie told the Settlement School Committee that never before have we had so many healthy children. There were remarkably few under-weights and about 6 over-weights. All but one of these over-weights were taken to the Doctor for checking and treatment. The under-weights came from schools where no hot lunches were served. On November first in her concluding paragraph of her column "Health Shots", Marjorie wrote, "Fourteen years of service. Emergencies come and babies grow. Crooked feet are made straight and yesterday's barefoot youngster has youngsters of his own. Busy years, they have been, and very happy ones. Discouragements are part of the daily fare, of course, for there is so much more that should be done. But in the balance-scale of the days, we truly hope to see the omissions and the failures quite out-weighed by the side that holds `things accomplished'. Perhaps some day, if we hope long enough and work hard enough, it will be so." But Pi Phis in looking from over the country and back over the years at the service given through the Health Center by Pi Phi nurses can now sum it up by calling it "just plain, pure, unsauced accomplishments."

ALPHA PROVINCE EAST NOVA SCOTIA ALPHA DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY Chartered, 1934 INITIATED, December 3, 1949: Patricia Beatty, Joanne Beaubien, Nancy Briggs, Elizabeth Clarke, Elizabeth Corkum, Elizabeth Cousins, Marion Fraser, Mary Lou Forbes, Geraldine Grant, Pearl Goodwin, Thelma Harvey, Marion Kerr, Sheila MacDonald, Barbara King, Kathryn Murray, Nola Murray, Barbara McGeoch, Judith McKeen, Elizabeth Mc-Nichol, Doreen Simpson, Mary Lou Sutherland, Cecily Mader, Alberta White, Marjorie Yeadon, Lorraine Ware. This year, for the first time, Dalhousie held a Home Coming Weekend; such a successful one that it is hoped the venture will become an annual occurrence. Many alumni accepted their invitations and from the time of their arrival in Halifax participated with great spirit in all events. These included the Alumni Show and Dance given by the Glee Club and Dramatic Society, a football game played in spite of rain, a reception held at Shirreff Hall Residence, and a chapel service. These former students showed great interest in the new Arts Building under construction on campus. The laying of the corner stone of this new building was a very impressive ceremony with an almost medieval touch. The Circus Rushing Party was most successful. Many of the members wore gypsy, clown, or animal costumes and the rushees were warned to wear slacks. The walls of the rooms were lined with various booths, with the Fortune-telling Tent and the Hot Dog Stand proving about the most popular. The Nova Scotia As had an enjoyable weekend at the time of Mrs. F. H. Carson's visit. The Grand Secretary was able to attend pledging and to speak to both actives and pledges just before the cooky-shine which traditionally follows the ceremony. Also at this time, Dr. Roberta B. Nichols and Mrs. Murray Macneille, sponsors, entertained the whole group at a Birthday Tea in honour of the chapter's fifteenth anniversary. Initiation was held at the Nova Scotian Hotel and after-ward at the banquet the Initiates presented a most amusing skit a Fashion Parade of Past and Present. A dapper young miss in a green creation of the 1920's practically stoppe the show. Panhellenic has been doing a great deal of extra work on campus this, year preparing the way for the new freshette rushing system. Booklets of fraternity information have been prepared and sent to all freshettes and a form was enclosed to be filled out and returned by all those interested in fraternity. Nova Scotia A will again offer a scholarship to a freshette entering Dalhousie. The chapter is glad to have last year's winner, Kathryn Murray, an active, member this year. The International Student Service Campaign took place in the fall and the Nova Scotia As turned out to help with publicity, dance decorations and tagging. The proceeds from the campaign are to be used at Dalhousie. Scholarships will be awarded to students from sterling areas to help them meet their increased financial obligations. Interest was especially high as a European student, brought over by I.S.S. is at Dalhousie this year. PLEDGED: Adele Findlay, Joline Higgins.

ANDY HUFF On December 13, Andy Huff died at his hotel, The Mountain View, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. As all Pi Phis who have had the opportunity of visiting Gatlinburg know, his knowledge of the community and faith in its people contributed immeasurably to the development of the entire Smoky Mountain vicinity. Mr. Huff went to Gatlinburg at the age of 19 and lived there the remaining 52 years of Andy Huff with 13 of his 14 grandchildren and Mrs. Huff . his life. He was in the lumbering business until 1929 when the government put restrictions on the cutting of lumber in that area. Meanwhile, his vision and clear judgment had prompted him to build the first small two-story hotel in the neighborhood and in 1928, the present, modern, resort-structure replaced the original building. With his very good friend "Uncle Steve" Whaley, Mr. Huff was a leading figure in the establishment of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, in writing of her first discouraging meeting in Gatlinburg said, "Several days after the first mass meeting, I was on my way down the tortuous mountain side holding on to the sides of the old buck-board, when there came into sight a man pacing up and down. His horse was hitched to a sapling beside the road. It was Andy Huff. He stopped me and, placing his big, strong hands on the dash-board, announced that he had come to stop my leaving `these parts' until I had given a solemn promise that the Pi Phis would bring a school to Gatlinburg for his children. Of all the indelible impressions these people made upon me in the first days of our life among them, this early plea of Andy Huff stands out as the greatest force actuating my years of daily work for them and for Pi Beta Phi in this mountain school." He has always been an intimate part of the Settlement School's existence there. Not long ago he told a visiting Pi Phi, "I aim never to let a day go by without doing something for Pi Phi." From its beginning, Mr. and Mrs. Huff actively supported the school in every way. Their two sons, Jack and Jim and their three daughters, Mattie, Estella and Blanche, all attended the school. Mattie (Mrs. Larson) later became a Pi Phi at Ames, Iowa, and is now with her husband managing a large cafe and Tourist camp, Rocky Waters, not far from her father's hotel. Just last summer, Mr. Huff was over-heard saying to one of his guests, "Now if you want a really good meal, go up to Mattie's." Estella Huff Cox and her husband were both members of the Settlement School staff before opening their tourist camp in Gatlinburg. Blanche Huff Arthur was also a Pi Phi pledge at Ames. Her husband is well known to the Pi Phi Committees for his excellent surveying work. The two Huff boys, jack and Jim, married Pi Phis. Jack and his wife have a scenic mountain lodge on the top of Mount Le Conte and Jim and his wife have a Duncan-Hines approved tourist camp in the Burg. Mr. Huff's first wife, Martha Whaley, died in 1933 after a long illness. Some years later, Mr. Huff married Miss Mary King who survives him. Also surviving are 14 grandchildren and his now school-age grandchildren attend the Pi Phi school. 256 THE MARCH ARROW .25'7 BARBARA HUFF Barbara Huff is the oldest grandchild of Andy Huff. She entered the University of Tennessee in the fall of '48, having graduated from the Pi Beta Phi high school in Gatlinburg the previous June.' Barbara pledged Pi Phi and, in due time, was voted the best pledge in Tennessee Gamma. This honor won for her the recognition pin with the tiny pearl in the shaft. At Greek week banquet, she was elected "goddess of the Greeks" by all of the pledges of the men's fraternities. She was one of six members of the "Aloha Oe" committee, a committee in charge of the presentation of annual awards at an impresssive senior farewell ceremony. She is a member of the university social and activities committee for 1949-50. This committee has the responsibility of planning the social and activities calendar for the university year. She is house-president of Heusen Hall a freshman dormitory for 1949-50. She was political representative for her chapter in campus politics as well as historian for her pledge group and publicity chairman for her chapter. She is a member of the Y.W.C.A. and Home Economics Club and advertising manager for the Tennesean and worked on the school paper and school year-book.

She is majoring in Home Economics and ended the year with a B plus average. Barbara Huff, Tennessee Gamma Pi Phi Nurse, Marjorie Chalmers PI BETA PHI HEALTH CENTER November 1, 1949, marked another mile-stone for Pi Phi nurse, Marjorie Chalmers. On that day she began her fifteenth year of service at the Pi Beta Phi Health Center in Gatlin-burg. For the past year and a half, old and new neighbors, friends and patients have been coming to see Nurse Chalmers in our new and modern Jennie Nicol memorial Health Center, and Arlie Watson, our ever-cheerful, helpful maintenance man and his wife, Josie, now live in the little old Ogle cottage which had seen hard service as the official Health Center since 1922. Over this short span of time Gatlinburg has grown. Its location at the Gateway to the beautiful National Park, bringing its yearly influx of tourists, has been the main contributing factor and our Settlement School program has expanded to meet the new and varied problems of a growing but still needy community. Nurse Marjorie continues to make helpful friendly calls to almost inaccessible places such as "up Baskins Way" or "Turkey's Nest" but the Health Program has gradually evolved into one where the emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of preventive medicine and health education. Every morning from 7:30 to 9:30 Marjorie is in her office to take care of first-aid cases, mostly school children who saunter in and out of the back door of Health Center. In addition to her service for our two Gatlinburg schools, Marjorie serves three rural county schools ; The Glades, Carter-town and Banner. Including the ....... . 58 THE MARCH ARROW Gatlinburg Elementary and High Schools, between 600 and 700 school children and one-half to two-thirds as many pre-school children are cared for by Pi Phi Health Center. There are about 70 to 80 rural schools in the out-lying area that have no service given by a regular nurse. Fortunately for Marjorie's time and strength, the, three rural schools under Pi Phi health supervision open before the Gatlinburg schools so that she is able to make preliminary inspections there to get their records and, as Marjorie says, "Get them used to her." Then she goes back with her scales and measurers to give the regular physical examinations. One record is made out for every child of school age in the area, including dates for their inoculations, and a record is sent home to the parents. Her records are most valuable because the children have a way of wanting an inoculation whether they need one or not. After the preliminary fall work in the Country and Gatlinburg schools, Nurse Marjorie makes ,?egular inspection calls, shows health movies, and gives health talks. She is convinced now that the youngsters save all of their boils, stubbed toes, and minor cuts and bruises for her visits. She spreads the dressings on the table and, as she works, gives demonstration talks. At the pre-school round-up for the Gatlin-burg Elementary and High Schools, she now has the assistance of Dr. Schilling, Gatlinburg doctor, and Dr. Wadley, Gatlinburg dentist, as well as the organizational help of the Gatlin-burg Parent-Teachers association. This past fall, Mrs. G. Herbert Smith, Settlement School Committee member, who had gone to Gatlin-burg to supervise the making of a new movie of the school, found herself much to her surprise, assisting at the physical examination clinic. Duties have a way of over-lapping at the Pi Phi school. Dental defects, as usual, head the list of corrections. 14 children were supplied with glasses last year and during the first two months of this school year 950 preventive inoculations have been given with serum furnished by the state. Also, some allergy shots have been given under the Doctor's direction. Then, too, there is the crippled children's work. These 'children are taken to the children's clinic in Knoxville, Marjorie transports them and makes arrangements for the funds for the corrections if the families are unable to manage the expense. The Sigma Phi Gamma fund for correction last year provided dentistry for two children, furnished tooth brushes and tooth paste to the students in the rural schools as well as for a few needy ones in Gatlinburg. It also paid together with some money from the local. Lions Club for eye examinations for eleven children and provided glasses for nine. There was enough left over in the fund to supply the medication for vitamin deficiency for two children. Friday afternoons are given over to clinics at Health center for both children and adults and, at these clinics, consultations may range all of the way from preventive medicine through love to death and taxes. During the year, with the help of the local phy5ician and dentist again, there are dental clinics, chest clinics, and nutrition clinics. In addition to our school medical work Pi Beta Phi through Marjorie has a finger in the community-health "pie" such as keeping a watchful eye on Community pest control and other such community health council problems. The Gatlinburg Press, a fine weekly newspaper, was started in Gatlinburg in October, 1947, and Marjorie has missed only one week since that time with her informative health columns. Last May, Marj orie told the Settlement School Committee that never before have we had so many healthy children. There were remarkably few under-weights and about 6 over-weights. All but one of these over-weights were taken to the Doctor for checking and treatment. The under-weights came from schools where no hot lunches were served. On November first in her concluding paragraph of her column "Health Shots", Marjorie wrote, "Fourteen years of service. Emergencies come and babies grow. Crooked feet are made straight and yesterday's barefoot youngster has youngsters of his own. Busy years, they have been, and very happy ones. Discouragements are part of the daily fare, of course, for there is so much more that should be done. But in the balance-scale of the days, we truly hope to see the omissions and the failures quite out-weighed by the side that holds `things accomplished'. Perhaps some day, if we hope long enough and work hard enough, it will be so." But Pi Phis in looking from over the country and back over the years at the service given through the Health Center by Pi Phi nurses can now sum it up by calling it "just plain, pure, unsauced accomplishments."

ALPHA PROVINCE EAST NOVA SCOTIA ALPHA DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY Chartered, 1934 INITIATED, December 3, 1949: Patricia Beatty, Joanne Beaubien, Nancy Briggs, Elizabeth Clarke, Elizabeth Corkum, Elizabeth Cousins, Marion Fraser, Mary Lou Forbes, Geraldine Grant, Pearl Goodwin, Thelma Harvey, Marion Kerr, Sheila MacDonald, Barbara King, Kathryn Murray, Nola Murray, Barbara McGeoch, Judith McKeen, Elizabeth Mc-Nichol, Doreen Simpson, Mary Lou Sutherland, Cecily Mader, Alberta White, Marjorie Yeadon, Lorraine Ware. This year, for the first time, Dalhousie held a Home Coming Weekend; such a successful one that it is hoped the venture will become an annual occurrence. Many alumni accepted their invitations and from the time of their arrival in Halifax participated with great spirit in all events. These included the Alumni Show and Dance given by the Glee Club and Dramatic Society, a football game played in spite of rain, a reception held at Shirreff Hall Residence, and a chapel service. These former students showed great interest in the new Arts Building under construction on campus. The laying of the corner stone of this new building was a very impressive ceremony with an almost medieval touch. The Circus Rushing Party was most successful. Many of the members wore gypsy, clown, or animal costumes and the rushees were warned to wear slacks. The walls of the rooms were lined with various booths, with the Fortune-telling Tent and the Hot Dog Stand proving about the most popular. The Nova Scotia As had an enjoyable weekend at the time of Mrs. F. H. Carson's visit. The Grand Secretary was able to attend pledging and to speak to both actives and pledges just before the cooky-shine which traditionally follows the ceremony. Also at this time, Dr. Roberta B. Nichols and Mrs. Murray Macneille, sponsors, entertained the whole group at a Birthday Tea in honour of the chapter's fifteenth anniversary. Initiation was held at the Nova Scotian Hotel and after-ward at the banquet the Initiates presented a most amusing skit a Fashion Parade of Past and Present. A dapper young miss in a green creation of the 1920's practically stoppe the show. Panhellenic has been doing a great deal of extra work on campus this, year preparing the way for the new freshette rushing system. Booklets of fraternity information have been prepared and sent to all freshettes and a form was enclosed to be filled out and returned by all those interested in fraternity. Nova Scotia A will again offer a scholarship to a freshette entering Dalhousie. The chapter is glad to have last year's winner, Kathryn Murray, an active, member this year. The International Student Service Campaign took place in the fall and the Nova Scotia As turned out to help with publicity, dance decorations and tagging. The proceeds from the campaign are to be used at Dalhousie. Scholarships will be awarded to students from sterling areas to help them meet their increased financial obligations. Interest was especially high as a European student, brought over by I.S.S. is at Dalhousie this year. PLEDGED: Adele Findlay, Joline Higgins.
