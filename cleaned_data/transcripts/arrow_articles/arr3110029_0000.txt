        28 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI GRAND VICE-PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS 29 GRAND V10E-PRESIDENT'S DEDICATORY ADDRESS Dear Friends in Gatlinburg and Sevier County. By our faces you can see how happy we are to be with you today. This is a happy day for Pi Beta Phi. In order that you may know why the dedication of this school building means so much to us as Pi Beta Phis, I am going to tell you something of the organization of our society and our object in founding a Settlement School. Our society which is not a religious organization, though its members are religious, is something like the Odd Fellows, with which you men are familiar. We have chapters in different parts of the country just as the Odd Fellows do and we take in members in much the saane way. That is, no one is asked to join a chapter unless everyone in that chapter is willing she should be asked. Then as each Odd Fellow puts on three links to show his loyalty to the ideals of his society and his brothers, we put on this little arrow to show our loyalty to our sisters in Pi Beta Phi. There is one marked difference between these societies. Men may join the Odd Fellows at any time, but girls can become members of Pi Beta Phi only when they are in college. (I joined nineteen years ago. These other girls won't let me tell how long ago they joined.) While we are in college and belong to the active chapter we are called "active girls". After leaving college, they call us "alum.nm". While the active girls are very much interested in our Settlement School, and many of them have given money toward it, the alumnae are responsible for collecting the funds with which to maintain it. Before telling you just what our object is in founding this school, I want to tell you what I may of the real meaning of our society to us. As we put on this little arrow, we pledge ourselves and those girls who have invited us to join, to become as good and noble as we can become and we promise to be a true friend to every girl who wears the arrow. We become sisters in Pi Beta Phi and we love each other. Because we are true friends to each other and love each other 30 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI as we do, this makes us better friends to everybody. If we have profited by this close friendship which we enjoy while we are in college, we learn to become better neighbors and friends after we leave college. Now I said, we who wear the arrow are sisters in Pi Beta Pi and that we love each other. That doesn't mean that we always agree and that we never have any quarrels. You know just how it is in your family life. You don't always agree and you sometimes quarrel. Yet you know you love each other. It is that way with us in Pi Beta Phi. Our little arrow is a constant reminder to live nobly and to love everybody. I think from this you can understand why we love Pi Beta Phi. Now I want to tell you just why we are starting this school in Gatlinburg. About fifty years ago, twelve girls in Monmouth College decided they would form a society to cultivate friendship and to do things which would make other people happy. They thought they should have a secret and this is what it was. They bought the wood for a poor family in Monmouth and did not let anyone know about it. This was the beginning of Pi Beta Phi almost fifty years ago and today we have forty-eight chapters and sixty-two alumnx clubs. Ten of those girls who started the society are living now and we wanted to do something to show them how we love them and how much we appreciate what they have done for us. We wanted to do something in keeping with their original idea of helpfulness, some-thing which would bring happiness to some one. And we wanted to establish a school because we believe in schools. We love school, we joined Pi Beta Phi when we were in school, and we think we are better mothers, neighbors, and friends because we have had the chance to go to school as long as we have. So in thinking of a memorial to our founders, it was decided that we establish a school somewhere. We found you here in Gatlinburg who were willing to help us to carry out our plan and we are here today to dedicate this building. What you have done in helping us to get the land and to put up the building has aided us greatly in carrying out our plan for the school. Your interest and help has made it easier for us to get the money we have needed. And now I must tell you how we raise the money for this school. We have no money all ready for it but we have a committee to look after the raising of it, Mrs. Helmick, whom you all know, is chair-man of it and Miss Miller is a member. We have a great many Pi ARTICLES FRATERNITY GIRLS SHOULD READ 31 Beta Phis living all over the country and our committee writes to them about you and about our work here and they show their love for you and Pi Beta Phi by sending what money they can. Then we have alumnae clubs, something like your tomato club here, and they raise money in various ways, by giving entertainments or socials, or by each member giving or earning money. In the club to which I belong some of the women earned their money by making and selling things. One woman made aprons and sold them. Another made cake and jam. Some wrote stories for papers, and a great many did work for which their husbands paid them. You see we have all sorts of ways for raising the money and then people are all very much interested in you and in this work which we are doing for the love of those girls who started Pi Beta Phi almost fifty years ago. And now you know our reason for having our school here, how we raise the money f6r it, why our teachers are so interested in it and why we are happy today to join you in dedicating this building to our founders. ARTICLES WHICH EVERY FRATERNITY GIRL SHOULD RE The editor has selected two of the most valuable articles which have appeared in the fraternity journals of other organizations during the past year for reprinting in this issue. The first of these which follows is the toast given by Mrs. Parmelee, President of Delta Delta Delta at the Pan-Hellenic luncheon in Chicago. It has been reprinted in many journals as a valuable piece of constructive criticism. HOSTILITIES TO FRATERNITIES, ITS CAUSE, ITS CURE The present opposition to fraternities is only a very recent crystallization of much sporadic criticism, dating back to that early anti-secret, anti-Masonic agitation which resulted in the first of all Greek-letter fraternities, Phi Beta Kappa, revealing its secrets. Opposition is of two kinds, opposition without our ranks, and opposition even within our ranks. A great deal of the outside opposition must be credited to the old-time and even present day mock initiations of the class societies of Harvard and Yale and elsewhere where the class society exists.
