        170 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI WAR (From New York Times) Glorious thou, as terrible thou art, And beautiful as only Death can be, Yet, boding, at thy very name we start, Thou scarlet splendor, come to set us free! We cower, bound with chains of trivial things, Jailed in a high stockade of dull routine Where thoughts and fancies trail stained, broken wings And earthward, with unseeing eyes, we lean, Till, sudden hark! thy wild, appalling cry! The barriers fall, the brittle fetters break, And men look up, as who first see the sky, And rise and move as though but now awake. They waited Death in fear or resignation Who now, as wrestlers trained, leap to embrace The Death in thee, and, with a wild elation, Unflinching, strive at grips with thee for place. Brother of fire and storm, and overlord Of elemental passions, drenching earth In blood and tears, surely thou art abhorred Most of all powers of demoniac birth, Yet thy fierce fires must still, destroying, purge Till gone ,the wrongs we hoard, the shame we cherish, With thrones of Kings and slavery's chains and scourge, When, with the last of these, thou, too, shalt perish! WANDA PETRUNKEVITCH, Maryland A. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 1' NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON Those who have followed the Pi Beta Phi Settlement Scho through the various stages of metamorphosis should make an effort visit the school before the metamorphosis is entirely complete. A ready, it has ceased to be "a" mountain school. Throughout section it goes by the name of "the college," and is in truth an educ tional institution which is ranked with the best schools in the sta. Those who founded the school in the face of denominational opp sition and natural hostility of the mountaineers toward "book larni: will appreciate the great strides forward that the school and the col munity have made in the past five years. Several innovations have been inaugurated this year with mark success. The first of these is a lyceum course which is held in t school every two weeks, and which the people attend en masse. T first, given by Mr. Prickett, was a radiopticon lecture on the ci of Birmingham. Another was a musical given by Miss Evel: Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. T attend these, people came from a distance of eight miles, and we very nearly enthusiastic iii their praises. (Their most superlati expressions are "all right" and "reckon it wasn't so bad" I) Our ki: of music is literally a revelation to the mountaineers. All of thi music is in the old English ballad form and admits of no develo ment. Recently, steps have been taken to form an orchestra to composed of school students, two of the parents, and the teache and this step we are encouraging. On the last Friday of each month there is another educatior entertainment, differing from the first in that it is given by the st dents of the various rooms. This, we hope, is the nucleus for Parent-Teachers' Club, but realize that its growth will be slow. is such a radical departure from anything attempted hereabouts. If one were to ask the girls what they liked best in the school tl year, they would promptly reply "music and cooking," with cooki leading popular favor. All of us, for that matter, are proud of c new kitchen. While its equipment is not complete by any means, is a decided improvement over the old method of taking the girls the teachers' cottage for lessons. The partition which divides t 20 x 30 room into departments for sewing and cooking was built the manual training boys and the same boys are making the necessz wooden utensils. 172 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI It is a theory founded upon fact that many diseases peculiar to the mountain people can be traced directly to the unsanitary condition and their unbalanced rations. Generally speaking, in every home the customary meal of beans, corn bread, and apple sauce is repeated morning, noon, and night, with slight variation. It is, indeed, a satisfaction to see how eagerly the children leani the different new food combinations. The same responsive spirit characterizes the sewing classes, al-though now and then the ideas of the older generations are given up with a struggle. Recently, Mrs. Prickett asked the girls to bring material for pillow slips. One girl refused, and when pressed for a reason, replied, "because we have two pair already." An interesting departure from the regular school curriculum is the class for so-called delinquents. In this class come the older boys and girls who. barely know how to read or write and who have not entered school before because they were ashamed to start with the little tots where they belonged. They are in assembly with the advanced grades, and the sight of their solemn, scared faces in contrast with the eager, laughing faces of our regular pupils is truly touching. In this and other ways we feel that we are reaching all children of school age wtihin a radius of five miles. To get children from distances greater than this is practically impossible because of the handicap of bad roads. Unless we can evolve some system whereby we can supply Pi Phi teachers to the outlying district schools, using the present school as a center, the school has just about reached its maxi-mum enrollment. In the meantime, our efforts are directed along the line of intensive rather than extensive education. It seems as if the psychological problems that we are called upon to meet were never greater than they are at present. The pupils, even those who have attended the school since its inception, are still in the formative stage and are still drawn into the struggle between the ideas of the old and the new generation. Recently we visited at the cabin of one of our children, one of the wellAnown families of the Burg. The mother greeted us in a cluttered room, sans shoes and vigorously chewing a snuff stick. Presently, their oldest daughter, who is finishing (through the kindness of a Pi Phi) the education started in our school, at Maryville College, appeared upon the scene. We held our breath at the tableau and wondered how to relieve the NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 173 embarrassing situation. We need not have worried for never was a situation handled more tactfully. There was no apology nor sign of embarrassment, and the deference the daughter showed her mother was truly an object lesson to us. Another similar incident illustrating the strides that the younger generation are making with the aid of an education occurred at the John Parton cabin. The day we arrived, the wife and mother was drowsily rocking to and fro smoking a corncob pipe (which disappeared as if by magic when we entered) . Beside her sat Veatress, a child of nine, student in the upper fourth grade. She was working buttonholes on a dress which she had actually made from start to finish by herself. While we chatted, she continued to sew busily, stopping only long enough to apologize because she had not found time to scrub the house that day. By the next ARROW, we hope to report work in the Red Cross classes. The people here, contrary to popular belief, are intensely patriotic and the you"nger ones seized upon the idea of sewing for the soldiers with avidity. We are waiting only for the arrival of supplies which will come from our nearest Red Cross chapter, Sevierville, before organizing an auxiliary at "Little Pigeon." MARJORIE JACKSON.

PRICKETT In writing this short sketch of the life of Norman R. Prickett, I am afraid I shall fail to do him justice, as I consider him one of the finest characters I have known. He occupies a very tender spot in my heart, having been in my home in the capacity of nurse, at-tending one of my sons in a ease of typhoid fever, during his vacation, in June, 1911. Norman R. Prickett was born in Ohatchie, Calhoun County, Ala., at a small lumber camp. His parents moved to Ashville, Ala., in 1890, when Norman was quite a small boy. He is the third of nine children. He began his education and life work in the public school of Ashville. Being a boy of high and noble aspiration, he began to prepare himself for a teacher, attending the school in PrinciPal II B Settlement School Ashville until 1908, at which time he qualified himself for a teacher, passing the state examination. In 1909 he taught in the rural schools of Alabama, and in the fall of 1910, entered school at Berry, an industrial school for boys, situated in the mountains of north Georgia. In this school he was enabled to supplement his tuition fee by doing some kind of work. Graduating from Berry in 1913, he worked in a store until 1915 to accumulate funds with which to further prosecute his studies. Then he entered Howard NORMAN R. PRICKETT NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 177 College, one of the best schools in the South, located in Birmingham, Ala. Mr. Prickett has lived a consistent Christian life foi many years, and his influence is always for good. In June, 1913 he married Miss Estella Montgomery of Birmingham, Ala., and since leaving Howard College, both Mr. Prickett and his wife have taught in the schools of Georgia. Last year they located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., and this year they are again teaching in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. MRS. JAMES A. EMERY, Ashville, Ala. ESTELLA MONTGOMERY PRICKETT Estella Montgomery Prickett, teacher of domestic science at the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, was born in the mountain section of northern Alabama in 1888, being the oldest of three children. Her father, a man with a limited education but ambitious, kept a country store, and wished to give his children the best educational advantages he could afford. When Stella was twelve years old the family moved to Birmingham where she entered the public schools, graduating from the Woodlawn high school at the age of sixteen. She then entered and graduated from the Birmingham Seminary. At nineteen she began teaching in the mountain schools of Alabama, and then taught for three years in the city schools of Birmingham. Leaving the schoolrooms, she entered the oldest dressmaking establishment in .BirESTELLA MONTGOMERY PRICKETT mingham as head designer, where Industrial Work all her training was put to use. In 1913, she was married to Norman R. Prickett, and together they entered upon a partnership in social settlement work in a mill village of northern Georgia where they spent the first two years of their married life. Two years later they returned to Birmingham so that Mr. Prickett might attend Howaid College and in the autumn 178 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI of 1916 they came to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School where Mrs. Prickett has charge of the industrial work among the girls. NORMAN R. PRICKETT. NOTE. Modesty has prevented Mr. Prickett from telling our ARROW readers that his wife is a deeply sincere, quiet but forceful, hard working, high minded, lovable woman.

        174 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI dented by the fact that immediately upon entering the university she was elected vice-president of her class. Marjorie was always a real asset to the active chapter, an enthusiastic Pi Phi, good student, a girl of broad interests which led her into many campus activities, a genial and lovable personality. After three years, she gave up her course to be with her family in Ludington, Mich. She took an active interest in newspaper work and was employed as correspondent with several newspapers. Later, her artistic temperament found expression in work which she did with a; Ludington company making wooden novelties. Many quaint and cunning figures and faces were the creatures of her brush. Marjorie has taken a great interest in our Pi Beta Phi Settlement School and during the past summer grasped the opportunity to be of service. Practical, versatile, and adaptable, she is remarkably well fitted for her work in the school and with the people of Gatlinburg. ANNE P. HUTCHINSON.

Gentle and affectionate by inheritance, she has a happy, cheerful nature which has helped to endear her to all who come in close contact with her. Emits BURTON Emily Burton has from her earliest youth brought cheer and comfort to those around her. The member of a crowded family circle holding at all times the unusual grouping of four generations, every talent has naturally been brought into play to amuse, to wait upon and serve, to comfort, and to have joyous times as well. Gay and bright and sincere, and with a depth of thought not always easy to reach, to have her friendship has always meant much to her friends both old and young. As a lover of books she has been able to fashion her own world: as a friend of children, she has found many opportunities to nurse the -sick and tired little ones, to frolic with the jolly ones, and with her infectious laugh to lift up and brighten the sad ones, and to teach all sorts and conditions of child life the gifts of Froebel, and the sterner facts in education, and above all the story of the Christ. After the private school in her home village and the larger public schools, she entered the Emma Willard School of Troy, N. Y., and graduated with honor to her class and teachers. Later she specialized in kindergarten, a subject very near to her heart, and has taught the foreign Italian on our shores and the Kentucky mountaineer with equal pleasure and profit. She has also done good work in forming and serving Camp Fire Circles. With the outbreak of this terrible war, when one's heart's strings were being pulled in every way, her hands stretched out to the suffering, as of course she wanted to help.

He occupies a very tender spot in my heart, having been in my home in the capacity of nurse, at-tending one of my sons in a ease of typhoid fever, during his vacation, in June, 1911. Norman R. Prickett was born in Ohatchie, Calhoun County, Ala., at a small lumber camp. His parents moved to Ashville, Ala., in 1890, when Norman was quite a small boy. He is the third of nine children. He began his education and life work in the public school of Ashville. Being a boy of high and noble aspiration, he began to prepare himself for a teacher, attending the school in PrinciPal II B Settlement School Ashville until 1908, at which time he qualified himself for a teacher, passing the state examination. In 1909 he taught in the rural schools of Alabama, and in the fall of 1910, entered school at Berry, an industrial school for boys, situated in the mountains of north Georgia. In this school he was enabled to supplement his tuition fee by doing some kind of work. Graduating from Berry in 1913, he worked in a store until 1915 to accumulate funds with which to further prosecute his studies. Then he entered Howard NORMAN R.

The barriers fall, the brittle fetters break, And men look up, as who first see the sky, And rise and move as though but now awake. They waited Death in fear or resignation Who now, as wrestlers trained, leap to embrace The Death in thee, and, with a wild elation, Unflinching, strive at grips with thee for place. Brother of fire and storm, and overlord Of elemental passions, drenching earth In blood and tears, surely thou art abhorred Most of all powers of demoniac birth, Yet thy fierce fires must still, destroying, purge Till gone ,the wrongs we hoard, the shame we cherish, With thrones of Kings and slavery's chains and scourge, When, with the last of these, thou, too, shalt perish! WANDA PETRUNKEVITCH, Maryland A. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 1' NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON Those who have followed the Pi Beta Phi Settlement Scho through the various stages of metamorphosis should make an effort visit the school before the metamorphosis is entirely complete. A ready, it has ceased to be "a" mountain school. Throughout section it goes by the name of "the college," and is in truth an educ tional institution which is ranked with the best schools in the sta. Those who founded the school in the face of denominational opp sition and natural hostility of the mountaineers toward "book larni: will appreciate the great strides forward that the school and the col munity have made in the past five years. Several innovations have been inaugurated this year with mark success. The first of these is a lyceum course which is held in t school every two weeks, and which the people attend en masse. T first, given by Mr. Prickett, was a radiopticon lecture on the ci of Birmingham. Another was a musical given by Miss Evel: Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. T attend these, people came from a distance of eight miles, and we very nearly enthusiastic iii their praises. (Their most superlati expressions are "all right" and "reckon it wasn't so bad" I) Our ki: of music is literally a revelation to the mountaineers. All of thi music is in the old English ballad form and admits of no develo ment. Recently, steps have been taken to form an orchestra to composed of school students, two of the parents, and the teache and this step we are encouraging. On the last Friday of each month there is another educatior entertainment, differing from the first in that it is given by the st dents of the various rooms. This, we hope, is the nucleus for Parent-Teachers' Club, but realize that its growth will be slow. is such a radical departure from anything attempted hereabouts. If one were to ask the girls what they liked best in the school tl year, they would promptly reply "music and cooking," with cooki leading popular favor. All of us, for that matter, are proud of c new kitchen. While its equipment is not complete by any means, is a decided improvement over the old method of taking the girls the teachers' cottage for lessons. The partition which divides t 20 x 30 room into departments for sewing and cooking was built the manual training boys and the same boys are making the necessz wooden utensils. 172 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI It is a theory founded upon fact that many diseases peculiar to the mountain people can be traced directly to the unsanitary condition and their unbalanced rations. Generally speaking, in every home the customary meal of beans, corn bread, and apple sauce is repeated morning, noon, and night, with slight variation. It is, indeed, a satisfaction to see how eagerly the children leani the different new food combinations. The same responsive spirit characterizes the sewing classes, al-though now and then the ideas of the older generations are given up with a struggle. Recently, Mrs. Prickett asked the girls to bring material for pillow slips. One girl refused, and when pressed for a reason, replied, "because we have two pair already." An interesting departure from the regular school curriculum is the class for so-called delinquents. In this class come the older boys and girls who. barely know how to read or write and who have not entered school before because they were ashamed to start with the little tots where they belonged. They are in assembly with the advanced grades, and the sight of their solemn, scared faces in contrast with the eager, laughing faces of our regular pupils is truly touching. In this and other ways we feel that we are reaching all children of school age wtihin a radius of five miles. To get children from distances greater than this is practically impossible because of the handicap of bad roads. Unless we can evolve some system whereby we can supply Pi Phi teachers to the outlying district schools, using the present school as a center, the school has just about reached its maxi-mum enrollment. In the meantime, our efforts are directed along the line of intensive rather than extensive education. It seems as if the psychological problems that we are called upon to meet were never greater than they are at present. The pupils, even those who have attended the school since its inception, are still in the formative stage and are still drawn into the struggle between the ideas of the old and the new generation. Recently we visited at the cabin of one of our children, one of the wellAnown families of the Burg. The mother greeted us in a cluttered room, sans shoes and vigorously chewing a snuff stick. Presently, their oldest daughter, who is finishing (through the kindness of a Pi Phi) the education started in our school, at Maryville College, appeared upon the scene. We held our breath at the tableau and wondered how to relieve the NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 173 embarrassing situation. We need not have worried for never was a situation handled more tactfully. There was no apology nor sign of embarrassment, and the deference the daughter showed her mother was truly an object lesson to us. Another similar incident illustrating the strides that the younger generation are making with the aid of an education occurred at the John Parton cabin. The day we arrived, the wife and mother was drowsily rocking to and fro smoking a corncob pipe (which disappeared as if by magic when we entered) . Beside her sat Veatress, a child of nine, student in the upper fourth grade. She was working buttonholes on a dress which she had actually made from start to finish by herself. While we chatted, she continued to sew busily, stopping only long enough to apologize because she had not found time to scrub the house that day. By the next ARROW, we hope to report work in the Red Cross classes. The people here, contrary to popular belief, are intensely patriotic and the you"nger ones seized upon the idea of sewing for the soldiers with avidity. We are waiting only for the arrival of supplies which will come from our nearest Red Cross chapter, Sevierville, before organizing an auxiliary at "Little Pigeon." MARJORIE JACKSON.

Ruth has had her heretofore unruffled life sorely taxed many times by the knotty mountain problems of our work at Gatlinburg, but each time has not been found lacking in determination, ability, good RUTH C.

Gentle and affectionate by inheritance, she has a happy, cheerful nature which has helped to endear her to all who come in close contact with her. Emits BURTON Emily Burton has from her earliest youth brought cheer and comfort to those around her. The member of a crowded family circle holding at all times the unusual grouping of four generations, every talent has naturally been brought into play to amuse, to wait upon and serve, to comfort, and to have joyous times as well. Gay and bright and sincere, and with a depth of thought not always easy to reach, to have her friendship has always meant much to her friends both old and young. As a lover of books she has been able to fashion her own world: as a friend of children, she has found many opportunities to nurse the -sick and tired little ones, to frolic with the jolly ones, and with her infectious laugh to lift up and brighten the sad ones, and to teach all sorts and conditions of child life the gifts of Froebel, and the sterner facts in education, and above all the story of the Christ. After the private school in her home village and the larger public schools, she entered the Emma Willard School of Troy, N. Y., and graduated with honor to her class and teachers. Later she specialized in kindergarten, a subject very near to her heart, and has taught the foreign Italian on our shores and the Kentucky mountaineer with equal pleasure and profit. She has also done good work in forming and serving Camp Fire Circles. With the outbreak of this terrible war, when one's heart's strings were being pulled in every way, her hands stretched out to the suffering, as of course she wanted to help.

To get a view of what she thinks of her opportunities in the mountains makes the loneliness of her northern friends easier to bear, believing that she sees all the good there is to see and will help with all her might. Such is a glimpse into the life of one of the teachers at the Pi Beta Phi School and is just a little bit of the way a northern friend esteems Emily Burton. NORMAN R. PRICKETT In writing this short sketch of the life of Norman R. Prickett, I am afraid I shall fail to do him justice, as I consider him one of the finest characters I have known. He occupies a very tender spot in my heart, having been in my home in the capacity of nurse, at-tending one of my sons in a ease of typhoid fever, during his vacation, in June, 1911. Norman R. Prickett was born in Ohatchie, Calhoun County, Ala., at a small lumber camp. His parents moved to Ashville, Ala., in 1890, when Norman was quite a small boy. He is the third of nine children. He began his education and life work in the public school of Ashville. Being a boy of high and noble aspiration, he began to prepare himself for a teacher, attending the school in PrinciPal II B Settlement School Ashville until 1908, at which time he qualified himself for a teacher, passing the state examination. In 1909 he taught in the rural schools of Alabama, and in the fall of 1910, entered school at Berry, an industrial school for boys, situated in the mountains of north Georgia. In this school he was enabled to supplement his tuition fee by doing some kind of work. Graduating from Berry in 1913, he worked in a store until 1915 to accumulate funds with which to further prosecute his studies. Then he entered Howard NORMAN R. PRICKETT NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 177 College, one of the best schools in the South, located in Birmingham, Ala. Mr. Prickett has lived a consistent Christian life foi many years, and his influence is always for good. In June, 1913 he married Miss Estella Montgomery of Birmingham, Ala., and since leaving Howard College, both Mr. Prickett and his wife have taught in the schools of Georgia. Last year they located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., and this year they are again teaching in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. MRS. JAMES A. EMERY, Ashville, Ala. ESTELLA MONTGOMERY PRICKETT Estella Montgomery Prickett, teacher of domestic science at the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, was born in the mountain section of northern Alabama in 1888, being the oldest of three children. Her father, a man with a limited education but ambitious, kept a country store, and wished to give his children the best educational advantages he could afford. When Stella was twelve years old the family moved to Birmingham where she entered the public schools, graduating from the Woodlawn high school at the age of sixteen. She then entered and graduated from the Birmingham Seminary. At nineteen she began teaching in the mountain schools of Alabama, and then taught for three years in the city schools of Birmingham. Leaving the schoolrooms, she entered the oldest dressmaking establishment in .BirESTELLA MONTGOMERY PRICKETT mingham as head designer, where Industrial Work all her training was put to use. In 1913, she was married to Norman R. Prickett, and together they entered upon a partnership in social settlement work in a mill village of northern Georgia where they spent the first two years of their married life. Two years later they returned to Birmingham so that Mr. Prickett might attend Howaid College and in the autumn 178 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI of 1916 they came to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School where Mrs. Prickett has charge of the industrial work among the girls.

Pi Phi is fortunate in securing her services in this work. E. A. H. A CHRISTMAS MESSAGE FROM THE FRONT BY A SOLDIER IN FRANCE * (From the London Daily News of December 2, 1916) "Please don't let them kill all Christmas joy in the columns of The Daily News. Surely that is an unnecessary penance, and of all people you who live as it were in the spirit of Dickens should least try to rob the folks at home of such happiness as may be found simply by the Yule log on the home fire. I don't expect it can be a Merry Christmas, but surely it can be a Happy one. Oh, I know too well the thousands of vacant chairs that will never be filled again, but I know, too, that these missing ones were happy in their sacrifice, they `went West' with no repining. I know it all seems inexplicable, but only those who have seen a gallant regiment go forward to battle can realize the bright eyes and the laughing lips with which fate is met.. Let those who are left behind emulate that courage, and be happy that their sons and husbands and lovers chose the path that led to Glory. It will be no desecration to such memories for Christmas to bring happier hours to those who mourn. The guns are booming away just over the ridge. I hear the rattle of the machine guns, too; let the fact of their silence in the home-land make for happiness and confidence in the future. But here I can assure you that Christmas will be Merry as well as Happy and I will paint you a little picture which, on Christmas Day, will be duplicated in scores of thousands. The `bivvy' is but a wagon cover, much the worse for wear, we have patched it until it is almost weatherproof. I have a paper * See Editorial page.

I have a bunch of paper. flowers that will glow redly in the .candle glare, and I think a sprig of holly will not be wanting. And.,, I hope, as you say, a Daily News plum pudding will come to grace our feast. The place of honor awaits it! I dare say we shall have some crackers though after the near-by explosion of a fifteen-inch shell, their fusillade will not be quite so impressive as in the old days of Peace on Earth. And the boys from the huts in the field will pay us visits and we'll drink to you all in'*`old Blighty' with quip and jest and laughter. It isn't a Christmas card picture that you see. I've. seen two others go since I put aside my pen and donned my soldier's coat, so I know the truth of what I write. And if we can bear our lot so lightly, can't the dear folks at home. take a page out of our book and be happy too. The road we must travel may be long; it is sure to be rough. All the more reason why the flowers that may be gathered by the way should not be wasted." THE GIRL SCOUT MOVEMENT We, bearers of the Arrow, who carry in our hearts the ideals of Pi Beta Phi, know that the first ideal of that true womanhood, for which our Fraternity stands, is the ideal of service. I should like to suggest one form ,of service which will, I feel sure, appeal to all Pi Phis. The Girl ScOut movement is but five years old in this country, but has already proved its worth. The difficult age for every girl is the adolescent period those years between ten and fifteen or six-teen when her ideas are in the formative state ; her character is at the "white-hot stage of enthusiasm," when she will be molded by the ideas' and the people with whom she comes in contact. The, Girl Scout promise: "Upon my honor I will try (1) To do my duty to God and my country (2) To .help other. people at all times (3) To obey the Scout Law," . The, Girl Scout motto: "Be Prepared," and the Girl Scout laws of truth, loyalty, helpfulness, friendliness, courtesy, purity, kindness, ,obedience, cheerfulness, and thrift all these make a tremendous im *Tommy Atkins has adopted "Blighty," a word meaning overseas as a synonym for home.
