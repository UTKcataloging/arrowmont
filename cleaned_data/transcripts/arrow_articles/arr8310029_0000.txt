        Alumnae Workshop Reports Program Workshop The Program Workshop consisted of two parts, the four required programs and all other programs. Many clubs with nearby chapters entertained the new pledges and the seniors. Cookies and snacks were also provided at examination time. For the Settlement School program slides proved popular. A showing, combined with a sale also proved successful. One club had a clever skit, a take-off of the Beverly Hillbillies, using Settlement School history and characters. A Centennial Fund program also fills the program requirement. Interesting history program had been take-offs on other television game shows, such as Password, What's My Name (instead of What's My Line) and You Don't Say. The Founders, Constitution, Settlement School and other history had been used as material. Such programs require some ingenuity but are very well received. Active and pledge examinations given to an alumnae club have been fun and educational. This was done in many forms with panels, teams or a spell-down quiz. Talks by Golden Arrows about their school days provided interesting historical information. Stories concerning the chartering of an alumnae club also made good programs. Founder's Day as generally celebrated with nearby chapters and other clubs with a salute to Golden Arrows and a tribute to Founders. Many other and varied programs were discussed. Speakers on such topics as hobbies, occupations, wills and trusts, health and decorations have been popular. Tasting luncheons where each member brought a favorite dish with recipes for sale provided good food and money for the treasury. One club had a gift exchange program where each member brought a gift suggestion or a book and then explained why it would be a good gift. Exchange meetings with other sororities reporting on their philanthropies have proved informative and worthwhile. There were almost as many different programs as there were clubs represented, but the general feeling was, that the better the program, the better the attendance and interest. Philanthropies Workshop The 1966 Convention slogan, "Keep Pi Beta Phi Spinning On Top, We Can Do It, LET'S," was the theme of the Workshop on Philanthropies of Pi Beta Phi. This was the workshop where questions and answers were given on the Settlement School, Centennial Fund, Holt House, and the Emma Harper Turner Fund. Plans for the transition of the Settlement School as we have known it, into an Arts and Crafts Center were discussed. Questions about the location, financing, curriculum, buildings, and teachers were given close scrutiny by the delegates. The discussion resulted in the majority being convinced that the Arts and Crafts Center is a feasible plan to help others help themselves through education. Like the oaks of the forest the Center must have time to take shape and grow strong. Magazine Sales and Arrowcraft Beta Province Alumnae President, Nancy Pollock, explained in this alumnae workshop that magazine sales are a very easy, painless way to raise money for Settlement School. The publishers will meet any special offers that magazines come out with, with the exception of the Clearing House Specials. She suggested that each magazine chairman should mail all subscriptions within 24 hours after receiving them rather than to obtain additional subscriptions. Central Office has guaranteed to send in all orders within 24 hours after receiving them. With these improvements, magazines should be received much more promptly than in the past. Each chairman should have a card file and phone individuals to re-mind them when their subscriptions are due to expire. It was suggested that if you have a friend who owns a beauty salon, you could ask her to order magazines for her shop from you. Also, ask your family Doctor to subscribe through you. The publishers have announced that all orders coming to them must be zip-coded. Mu Province Alumnae President, Shirley Phillips, told us that the Settlement School Chairman must be completely sold on both Arrowcraft and Settlement School, with a feeling of pride in quality products and worthwhile purpose. The better in-formed she is about the products and the back-ground, the better salesperson she will become. The method of exhibiting Arrowcraft articles is very important. A Tea-Sale in a private home or community building is probably the most familiar method. Having a sale two or three days allows for conflicting schedules. An inexpensive luncheon can be provided by club members as a further lure to shoppers. A springtime wedding theme can be a refreshing shift in time and emphasis from the pre-Christmas sale in the fall. A department store fashion show, benefit dessert-bridge party, Christmas bazaar, and a booth in a charity fair are other suggested ideas for a sale. 28 News from Little Pigeon Edited by Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin A At Settlement School 4. 4. ...Our roots are deep in craft programs. ...On the foundation of Arrowcraft, which began in 1925, we have built toward a bright future in art and crafts. ...The new Craft Center is part of that future and opens the door to n'ew accomplishment that will be a source of pride to all Pi Phis.

The Craft Workshop program offers many avenues of creative expression that lead to designs of beauty. 29 A Tour of the Settlement School by Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin Alpha A warm welcome from Orlie Watson was the way the Settlement School Tour began. Orlie attended classes at the School as a boy. The 1966 Pi Beta Phi Convention in Gatlinburg was a real opportunity to see the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School and Craft Workshop in action. It brought to mind so many early memories of the Settlement School, the chapter chairman giving the early history of it during pledge training, the Settlement School skits, the Settlement School Teas and Arrow-craft Sales. Gatlinburg is no longer a small village, but a busy tourist town at the Gateway to the Great Smoky National Park. The year-round population is, however, still small. The Settlement School property is in the center of Gatlinburg, with the Arrowcraft Shop and the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Office on the busy Parkway that leads to the Smokies. Sunday afternoon, June 19, the Settlement School Committee welcomed over four hundred Pi Phis who toured the buildings and the grounds. A reception was held in the Lounge of the Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House honoring the members of Grand Council and tea was served in the dining room. Staff House, a two story shingle building with dormer windows, provides housing and dining facilities for resident staff and also for workshops. The large Marie Davidson lounge is used for meetings and social functions throughout the year. At meal time during Craft Workshop the students crowd the spacious dining room. Down the path from the Staff House is the Log Cabin, a small museum which has many interesting historical items. This cabin is a relic of pre-Civil War Days; nine members of the Ogle family lived in it. just adjacent is the Red Barn, originally built in 1923 as a model barn for the School farm. That same year a motion picture machine was given the school and there in the hayloft the first movies in the Smoky Mountains were shown. It was also in the hayloft that the first basketball games were played. As the Craft Workshop grew there was great need for better living quarters for the Workshop students. Teachers', Pollard and Stuart Cottages all housed students and staff and because of the crowded conditions the Pi Beta Phi Grade School was temporarily converted into a dormitory. Since the red barn was no longer being used for its original purpose, it was decided to adapt it for a much Delegates examine linens in the Arrowcraft Shop. 30 needed dormitory. Several generous legacies made it possible and in June 1959 the Red Barn was dedicated. The comfortable lounges, the attractive bed-rooms and the "Little Pigeon Loft" dormitory on the third floor are used by special educational, religious or philanthropic groups when workshops are not in session. Many Pi Phi chapters have come to the Red Barn for Retreats. The Craft Workshop in the Smokies, co-sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee, offers courses at the Settlement School for graduate and undergraduate credit, or audit. Since the first workshop in 1945, there have been students from almost every state and many foreign countries. Classes are held in the Rock Building, the Emma Harper Turner Building and the Craft Center. The Rock Building is the old Pi Beta Phi High School built in 1928. At present it is leased to the County for an Elementary School and during the summer is converted into Craft Workshop class-rooms. In the Textile Design Studio designs are created for fabrics and executed in the numerous techniques of silk screen. There are most interesting and imaginative examples of stitchery and mosaic in Recreational Crafts. Design students experiment with the elements and principles of design as applied to craft objects. In the Enameling Studio a variety of techniques are objects for the home and for personal adornment. jewelry is taught in the Emma Harper Turner Building, which was the first schoolroom built by Pi Beta Phi in its Settlement School Program. Here students create jewelry using different techniques, metals and semi-precious stones. The Craft Center consists of the Weaving Studio, the Lounge and the Ceramic Wing. The Weaving Studio and the Lounge were completed in 1962. The Lounge was dedicated in memory of the first Head Resident, Evelyn Bishop. The Weaving Stu Instructor W. Stephen Wing, readies a pot for firing. A warm invitation to visit the Arrow Craft Shop. dio with its numerous looms provides facilities fc different types of weaving classes. In June 1966, the Ceramic Wing was dedicate to Lolita Snell Prouty, the 1966 Convention goes who was a member of the Settlement School Con mittee from 1941 to 1946 and devoted in her se vice to Pi Phi. This Wing includes the Ceramic St dio and a combination Lecture and Exhibit Roon which adds to the usefulness of the Craft Cente The spacious and attractive Studio houses all the u to date facilities and is ideal for creative work. C special interest is the Kiln Room, a separate bull ing at the back of the Studio. Here are the large g kiln and several small electric kilns. It is considers the very best Ceramic Studio in the country today. Crafts created by instructors and assistants are e: hibited during the Workshop and are examples ( fine design and excellent workmanship. The guic ance of these outstanding authorities in their respe tive fields has given the Craft Workshop the exce lent reputation it enjoys. The Pi Beta Phi Office, which serves as headqua ters for the Settlement School Staff, is a short wa: along Pi Phi Lane from the Craft Center. Th office occupies the former Jennie Nicol Health Cei ter, which Pi Phi operated for so many years. No Gatlinburg has a modern hospital to take care 1 the health problems of the community. Next to the Pi Beta Phi Office on the Parkway the Arrowcraft Shop. This attractive shop has cold ful displays of the great variety of items special woven for us under the Arrowcraft label, the tab mats, napkins, stoles, handbags, aprons, etc. T] response during Convention was most gratifyin both in enthusiasm and sales. Pi Phis should be very proud of what the Sett] ment School has stood for and what it has achieve It is through the unselfish support of clubs, chapti and individuals that this has been made possible. Jewelry Class Proves Successful Therapy by Helen F. Potter It is a long trek from Lexington, Massachusetts, to the mountains of Tennessee, but every June finds me with clothes and equipment packed, anxious to be on my way, for at the Craft Workshop in Gatlinburg I find the inspiration, the lift of mind and spirit that help to carry me through a happy and profitable year. Here age and other factors that usually separate people matter very little. The students range from sixteen to well over seventy. They come from all parts of our own country and often from other countries. They are brought together by a common interest in crafts and differences of age are forgot-ten. Here, under competent instruction, the student quickly acquires a respect for work of high quality. Excellent exhibits and the work and enthusiasm of other students stimulate and challenge the mind and soon everyone is involved in designing and creating things of beauty. Having retired from active business, I can now devote my time to things that were once leisure-time activities. At the Workshop, I find constructive work for my mind to plan and my hands to create. Not busy-work to keep me out of mischief, but creative work of high quality that relates me to all who use their God-given creative abilities. And also for those with either physical or mental disabilities, what better therapy could there be than to design Miss Helen Potter at work in Jewelry Studio. good craft objects and manipulate materials to carry out those designs ? Each year I greet old friends at the Workshop, and make new ones. The many friendships made there, as well as the knowledge and working ability I have gained, have enriched my life and broadened my horizons immeasurably. My growing appreciation of all forms of beauty, in nature as well as in art, have added a new dimension to life. The Great Smoky Mountains that surround Gatlinburg are full of such loveliness and grandeur that they themselves are an inspiration and I spend happy hours learning to know them better. And so each June I turn again toward the Craft Workshop in the mountains of Tennessee, thinking to myself, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills " to beauty, inspiration and strength. Member Support Is Vital to Continue This Program The Settlement School program today must have the continued support of Clubs and Chapters be-cause it is the foundation upon which the Centennial Fund Project will be established. The Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, is one of the very best in the country and was extremely successful this year with the largest attendance since it was started in 1945. Stu-dents were attracted to Craft Workshop because of the outstanding instructors who were well known, nationally. Continued financial support is needed: to keep the grounds and buildings in proper condition; to pay salaries, insurance and administrative costs; to provide assistant scholarships; to provide outstanding faculty and equipment to make it the best Craft Workshop. Please send your contributions to Central Office. Individual gifts are tax deductible. Settlement School Committee wishes to extend its appreciation to all individual Pi Phis, clubs and chapters for the generous support given through contributions and gifts, during the year 1965-66.

Set of new slides "The Pi Beta Phi Art and Craft 'Center in the Smokies at Settlement School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee." 32 An Inspiring Experience by Barbara Wehr, Minnesota Alpha When I filled the vacant position of Settlement School Chairman for Minnesota Alpha in 1965, I knew relatively little about the Craft Workshop, Gatlinburg or the Settlement School. I re-read my pledge lessons and tried to find people who had been there to learn first hand what the school offered. My mother had taken the side trip to Gatlinburg during the Asheville Convention in 1937. "It's a tiny town which you reach by a winding dirt road through the Smokies," she told me. It was then I decided that someone from our chapter should go to the Craft Workshop and see what Pi Phi is doing in Gatlinburg. As a Recreation Leadership major, I was interested in the Craft program offered by Pi Phi and the University of Tennessee, so I applied for one of the seven graduate assistantships. I plan to use my degree in working with blind people in Recreation and Crafts. In May I learned of my acceptance as an assistant and in June found myself aboard a bus speeding down the four lane super highway which now leads to Gatlinburg. I couldn't believe it! Not like my pledge lesson at all. One main street, yes, twelve blocks long and dotted with candy stores, restaurants, basket shops and motels which serve over 5,000,000 tourists who pass through Gatlinburg annually to reach the Smokies. The school itself is set back off the main street with a lovely mountain behind and a creek running beside it. The class which I took was beginning Mary Gregg Brodie, South Carolina Alpha and Barbara Wehr, Minnesota Alpha. weaving. It was really fun and I have new respect for our Arrowcraft weavers (just winding a warp can take months!) The equipment in the weaving, pottery, jewelry, enameling and textile design studios is the best you can find. The instructors come from outstanding backgrounds and schools to teach at the Craft Workshop. The Workshop is like any summer school, it includes studying, hard work and rewarding experiences with new friends. You as Pi Phis should take advantage of the opportunities offered here. It was astounding to me that only two of seven assistants and four of 133 students were Pi Phis. The people of Gatlinburg are some of our most avid fans. If they see your arrow they will stop you on the street to praise Pi Beta Phi and tell you what we have done for them. They thank you for starting the school so long ago, for helping them learn a trade, for encouraging them to develop good working habits. Silver Lining to a Dark Cloud by Mary Gregg Brodie South Carolina Alpha I first heard of Craft Workshop in 1963 when I was a Pi Phi pledge at the University of South Carolina. My sorority sisters, knowing of my interest in art, urged me to apply for the Virginia Alpha Scholarship. I applied and was very surprised and excited when news came that I had been awarded the scholarship. It was a wonderful summer and I felt that I had learned so much at the Craft Work-shop. In the spring of 1965 I was married. My husband, being an army pilot, was promptly sent to Vietnam. When I received a brochure from Craft Workshop this spring, I decided to apply for an assistantship. I wanted to have something enjoyable to do to pass the time before my husband came home. Also, I plan some day to get my degree in art education, so the course I would take at the Workshop would help me a great deal. This summer has proved to be more rewarding than the last one spent at Craft Workshop. I al-ready knew some of the students and staff members and met interesting Pi Phis from different parts of the country. It was also nice to be able to attend the Pi Phi Convention banquet and meet the Settlement School Committee and some of the National Officers of Pi Phi. Gatlinburg is a perfect place for Craft Work-shop. It was inspiring to be surrounded by beautiful natural scenery. We visited native craftsmen up in the mountains and were able to watch them work in their homes. 33

I re-read my pledge lessons and tried to find people who had been there to learn first hand what the school offered. My mother had taken the side trip to Gatlinburg during the Asheville Convention in 1937. "It's a tiny town which you reach by a winding dirt road through the Smokies," she told me. It was then I decided that someone from our chapter should go to the Craft Workshop and see what Pi Phi is doing in Gatlinburg. As a Recreation Leadership major, I was interested in the Craft program offered by Pi Phi and the University of Tennessee, so I applied for one of the seven graduate assistantships. I plan to use my degree in working with blind people in Recreation and Crafts. In May I learned of my acceptance as an assistant and in June found myself aboard a bus speeding down the four lane super highway which now leads to Gatlinburg. I couldn't believe it! Not like my pledge lesson at all. One main street, yes, twelve blocks long and dotted with candy stores, restaurants, basket shops and motels which serve over 5,000,000 tourists who pass through Gatlinburg annually to reach the Smokies. The school itself is set back off the main street with a lovely mountain behind and a creek running beside it. The class which I took was beginning Mary Gregg Brodie, South Carolina Alpha and Barbara Wehr, Minnesota Alpha. weaving. It was really fun and I have new respect for our Arrowcraft weavers (just winding a warp can take months!) The equipment in the weaving, pottery, jewelry, enameling and textile design studios is the best you can find. The instructors come from outstanding backgrounds and schools to teach at the Craft Workshop. The Workshop is like any summer school, it includes studying, hard work and rewarding experiences with new friends. You as Pi Phis should take advantage of the opportunities offered here. It was astounding to me that only two of seven assistants and four of 133 students were Pi Phis. The people of Gatlinburg are some of our most avid fans. If they see your arrow they will stop you on the street to praise Pi Beta Phi and tell you what we have done for them. They thank you for starting the school so long ago, for helping them learn a trade, for encouraging them to develop good working habits. Silver Lining to a Dark Cloud by Mary Gregg Brodie South Carolina Alpha I first heard of Craft Workshop in 1963 when I was a Pi Phi pledge at the University of South Carolina. My sorority sisters, knowing of my interest in art, urged me to apply for the Virginia Alpha Scholarship. I applied and was very surprised and excited when news came that I had been awarded the scholarship. It was a wonderful summer and I felt that I had learned so much at the Craft Work-shop. In the spring of 1965 I was married. My husband, being an army pilot, was promptly sent to Vietnam. When I received a brochure from Craft Workshop this spring, I decided to apply for an assistantship. I wanted to have something enjoyable to do to pass the time before my husband came home. Also, I plan some day to get my degree in art education, so the course I would take at the Workshop would help me a great deal. This summer has proved to be more rewarding than the last one spent at Craft Workshop. I al-ready knew some of the students and staff members and met interesting Pi Phis from different parts of the country. It was also nice to be able to attend the Pi Phi Convention banquet and meet the Settlement School Committee and some of the National Officers of Pi Phi. Gatlinburg is a perfect place for Craft Work-shop. It was inspiring to be surrounded by beautiful natural scenery. We visited native craftsmen up in the mountains and were able to watch them work in their homes. 33 Alumnae Workshop Reports Program Workshop The Program Workshop consisted of two parts, the four required programs and all other programs. Many clubs with nearby chapters entertained the new pledges and the seniors. Cookies and snacks were also provided at examination time. For the Settlement School program slides proved popular. A showing, combined with a sale also proved successful. One club had a clever skit, a take-off of the Beverly Hillbillies, using Settlement School history and characters. A Centennial Fund program also fills the program requirement. Interesting history program had been take-offs on other television game shows, such as Password, What's My Name (instead of What's My Line) and You Don't Say. The Founders, Constitution, Settlement School and other history had been used as material. Such programs require some ingenuity but are very well received. Active and pledge examinations given to an alumnae club have been fun and educational. This was done in many forms with panels, teams or a spell-down quiz. Talks by Golden Arrows about their school days provided interesting historical information. Stories concerning the chartering of an alumnae club also made good programs. Founder's Day as generally celebrated with nearby chapters and other clubs with a salute to Golden Arrows and a tribute to Founders. Many other and varied programs were discussed. Speakers on such topics as hobbies, occupations, wills and trusts, health and decorations have been popular. Tasting luncheons where each member brought a favorite dish with recipes for sale provided good food and money for the treasury. One club had a gift exchange program where each member brought a gift suggestion or a book and then explained why it would be a good gift. Exchange meetings with other sororities reporting on their philanthropies have proved informative and worthwhile. There were almost as many different programs as there were clubs represented, but the general feeling was, that the better the program, the better the attendance and interest. Philanthropies Workshop The 1966 Convention slogan, "Keep Pi Beta Phi Spinning On Top, We Can Do It, LET'S," was the theme of the Workshop on Philanthropies of Pi Beta Phi. This was the workshop where questions and answers were given on the Settlement School, Centennial Fund, Holt House, and the Emma Harper Turner Fund. Plans for the transition of the Settlement School as we have known it, into an Arts and Crafts Center were discussed. Questions about the location, financing, curriculum, buildings, and teachers were given close scrutiny by the delegates. The discussion resulted in the majority being convinced that the Arts and Crafts Center is a feasible plan to help others help themselves through education. Like the oaks of the forest the Center must have time to take shape and grow strong. Magazine Sales and Arrowcraft Beta Province Alumnae President, Nancy Pollock, explained in this alumnae workshop that magazine sales are a very easy, painless way to raise money for Settlement School. The publishers will meet any special offers that magazines come out with, with the exception of the Clearing House Specials. She suggested that each magazine chairman should mail all subscriptions within 24 hours after receiving them rather than to obtain additional subscriptions. Central Office has guaranteed to send in all orders within 24 hours after receiving them. With these improvements, magazines should be received much more promptly than in the past. Each chairman should have a card file and phone individuals to re-mind them when their subscriptions are due to expire. It was suggested that if you have a friend who owns a beauty salon, you could ask her to order magazines for her shop from you. Also, ask your family Doctor to subscribe through you. The publishers have announced that all orders coming to them must be zip-coded. Mu Province Alumnae President, Shirley Phillips, told us that the Settlement School Chairman must be completely sold on both Arrowcraft and Settlement School, with a feeling of pride in quality products and worthwhile purpose. The better in-formed she is about the products and the back-ground, the better salesperson she will become. The method of exhibiting Arrowcraft articles is very important. A Tea-Sale in a private home or community building is probably the most familiar method. Having a sale two or three days allows for conflicting schedules. An inexpensive luncheon can be provided by club members as a further lure to shoppers. A springtime wedding theme can be a refreshing shift in time and emphasis from the pre-Christmas sale in the fall. A department store fashion show, benefit dessert-bridge party, Christmas bazaar, and a booth in a charity fair are other suggested ideas for a sale. 28 News from Little Pigeon Edited by Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin A At Settlement School 4. 4. ...Our roots are deep in craft programs. ...On the foundation of Arrowcraft, which began in 1925, we have built toward a bright future in art and crafts. ...The new Craft Center is part of that future and opens the door to n'ew accomplishment that will be a source of pride to all Pi Phis.

The Craft Workshop program offers many avenues of creative expression that lead to designs of beauty. 29 A Tour of the Settlement School by Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin Alpha A warm welcome from Orlie Watson was the way the Settlement School Tour began. Orlie attended classes at the School as a boy. The 1966 Pi Beta Phi Convention in Gatlinburg was a real opportunity to see the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School and Craft Workshop in action. It brought to mind so many early memories of the Settlement School, the chapter chairman giving the early history of it during pledge training, the Settlement School skits, the Settlement School Teas and Arrow-craft Sales. Gatlinburg is no longer a small village, but a busy tourist town at the Gateway to the Great Smoky National Park. The year-round population is, however, still small. The Settlement School property is in the center of Gatlinburg, with the Arrowcraft Shop and the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Office on the busy Parkway that leads to the Smokies. Sunday afternoon, June 19, the Settlement School Committee welcomed over four hundred Pi Phis who toured the buildings and the grounds. A reception was held in the Lounge of the Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House honoring the members of Grand Council and tea was served in the dining room. Staff House, a two story shingle building with dormer windows, provides housing and dining facilities for resident staff and also for workshops. The large Marie Davidson lounge is used for meetings and social functions throughout the year. At meal time during Craft Workshop the students crowd the spacious dining room. Down the path from the Staff House is the Log Cabin, a small museum which has many interesting historical items. This cabin is a relic of pre-Civil War Days; nine members of the Ogle family lived in it. just adjacent is the Red Barn, originally built in 1923 as a model barn for the School farm. That same year a motion picture machine was given the school and there in the hayloft the first movies in the Smoky Mountains were shown. It was also in the hayloft that the first basketball games were played. As the Craft Workshop grew there was great need for better living quarters for the Workshop students. Teachers', Pollard and Stuart Cottages all housed students and staff and because of the crowded conditions the Pi Beta Phi Grade School was temporarily converted into a dormitory. Since the red barn was no longer being used for its original purpose, it was decided to adapt it for a much Delegates examine linens in the Arrowcraft Shop. 30 needed dormitory. Several generous legacies made it possible and in June 1959 the Red Barn was dedicated. The comfortable lounges, the attractive bed-rooms and the "Little Pigeon Loft" dormitory on the third floor are used by special educational, religious or philanthropic groups when workshops are not in session. Many Pi Phi chapters have come to the Red Barn for Retreats. The Craft Workshop in the Smokies, co-sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee, offers courses at the Settlement School for graduate and undergraduate credit, or audit. Since the first workshop in 1945, there have been students from almost every state and many foreign countries. Classes are held in the Rock Building, the Emma Harper Turner Building and the Craft Center. The Rock Building is the old Pi Beta Phi High School built in 1928. At present it is leased to the County for an Elementary School and during the summer is converted into Craft Workshop class-rooms. In the Textile Design Studio designs are created for fabrics and executed in the numerous techniques of silk screen. There are most interesting and imaginative examples of stitchery and mosaic in Recreational Crafts. Design students experiment with the elements and principles of design as applied to craft objects. In the Enameling Studio a variety of techniques are objects for the home and for personal adornment. jewelry is taught in the Emma Harper Turner Building, which was the first schoolroom built by Pi Beta Phi in its Settlement School Program. Here students create jewelry using different techniques, metals and semi-precious stones. The Craft Center consists of the Weaving Studio, the Lounge and the Ceramic Wing. The Weaving Studio and the Lounge were completed in 1962. The Lounge was dedicated in memory of the first Head Resident, Evelyn Bishop. The Weaving Stu Instructor W. Stephen Wing, readies a pot for firing. A warm invitation to visit the Arrow Craft Shop. dio with its numerous looms provides facilities fc different types of weaving classes. In June 1966, the Ceramic Wing was dedicate to Lolita Snell Prouty, the 1966 Convention goes who was a member of the Settlement School Con mittee from 1941 to 1946 and devoted in her se vice to Pi Phi. This Wing includes the Ceramic St dio and a combination Lecture and Exhibit Roon which adds to the usefulness of the Craft Cente The spacious and attractive Studio houses all the u to date facilities and is ideal for creative work. C special interest is the Kiln Room, a separate bull ing at the back of the Studio. Here are the large g kiln and several small electric kilns. It is considers the very best Ceramic Studio in the country today. Crafts created by instructors and assistants are e: hibited during the Workshop and are examples ( fine design and excellent workmanship. The guic ance of these outstanding authorities in their respe tive fields has given the Craft Workshop the exce lent reputation it enjoys. The Pi Beta Phi Office, which serves as headqua ters for the Settlement School Staff, is a short wa: along Pi Phi Lane from the Craft Center. Th office occupies the former Jennie Nicol Health Cei ter, which Pi Phi operated for so many years. No Gatlinburg has a modern hospital to take care 1 the health problems of the community. Next to the Pi Beta Phi Office on the Parkway the Arrowcraft Shop. This attractive shop has cold ful displays of the great variety of items special woven for us under the Arrowcraft label, the tab mats, napkins, stoles, handbags, aprons, etc. T] response during Convention was most gratifyin both in enthusiasm and sales. Pi Phis should be very proud of what the Sett] ment School has stood for and what it has achieve It is through the unselfish support of clubs, chapti and individuals that this has been made possible. Jewelry Class Proves Successful Therapy by Helen F. Potter It is a long trek from Lexington, Massachusetts, to the mountains of Tennessee, but every June finds me with clothes and equipment packed, anxious to be on my way, for at the Craft Workshop in Gatlinburg I find the inspiration, the lift of mind and spirit that help to carry me through a happy and profitable year. Here age and other factors that usually separate people matter very little. The students range from sixteen to well over seventy. They come from all parts of our own country and often from other countries. They are brought together by a common interest in crafts and differences of age are forgot-ten. Here, under competent instruction, the student quickly acquires a respect for work of high quality. Excellent exhibits and the work and enthusiasm of other students stimulate and challenge the mind and soon everyone is involved in designing and creating things of beauty. Having retired from active business, I can now devote my time to things that were once leisure-time activities. At the Workshop, I find constructive work for my mind to plan and my hands to create. Not busy-work to keep me out of mischief, but creative work of high quality that relates me to all who use their God-given creative abilities. And also for those with either physical or mental disabilities, what better therapy could there be than to design Miss Helen Potter at work in Jewelry Studio. good craft objects and manipulate materials to carry out those designs ? Each year I greet old friends at the Workshop, and make new ones. The many friendships made there, as well as the knowledge and working ability I have gained, have enriched my life and broadened my horizons immeasurably. My growing appreciation of all forms of beauty, in nature as well as in art, have added a new dimension to life. The Great Smoky Mountains that surround Gatlinburg are full of such loveliness and grandeur that they themselves are an inspiration and I spend happy hours learning to know them better. And so each June I turn again toward the Craft Workshop in the mountains of Tennessee, thinking to myself, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills " to beauty, inspiration and strength. Member Support Is Vital to Continue This Program The Settlement School program today must have the continued support of Clubs and Chapters be-cause it is the foundation upon which the Centennial Fund Project will be established. The Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee, is one of the very best in the country and was extremely successful this year with the largest attendance since it was started in 1945. Stu-dents were attracted to Craft Workshop because of the outstanding instructors who were well known, nationally. Continued financial support is needed: to keep the grounds and buildings in proper condition; to pay salaries, insurance and administrative costs; to provide assistant scholarships; to provide outstanding faculty and equipment to make it the best Craft Workshop. Please send your contributions to Central Office. Individual gifts are tax deductible. Settlement School Committee wishes to extend its appreciation to all individual Pi Phis, clubs and chapters for the generous support given through contributions and gifts, during the year 1965-66.
