        Life of Service Ends ON THE opening night of the Knoxville Workshop, word was received by Grand Council of the death of Anna Robinson Nickerson, Massachusetts Alpha, Grand Vice-President of Pi Beta Phi from 1918 to 1925. Mrs. Nicker-son, 88, of Malden, Mass., had been ill for a month preceding her death. Mrs. Nickerson gave many long years of service to her fraternity and her community. She was Alpha Province President from 1908-1915, and Alumnae Editor of THE ARROW from 1915-1918. It was during her tenure as Grand Vice-President that she directed the project of presenting to the White House the portrait of Grace Goodhue Coolidge, Vermont Beta, painted by Howard Chandler Christy. According to the new Pi Phi history, A Century of Friendship, "Under Mrs. Nickerson's direction, every club and chapter of Pi Beta Phi and many individuals were given an opportunity to help in the purchase of the portrait. The necessary sum and more, too, was quickly raised and the portrait presentation became one of the high-lights of the Eastern Conference in 1924." Mrs. Nickerson served as toastmistress of that historic conference. In 1922, Mrs. Nickerson compiled the first Manual for the use of Alumna Advisory Committees, which proved of inestimable value in relating the work of alumnae to that of active chapters. The first official one-inch pin was made in 1918 for Anna Robinson Nickerson. This pin, with a diamond shaft and a plain point, was presented to the fraternity by the L. G. Balfour Company. In addition to fraternity work, Mrs. Nicker-son served as chairman of education of the Massachusetts State Federation of Women's Clubs, was founder of the College Club of Malden, and an original member of the Boston University Women's Council. She served as president of the board of directors. of Willcox Hall, home for business girls, and the board of the corporation of the Panhellenic House, Boston. In addition, as a ghost writer, she was the author of six children's books and many animal stories. Funeral services for Anna Robinson Nicker-son were held August 23 at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Malden, Mass. Sara Pomeroy Rugg, Arrow editor from 1912 to 1921, was official fraternity representative at the funeral. 24 News of THE PI PHI MALL, shown above in the architect's version, is now under construction in Gatlin-burg, following ground-breaking ceremonies Saturday, July 13, 1968.

All but three members were present for the ground-breaking ceremonies. Lucille Woodworth To "Mesh Gears" As Executive Coordinator Mrs. Lucile McCutchan Woodworth has been appointed Executive Coordinator of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School combining the positions of Pi Phi's Director of Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts and Manager of the Arrowcraft Shop. After 20 years with the C. E. Hooper Re-search Company in New York City she has left her position as Vice President and a Director of the company to come to Gatlinburg. Her home was in Darien, Connecticut. Mrs. Woodworth claims Missouri Beta and Illinois Epsilon as her college chapters since she attended Washington University in St. Louis and then transferred to Northwestern University from which she graduated. She has three children: Sandra, now Mrs. Douglas Campbell, of Darien, Connecticut ; Wade, associated with johns-Manville in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Kent, a Director of the Young Life program in Rochester, New York. Her daughter was a Pi Phi at Northwestern University. Gatlinburg is not a strange place to our new Coordinator as she has been visiting the area most of her life. Her sister, Henrietta McCutchan Huff, taught in the Settlement School be-fore her marriage to James Huff of Gatlinburg. Later the other members of her family also moved here . . . two brothers, Jerry and Jack McCutchan, and her mother, Mrs. Jerome Bascom McCutchan, who ran the Arrowcraft Shop at the Mountain View Hotel for 12 years. Mrs. Woodworth's love for the Great Smoky Mountains influenced her to make :them her home but it was the Pi Beta Phi Centennial project which caused her to make the move now. Mrs. Woodworth says, "The committment of Pi Beta Phi to enlarge the craft program from Lucille McCutchart Woodworth summer workshops to a year-round school as our centennial project has the vigor and the far sightedness that was displayed back in 1912 when the Settlement School had its inception. We started helping a community and with our growth plus the support of Pi Phis everywhere, we are in a position now to help the entire country as well as other nations. How fortunate to have the University of Tennessee behind us on the academic side, to have Professor Marian Heard guiding the school programs, and to have the Arrowcraft Shop to display the hand-crafted products and ta assist the school financially. No school is self-sustaining so every Pi Phi's help is needed. My part will be to mesh the gears, When all lift, there is no load." 28 Craftsman Impressed Each Time She Returns To Arrowmont Jessie Clarke Daniels, president of Grace Richey Clarke, Inc., has attended Pi Phi's Summer Craft Workshops for four years. Her own firm in Texas makes handwoven blinds and panels for interior designers, supplying such clients as Marshall Field and Neiman Marcus, and she is recognized as an accomplished craftsman in her own right. The time she spends in Gatlinburg is one of enjoying her horizons. She has the following to say about Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. "When I arrive in Gatlinburg for the Summer Craft Workshop (now Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts), it always takes me a week or so to "get with it". Then ideas seem to spring from everywhere chance remarks, instructor's suggestions, roommates' wisecracks, trial and error it just goes on and on. I may gripe about the hills and the pale white toast but I love every minute of it! Another thing that impresses me so much each time is the professional feeling that prevails in each class the quality of the instructors and their insistence on good design and good craftsmanship. These are basic requirements for anything that is worth doing with one's hands. And then Open House comes along and I am amazed anew at the excellence of the students' work from all areas and the beauty of the entire display. It just doesn't seem possible that "we" did it! I have seen a lot of craft shows from Texas to New York to San Francisco and many places in between and I would be proud to set our Open House right beside any of them! "After four summers, or parts of summers, at the Pi Beta Phi U. T. Craft Workshop, I seem to get more excited each year. Now with Arrowmont becoming a year round program, many more will have the opportunity to have this great learning experience. There are many schools that have excellent craft programs for college students. There are many craft centers where our "senior citizens" have the opportunity to work under qualified instructors. There are even summer workshops where the inbe JESSIE CLARKE DANIELS demonstrates her skill in jewelry class during her fourth year at Summer Craft Workshop. tween group can go and relax and play in a different environment and learn on the side about various crafts, and there are possibly other places that offer as much as the Pi Phi U. T. Workshop but I do not know about them. "To me, the close association here of people of all ages and from all backgrounds all of whom are most interested in the creativity of various handcrafts, is one of the most exciting things about it. I love being with the young people who come with fresh enthusiasm and who have an experimental approach. I enjoy being with the older people with all the wide and varied backgrounds of experience. Even those who are rank amateurs in crafts want to do something better than to make toy poodles from plastic sheets or they wouldn't be here. I look at some who are in their seventies and sixties and then all those in their fifties with me and clear on down to the college kids (who get younger every year) and there really doesn't seem to be any generation gap. Every year I make new friends and happily greet the older friends I made the year before or the year be-fore that. And now I look forward to next year to the changes that I will find, and I am confident that some of Marian Heard's dream is coming true." 29

The time she spends in Gatlinburg is one of enjoying her horizons. She has the following to say about Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. "When I arrive in Gatlinburg for the Summer Craft Workshop (now Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts), it always takes me a week or so to "get with it". Then ideas seem to spring from everywhere chance remarks, instructor's suggestions, roommates' wisecracks, trial and error it just goes on and on. I may gripe about the hills and the pale white toast but I love every minute of it! Another thing that impresses me so much each time is the professional feeling that prevails in each class the quality of the instructors and their insistence on good design and good craftsmanship. These are basic requirements for anything that is worth doing with one's hands. And then Open House comes along and I am amazed anew at the excellence of the students' work from all areas and the beauty of the entire display. It just doesn't seem possible that "we" did it! I have seen a lot of craft shows from Texas to New York to San Francisco and many places in between and I would be proud to set our Open House right beside any of them! "After four summers, or parts of summers, at the Pi Beta Phi U. T. Craft Workshop, I seem to get more excited each year. Now with Arrowmont becoming a year round program, many more will have the opportunity to have this great learning experience. There are many schools that have excellent craft programs for college students. There are many craft centers where our "senior citizens" have the opportunity to work under qualified instructors. There are even summer workshops where the inbe JESSIE CLARKE DANIELS demonstrates her skill in jewelry class during her fourth year at Summer Craft Workshop. tween group can go and relax and play in a different environment and learn on the side about various crafts, and there are possibly other places that offer as much as the Pi Phi U. T. Workshop but I do not know about them. "To me, the close association here of people of all ages and from all backgrounds all of whom are most interested in the creativity of various handcrafts, is one of the most exciting things about it. I love being with the young people who come with fresh enthusiasm and who have an experimental approach. I enjoy being with the older people with all the wide and varied backgrounds of experience. Even those who are rank amateurs in crafts want to do something better than to make toy poodles from plastic sheets or they wouldn't be here. I look at some who are in their seventies and sixties and then all those in their fifties with me and clear on down to the college kids (who get younger every year) and there really doesn't seem to be any generation gap. Every year I make new friends and happily greet the older friends I made the year before or the year be-fore that. And now I look forward to next year to the changes that I will find, and I am confident that some of Marian Heard's dream is coming true." 29
