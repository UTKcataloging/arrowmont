        250 THE ARROW OF PI BETA' PHI ALUMNIE HEALTH WORK By reading the Alumnae Club Reports in the October AP:Row you will find that the alumnae clubs are doing many worthy things to co-operate with the Health Committee. Some of the clubs assist in local hospital work, two have II 4) rooms in hospitals, others have been devoting time to the study of health, and many of the clubs have invited community nurses and health workers to talk to them. BURLINGTON HOSPITAL Room The II .1. Room at the Burlington Hospital is maintained by the Burlington Alumnae club. Located on the second floor, with one large window which lets in a flood of sunlight, the room is one of the most cheerful ones in the institution. This room is not only for Pi Phis but is for anyone 'seeking medical aid. The local chapter members take a personal pride in the room. An efficient standing committee visits the hospital at intervals and sees that the II 'cD room is kept in the very best of condition. Fifteen dollars a year is donated to the hospital and in addition to that sum, the chapter. furnishes linens and innumerable supplies. We do not feel that the room is a burden to the chapter. It seems as one of the many welcome channels through which we can really be of service. BESS H. STANG. The Lancaster alumnae club spent one meeting of three hours making hospital garments and supplies for the Lancaster General Hospital. During the last hour of the meeting, Dr. Schwartz, a physician of that city spoke on "Health." Many of the clubs did work of this kind. The Galesburg Alumnae Club maintains a. Pi Phi Hospital Room also. The Drury Alumni Club made thirty-six layettes for a "Loan Chest" directed by the Greene County Health Association. One of the Pi Beta Phi patronesses furnished all of the material. The Oklahoma City Alumni Club visits the hospital once a week, taking candy to the children. As a result of their interest Mrs. Eldowney was appointed to the Hospital Board. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 251 NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON EDITED BY SARAH POMEROY RUGG, Massachusetts A Instruction in practical agriculture has always been a vital need in Gatlinburg. This fact has been recognized by everyone ever connected with our Settlement School in an official capacity and there is general rejoicing that the need has at last been met most adequately. Miss Bishop has endeavored constantly to solve this problem by finding ways and means to meet it, and thanks to her tireless efforts the II B 4 School has at last secured a teacher of voca tional agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act. The state requirements for such a teacher are given below in order that the general reader may appreciate the full scope of this new branch of our work which has now been made possible. VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE IN TENNESSEE AND WORK OF THE TEACHER OF VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE A teacher must be employed by the School for a period of twelve months. The teacher must be a graduate of a four-year course in Agriculture from a standard college or university. In addition to his M.A. degree he must have had eighteen semester hours in education, nine of which must be in agricultural education. A room must be provided and equipped with chairs, tables, shelves, cabinets, etc., for the use of the department of Vocational Agriculture. The School must appropriate for laboratory equipment $250.00 the first year, $1oo.00 per year for three years thereafter. An appropriation of $So.00 for an Agricultural Library must be made the first year and $25.00 per year for three years thereafter. This work is designed for boys over fourteen years of age who live on farms. Each boy taking agriculture must devote one-half of school day to it and in no case shall this be less than ninety minute classroom instruction. Each boy taking agriculture must carry out a project along the line of instruction given. The work must be under the direct and personal supervision of the teacher. The project must always be completed and in no case shall. the time be less than six months supervised practice and project work. The teacher of Agriculture must own and operate a means of transportation in order that he may be able to visit the boys doing project work and farmers of the community. The work of the teacher of Vocational Agriculture includes classroom instruction, supervision of projects, part-time work with boys not regularly in school, evening work with men, and community work. The classroom instruction includes the regular recitation, laboratory work, project study, reference reading, project planning, supervised study and field work. 252 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Each boy who elects the course is required to take a project along the line of instruction taken and under direct supervision of the teacher. This brings the teacher in contact with the farm home and the people of the community. Collecting and preserving laboratory materials such as insects affecting farm crops, specimens of disease attacking plants and animals, crop exhibits of all kinds, adding additional equipment to the department, making charts for use in class instruction, these and many other duties come in the program of the teacher of Vocational Agriculture. There are many boys who have dropped out of school before reaching or finishing high school. These boys are now living on farms and cannot attend school for nine months because of theit business. These boys are vitally interested in their vocation, agriculture, and would gladly take instruction if they had the opportunity. The teacher of Vocational Agriculture in Tennessee will organize unit courses for these boys during the months of December, January and February, and for two hours twice a week for three months instruction will be given in agriculture, farm arithmetic, farm accounting, farm letter writing, reference reading, bulletin and magazine work and any other thing that they need to help them in their vocation. The meetings will be held twice each week, making it possible to complete a unit course each month. The teacher of Vocational Agriculture is the community adviser and his activities are many. He should organize and promote community organization, organize community fairs and. exhibits, act as the community veterinarian in erhergency, actively engage in all work with boys, get people interested in recreation for all ages, promote the social and religious sides of community 'life, help bring father and son closer to each other, help develop a market for the produce of the community, instruct the community in the presentation and preservation of products for the market, instruct the community farmers how to combat diseases and pests attacking crops and animals, make a survey of the community to ascertain its needs, put on agricultural plays for the schools, standardize the products of the community, do junior project work with boys in the rural schools, act as a teacher-trainer to rural teachers. Even a cursory reading of these requirements for a teacher of vocational agriculture is enough to show the uninitiated that it has been no small task to find the person fitted to meet them and to work in harmony with our school staff. It is a matter of great satisfaction therefore that our pioneer worker in this field is proving so satisfactory. In her semi-annual report to the Settlement School Committee made after her summer visit to the school in August and September, Miss Kate Miller, the chairman, writes as follows: "Mr. O. j. Mattil, teacher of agriculture under the provisions of the Smith-Hughes Act is from the University of Tennessee and is a teacher of experience with two years in Smith-Hughes work. He is a splendid man to ha've on our staff, able, willing and interested. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 253 Like the nurse he is a power throughout the whole community. The old school house is used by Mr. Mattil for his work. He has made two rooms in it, one for class work and the other for shop. He is putting in racks for tools and employing the boys to do the work. There is so much of his work that is outside that I believe the small classroom will be adequate for a while." Following is Mr. Mattil's report to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee after three months' work in his new position. THE SMITH-HUGHES AGRICULTURE AT THE Pl BETA PHI SCHOOL July, August, September, 1922 In the establishing of such a work as vocational agriculture in a new field, a long time is required before we can hope to see progress or notice any great results. It's a slow process, really a gradual growth, so these first three months in particular could hardly be expected to produce any showy record yet the responses to my efforts have been very pleasing and cause me to feel that satisfactory results will be obtained in the course of time. In the horticultural class we have had occasion to make a number of trips to orchards. In connection with the study of harvesting and marketing of fruit the boys observed the thinning and picking from the trees and that these picked apples were kept separate from any that fell from the trees. They were surprised to find that to avoid the multiplication and spread of disease the bruised rottening apples, cores, etc., were removed from under the trees. They were told about and shown how apples should be graded and packed for the market, then all tried their hands at it themselves. In observing the orchard cultivation the benefits of cultivation were clearly seen, and it was also observed that by the proper cultivation and rotation of crops some of the most troublesome of weeds were being eradicated. Learning varieties of apples something like two dozen different ones were observed and of the more important ones a close study by the use of a score card was made. Such points as good bearers, good shippers, good keepers, the flavor, color, etc., were considered. On another occasion the class was shown how to select a good exhibit of apples for fairs, etc., after instruction each boy picked his 254 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI exhibit of apples. These exhibits, I then judged and criticized the selections and announced the placings. A few days later the same exercise was repeated, this time in an orchard of unsprayed fruit. The reaction obtained was fine; selecting a few minutes they declared it would be impossible for each of them to pick any kind of an exhibit; that the best from unsprayed trees were not as good as the worst of the sprayed fruit! They had learned that to get sound fruit free from disease it would be necessary to spray. (The unsprayed fruit came from the school orchard.) In the animal hubandry class, in the study of poultry we studied culling; that is the boys were taught how to distinguish the good and the poor producing hens so that those hens that did not lay enough could be disposed of. In the handling of the hens in some of the flocks that we culled, we found other conditions to remedy. In Charlie Ogle's flock of White Leghorns for instance we discovered they were not laying on account of the lice. I informed him of the fact, suggested what to do for the lice and offered to dip the chick-ens for him if he would obtain the sodium fiouride. He obtained, the chemical and the fowls were dipped before the class. This trip with a further study taught the boys how to combat lice and what a simple and inexpensive operation it was. Thus, wherever possible I endeavor to teach by a practical application on some farm in the community. During a week in September I was able to secure several sets of slides, including special slides on "Farm Poultry" and "Orchard Management." Seven community meetings were held at which these pictures were shown and a talk made on the subjects. At the Gatlinburg meeting a community fair association was organized for a fair in the eleventh district. Some of the farmers are beginning to show a response to the work for I have had personal inquiries with requests to show them how to do certain things on their farms. Signed, O. J. MATTIL. The great event of the year in the lives of the boys at Gatlinburg was their visit conducted by Mr. Mattil to the Agricultural Fair at Knoxville, in September. Read the story of this experience and you will realize in a measure what possibilities lie before us in the development of our department of vocational agriculture: NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 255 THE TRIP TO THE FAIR BY O. J. MATTEL As I am a great believer in the educational value of a Fair, I felt that it would be a fine thing if I could get my agriculture class to the East Tennessee Division Fair at Knoxville. The boys seemed eager enough but I feared that the expenses would keep most of them from going. After arrangements were made whereby expenses would be as low as possible, only $1.50 with a little spending money being necessary, I was surprised to find eighteen out of the twenty-one boys signified their intentions of going. Arrangements were all made and the boys were instructed to meet by five o'clock at Calvin Ogle's store. "What time is that?" "Is that about sunrise?" "Is that before daybreak?" and other similar questions were asked. I informed them as near as possible what time by the sun five A. M. was but I began to get visions of what difficulty I would have to get the whole crowd assembled on time. But excitement helped me out, for the anticipation of going to the fair caused these boys to arise hours too soon, many in the `wee sma' hours of the morning' and long before time to start I could hear their impatient voices. Excitement failed to reach the rather unresponsive nature of one of these mountain boys, however, who slept an hour too long and was left behind. . But seventeen who arrived before the appointed hour started walking towards Banner, three miles distant, where they were to meet the truck which was to carry us into Knoxville. Wishing to have work done on my car at Sevierville, I planned to ride that far in my car and then join the truck. Arriving at Banner I found the crowd impatiently waiting for the truck which failed to appear. Time rolled by and we decided to start towards Pigeon Forge by car, a distance of four miles, mountain road graded, but some of it not any too smooth to travel with ease. If you can picture seventeen persons weighing anywhere from seventy-five to one hundred fifty pounds on a Ford roadster you can appreciate the sight at which the people along the roadside and in the fields stopper to look with the keenest curiosity. A circus wagon come to town would hardly have attracted more attention. At Pigeon Forge w( found the truck loading with straw and it was not long before the crowd was on its way towards Knoxville. 256 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Among the more serious things heard during the ride were: "What's that big, round thing over side of that barn ?" They were told it was a silo, and its use was explained. A body of water was noticed and one of the boys asked : "What's that water' over there ?" The answer came: "A small lake or a pond." "Why, I don't see any place where it can run off." After the explanation was made as to what a lake was, another boy whose geography had evidently been making more of an impression chimed in naming Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior and Lake Ontario. "People sure do have fine large barns around here, why most of them are better than any of our houses," said one. "Why there is one of the kind of chicken houses like we have been studying about," said another. "There's another kind." These and many other re-marks were heard between the shouting and singing of the group as the truck bounced and jolted over the rough pike. As we neared Knoxville the roadbed improved, the riding became easier, and soon one of the boys exclaimed: "Now we can burn the wind for we are on the Rubber pike." So swifter we sped along over the asphalt pavements reaching our destination about nine forty-five, and then the fun commenced. To endeavor to record my experience in taking seventeen mountain boys, from one part of the grounds to another would 'fill a volume. Most of them had never seen a fair and only a very few had ever been to a city such as Knoxville. A few had never been as far out of Gatlinburg as the nearest town of Sevierville. Conducting them was no small task but still it was almost as much fun as a regular circus to hear .and to see how these mountain boys were reacting to the things they were experiencing. Some would exclaim about this or that others would ask any number of questions, very often very foolish ones still others were so overawed that they appeared to be struck dumb and with eyes atwinkle, fairly popping from their sockets and mouths agape, they gazed on the new and strange things as we made the rounds of the fair. The livestock, poultry, farm prdducts and all other exhibits ,were viewed and the places of amusements, the midway, ,the free vaudeville shows, the ice cream cone and peanut stands and the airplanes were not neglected. For the boys it was one thrill after another. "Oh, look what a big hog, I don't believe we could ever, raise that kind." Too much NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 257 of a contrast between an 1,100 pound hog and a razor back! "Gee, that's fine riding I'm going to save my money and ride that roller coaster some more." Thus it went from exhibits to amusements. An airplane appeared and every moment of its flight the boys watched with almost breathless amazement. The acrobatic stunts held them spellbound at times and so incredulous did they appear that on several occasions the question was put: "Why, that's not a man; that's not a woman, is it ?" After witnessing a gorgeous display of fireworks that night we boarded a street car and went "to take in" the city. The boys were all tired by this, time and were soon ready to turn in for the night and I wasn't sorry either for they had about worn me out several hours before. I asked the boys to wait while I went into a building near the principal corner of Knoxville. When I returned what did I see but the whole bunch lined up sitting on the curbing in front of the building, a sight unusual enough to excite the curiosity of the fair sized crowd still on the street. As I gave the accustomed signal, a whistle, the whole line were on their feet. They had to cross the street and even at this hour trolleys and automobiles continually traveled so the boys did not walk across the street, that was too tame for them they wanted to make sure they, reached the other side in a hurry so they made it on a dead run. It was a ridiculous sight to see them scramble across the main corner of the city .on a hop like scared rabbits. Many of the boys had enjoyed their first street car ride so much that they were disappointed to find that it would be unnecessary to' take a street car to our -destination for the night. The next morning most of the boys were ready to return home so at an early hour we started. What these boys gained and retained from their trip would .be hard to determine but it will be a long time before they will cease talking of what they saw. When asked to write a paper on *what they had seen at the fair they exclaimed: "Don't get us started on that for we can't ever tell, you all, nor can we ever stop telling." One result of the trip was discovered the next day of school. After chapel exercises Miss Chew advised the boys that the barbed wire fences were to keep in the .stock and if they' were walked on very much would soon be useless for that purpose and suggested that foi future acrobatic .stunts like wire walking it .would be best to stretch 258 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI a special wire. This was done and the boys for the next few weeks displayed their skill in walking on the wire. Early in the morning of the day of the Gatlinburg Fair I noticed several boys approaching with a small roll of wire and upon inquiry I learned that they contemplated giving a special performance at the fair. It was rather late to construct a suitable place to stretch a wire so the fair committee feels that it lost a very attractive feature when it missed this treat of high wire performance. To recompense this loss the committee expects to assure this attraction for the coming fair of 1923 by an option. It is hoped that this trip to the fair has left other impressions of greater lasting value. The boys are already talking of going back again next year so the trip to the East Tennessee Division Fair seems to be an assured annual event. * * * * * * * * The community fair association which was organized in Gatlin--burg in September achieved a marked success in its efforts to put on a fair in the eleventh district. The event was very popular and the crowd which attended far outnumbered any gathering which had previously been held in the neighborhood. The following extracts are taken from the report written for the Sevierville Vindicator by Mrs. Anna Dowell of the School staff. GATLINBURG COMMUNITY FAIR On Friday morning, October Is, all Gatlinburg was astir early getting ready for the fair. They were soon joined by people of the community and in fact from all over Sevier County, bringing in their produce, chickens, horses, cows, calves, etc.; jams, jellies, preserves and canned fruit, pickles, cakes, weaving, sewing, fancy work and everything that goes to make a good community fair. The committees of the different departments had the work well planned and everything was listed in its class when brought in, The three large school rooms were thrown together for the school and community exhibits, giving plenty of room for the exhibits and the people who were interested in this branch of the fair. There were fully 1,000 people present to view the exhibits, races and games, and to enjoy the basket dinner with neighboring friends. Everyone was in good humor and the weather man had been good enough to forecast a bright, sunshiny day so everyone had a fine time and went home praising the Gatlin-burg Community for putting on a splendid fair. The program started with a parade of the schools present, headed by the *teachers. Leading the entire parade was Mr. G. F. Ownby, chairman of NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 259 Sevier County Board of Education, and Mr. Robert Ogle, superintendent of schools of Sevier County. There were fully 250 school children in the parade representing nine different schools in this division. Credit should be given to Mr. Hobart Shields, supervisor of schools of this district, for interesting so many of the schools from a distance in the fair by bringing exhibits and taking part in many of the events. Following the parade, the contests in racing and games were begun, such as loo-yard dash for boys, 50-yard dash for girls, cracker-eating contest, tug of war, sack race, three-legged race, needle-threading contest, egg rolling, peanut scramble (which caused much merriment for the crowd). Every small boy and girl and larger ones, too, visited, the ice cream and pop stand and could be seen any time of day refreshing themselves with one or both. The day was all too short for the entire program and several events were crowded out. At all fairs everybody is interested in the horse shows and races and this was no exception, for everyone was out to see the saddle horses and their riders, ladies and children as well as men. One would hardly think there were so many good saddlers in so small a community but there were about twenty in the ring for gaits and races. In the school exhibits the Gatlinburg School did not compete with the others in the general exhibits or contests but only in individual contests, as the officers did not think it quite fair as the school was in the community putting on the fair and that would give it an advantage over the others. The Elkmont School, with Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Watson, teachers, won first prize on the school exhibit and Mr. Watson drove to Elkmont early Friday morning for his pupils who had no other way of getting to Gatlinburg. The teachers from the France and Ridge Schools brought their pupils in the same way and the latter won the prize for the largest per cent of pupils present, having fifty-eight per cent on the grounds. Mill Creek came next with fifty-one per cent to their credit. There were fourteen schools taking part in the athletic events and bringing exhibits. The mammoth ear of yellow dent corn that was on exhibition created much comment .and surely was a curiosity. The boys could not see just how a stalk of ordinary corn could hold up such a large ear. The judges were Miss Mayme Parrott, district agent, Division of Extension, University of Tennessee, who judged the women's work and general school exhibits. She gave the prizes not only on the quality of the work but suitableness of the material and neatness as well. C. Wilson, dean of agriculture of the University of Tennessee, J. P. Buck, professor of agriculture education of the university, J. L. Asher, professor of vocational agriculture at Pitman Center, and six of the Univerity of Tennessee senior class, and Roy Marshall judged the farm produce, stock and saddle and racing contests.

I asked the boys to wait while I went into a building near the principal corner of Knoxville. When I returned what did I see but the whole bunch lined up sitting on the curbing in front of the building, a sight unusual enough to excite the curiosity of the fair sized crowd still on the street.

The event was very popular and the crowd which attended far outnumbered any gathering which had previously been held in the neighborhood. The following extracts are taken from the report written for the Sevierville Vindicator by Mrs. Anna Dowell of the School staff. GATLINBURG COMMUNITY FAIR On Friday morning, October Is, all Gatlinburg was astir early getting ready for the fair. They were soon joined by people of the community and in fact from all over Sevier County, bringing in their produce, chickens, horses, cows, calves, etc.; jams, jellies, preserves and canned fruit, pickles, cakes, weaving, sewing, fancy work and everything that goes to make a good community fair. The committees of the different departments had the work well planned and everything was listed in its class when brought in, The three large school rooms were thrown together for the school and community exhibits, giving plenty of room for the exhibits and the people who were interested in this branch of the fair. There were fully 1,000 people present to view the exhibits, races and games, and to enjoy the basket dinner with neighboring friends. Everyone was in good humor and the weather man had been good enough to forecast a bright, sunshiny day so everyone had a fine time and went home praising the Gatlin-burg Community for putting on a splendid fair. The program started with a parade of the schools present, headed by the *teachers. Leading the entire parade was Mr. G. F. Ownby, chairman of NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 259 Sevier County Board of Education, and Mr. Robert Ogle, superintendent of schools of Sevier County. There were fully 250 school children in the parade representing nine different schools in this division. Credit should be given to Mr. Hobart Shields, supervisor of schools of this district, for interesting so many of the schools from a distance in the fair by bringing exhibits and taking part in many of the events. Following the parade, the contests in racing and games were begun, such as loo-yard dash for boys, 50-yard dash for girls, cracker-eating contest, tug of war, sack race, three-legged race, needle-threading contest, egg rolling, peanut scramble (which caused much merriment for the crowd). Every small boy and girl and larger ones, too, visited, the ice cream and pop stand and could be seen any time of day refreshing themselves with one or both. The day was all too short for the entire program and several events were crowded out. At all fairs everybody is interested in the horse shows and races and this was no exception, for everyone was out to see the saddle horses and their riders, ladies and children as well as men. One would hardly think there were so many good saddlers in so small a community but there were about twenty in the ring for gaits and races. In the school exhibits the Gatlinburg School did not compete with the others in the general exhibits or contests but only in individual contests, as the officers did not think it quite fair as the school was in the community putting on the fair and that would give it an advantage over the others. The Elkmont School, with Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Watson, teachers, won first prize on the school exhibit and Mr. Watson drove to Elkmont early Friday morning for his pupils who had no other way of getting to Gatlinburg. The teachers from the France and Ridge Schools brought their pupils in the same way and the latter won the prize for the largest per cent of pupils present, having fifty-eight per cent on the grounds. Mill Creek came next with fifty-one per cent to their credit. There were fourteen schools taking part in the athletic events and bringing exhibits. The mammoth ear of yellow dent corn that was on exhibition created much comment .and surely was a curiosity. The boys could not see just how a stalk of ordinary corn could hold up such a large ear. The judges were Miss Mayme Parrott, district agent, Division of Extension, University of Tennessee, who judged the women's work and general school exhibits. She gave the prizes not only on the quality of the work but suitableness of the material and neatness as well. C. Wilson, dean of agriculture of the University of Tennessee, J. P. Buck, professor of agriculture education of the university, J. L. Asher, professor of vocational agriculture at Pitman Center, and six of the Univerity of Tennessee senior class, and Roy Marshall judged the farm produce, stock and saddle and racing contests.

        254 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI exhibit of apples. These exhibits, I then judged and criticized the selections and announced the placings. A few days later the same exercise was repeated, this time in an orchard of unsprayed fruit. The reaction obtained was fine; selecting a few minutes they declared it would be impossible for each of them to pick any kind of an exhibit; that the best from unsprayed trees were not as good as the worst of the sprayed fruit! They had learned that to get sound fruit free from disease it would be necessary to spray. (The unsprayed fruit came from the school orchard.) In the animal hubandry class, in the study of poultry we studied culling; that is the boys were taught how to distinguish the good and the poor producing hens so that those hens that did not lay enough could be disposed of. In the handling of the hens in some of the flocks that we culled, we found other conditions to remedy. In Charlie Ogle's flock of White Leghorns for instance we discovered they were not laying on account of the lice. I informed him of the fact, suggested what to do for the lice and offered to dip the chick-ens for him if he would obtain the sodium fiouride. He obtained, the chemical and the fowls were dipped before the class. This trip with a further study taught the boys how to combat lice and what a simple and inexpensive operation it was. Thus, wherever possible I endeavor to teach by a practical application on some farm in the community. During a week in September I was able to secure several sets of slides, including special slides on "Farm Poultry" and "Orchard Management." Seven community meetings were held at which these pictures were shown and a talk made on the subjects. At the Gatlinburg meeting a community fair association was organized for a fair in the eleventh district. Some of the farmers are beginning to show a response to the work for I have had personal inquiries with requests to show them how to do certain things on their farms. Signed, O. J. MATTIL. The great event of the year in the lives of the boys at Gatlinburg was their visit conducted by Mr. Mattil to the Agricultural Fair at Knoxville, in September. Read the story of this experience and you will realize in a measure what possibilities lie before us in the development of our department of vocational agriculture: NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 255 THE TRIP TO THE FAIR BY O. J. MATTEL As I am a great believer in the educational value of a Fair, I felt that it would be a fine thing if I could get my agriculture class to the East Tennessee Division Fair at Knoxville. The boys seemed eager enough but I feared that the expenses would keep most of them from going. After arrangements were made whereby expenses would be as low as possible, only $1.50 with a little spending money being necessary, I was surprised to find eighteen out of the twenty-one boys signified their intentions of going. Arrangements were all made and the boys were instructed to meet by five o'clock at Calvin Ogle's store. "What time is that?" "Is that about sunrise?" "Is that before daybreak?" and other similar questions were asked. I informed them as near as possible what time by the sun five A. M. was but I began to get visions of what difficulty I would have to get the whole crowd assembled on time. But excitement helped me out, for the anticipation of going to the fair caused these boys to arise hours too soon, many in the `wee sma' hours of the morning' and long before time to start I could hear their impatient voices. Excitement failed to reach the rather unresponsive nature of one of these mountain boys, however, who slept an hour too long and was left behind. . But seventeen who arrived before the appointed hour started walking towards Banner, three miles distant, where they were to meet the truck which was to carry us into Knoxville. Wishing to have work done on my car at Sevierville, I planned to ride that far in my car and then join the truck. Arriving at Banner I found the crowd impatiently waiting for the truck which failed to appear. Time rolled by and we decided to start towards Pigeon Forge by car, a distance of four miles, mountain road graded, but some of it not any too smooth to travel with ease. If you can picture seventeen persons weighing anywhere from seventy-five to one hundred fifty pounds on a Ford roadster you can appreciate the sight at which the people along the roadside and in the fields stopper to look with the keenest curiosity. A circus wagon come to town would hardly have attracted more attention. At Pigeon Forge w( found the truck loading with straw and it was not long before the crowd was on its way towards Knoxville. 256 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Among the more serious things heard during the ride were: "What's that big, round thing over side of that barn ?" They were told it was a silo, and its use was explained. A body of water was noticed and one of the boys asked : "What's that water' over there ?" The answer came: "A small lake or a pond." "Why, I don't see any place where it can run off." After the explanation was made as to what a lake was, another boy whose geography had evidently been making more of an impression chimed in naming Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior and Lake Ontario. "People sure do have fine large barns around here, why most of them are better than any of our houses," said one. "Why there is one of the kind of chicken houses like we have been studying about," said another. "There's another kind." These and many other re-marks were heard between the shouting and singing of the group as the truck bounced and jolted over the rough pike. As we neared Knoxville the roadbed improved, the riding became easier, and soon one of the boys exclaimed: "Now we can burn the wind for we are on the Rubber pike." So swifter we sped along over the asphalt pavements reaching our destination about nine forty-five, and then the fun commenced. To endeavor to record my experience in taking seventeen mountain boys, from one part of the grounds to another would 'fill a volume.

The following extracts are taken from the report written for the Sevierville Vindicator by Mrs. Anna Dowell of the School staff. GATLINBURG COMMUNITY FAIR On Friday morning, October Is, all Gatlinburg was astir early getting ready for the fair. They were soon joined by people of the community and in fact from all over Sevier County, bringing in their produce, chickens, horses, cows, calves, etc.; jams, jellies, preserves and canned fruit, pickles, cakes, weaving, sewing, fancy work and everything that goes to make a good community fair. The committees of the different departments had the work well planned and everything was listed in its class when brought in, The three large school rooms were thrown together for the school and community exhibits, giving plenty of room for the exhibits and the people who were interested in this branch of the fair. There were fully 1,000 people present to view the exhibits, races and games, and to enjoy the basket dinner with neighboring friends. Everyone was in good humor and the weather man had been good enough to forecast a bright, sunshiny day so everyone had a fine time and went home praising the Gatlin-burg Community for putting on a splendid fair. The program started with a parade of the schools present, headed by the *teachers. Leading the entire parade was Mr. G. F. Ownby, chairman of NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 259 Sevier County Board of Education, and Mr. Robert Ogle, superintendent of schools of Sevier County. There were fully 250 school children in the parade representing nine different schools in this division. Credit should be given to Mr. Hobart Shields, supervisor of schools of this district, for interesting so many of the schools from a distance in the fair by bringing exhibits and taking part in many of the events. Following the parade, the contests in racing and games were begun, such as loo-yard dash for boys, 50-yard dash for girls, cracker-eating contest, tug of war, sack race, three-legged race, needle-threading contest, egg rolling, peanut scramble (which caused much merriment for the crowd). Every small boy and girl and larger ones, too, visited, the ice cream and pop stand and could be seen any time of day refreshing themselves with one or both. The day was all too short for the entire program and several events were crowded out. At all fairs everybody is interested in the horse shows and races and this was no exception, for everyone was out to see the saddle horses and their riders, ladies and children as well as men. One would hardly think there were so many good saddlers in so small a community but there were about twenty in the ring for gaits and races. In the school exhibits the Gatlinburg School did not compete with the others in the general exhibits or contests but only in individual contests, as the officers did not think it quite fair as the school was in the community putting on the fair and that would give it an advantage over the others. The Elkmont School, with Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Watson, teachers, won first prize on the school exhibit and Mr. Watson drove to Elkmont early Friday morning for his pupils who had no other way of getting to Gatlinburg. The teachers from the France and Ridge Schools brought their pupils in the same way and the latter won the prize for the largest per cent of pupils present, having fifty-eight per cent on the grounds. Mill Creek came next with fifty-one per cent to their credit. There were fourteen schools taking part in the athletic events and bringing exhibits. The mammoth ear of yellow dent corn that was on exhibition created much comment .and surely was a curiosity. The boys could not see just how a stalk of ordinary corn could hold up such a large ear. The judges were Miss Mayme Parrott, district agent, Division of Extension, University of Tennessee, who judged the women's work and general school exhibits. She gave the prizes not only on the quality of the work but suitableness of the material and neatness as well. C. Wilson, dean of agriculture of the University of Tennessee, J. P. Buck, professor of agriculture education of the university, J. L. Asher, professor of vocational agriculture at Pitman Center, and six of the Univerity of Tennessee senior class, and Roy Marshall judged the farm produce, stock and saddle and racing contests. 250 THE ARROW OF PI BETA' PHI ALUMNIE HEALTH WORK By reading the Alumnae Club Reports in the October AP:Row you will find that the alumnae clubs are doing many worthy things to co-operate with the Health Committee. Some of the clubs assist in local hospital work, two have II 4) rooms in hospitals, others have been devoting time to the study of health, and many of the clubs have invited community nurses and health workers to talk to them. BURLINGTON HOSPITAL Room The II .1. Room at the Burlington Hospital is maintained by the Burlington Alumnae club. Located on the second floor, with one large window which lets in a flood of sunlight, the room is one of the most cheerful ones in the institution. This room is not only for Pi Phis but is for anyone 'seeking medical aid. The local chapter members take a personal pride in the room. An efficient standing committee visits the hospital at intervals and sees that the II 'cD room is kept in the very best of condition. Fifteen dollars a year is donated to the hospital and in addition to that sum, the chapter. furnishes linens and innumerable supplies. We do not feel that the room is a burden to the chapter. It seems as one of the many welcome channels through which we can really be of service. BESS H. STANG. The Lancaster alumnae club spent one meeting of three hours making hospital garments and supplies for the Lancaster General Hospital. During the last hour of the meeting, Dr. Schwartz, a physician of that city spoke on "Health." Many of the clubs did work of this kind. The Galesburg Alumnae Club maintains a. Pi Phi Hospital Room also. The Drury Alumni Club made thirty-six layettes for a "Loan Chest" directed by the Greene County Health Association. One of the Pi Beta Phi patronesses furnished all of the material. The Oklahoma City Alumni Club visits the hospital once a week, taking candy to the children. As a result of their interest Mrs. Eldowney was appointed to the Hospital Board. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 251 NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON EDITED BY SARAH POMEROY RUGG, Massachusetts A Instruction in practical agriculture has always been a vital need in Gatlinburg. This fact has been recognized by everyone ever connected with our Settlement School in an official capacity and there is general rejoicing that the need has at last been met most adequately. Miss Bishop has endeavored constantly to solve this problem by finding ways and means to meet it, and thanks to her tireless efforts the II B 4 School has at last secured a teacher of voca tional agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act. The state requirements for such a teacher are given below in order that the general reader may appreciate the full scope of this new branch of our work which has now been made possible. VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE IN TENNESSEE AND WORK OF THE TEACHER OF VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE A teacher must be employed by the School for a period of twelve months. The teacher must be a graduate of a four-year course in Agriculture from a standard college or university. In addition to his M.A. degree he must have had eighteen semester hours in education, nine of which must be in agricultural education. A room must be provided and equipped with chairs, tables, shelves, cabinets, etc., for the use of the department of Vocational Agriculture. The School must appropriate for laboratory equipment $250.00 the first year, $1oo.00 per year for three years thereafter. An appropriation of $So.00 for an Agricultural Library must be made the first year and $25.00 per year for three years thereafter. This work is designed for boys over fourteen years of age who live on farms. Each boy taking agriculture must devote one-half of school day to it and in no case shall this be less than ninety minute classroom instruction. Each boy taking agriculture must carry out a project along the line of instruction given. The work must be under the direct and personal supervision of the teacher. The project must always be completed and in no case shall. the time be less than six months supervised practice and project work. The teacher of Agriculture must own and operate a means of transportation in order that he may be able to visit the boys doing project work and farmers of the community. The work of the teacher of Vocational Agriculture includes classroom instruction, supervision of projects, part-time work with boys not regularly in school, evening work with men, and community work. The classroom instruction includes the regular recitation, laboratory work, project study, reference reading, project planning, supervised study and field work. 252 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Each boy who elects the course is required to take a project along the line of instruction taken and under direct supervision of the teacher. This brings the teacher in contact with the farm home and the people of the community. Collecting and preserving laboratory materials such as insects affecting farm crops, specimens of disease attacking plants and animals, crop exhibits of all kinds, adding additional equipment to the department, making charts for use in class instruction, these and many other duties come in the program of the teacher of Vocational Agriculture. There are many boys who have dropped out of school before reaching or finishing high school. These boys are now living on farms and cannot attend school for nine months because of theit business. These boys are vitally interested in their vocation, agriculture, and would gladly take instruction if they had the opportunity. The teacher of Vocational Agriculture in Tennessee will organize unit courses for these boys during the months of December, January and February, and for two hours twice a week for three months instruction will be given in agriculture, farm arithmetic, farm accounting, farm letter writing, reference reading, bulletin and magazine work and any other thing that they need to help them in their vocation. The meetings will be held twice each week, making it possible to complete a unit course each month. The teacher of Vocational Agriculture is the community adviser and his activities are many. He should organize and promote community organization, organize community fairs and. exhibits, act as the community veterinarian in erhergency, actively engage in all work with boys, get people interested in recreation for all ages, promote the social and religious sides of community 'life, help bring father and son closer to each other, help develop a market for the produce of the community, instruct the community in the presentation and preservation of products for the market, instruct the community farmers how to combat diseases and pests attacking crops and animals, make a survey of the community to ascertain its needs, put on agricultural plays for the schools, standardize the products of the community, do junior project work with boys in the rural schools, act as a teacher-trainer to rural teachers. Even a cursory reading of these requirements for a teacher of vocational agriculture is enough to show the uninitiated that it has been no small task to find the person fitted to meet them and to work in harmony with our school staff. It is a matter of great satisfaction therefore that our pioneer worker in this field is proving so satisfactory. In her semi-annual report to the Settlement School Committee made after her summer visit to the school in August and September, Miss Kate Miller, the chairman, writes as follows: "Mr. O. j. Mattil, teacher of agriculture under the provisions of the Smith-Hughes Act is from the University of Tennessee and is a teacher of experience with two years in Smith-Hughes work. He is a splendid man to ha've on our staff, able, willing and interested. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 253 Like the nurse he is a power throughout the whole community. The old school house is used by Mr. Mattil for his work. He has made two rooms in it, one for class work and the other for shop. He is putting in racks for tools and employing the boys to do the work. There is so much of his work that is outside that I believe the small classroom will be adequate for a while." Following is Mr. Mattil's report to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee after three months' work in his new position. THE SMITH-HUGHES AGRICULTURE AT THE Pl BETA PHI SCHOOL July, August, September, 1922 In the establishing of such a work as vocational agriculture in a new field, a long time is required before we can hope to see progress or notice any great results. It's a slow process, really a gradual growth, so these first three months in particular could hardly be expected to produce any showy record yet the responses to my efforts have been very pleasing and cause me to feel that satisfactory results will be obtained in the course of time. In the horticultural class we have had occasion to make a number of trips to orchards. In connection with the study of harvesting and marketing of fruit the boys observed the thinning and picking from the trees and that these picked apples were kept separate from any that fell from the trees. They were surprised to find that to avoid the multiplication and spread of disease the bruised rottening apples, cores, etc., were removed from under the trees. They were told about and shown how apples should be graded and packed for the market, then all tried their hands at it themselves. In observing the orchard cultivation the benefits of cultivation were clearly seen, and it was also observed that by the proper cultivation and rotation of crops some of the most troublesome of weeds were being eradicated. Learning varieties of apples something like two dozen different ones were observed and of the more important ones a close study by the use of a score card was made. Such points as good bearers, good shippers, good keepers, the flavor, color, etc., were considered. On another occasion the class was shown how to select a good exhibit of apples for fairs, etc., after instruction each boy picked his 254 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI exhibit of apples. These exhibits, I then judged and criticized the selections and announced the placings. A few days later the same exercise was repeated, this time in an orchard of unsprayed fruit. The reaction obtained was fine; selecting a few minutes they declared it would be impossible for each of them to pick any kind of an exhibit; that the best from unsprayed trees were not as good as the worst of the sprayed fruit! They had learned that to get sound fruit free from disease it would be necessary to spray. (The unsprayed fruit came from the school orchard.) In the animal hubandry class, in the study of poultry we studied culling; that is the boys were taught how to distinguish the good and the poor producing hens so that those hens that did not lay enough could be disposed of. In the handling of the hens in some of the flocks that we culled, we found other conditions to remedy. In Charlie Ogle's flock of White Leghorns for instance we discovered they were not laying on account of the lice. I informed him of the fact, suggested what to do for the lice and offered to dip the chick-ens for him if he would obtain the sodium fiouride. He obtained, the chemical and the fowls were dipped before the class. This trip with a further study taught the boys how to combat lice and what a simple and inexpensive operation it was. Thus, wherever possible I endeavor to teach by a practical application on some farm in the community. During a week in September I was able to secure several sets of slides, including special slides on "Farm Poultry" and "Orchard Management." Seven community meetings were held at which these pictures were shown and a talk made on the subjects. At the Gatlinburg meeting a community fair association was organized for a fair in the eleventh district. Some of the farmers are beginning to show a response to the work for I have had personal inquiries with requests to show them how to do certain things on their farms. Signed, O. J. MATTIL. The great event of the year in the lives of the boys at Gatlinburg was their visit conducted by Mr. Mattil to the Agricultural Fair at Knoxville, in September. Read the story of this experience and you will realize in a measure what possibilities lie before us in the development of our department of vocational agriculture: NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 255 THE TRIP TO THE FAIR BY O. J. MATTEL As I am a great believer in the educational value of a Fair, I felt that it would be a fine thing if I could get my agriculture class to the East Tennessee Division Fair at Knoxville. The boys seemed eager enough but I feared that the expenses would keep most of them from going. After arrangements were made whereby expenses would be as low as possible, only $1.50 with a little spending money being necessary, I was surprised to find eighteen out of the twenty-one boys signified their intentions of going. Arrangements were all made and the boys were instructed to meet by five o'clock at Calvin Ogle's store. "What time is that?" "Is that about sunrise?" "Is that before daybreak?" and other similar questions were asked. I informed them as near as possible what time by the sun five A. M. was but I began to get visions of what difficulty I would have to get the whole crowd assembled on time. But excitement helped me out, for the anticipation of going to the fair caused these boys to arise hours too soon, many in the `wee sma' hours of the morning' and long before time to start I could hear their impatient voices. Excitement failed to reach the rather unresponsive nature of one of these mountain boys, however, who slept an hour too long and was left behind. . But seventeen who arrived before the appointed hour started walking towards Banner, three miles distant, where they were to meet the truck which was to carry us into Knoxville. Wishing to have work done on my car at Sevierville, I planned to ride that far in my car and then join the truck. Arriving at Banner I found the crowd impatiently waiting for the truck which failed to appear. Time rolled by and we decided to start towards Pigeon Forge by car, a distance of four miles, mountain road graded, but some of it not any too smooth to travel with ease. If you can picture seventeen persons weighing anywhere from seventy-five to one hundred fifty pounds on a Ford roadster you can appreciate the sight at which the people along the roadside and in the fields stopper to look with the keenest curiosity. A circus wagon come to town would hardly have attracted more attention. At Pigeon Forge w( found the truck loading with straw and it was not long before the crowd was on its way towards Knoxville. 256 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Among the more serious things heard during the ride were: "What's that big, round thing over side of that barn ?" They were told it was a silo, and its use was explained. A body of water was noticed and one of the boys asked : "What's that water' over there ?" The answer came: "A small lake or a pond." "Why, I don't see any place where it can run off." After the explanation was made as to what a lake was, another boy whose geography had evidently been making more of an impression chimed in naming Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior and Lake Ontario. "People sure do have fine large barns around here, why most of them are better than any of our houses," said one. "Why there is one of the kind of chicken houses like we have been studying about," said another. "There's another kind." These and many other re-marks were heard between the shouting and singing of the group as the truck bounced and jolted over the rough pike. As we neared Knoxville the roadbed improved, the riding became easier, and soon one of the boys exclaimed: "Now we can burn the wind for we are on the Rubber pike." So swifter we sped along over the asphalt pavements reaching our destination about nine forty-five, and then the fun commenced. To endeavor to record my experience in taking seventeen mountain boys, from one part of the grounds to another would 'fill a volume. Most of them had never seen a fair and only a very few had ever been to a city such as Knoxville. A few had never been as far out of Gatlinburg as the nearest town of Sevierville. Conducting them was no small task but still it was almost as much fun as a regular circus to hear .and to see how these mountain boys were reacting to the things they were experiencing. Some would exclaim about this or that others would ask any number of questions, very often very foolish ones still others were so overawed that they appeared to be struck dumb and with eyes atwinkle, fairly popping from their sockets and mouths agape, they gazed on the new and strange things as we made the rounds of the fair. The livestock, poultry, farm prdducts and all other exhibits ,were viewed and the places of amusements, the midway, ,the free vaudeville shows, the ice cream cone and peanut stands and the airplanes were not neglected. For the boys it was one thrill after another. "Oh, look what a big hog, I don't believe we could ever, raise that kind." Too much NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 257 of a contrast between an 1,100 pound hog and a razor back! "Gee, that's fine riding I'm going to save my money and ride that roller coaster some more." Thus it went from exhibits to amusements. An airplane appeared and every moment of its flight the boys watched with almost breathless amazement. The acrobatic stunts held them spellbound at times and so incredulous did they appear that on several occasions the question was put: "Why, that's not a man; that's not a woman, is it ?" After witnessing a gorgeous display of fireworks that night we boarded a street car and went "to take in" the city. The boys were all tired by this, time and were soon ready to turn in for the night and I wasn't sorry either for they had about worn me out several hours before. I asked the boys to wait while I went into a building near the principal corner of Knoxville. When I returned what did I see but the whole bunch lined up sitting on the curbing in front of the building, a sight unusual enough to excite the curiosity of the fair sized crowd still on the street. As I gave the accustomed signal, a whistle, the whole line were on their feet. They had to cross the street and even at this hour trolleys and automobiles continually traveled so the boys did not walk across the street, that was too tame for them they wanted to make sure they, reached the other side in a hurry so they made it on a dead run. It was a ridiculous sight to see them scramble across the main corner of the city .on a hop like scared rabbits. Many of the boys had enjoyed their first street car ride so much that they were disappointed to find that it would be unnecessary to' take a street car to our -destination for the night. The next morning most of the boys were ready to return home so at an early hour we started. What these boys gained and retained from their trip would .be hard to determine but it will be a long time before they will cease talking of what they saw. When asked to write a paper on *what they had seen at the fair they exclaimed: "Don't get us started on that for we can't ever tell, you all, nor can we ever stop telling." One result of the trip was discovered the next day of school. After chapel exercises Miss Chew advised the boys that the barbed wire fences were to keep in the .stock and if they' were walked on very much would soon be useless for that purpose and suggested that foi future acrobatic .stunts like wire walking it .would be best to stretch 258 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI a special wire. This was done and the boys for the next few weeks displayed their skill in walking on the wire. Early in the morning of the day of the Gatlinburg Fair I noticed several boys approaching with a small roll of wire and upon inquiry I learned that they contemplated giving a special performance at the fair. It was rather late to construct a suitable place to stretch a wire so the fair committee feels that it lost a very attractive feature when it missed this treat of high wire performance. To recompense this loss the committee expects to assure this attraction for the coming fair of 1923 by an option. It is hoped that this trip to the fair has left other impressions of greater lasting value. The boys are already talking of going back again next year so the trip to the East Tennessee Division Fair seems to be an assured annual event. * * * * * * * * The community fair association which was organized in Gatlin--burg in September achieved a marked success in its efforts to put on a fair in the eleventh district.
