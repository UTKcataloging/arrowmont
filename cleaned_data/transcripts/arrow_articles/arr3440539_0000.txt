        538 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI It. is rather unusual to find three chapters as close both geographically and through association as those at Butler, Franklin, and Indiana. It is indeed a most splendid situation. My visits to Indiana were marked by poor railroad connections and my experiences varied from being two hours ahead of time to being three hours late, but these trials made me appreciate all the more the good things of the visits themselves. A big cooky-shine where I had an opportunity to meet not only_ the active chapter but also the alumnae and the pledges, made a very enjoyable beginning for my visit at Butler. The girls followed the cooky-shine with an original and very clever little three act satire of life at Butler, Business Is Looking Up. Association with the individual girls filled the days most pleasantly, and an initiation and buffet supper made my second night with Indiana r a very memorable one. A very short time at an alumnae club meeting impressed me with the efficiency of the club and with the results which it was obtaining. For a chapter which cannot have a house, Indiana A has an almost ideal condition, with her lovely, artistic chapter-room in the Pi Phi wing of the dormitory. A splendid opportunity to know the active chapter was given by the chapter supper and meeting and by the in-formal visits in the room and on the campus. It was a great pleasure to renew acquaintance with Mrs. Drybread, a former Grand Vice-president, and to meet other alumnae and patronesses. Although, in the telling, the chapter visits seem very much alike, each had its peculiar characteristics which distinguish it for me.. At Bloomington, as at several chapters, I enjoyed so much the privilege of being with the girls in the classrooms, and I developed the "eight o'clock" habit to such an extent that the weather had no effect upon it. Indiana B entertained her town alumnae at dinner, in order that I might have an opportunity to know them, and it was a very enthusiastic and happy group of Pi Phis who filled the house with the sounds of a real Pi Phi good time. A call meeting of the chapter made it possible for me to meet the girls as a chapter still another time. This year I had the privilege, for the second time, of celebrating Founders' Day with the Illinois B and Illinois A chapters and the Galesburg Alumnae Club. Almost a hundred Pi Phis attended the luncheon and enjoyed the cabaret given by the active girls from both chapters. The stunts very cleverly carried out the idea of a magazine 2VEIVS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 539 from cover to advertisements, and the programs were little printed Arrows. My visit with Illinois B was marked by an exceptionally good cooky-shine, which was remarkable because everything except the rolls had been prepared by the girls themselves, and by long talks in the big home-like living-room of the chapter bungalow. Through a most enjoyable Sunday afternoon tea, dinner at the hall, and chap-ter meeting, I was able to feel that I knew Illinois as a chapter very well, while an Orpheum party and luncheon down town meant a very pleasant more personal acquaintance with individual girls. My appreciation of the many things done for me both by chapters and clubs and by individual Pi Phis cannot be expressed. The memories of the past three months are among the very happiest that my fraternity has brought to me. As a member of the Council these visits have meant to me a new vision of what our fraternity really is and of what being a Pi .Beta Phi can mean. If I have been able to give to the chapters even a small part of the inspiration and of the incentive to do better things. for Pi Phi that they have given to me, then my visits have indeed been worth while from the standpoint of the fraternity. AMY BURNHAM ONKEN. (On account of serious illness in her family, Miss Stuart was obliged to forego the chapter visiting she had anticipated and asked to have other members of the Council substituted for her. Accordingly Mrs. Allen added the Alpha Province chapters to her previous itinerary, Mrs. Rugg '.!sited the Pennsylvania chapters, the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh alumna/ clubs, and joined Mrs. Allen for Founders' Day celebration with the New York Alumnee Club, and Miss Onken went to Colorado and Wyoming. At the present writing no one of these have returned to their homes and of course detailed accounts of these last visits are not obtainable. EnlToR.) NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON (A Message from the New Chairman of the Settlement School Committee) The great war is probably to be considered the cause of a change in chairman of the Settlement School Committee, for otherwise Mrs. Helmick would be carrying on that great work today instead of your humble servant. However, it is an ill wind that blows good to no one and I have! certainly been happy to do the little I have had to do so far. When questions began to arise the first of the year that called for a personal knowledge of affairs, I decided it would be 540 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI necessary for me to make my first visit to Gatlinburg. Miss Melinda. Stuart consented to accompany me and we started on our journey February 13 and arrived at the school Saturday, February 16. I most earnestly urge all Pi Phis who can to make this trip up Pigeon Creek from Sevierville. We rode eighteen miles by mule team up this beautiful canyon, hemmed in by the Great Smoky Mountains with scenery not to be surpassed in any part of the country. I was, as I thought, prepared to see a flourishing school but can-not express my surprise when I saw the work Mrs. Helmick had accomplished under almost insurmountable difficulties. We were delighted to meet the five teachers in the flesh and to find them such delightful people. They gave us a very hearty reception. We were greatly impressed with the children that were enrolled in our school. They are exceptionally bright and eager for learning, and will be a credit to' the Pi Phis in the world's work of the future, I am sure. We were privileged in visiting homes of most of the residents of Gatlinburg and on a whole, found them superior people of a high moral standing and deep religious convictions. The road-bed of the new railroad from Sevierville now under construction is finished about half way up the canyon and it is hoped that by fall it will be completed as far as Gatlinburg. This will bring untold opportunities to our people and will also widen our own field of usefulness, as children further away from the school who have expressed a desire to attend will then be able to attend daily. Supplies can be secured more easily and economically. All the development resources of the mountains will be open to the commercial world outside and what blesses one blesses all in that respect. I would like to mention the fact that Mr. Andy Huff, one of the staunch friends of Pi Phi, has built a hotel and is having it operated in a very satisfactory manner. He offers special rates to all Pi Phis and will meet them in Sevierville) if they so desire. I can heartily recommend this new enterprise and can assure future guests of a quiet resting place in the most beautiful surroundings. When I am asked how soon I expect to go to Gatlinburg, I assure all that it will be just as soon as there will be sufficient excuse, for it was a visit I will always cherish in my memory. The people were so frank and sincere in their hospitality and were unstinted in their praise of Pi Phi and the love and interest given them by Mrs. Helmick.

BOOK REVIEWS BY OLIVE GILBREATH, Michigan B Miss Amerikanka Illustrated by Sigismund de Ivanowski, New York: Harper and Brothers. $1.40 Olive Gilbreath, the author of Miss A merikanka, became a member of Michigan B chapter of II B .13 while she was a graduate student at the University of Michigan in 1907-08. Her subsequent travels and experiences have been very interesting. This is her first book and its reception has been most flattering. The following ex-tract is taken from a long review in the New York Times for March 31, 1918. Among all the volumes that are being written about Russia nowadays there is room a-plenty still for the books rare always ! that combine freshness with penetration, and that have the charm of distinct individuality. Miss Amerikanka is such a book. It is a novel, and its slender little story is a pretty romance touched with the mystery of German intrigue in Russia in the early days of the war; but the impression which it leaves upon the reader is not at all one of fiction, but of truth; it is a bit of Russia as it was seen, in 1914 and 1915, by an American woman who knew how to observe, to question, to think; But it is never didactic ; always it has in it youth and personality. Miss Amerikanka, as her Russian friends call her, tells the story in the first person. She was in China when the war broke out. She had always wanted to go to Russia. With the coming of war her desire grew not less, but more. She insisted upon journeying to Petrograd in the autumn of 1914, and her friends in Peking's Legation Street commended her to two distinguished Russians, a General and a young attache, who were called home by war emergencies, and started her off otherwise companionless on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The story is of her journey, of her visit to friends in Petrograd, of her travels to Moscow and the Volga country, and of the happenings that involved the General and the attache in strange intrigue and herself in romance. Yet she had no exciting "adventures"; the book is of Russia, and of how an American saw and studied and loved it. It is its individuality that makes it charming, its keen seeing and thinking that give it real value. Miss Gilbreath is a young woman, and this is her first book. It is a book full of promise, in its keenness of observation, its intelligent sympathy, its sin
