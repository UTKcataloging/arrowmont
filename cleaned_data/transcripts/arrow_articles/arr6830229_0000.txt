She spends many hours in conference with Miss Jessie W. Harris, vice-dean of the college of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee, Miss Marian G. Heard, professor of craft design at the University of Tennessee and Ruth Dyer, director of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. The courses metalwork, jewelry, weaving, textile design, recreational crafts, pottery are outlined. Schedules, accommodations, and expenses are discussed fully. But the most careful concentration is spent on the selection of the staff. . Pi Beta Phi University of Tenneisee Work-shop is most fortunate again in ha:ving Marian G. Heard as director of the eighth summer session. Miss Heard was trained to be a ceramic designer, graduating from Alfred University with a Bachelor of Science degree. But she found that during the depression there was no demand for . a ceramics designer. So she went back to her home in Staten Island, New York, and took 'up the uncertain life of a free-lance artist in jewelry, metal, and pottery. She very modestly says: "due to my excellent training and a fair amount of luck, I was successful in this venture." During this time she took classes in fine arts at Columbia University and this led to a Master's degree. In 1936 Miss Harris asked Miss Heard to go to the College of Home Economics, University of Tennessee, to establish the craft unit of the related arts and crafts department. Her position was Assistant Professor of Craft Design with part-time teaching in the College of Home economics and part-time with the Agricultural Extension Service. In 1944 she was given a leave of absence from the University to conduct a craft survey for the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild. This enabled her to see the craftsmen, craft schools and craft industries in Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee. As a result of this survey, the guild received a grant for a craft education program from the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation. She thenorganized the craft education program and served as its director until 1947 when she was asked to be the director of the Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Summer Workshop. She has served in that position every summer since that time. In 1948 she was master planner for the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild Fair that Professor Marian G. Heard, Director of U.T. Pi Phi Workshop was held on the Pi Phi green in Gatlinburg. In 1950 Miss Heard was promoted to full professor of Craft Design at the University of Tennessee. In the last two years her extra-curricular activities have included Chairmanship of the Gatlinburg Exhibit for the Governor's Conference, Chairmanship of the. Tennessee Arts and Crafts Exhibit, trustee of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild, co-chairman with Jane Glass for the 1952 Craftsman's Fair, Chair-man of the Craft Education Committee, member of the Executive Standard Committee and the Sales Committee of the Southern Highland Handicraft 'Guild. In addition to being Director of the 1952 Workshop, Miss Heard will teach again the splendid courses in advanced jewelry-making. 229 230 THE MARCH ARROW Pi Phi's Mary Elizabeth Starr Sullivan (Washington Alpha) will teach rug weaving and advanced weaving in the 1952 Summer Workshop. Mrs. Sullivan received her degrees of Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts from the University of Washington majoring in textiles, clothing and fine arts. She said: "I did my first weaving in a textile class taken my first quarter in college and I have been weaving ever since Good Heavens ! that is 25 years! I don't feel that old. We didn't have a weaving class then but I learned a lot by being flunky around the textile laboratory and volunteering Mary Elizabeth Starr Sullivan, Washington Alpha, will teach rug weaving and advanced weaving at the 1952 Summer Workshop. to warp the looms. My reward was being al-lowed to weave the first piece on the new warp." Mrs. Sullivan taught textiles and clothing for five years at the University of Oregon and in 1933 visited seven European countries as assistant leader of a group studying historic textiles. In 1937 she studied weaving in Sweden with Sigrid Synnergren who now designs and produces ecclesiastical textiles in Lund, Sweden. In 1939 Mrs. Sullivan continued her Scandinavian training by studying with Marianne Strengell at the Cranbrook Academy of Art. "In my early days," said Mrs. Sullivan, "I was intrigued as a weaver by the mechanical possibilities of drafts and pattern weaving but my interests now are concerned with textures and colors and for some years now I have not `gone off the twill' (a kind of weaver's jargon meaning that I use only the simplest techniques) and I like to design textiles when the interest comes from the contrasts of rough and smooth, dull and shiny, fine and coarse and the interplay of light and bright colors." She taught for nine years at the University of Washington and through the years has exhibited her textiles in the museums of Port-land, Seattle, Baltimore, Cincinnati and the De Young museum in San Francicso. She has had pieces in Lou Tate's traveling exhibitions and the Oregon Ceramic Studio in Portland and won a prize for a textile at the International Textile exhibition. Mrs. Sullivan has taught at the Summer Workshop four summers and her whole family intends to go to Gatlinburg with her this summer. That includes Dr. Sullivan who teaches philosophy at the University of California, her seven-year-old daughter, Elizabeth and her three-year-old son, Dennis. When Pi Phis are buying the popular whig rose apron at Settlement School Sales, it might interest them to know that Mrs. Sullivan de-signed that apron for Arrowcraft. Last summer, Miss Tina said that Arrowcraft had made and sold nearly eight thousand of those Whig Rose aprons. Miss Jane Glass, a graduate of Iowa State College and with a Master's Degree from Columbia University, assistant professor at Radford College will teach beginning jewelry again, giving the techniques and individual problems, creating objects using various metals and semi-precious stones. Woodwork and wood-carving is to be offered this summer. Mr. Jules Struppeck, associate Professor of Fine Arts at Sophie Newcomb college and an outstanding man in wood-carving will teach this course. The dates for the 1952 Summer Workshop are set for June 10 to July 16. Seventy-seven students from thirty-nine states studied at the 1951 Summer Workshop. Pi Phis, you may work with craftsmen from various parts of the country, visit mountain craftmen in their homes and enjoy the hours for fun, for credit, or for both. FUN IN THE WORKSHOP The Work Shop opened before me. I entered in fear and trembling. When realization dawned upon me of the many activities, how meager my fund of knowledge, then hearing "Be original create don't copy" my mind was as blank as a bare sheet of paper and no pencil to scribble thereon. The valley of the shadow of mental oblivion lay before me. Suddenly, a bit of dawn appeared ahead. I bucked up my nerve, saying to my sleepy brain "wake up drowsy head, use your wits. Others can create why not you ?" My eyes lit upon a piece of walnut in the scrap box. I saw a leaved shaped tray in that lovely wood. I struggled away carving a bit THE MARCH ARROW here a bit there, until beads of perspiration rolled down my brow, my moist fingers stuck together, yet always saying to myself "stick at it, don't let it get you. You get it." Wonder of wonders, it was accomplished. Creating my own work gave joy immeasurable. And what is fun but joy in your immediate task no matter what it is. From a block of wood, worked upon for smoothness and proportion, came a feeling for design, beauty and rhythm of lines, richness of color, harmony of parts. This was the opening of my mind to a greater feeling for all crafts California Maids of Cotton Candidates Each year colleges in California choose their candidates for the California Maid of Cotton; and from these girls is chosen the state's candidate for the national Maid of Cotton Contest at Memphis early in January. Four Pi Phis were among the candidates: Barbara Teal, California Zeta ; Betsy Swift, California Beta ; Paula Turner, California Gamma ; and Allyn Smith, California Delta, who was last year Home Coming Queen at UCLA. Allyn won the state contest, and with it a wonderful wardrobe all specially designed of cotton, to wear at Memphis. The winner of the national contest will represent the cotton industry on a six month tour of cities in thisleading to the fun of exploring and ex.F menting in unknown fields; a better apprc don of design, color, skill in fact for ar general which is something that can be a no one can ever take from you.
