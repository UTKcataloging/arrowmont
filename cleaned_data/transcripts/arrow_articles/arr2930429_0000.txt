Miss Gillette has adopted certain Boy Scout rules for behavior and development in her boys' base-ball team. She has two teams an indoor team plays in the abandoned Methodist church, and the second team outside, in "flats". This has been a fine thing for the boys. Miss Hill has not been well and robust this winter, having had a touch of grip, and it has been, indeed, a most fortunate thing for the school that we have had such a capable, high-minded and unselfish a person as Miss Gillette to go ahead with the settlement feature, which is important in our work among these stolid, impassive, ascetic people of our own race in the mountains. 428 .
