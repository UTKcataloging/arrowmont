Her gracious charm, ability in managing the School, and devotion to Pi Beta Phi will be long remembered by all those who were privileged to know her. The Children Speak from the Pi Beta Phi School in the Great Smokies By ANN LIGHTER, Librarian and Teacher of English The students of Pi Beta Phi High School are always glad to tell interested listeners about their classes, their extra-curricular activities, their hopes and_ aspirations. And they particularly appreciate the opportunity to tell the Pi Beta Phis throughout the land, of the ad-vantages they enjoy at Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. These one hundred and eleven boys and girls in high school are no different than those you find most anywhere in these United States except that they have been blessed with the privilege and opportunity of being a part of the evolution of the original dream of the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. And now a few facts and figures about the authors of the articles written about each of the four classes in high school. Alliene Barnes is the president of the fresh-man class and one of the most promising students in the school. She is a shy, quiet little girl who is well liked by her teacher and class-mates. She is a member of the Beta Club-National Honor Society. Alliene lives in Pigeon Forge, a small town about seven miles from Gatlinburg and comes to school every day on the school bus. She is the oldest of five children. Her father is a real estate agent in Gatlinburg. Geraldine Fox, our sophomore, comes to Pi Beta Phi from Chestnut Hill, a community about thirty miles from Gatlinburg. Because of the distance from their home, Gerry and her brother, Jack, live at the school dormitory. Gerry, a bright-eyed, alert girl of fourteen years, is an honor student and an avid reader. Most of her leisure time is spent in reading and as a result she has an exceptional vocabularyand knowledge of good books. Gerry has not chosen her college and has not decided on her future occupation as yet, but wants to be a librarian, teacher or singer. The author of the article on the active junior class, Barbara Huff, is the daughter of a Pi Beta Phi Henrietta McCutchan Huff. She has one brother and three sisters, one of whom is, at the time of this writing, just a few days old. Barbara's mother and father own the Huff Tourist Cabins in Gatlinburg and are active in school and community projects. Barbara is a typical teen-ager and one of the most capable students in our high school as is evidenced by her many activities. She plays on the girls' basketball team, is a cheer leader, a member of the Y-Teen Club, Beta Club, Home Ec Club and president of the Junior Class. Our senior, Juanita Wilson, is an honor student, an attractive girl and is very popular with the students and the faculty. Juanita's home is on a farm in the Glades, a few miles from Gatlinburg, and she has lived at the school dormitory for most of her four years in high school. Because of her high marks and her. personality Juanita has been given a scholarship to the Andrew Jackson Business College in Nashville. She hopes to be able to continue her academic education at a university after finishing the secretarial course, THE CLASS OF 1950 By ALLIENE BARNES The Freshman class of the Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee is made up of 460 THE MAY ARROW 461 forty-four students twenty-one boys and twenty-three girls. We have the same number of students now that we had at the beginning of this term, as we lost two boys and added two girls. We have the largest class in the school and we hope we will have forty-four in the 1950 graduating class. About half of our class come from small country schools in nearby communities. Nina Sue McCarter, Stella Ownby, Ray Dodgen, Jimmy Moore, and Faye and Ray King, the twins of our class, and Betty June Carr, an honor roll student, come from Banner, a little rural community near Gatlinburg and all of these students come to school by bus. Joyce McCarter, Mary Newman, Betty Cantrell, Bobby Conner, and Jack Grooms live in the Glades, a settlement near Gatlinburg. A "glade," as you know, is a clearing or an open space in the woods and that is just what the "Glades" is. Junior Ogle, along with Wanda, Huskey, comes from Carter Town, located between Gatlinburg and the Glades. Mildred Ward and Charles Maples come from Pigeon Forge, a village half-way between Gatlinburg and Sevierville. Pauline Whaley who comes from Caney Creek School, recently moved to Gatlinburg. Jean Huskey comes from Wears Valley, a typical mountain community located in a valley with high mountains completely hemming it in. Bertha Marine, another of our honor roll students, comes from Laurel Lick. Without these students from other schools the freshman class would be only half as large as it is. There are five girls and one boy in our class who stay in the school dormitory. They stay there because they live so far away that it is impossible for them to be transported to and from school. They enjoy living on campus because they have nice rooms and congenial company and because by doing so it is possible for them to attend high school. For instance, Lois Starkey and Robert Walker who stay in the dormitory live in Laurel Lick, a little community about eleven miles from Gatlinburg. To reach their homes in Laurel Lick they ride by bus to Pigeon Forge and walk about four miles over a mountain trail across Pine Mountain. Jane Love's home is in Sevierville and she could have gone to Sevierville High School but Jane knew what the Pi Beta Phi High School was like so she decided to come here. I don't know how the others feel, but to me going to Pi Beta Phi High School is a privilege and an honor. Just look at the advantages we have. If it were not for the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity we would not have Mr. Jo hnson, the physical education director, who has given the school winning basketball teams this year andwho teaches every student physical education. They also give us Mrs. Armstrong, our music teacher, who not only teaches us all community singing but also directs a robed Glee Club made up of high school boys and girls who sing on many occasions and for various organizations. Alliene Barnes The school nurse, Mrs. Chalmers, is also given us by the Pi Phis and she helps keep us strong and healthy. Miss Petrie is our arts and crafts teacher and we all enjoy her and the work she is doing. I am thankful, too, that the Pi Beta Phis chose so interesting and beautiful a place as Gatlin-burg, in the midst of the Great Smokies, in which to locate their school. Studying, learning and playing in such beautiful surroundings and in such a good school helps us all, I am sure, to keep happy and interested in school. We as freshman, are looking forward to our next three years with much anticipation, for we know that our years in Pi Beta Phi High School will be the happiest of all our lives. SILLY SOPHOMORES GROWING UP By GERALDINE Fox Little thinking and I dare say, little caring about whether they came to school or not, be-cause after all it was lovely outside, the class of '49 first entered the portals of Pi Beta Phi High School. Just forty-three little freshmen against the world. They were ready and for the most willing, to begin their journey up the 462 THE MAY ARROW ladder of learning, as it is sometimes called. Now, I come to the more recent chapter of my story. When the sophomores came back to school in September, 1946, certain members of the class started progressing more. Everyone took more interest in his studies, although they Geraldine Fox still had a fine capacity for making noise. As in all classes, some people like one subject better than another. In the sophomore class this is especially pronounced. The one subject which is the general favorite is English, especially the study of literature. (The least said about grammar the better.) At the present time the class is reading A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. The twins of the class, Roy and Ralph Maples, have taken a decided interest in the story, going so far as to carve miniature figures from wood of a stage-coach, coachman, houses, a French revolutionist and a bloody guillotine. Billy Joe Gregg, an out of town boy who lives at the dormitory, and Calvin Barksdale, the vice-president of the class, have been very helpful in looking up the historical background of the story. We get loads of fun from the tactics of Jerry Cruncher and his spiky hair. And we find Dickens' twisted hints and complicated facts require not only a quick brain but a lot of studying also. Before we finish the story each member of the class is going to make a setting for a scene, a character, or a sketch of one character. The sophomores also enjoy the library very much. We have the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity to thank for many books and magazines to quenchthe reading thirst of many students. We not only have fiction, biographies, poetry, history, and philosophy in books but through the generous contributions of the Pi Phis we are building up a fine library of recordings. We also have in the library a selection of current magazines including Life; Science Digest, Collier's, Saturday Evening Post, and many others. We get a daily newspaper too and through these we learn of current events and thereby keep up with the world. We also have a file of Nature, National Georgraphic, Fortune, Travel, and Popular Science which we use for reference material in our various classes. Other gifts we received for Christmas besides. money were a new set of -World Book Encyclopedia and a 1947 Funk and Wagnall Unabridged Dictionary given by the Lions Club of Gatlinburg. Coming back to the sophomores I couldn't leave out the class officers. The class president is Faye Huskey, a very quiet, dignified girl who is very intelligent and studious. The vice-president, Calvin Barksdale, especially likes history. The secretary and treasurer are Grace Ogle and Lee Johnson, Jr. Grace is a tall, cool, freckle-faced girl, and Lee is a fresh, sun-shiney, per-son. Although perhaps some of the sophomores are careless and others thoughtless and not quite grown up yet, they are all glad of the opportunity to attend the Pi Beta Phi High School. JUNIOR CLASS, THEIR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE By BARBARA HUFF Being Juniors, we think the Junior Class is the best in the school, but we'll give you the facts ,and let you decide for yourself. As freshmen, the first important event, at least for the girls, was when they were invited to join the Home Economics Club. All the girls in the class entered enthusiastically into this activity. Initiation ceremonies got underway and the girls came to school dressed every way imaginable some had their hair braided in thirty or more pigtails, wore red flannel under-wear, short skirts, had painted faces, potato necklaces, alarm-clocks, chickens, dogs, cats, and many more amusing things. Then at night there was a judge and jury assigning each one some task to fulfill. Following this came a candle lighting ceremony after which the initiates were full fledged members of the Future Homemakers of America. Spring came and with it came "Field Day." That was something new but it was explained to us that all the classes picked teams and individuals to enter races, relays, broad jumps, high , Carvings made by, Roy and Ralph Maples, twins in the sophomore class. jumps, dart throwing, tug-o-war and other events. The big day came with the freshmen "rarin to go" and ended with many wins. Along came fall 1946 with a new name "juniors" which we like much better than the other two. The sponsor of the class is Mrs. Ann Wheeler Lighter ; president, Barbara Huff ; vice-president, Joe Howell ; secretary, Anna Mae Maples and treasurer, Louise Cole. This year Roberta Bell, junior, is president of the F. H. A. Club and at a sub:district meeting another junior, Dot Miller, won distinction when she was elected news reporter for the whole district. A Y-Teen Club has been organized in our high school. Miss Helen Borgstrom is the sponsor three junior girls, Louise Cole, Dot Miller and Barbara Huff are officers in this group. "The National Beta Club," a national honor society, was also organized, only students with an average above ninety who are approved by the prin'cipal are eligible. In the present membership of the club seven out of the nine members are Juniors and there are more Juniors now eligible for membership. In the Junior Class there were only two people who failed one subject last semester which was the best record in the whole school. The Junior Class also had a bigger percentage on the honor roll than any other class. This year our class has had to think more about raising money for in the spring the Juniors are to give the Seniors a formal banquet at one of the hotels. Then next year the class hopes to go on a class trip to California. The first thing the Juniors did to earn money for their treasury was to have an old fashioned "Pie and Box Supper." Everyone came and had a wonderful time and after it was over the Juniors counted the proceeds and found they were richer by $133.00. We, the Junior Class, are sure we express thefeelings of all of the students when we tell you the Pi Phis, how, much we appreciate all that you have done and are doing for us. This school has given us an opportunity to get the education we need in order to go to college or whatever we plan to do. The music department is teaching us the appreciation of good music, the physical education activities are teaching us good sportsmanship and are helping us to be healthier boys and girls. The arts and crafts department is teaching us how to make our hands useful and the ones who don't enjoy academic subjects so much can learn to use their hands. All the other studies also help us immensely. We want to express our thanks to you for the wonderful work you have done and are still doing. Barbara Huff 464 THE MAY ARROW Seniors: Reading from Left to Right first row: Earl Oakley, Myrtle Whaley, Juanita Wilson, Lonnie Trent-ham. Second row: James B. Parton, Jonnie Maples, Eva Ogle, Hoover Cardwell. Third row: Roy Ogle, Louise .McCarter, Joann Parton, Harmon McCarter. THE SENIOR CLASS By JUANITA WILSON Four years ago thirty-one Freshmen entered Pi Beta Phi High School, and today only twelve of us remain. Various things have happened to the others the war took some, many moved away because of the war, two were married, and some have gone to other schools. Those of us who are left are very proud of the fact that soon we will be Pi Beta Phi graduates, and can take our place in the world as more capable men and women because of it. There are some out-standing students in the class and we are sure that they will make an important name for themselves in whatever field of endeavor they choose. The president of our class, Jim Parton, is one of the most likeable and capable students in school. He has been in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for six years and has been gaining in popularity each year. We feel sure Duke University will be proud to welcome him this fall when he enters to study journalism. Earl Oakley, our vice-president has attended school here since he was a tiny blond-headedboy in the beginner's class, and there isn't any-one in the class as' proud of the school as Earl is. He is especially good in science..Recently he has been nominated for the Beta Club, a National Honor society. Earl's father is the Mayor of Gatlinburg and has been an active member of the county school board. With Earl's excellent speaking voice as well as his many other out-standing qualities we wouldn't be surprised if someday he will be elected to Congress, or some other high office. This fall he plans to enter Tusculum College at Greenville, Tennessee. Jonnie Maples, our secretary and treasurer is one of the most popular girls in town. Last year she was elected the best all around girl in school. She is active in club work and in all sports. Jonnie went to school for two years in North Carolina, but she still prefers Pi Beta Phi and was glad to come back. The cheer leaders in North Carolina had been especially interesting to her, and upon her return to Gatlinburg she organized a group of cheer leaders here. They did a grand job last year, and are doing an even better one this year. In college she is going to study business administration and hopes some-day to have a business of her own in Gatlinburg. Louise McCarter was our class president last year and was selected as the best all around girl when she was a sophomore. She has been on the basketball team for four years and is the co-captain this year. Miss Elizabeth Petrie is well pleased with the excellent work she does in crafts and she is also a very outstanding mathematics student. She is an active member of the Glee Club as well as most of the other clubs in school. This fall she will enter Lincoln Memorial University where she will study business administration and where she hopes to get her Master's degree in mathematics. Harmon McCarter, the only veteran in our school,. spent two and a half years in the United States Navy, most of this time being spent in the South Pacific. Despite the fact that he was out of school for over two years he is doing very well in his class work, and is an excellent for-ward on the basketball team. This fall he plans to enter the University of Tennessee. Roy Ogle is another boy who has gone to Pi Beta Phi ever since he started to school. He has been in a number of plays in high school and is one of the most popular players on the basket-ball team. He is also very popular among the girls as he is one of the handsomest boys in school. Roy has not decided what he will do yet, but we hope he will enter a university this fall. Joanna Parton is one of the prettiest girls in school as well as the sister of our class president. She is a good singer and is especially interested in the arts and crafts class. This fall she is going THE MAY ARROW 465 to art school to study commercial art. She has been an efficient member of the student council and has been active in the other activities in which she has participated. Lonnie Trentham is another basketball star,, and is much in demand in all the social affairs in school as he is always the "life of the party." Myrtle Whaley is another member of our class who has been selected as the best all round girl in the school, and she has also won the scholarship award. We are very proud of Myrtle because she was brave enough to come back to finish school after being out for four years. Myrtle has always been on the school honor roll and is now a member of the Beta Club. She plans to take a business course after graduation. Hoover Cardwell is one of our most popular boys and he always has many original ideas of his own. He has done very well in the wood-working class, which seems to be his favorite. This fall he will enter the University of Tennessee. Eva Ogle is very much interested in the Home Economics class and plans to go on with her study of foods at Austin Peay College in Nash-ville this fall. Eva is a sweet, comical little person and has been the originator of many a prank during our years together, but she has always remained an honor roll student. Eva and I are especially good friends because we both live in the school dormitory. Here we have spent many happy days, and we feel that we have a definite advantage over the other students who do not live on campus. It is just like being in a big family. We deeply appreciate being able to live in the dormitory and shall always be grateful to the Pi Phis for giving us such a nice place in which to live and work. In a few months we will all be leaving high school to go our separate ways in the world. I know that we will always have very happy memories of school days and be very grateful to our fine teachers for their help. We are also deeply indebted to the Pi Phis for making it possible for us to have extra subjects such as crafts, music, and physical education. Every member of the Senior Class is thankful for these extra opportunities for study and enjoyment and wish to express their deep appreciation. Music in the Mountains By ALETHA MAY ARMSTRONG, Director of Public School Music, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee Our mountains are like the thrilling music of a mighty organ. Along the Potomac the melody starts faintly as the Master Organist presses the stop dulciana and the-cadence falls over the softly rolling hills of Kentucky. In the Virginia uplands the harmony grows in volume and tempo quickens, reaching a soaring crescendo in Tennessee and North Carolina. There, the organist pulls out the diapason on the great organ as the towering Smokies push their peaks into the very face of the sun. The music lessens to diminuendo among the pastel beauties of the Blue Ridge and, reaching Alabama and Georgia, the vox humana sings its nostalgic theme, dying away as the echo organ is heard. So is there music in the souls and in the voices of our Southern mountain people. Among the elders, the speaking voice is often plaintively sweet, pitched in minor key, but among the younger ones, soft and melodious often with a lilt seldom heard elsewhere. We assume an inherent love of music in every normal child and along with it some instinct for its expression. But here in the mountains, where for so long music represented not only a means of emotional expression but recreation in an area isolated from the outer world, Youth gives an even readier response to music. It has been said that in the field of music, theSouthern Mountaineer has made his greatest contribution, as he has kept alive the Anglo-American ballad, carol, and folk-song. So it seems especially imperative that our present generation shall know, value, and perpetuate these noble songs. Remember, however, that there is a vast difference between these folk-songs, whose excel-lent tunes and powerful poetic verses have proved their worth, and the so-called "hill-billy" songs which dominate many programs. Exposed daily to these inferior artificial musical impressions, the young people, naturally rhythmic and music-loving, are fearfully well informed of the former but are sadly ignorant of the beautiful songs which are their real treasures. In our major effort to help our students re-gain their rightful heritage, we have found the glorious-toned Majestic radio-phonograph com bination given by the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, an indispensable ally. Here we can acquaint them with the melody, the appeal of folk-songs. Here the songs are beautifully and correctly sung. As they play the record again and again the youngsters begin to sing along. We believe any child can be taught to sing by ear, just as he is taught to speak, and can later on be taught to read music as it is presented by way of the songbook. 466 THE MAY. ARROW Especially with the Stephen Foster Album, we have by means of records so quickened interest that our pupils not only love to sing the songs, but turn to the better radio programs in order to report their use. In addition, interest in Foster's song and life has inspired original projects in several elementary grades. The older boys have proved very difficult in the matter of enlisting in chorus work. We have found that recordings of fine male choruses have done much to dispel the legend that "singing is sissy." In one class where the boys refused to sing, we hit upon the idea of a class song. We, collectively, wrote the lyrics, extolling the merits of a really fine basketball team. It worked like magic and lusty male participation proved that a move toward the joy of singing had been made. In the accompanying group picture the elementary grade has been studying a recording of a two-part arrangement of "Home Sweet Home." They first listened to the pleasing effect of two soft, sweet voices. Then they studied the relation of the two voices, finally singing along with the soprano and then the alto voice. This method is of invaluable aid for here unison singing is universally practiced, (although when I first came it was boasted that they had quartettes even an octette which I discovered to mean four or eight people stood together and sang the same part) . This class, by the way, was the very first to do two-part singing and actually read notes of the two parts. Their singing of old French carols was an outstanding achievement of the Christmas program. In our mass-singing among the High School group, we use many of the better popular songs and are elated to find more and more of the pupils entering in with enthusiasm. One of the most popular scores is the "Oklahoma" album with its many hit tunes. Several such albumshave been presented as memorial gifts, from friends among the Pi Phis and we can assure you they are being used to excellent advantage. Truly the rich-toned Majestic Phonograph is proving a tremendous help as we crusade in be-half of these objectives of the Music department: To give these wonderfully-endowed students the emotional lift, the enjoyment that music provides. To enable them to use their voices correctly, developing them, safe-guarding them into maturity. To give an opportunity for self-expression and an outlet for the creative urge. To gain ability to read music, and discrimination that the pupil may be independent in selection. Finally to promote the feeling of co-operation and service through group activity, and the contribution of skill to be enjoyed in home, church and community. This last aim is being realized increasingly. The elementary chorus has made several appearances, singing for P.T.A. meetings and for the school Open House program. The various groups are often presented at the Weavers' meetings while the Glee Club has sung at many community gatherings at Thanksgiving services, at various churches. In no small way do our students aid the local church choirs and several are now being coached to do solo work. Together we are striving to make our community GOOD MUSIC conscious and aware of that vast and noble treasure they possess, and of which the bard sings "That old and antique song we heard last night; Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times." Shakespeare Mrs. Armstrong and Music Class Showing Majestic Phonograph Purchased with Money from the Memorial Fund. This is the first class to sing two part songs.

Billy Joe Gregg, an out of town boy who lives at the dormitory, and Calvin Barksdale, the vice-president of the class, have been very helpful in looking up the historical background of the story. We get loads of fun from the tactics of Jerry Cruncher and his spiky hair. And we find Dickens' twisted hints and complicated facts require not only a quick brain but a lot of studying also.

We also have in the library a selection of current magazines including Life; Science Digest, Collier's, Saturday Evening Post, and many others. We get a daily newspaper too and through these we learn of current events and thereby keep up with the world. We also have a file of Nature, National Georgraphic, Fortune, Travel, and Popular Science which we use for reference material in our various classes. Other gifts we received for Christmas besides. money were a new set of -World Book Encyclopedia and a 1947 Funk and Wagnall Unabridged Dictionary given by the Lions Club of Gatlinburg. Coming back to the sophomores I couldn't leave out the class officers. The class president is Faye Huskey, a very quiet, dignified girl who is very intelligent and studious. The vice-president, Calvin Barksdale, especially likes history. The secretary and treasurer are Grace Ogle and Lee Johnson, Jr. Grace is a tall, cool, freckle-faced girl, and Lee is a fresh, sun-shiney, per-son. Although perhaps some of the sophomores are careless and others thoughtless and not quite grown up yet, they are all glad of the opportunity to attend the Pi Beta Phi High School. JUNIOR CLASS, THEIR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE By BARBARA HUFF Being Juniors, we think the Junior Class is the best in the school, but we'll give you the facts ,and let you decide for yourself. As freshmen, the first important event, at least for the girls, was when they were invited to join the Home Economics Club. All the girls in the class entered enthusiastically into this activity. Initiation ceremonies got underway and the girls came to school dressed every way imaginable some had their hair braided in thirty or more pigtails, wore red flannel under-wear, short skirts, had painted faces, potato necklaces, alarm-clocks, chickens, dogs, cats, and many more amusing things. Then at night there was a judge and jury assigning each one some task to fulfill. Following this came a candle lighting ceremony after which the initiates were full fledged members of the Future Homemakers of America. Spring came and with it came "Field Day." That was something new but it was explained to us that all the classes picked teams and individuals to enter races, relays, broad jumps, high , Carvings made by, Roy and Ralph Maples, twins in the sophomore class. jumps, dart throwing, tug-o-war and other events. The big day came with the freshmen "rarin to go" and ended with many wins. Along came fall 1946 with a new name "juniors" which we like much better than the other two. The sponsor of the class is Mrs. Ann Wheeler Lighter ; president, Barbara Huff ; vice-president, Joe Howell ; secretary, Anna Mae Maples and treasurer, Louise Cole. This year Roberta Bell, junior, is president of the F. H. A. Club and at a sub:district meeting another junior, Dot Miller, won distinction when she was elected news reporter for the whole district. A Y-Teen Club has been organized in our high school. Miss Helen Borgstrom is the sponsor three junior girls, Louise Cole, Dot Miller and Barbara Huff are officers in this group. "The National Beta Club," a national honor society, was also organized, only students with an average above ninety who are approved by the prin'cipal are eligible. In the present membership of the club seven out of the nine members are Juniors and there are more Juniors now eligible for membership. In the Junior Class there were only two people who failed one subject last semester which was the best record in the whole school. The Junior Class also had a bigger percentage on the honor roll than any other class. This year our class has had to think more about raising money for in the spring the Juniors are to give the Seniors a formal banquet at one of the hotels. Then next year the class hopes to go on a class trip to California. The first thing the Juniors did to earn money for their treasury was to have an old fashioned "Pie and Box Supper." Everyone came and had a wonderful time and after it was over the Juniors counted the proceeds and found they were richer by $133.00. We, the Junior Class, are sure we express thefeelings of all of the students when we tell you the Pi Phis, how, much we appreciate all that you have done and are doing for us. This school has given us an opportunity to get the education we need in order to go to college or whatever we plan to do. The music department is teaching us the appreciation of good music, the physical education activities are teaching us good sportsmanship and are helping us to be healthier boys and girls. The arts and crafts department is teaching us how to make our hands useful and the ones who don't enjoy academic subjects so much can learn to use their hands. All the other studies also help us immensely. We want to express our thanks to you for the wonderful work you have done and are still doing.

THE SENIOR CLASS By JUANITA WILSON Four years ago thirty-one Freshmen entered Pi Beta Phi High School, and today only twelve of us remain. Various things have happened to the others the war took some, many moved away because of the war, two were married, and some have gone to other schools. Those of us who are left are very proud of the fact that soon we will be Pi Beta Phi graduates, and can take our place in the world as more capable men and women because of it. There are some out-standing students in the class and we are sure that they will make an important name for themselves in whatever field of endeavor they choose. The president of our class, Jim Parton, is one of the most likeable and capable students in school. He has been in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for six years and has been gaining in popularity each year. We feel sure Duke University will be proud to welcome him this fall when he enters to study journalism. Earl Oakley, our vice-president has attended school here since he was a tiny blond-headedboy in the beginner's class, and there isn't any-one in the class as' proud of the school as Earl is. He is especially good in science..Recently he has been nominated for the Beta Club, a National Honor society. Earl's father is the Mayor of Gatlinburg and has been an active member of the county school board. With Earl's excellent speaking voice as well as his many other out-standing qualities we wouldn't be surprised if someday he will be elected to Congress, or some other high office. This fall he plans to enter Tusculum College at Greenville, Tennessee. Jonnie Maples, our secretary and treasurer is one of the most popular girls in town. Last year she was elected the best all around girl in school. She is active in club work and in all sports. Jonnie went to school for two years in North Carolina, but she still prefers Pi Beta Phi and was glad to come back. The cheer leaders in North Carolina had been especially interesting to her, and upon her return to Gatlinburg she organized a group of cheer leaders here. They did a grand job last year, and are doing an even better one this year. In college she is going to study business administration and hopes some-day to have a business of her own in Gatlinburg. Louise McCarter was our class president last year and was selected as the best all around girl when she was a sophomore. She has been on the basketball team for four years and is the co-captain this year. Miss Elizabeth Petrie is well pleased with the excellent work she does in crafts and she is also a very outstanding mathematics student. She is an active member of the Glee Club as well as most of the other clubs in school. This fall she will enter Lincoln Memorial University where she will study business administration and where she hopes to get her Master's degree in mathematics. Harmon McCarter, the only veteran in our school,. spent two and a half years in the United States Navy, most of this time being spent in the South Pacific. Despite the fact that he was out of school for over two years he is doing very well in his class work, and is an excellent for-ward on the basketball team. This fall he plans to enter the University of Tennessee. Roy Ogle is another boy who has gone to Pi Beta Phi ever since he started to school. He has been in a number of plays in high school and is one of the most popular players on the basket-ball team. He is also very popular among the girls as he is one of the handsomest boys in school. Roy has not decided what he will do yet, but we hope he will enter a university this fall. Joanna Parton is one of the prettiest girls in school as well as the sister of our class president. She is a good singer and is especially interested in the arts and crafts class. This fall she is going THE MAY ARROW 465 to art school to study commercial art. She has been an efficient member of the student council and has been active in the other activities in which she has participated. Lonnie Trentham is another basketball star,, and is much in demand in all the social affairs in school as he is always the "life of the party." Myrtle Whaley is another member of our class who has been selected as the best all round girl in the school, and she has also won the scholarship award. We are very proud of Myrtle because she was brave enough to come back to finish school after being out for four years. Myrtle has always been on the school honor roll and is now a member of the Beta Club. She plans to take a business course after graduation. Hoover Cardwell is one of our most popular boys and he always has many original ideas of his own. He has done very well in the wood-working class, which seems to be his favorite. This fall he will enter the University of Tennessee. Eva Ogle is very much interested in the Home Economics class and plans to go on with her study of foods at Austin Peay College in Nash-ville this fall. Eva is a sweet, comical little person and has been the originator of many a prank during our years together, but she has always remained an honor roll student. Eva and I are especially good friends because we both live in the school dormitory. Here we have spent many happy days, and we feel that we have a definite advantage over the other students who do not live on campus. It is just like being in a big family. We deeply appreciate being able to live in the dormitory and shall always be grateful to the Pi Phis for giving us such a nice place in which to live and work. In a few months we will all be leaving high school to go our separate ways in the world. I know that we will always have very happy memories of school days and be very grateful to our fine teachers for their help. We are also deeply indebted to the Pi Phis for making it possible for us to have extra subjects such as crafts, music, and physical education. Every member of the Senior Class is thankful for these extra opportunities for study and enjoyment and wish to express their deep appreciation. Music in the Mountains By ALETHA MAY ARMSTRONG, Director of Public School Music, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee Our mountains are like the thrilling music of a mighty organ. Along the Potomac the melody starts faintly as the Master Organist presses the stop dulciana and the-cadence falls over the softly rolling hills of Kentucky. In the Virginia uplands the harmony grows in volume and tempo quickens, reaching a soaring crescendo in Tennessee and North Carolina. There, the organist pulls out the diapason on the great organ as the towering Smokies push their peaks into the very face of the sun. The music lessens to diminuendo among the pastel beauties of the Blue Ridge and, reaching Alabama and Georgia, the vox humana sings its nostalgic theme, dying away as the echo organ is heard. So is there music in the souls and in the voices of our Southern mountain people. Among the elders, the speaking voice is often plaintively sweet, pitched in minor key, but among the younger ones, soft and melodious often with a lilt seldom heard elsewhere. We assume an inherent love of music in every normal child and along with it some instinct for its expression. But here in the mountains, where for so long music represented not only a means of emotional expression but recreation in an area isolated from the outer world, Youth gives an even readier response to music. It has been said that in the field of music, theSouthern Mountaineer has made his greatest contribution, as he has kept alive the Anglo-American ballad, carol, and folk-song. So it seems especially imperative that our present generation shall know, value, and perpetuate these noble songs. Remember, however, that there is a vast difference between these folk-songs, whose excel-lent tunes and powerful poetic verses have proved their worth, and the so-called "hill-billy" songs which dominate many programs. Exposed daily to these inferior artificial musical impressions, the young people, naturally rhythmic and music-loving, are fearfully well informed of the former but are sadly ignorant of the beautiful songs which are their real treasures. In our major effort to help our students re-gain their rightful heritage, we have found the glorious-toned Majestic radio-phonograph com bination given by the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, an indispensable ally. Here we can acquaint them with the melody, the appeal of folk-songs. Here the songs are beautifully and correctly sung. As they play the record again and again the youngsters begin to sing along. We believe any child can be taught to sing by ear, just as he is taught to speak, and can later on be taught to read music as it is presented by way of the songbook. 466 THE MAY. ARROW Especially with the Stephen Foster Album, we have by means of records so quickened interest that our pupils not only love to sing the songs, but turn to the better radio programs in order to report their use. In addition, interest in Foster's song and life has inspired original projects in several elementary grades. The older boys have proved very difficult in the matter of enlisting in chorus work. We have found that recordings of fine male choruses have done much to dispel the legend that "singing is sissy." In one class where the boys refused to sing, we hit upon the idea of a class song. We, collectively, wrote the lyrics, extolling the merits of a really fine basketball team. It worked like magic and lusty male participation proved that a move toward the joy of singing had been made. In the accompanying group picture the elementary grade has been studying a recording of a two-part arrangement of "Home Sweet Home." They first listened to the pleasing effect of two soft, sweet voices. Then they studied the relation of the two voices, finally singing along with the soprano and then the alto voice. This method is of invaluable aid for here unison singing is universally practiced, (although when I first came it was boasted that they had quartettes even an octette which I discovered to mean four or eight people stood together and sang the same part) . This class, by the way, was the very first to do two-part singing and actually read notes of the two parts. Their singing of old French carols was an outstanding achievement of the Christmas program. In our mass-singing among the High School group, we use many of the better popular songs and are elated to find more and more of the pupils entering in with enthusiasm. One of the most popular scores is the "Oklahoma" album with its many hit tunes. Several such albumshave been presented as memorial gifts, from friends among the Pi Phis and we can assure you they are being used to excellent advantage. Truly the rich-toned Majestic Phonograph is proving a tremendous help as we crusade in be-half of these objectives of the Music department: To give these wonderfully-endowed students the emotional lift, the enjoyment that music provides. To enable them to use their voices correctly, developing them, safe-guarding them into maturity. To give an opportunity for self-expression and an outlet for the creative urge. To gain ability to read music, and discrimination that the pupil may be independent in selection. Finally to promote the feeling of co-operation and service through group activity, and the contribution of skill to be enjoyed in home, church and community. This last aim is being realized increasingly. The elementary chorus has made several appearances, singing for P.T.A. meetings and for the school Open House program. The various groups are often presented at the Weavers' meetings while the Glee Club has sung at many community gatherings at Thanksgiving services, at various churches. In no small way do our students aid the local church choirs and several are now being coached to do solo work. Together we are striving to make our community GOOD MUSIC conscious and aware of that vast and noble treasure they possess, and of which the bard sings "That old and antique song we heard last night; Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times."

        466 THE MAY. ARROW Especially with the Stephen Foster Album, we have by means of records so quickened interest that our pupils not only love to sing the songs, but turn to the better radio programs in order to report their use. In addition, interest in Foster's song and life has inspired original projects in several elementary grades. The older boys have proved very difficult in the matter of enlisting in chorus work. We have found that recordings of fine male choruses have done much to dispel the legend that "singing is sissy." In one class where the boys refused to sing, we hit upon the idea of a class song. We, collectively, wrote the lyrics, extolling the merits of a really fine basketball team. It worked like magic and lusty male participation proved that a move toward the joy of singing had been made. In the accompanying group picture the elementary grade has been studying a recording of a two-part arrangement of "Home Sweet Home." They first listened to the pleasing effect of two soft, sweet voices. Then they studied the relation of the two voices, finally singing along with the soprano and then the alto voice. This method is of invaluable aid for here unison singing is universally practiced, (although when I first came it was boasted that they had quartettes even an octette which I discovered to mean four or eight people stood together and sang the same part) . This class, by the way, was the very first to do two-part singing and actually read notes of the two parts. Their singing of old French carols was an outstanding achievement of the Christmas program. In our mass-singing among the High School group, we use many of the better popular songs and are elated to find more and more of the pupils entering in with enthusiasm. One of the most popular scores is the "Oklahoma" album with its many hit tunes. Several such albumshave been presented as memorial gifts, from friends among the Pi Phis and we can assure you they are being used to excellent advantage. Truly the rich-toned Majestic Phonograph is proving a tremendous help as we crusade in be-half of these objectives of the Music department: To give these wonderfully-endowed students the emotional lift, the enjoyment that music provides. To enable them to use their voices correctly, developing them, safe-guarding them into maturity. To give an opportunity for self-expression and an outlet for the creative urge. To gain ability to read music, and discrimination that the pupil may be independent in selection. Finally to promote the feeling of co-operation and service through group activity, and the contribution of skill to be enjoyed in home, church and community. This last aim is being realized increasingly. The elementary chorus has made several appearances, singing for P.T.A. meetings and for the school Open House program. The various groups are often presented at the Weavers' meetings while the Glee Club has sung at many community gatherings at Thanksgiving services, at various churches. In no small way do our students aid the local church choirs and several are now being coached to do solo work.

Her gracious charm, ability in managing the School, and devotion to Pi Beta Phi will be long remembered by all those who were privileged to know her. The Children Speak from the Pi Beta Phi School in the Great Smokies By ANN LIGHTER, Librarian and Teacher of English The students of Pi Beta Phi High School are always glad to tell interested listeners about their classes, their extra-curricular activities, their hopes and_ aspirations. And they particularly appreciate the opportunity to tell the Pi Beta Phis throughout the land, of the ad-vantages they enjoy at Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. These one hundred and eleven boys and girls in high school are no different than those you find most anywhere in these United States except that they have been blessed with the privilege and opportunity of being a part of the evolution of the original dream of the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. And now a few facts and figures about the authors of the articles written about each of the four classes in high school. Alliene Barnes is the president of the fresh-man class and one of the most promising students in the school. She is a shy, quiet little girl who is well liked by her teacher and class-mates. She is a member of the Beta Club-National Honor Society. Alliene lives in Pigeon Forge, a small town about seven miles from Gatlinburg and comes to school every day on the school bus. She is the oldest of five children. Her father is a real estate agent in Gatlinburg. Geraldine Fox, our sophomore, comes to Pi Beta Phi from Chestnut Hill, a community about thirty miles from Gatlinburg. Because of the distance from their home, Gerry and her brother, Jack, live at the school dormitory. Gerry, a bright-eyed, alert girl of fourteen years, is an honor student and an avid reader. Most of her leisure time is spent in reading and as a result she has an exceptional vocabularyand knowledge of good books. Gerry has not chosen her college and has not decided on her future occupation as yet, but wants to be a librarian, teacher or singer. The author of the article on the active junior class, Barbara Huff, is the daughter of a Pi Beta Phi Henrietta McCutchan Huff. She has one brother and three sisters, one of whom is, at the time of this writing, just a few days old. Barbara's mother and father own the Huff Tourist Cabins in Gatlinburg and are active in school and community projects. Barbara is a typical teen-ager and one of the most capable students in our high school as is evidenced by her many activities. She plays on the girls' basketball team, is a cheer leader, a member of the Y-Teen Club, Beta Club, Home Ec Club and president of the Junior Class. Our senior, Juanita Wilson, is an honor student, an attractive girl and is very popular with the students and the faculty. Juanita's home is on a farm in the Glades, a few miles from Gatlinburg, and she has lived at the school dormitory for most of her four years in high school. Because of her high marks and her. personality Juanita has been given a scholarship to the Andrew Jackson Business College in Nashville. She hopes to be able to continue her academic education at a university after finishing the secretarial course, THE CLASS OF 1950 By ALLIENE BARNES The Freshman class of the Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlinburg, Tennessee is made up of 460 THE MAY ARROW 461 forty-four students twenty-one boys and twenty-three girls. We have the same number of students now that we had at the beginning of this term, as we lost two boys and added two girls. We have the largest class in the school and we hope we will have forty-four in the 1950 graduating class. About half of our class come from small country schools in nearby communities. Nina Sue McCarter, Stella Ownby, Ray Dodgen, Jimmy Moore, and Faye and Ray King, the twins of our class, and Betty June Carr, an honor roll student, come from Banner, a little rural community near Gatlinburg and all of these students come to school by bus. Joyce McCarter, Mary Newman, Betty Cantrell, Bobby Conner, and Jack Grooms live in the Glades, a settlement near Gatlinburg. A "glade," as you know, is a clearing or an open space in the woods and that is just what the "Glades" is. Junior Ogle, along with Wanda, Huskey, comes from Carter Town, located between Gatlinburg and the Glades. Mildred Ward and Charles Maples come from Pigeon Forge, a village half-way between Gatlinburg and Sevierville. Pauline Whaley who comes from Caney Creek School, recently moved to Gatlinburg. Jean Huskey comes from Wears Valley, a typical mountain community located in a valley with high mountains completely hemming it in. Bertha Marine, another of our honor roll students, comes from Laurel Lick. Without these students from other schools the freshman class would be only half as large as it is. There are five girls and one boy in our class who stay in the school dormitory. They stay there because they live so far away that it is impossible for them to be transported to and from school. They enjoy living on campus because they have nice rooms and congenial company and because by doing so it is possible for them to attend high school. For instance, Lois Starkey and Robert Walker who stay in the dormitory live in Laurel Lick, a little community about eleven miles from Gatlinburg. To reach their homes in Laurel Lick they ride by bus to Pigeon Forge and walk about four miles over a mountain trail across Pine Mountain. Jane Love's home is in Sevierville and she could have gone to Sevierville High School but Jane knew what the Pi Beta Phi High School was like so she decided to come here. I don't know how the others feel, but to me going to Pi Beta Phi High School is a privilege and an honor. Just look at the advantages we have. If it were not for the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity we would not have Mr. Jo hnson, the physical education director, who has given the school winning basketball teams this year andwho teaches every student physical education. They also give us Mrs. Armstrong, our music teacher, who not only teaches us all community singing but also directs a robed Glee Club made up of high school boys and girls who sing on many occasions and for various organizations. Alliene Barnes The school nurse, Mrs. Chalmers, is also given us by the Pi Phis and she helps keep us strong and healthy. Miss Petrie is our arts and crafts teacher and we all enjoy her and the work she is doing. I am thankful, too, that the Pi Beta Phis chose so interesting and beautiful a place as Gatlin-burg, in the midst of the Great Smokies, in which to locate their school. Studying, learning and playing in such beautiful surroundings and in such a good school helps us all, I am sure, to keep happy and interested in school. We as freshman, are looking forward to our next three years with much anticipation, for we know that our years in Pi Beta Phi High School will be the happiest of all our lives. SILLY SOPHOMORES GROWING UP By GERALDINE Fox Little thinking and I dare say, little caring about whether they came to school or not, be-cause after all it was lovely outside, the class of '49 first entered the portals of Pi Beta Phi High School. Just forty-three little freshmen against the world. They were ready and for the most willing, to begin their journey up the 462 THE MAY ARROW ladder of learning, as it is sometimes called. Now, I come to the more recent chapter of my story. When the sophomores came back to school in September, 1946, certain members of the class started progressing more. Everyone took more interest in his studies, although they Geraldine Fox still had a fine capacity for making noise. As in all classes, some people like one subject better than another. In the sophomore class this is especially pronounced. The one subject which is the general favorite is English, especially the study of literature. (The least said about grammar the better.) At the present time the class is reading A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. The twins of the class, Roy and Ralph Maples, have taken a decided interest in the story, going so far as to carve miniature figures from wood of a stage-coach, coachman, houses, a French revolutionist and a bloody guillotine. Billy Joe Gregg, an out of town boy who lives at the dormitory, and Calvin Barksdale, the vice-president of the class, have been very helpful in looking up the historical background of the story. We get loads of fun from the tactics of Jerry Cruncher and his spiky hair. And we find Dickens' twisted hints and complicated facts require not only a quick brain but a lot of studying also. Before we finish the story each member of the class is going to make a setting for a scene, a character, or a sketch of one character. The sophomores also enjoy the library very much. We have the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity to thank for many books and magazines to quenchthe reading thirst of many students. We not only have fiction, biographies, poetry, history, and philosophy in books but through the generous contributions of the Pi Phis we are building up a fine library of recordings. We also have in the library a selection of current magazines including Life; Science Digest, Collier's, Saturday Evening Post, and many others. We get a daily newspaper too and through these we learn of current events and thereby keep up with the world. We also have a file of Nature, National Georgraphic, Fortune, Travel, and Popular Science which we use for reference material in our various classes. Other gifts we received for Christmas besides. money were a new set of -World Book Encyclopedia and a 1947 Funk and Wagnall Unabridged Dictionary given by the Lions Club of Gatlinburg. Coming back to the sophomores I couldn't leave out the class officers. The class president is Faye Huskey, a very quiet, dignified girl who is very intelligent and studious. The vice-president, Calvin Barksdale, especially likes history. The secretary and treasurer are Grace Ogle and Lee Johnson, Jr. Grace is a tall, cool, freckle-faced girl, and Lee is a fresh, sun-shiney, per-son. Although perhaps some of the sophomores are careless and others thoughtless and not quite grown up yet, they are all glad of the opportunity to attend the Pi Beta Phi High School. JUNIOR CLASS, THEIR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE By BARBARA HUFF Being Juniors, we think the Junior Class is the best in the school, but we'll give you the facts ,and let you decide for yourself. As freshmen, the first important event, at least for the girls, was when they were invited to join the Home Economics Club. All the girls in the class entered enthusiastically into this activity. Initiation ceremonies got underway and the girls came to school dressed every way imaginable some had their hair braided in thirty or more pigtails, wore red flannel under-wear, short skirts, had painted faces, potato necklaces, alarm-clocks, chickens, dogs, cats, and many more amusing things. Then at night there was a judge and jury assigning each one some task to fulfill. Following this came a candle lighting ceremony after which the initiates were full fledged members of the Future Homemakers of America. Spring came and with it came "Field Day." That was something new but it was explained to us that all the classes picked teams and individuals to enter races, relays, broad jumps, high , Carvings made by, Roy and Ralph Maples, twins in the sophomore class. jumps, dart throwing, tug-o-war and other events. The big day came with the freshmen "rarin to go" and ended with many wins. Along came fall 1946 with a new name "juniors" which we like much better than the other two. The sponsor of the class is Mrs. Ann Wheeler Lighter ; president, Barbara Huff ; vice-president, Joe Howell ; secretary, Anna Mae Maples and treasurer, Louise Cole. This year Roberta Bell, junior, is president of the F. H. A. Club and at a sub:district meeting another junior, Dot Miller, won distinction when she was elected news reporter for the whole district. A Y-Teen Club has been organized in our high school. Miss Helen Borgstrom is the sponsor three junior girls, Louise Cole, Dot Miller and Barbara Huff are officers in this group. "The National Beta Club," a national honor society, was also organized, only students with an average above ninety who are approved by the prin'cipal are eligible. In the present membership of the club seven out of the nine members are Juniors and there are more Juniors now eligible for membership. In the Junior Class there were only two people who failed one subject last semester which was the best record in the whole school. The Junior Class also had a bigger percentage on the honor roll than any other class. This year our class has had to think more about raising money for in the spring the Juniors are to give the Seniors a formal banquet at one of the hotels. Then next year the class hopes to go on a class trip to California. The first thing the Juniors did to earn money for their treasury was to have an old fashioned "Pie and Box Supper." Everyone came and had a wonderful time and after it was over the Juniors counted the proceeds and found they were richer by $133.00. We, the Junior Class, are sure we express thefeelings of all of the students when we tell you the Pi Phis, how, much we appreciate all that you have done and are doing for us. This school has given us an opportunity to get the education we need in order to go to college or whatever we plan to do. The music department is teaching us the appreciation of good music, the physical education activities are teaching us good sportsmanship and are helping us to be healthier boys and girls. The arts and crafts department is teaching us how to make our hands useful and the ones who don't enjoy academic subjects so much can learn to use their hands. All the other studies also help us immensely. We want to express our thanks to you for the wonderful work you have done and are still doing.

THE SENIOR CLASS By JUANITA WILSON Four years ago thirty-one Freshmen entered Pi Beta Phi High School, and today only twelve of us remain. Various things have happened to the others the war took some, many moved away because of the war, two were married, and some have gone to other schools. Those of us who are left are very proud of the fact that soon we will be Pi Beta Phi graduates, and can take our place in the world as more capable men and women because of it. There are some out-standing students in the class and we are sure that they will make an important name for themselves in whatever field of endeavor they choose. The president of our class, Jim Parton, is one of the most likeable and capable students in school. He has been in the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for six years and has been gaining in popularity each year. We feel sure Duke University will be proud to welcome him this fall when he enters to study journalism. Earl Oakley, our vice-president has attended school here since he was a tiny blond-headedboy in the beginner's class, and there isn't any-one in the class as' proud of the school as Earl is. He is especially good in science..Recently he has been nominated for the Beta Club, a National Honor society. Earl's father is the Mayor of Gatlinburg and has been an active member of the county school board. With Earl's excellent speaking voice as well as his many other out-standing qualities we wouldn't be surprised if someday he will be elected to Congress, or some other high office. This fall he plans to enter Tusculum College at Greenville, Tennessee. Jonnie Maples, our secretary and treasurer is one of the most popular girls in town. Last year she was elected the best all around girl in school. She is active in club work and in all sports. Jonnie went to school for two years in North Carolina, but she still prefers Pi Beta Phi and was glad to come back. The cheer leaders in North Carolina had been especially interesting to her, and upon her return to Gatlinburg she organized a group of cheer leaders here. They did a grand job last year, and are doing an even better one this year. In college she is going to study business administration and hopes some-day to have a business of her own in Gatlinburg. Louise McCarter was our class president last year and was selected as the best all around girl when she was a sophomore. She has been on the basketball team for four years and is the co-captain this year. Miss Elizabeth Petrie is well pleased with the excellent work she does in crafts and she is also a very outstanding mathematics student. She is an active member of the Glee Club as well as most of the other clubs in school. This fall she will enter Lincoln Memorial University where she will study business administration and where she hopes to get her Master's degree in mathematics. Harmon McCarter, the only veteran in our school,. spent two and a half years in the United States Navy, most of this time being spent in the South Pacific. Despite the fact that he was out of school for over two years he is doing very well in his class work, and is an excellent for-ward on the basketball team. This fall he plans to enter the University of Tennessee. Roy Ogle is another boy who has gone to Pi Beta Phi ever since he started to school. He has been in a number of plays in high school and is one of the most popular players on the basket-ball team. He is also very popular among the girls as he is one of the handsomest boys in school. Roy has not decided what he will do yet, but we hope he will enter a university this fall. Joanna Parton is one of the prettiest girls in school as well as the sister of our class president. She is a good singer and is especially interested in the arts and crafts class. This fall she is going THE MAY ARROW 465 to art school to study commercial art. She has been an efficient member of the student council and has been active in the other activities in which she has participated. Lonnie Trentham is another basketball star,, and is much in demand in all the social affairs in school as he is always the "life of the party." Myrtle Whaley is another member of our class who has been selected as the best all round girl in the school, and she has also won the scholarship award. We are very proud of Myrtle because she was brave enough to come back to finish school after being out for four years. Myrtle has always been on the school honor roll and is now a member of the Beta Club. She plans to take a business course after graduation. Hoover Cardwell is one of our most popular boys and he always has many original ideas of his own. He has done very well in the wood-working class, which seems to be his favorite. This fall he will enter the University of Tennessee. Eva Ogle is very much interested in the Home Economics class and plans to go on with her study of foods at Austin Peay College in Nash-ville this fall. Eva is a sweet, comical little person and has been the originator of many a prank during our years together, but she has always remained an honor roll student. Eva and I are especially good friends because we both live in the school dormitory. Here we have spent many happy days, and we feel that we have a definite advantage over the other students who do not live on campus. It is just like being in a big family. We deeply appreciate being able to live in the dormitory and shall always be grateful to the Pi Phis for giving us such a nice place in which to live and work. In a few months we will all be leaving high school to go our separate ways in the world. I know that we will always have very happy memories of school days and be very grateful to our fine teachers for their help. We are also deeply indebted to the Pi Phis for making it possible for us to have extra subjects such as crafts, music, and physical education. Every member of the Senior Class is thankful for these extra opportunities for study and enjoyment and wish to express their deep appreciation. Music in the Mountains By ALETHA MAY ARMSTRONG, Director of Public School Music, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee Our mountains are like the thrilling music of a mighty organ. Along the Potomac the melody starts faintly as the Master Organist presses the stop dulciana and the-cadence falls over the softly rolling hills of Kentucky. In the Virginia uplands the harmony grows in volume and tempo quickens, reaching a soaring crescendo in Tennessee and North Carolina. There, the organist pulls out the diapason on the great organ as the towering Smokies push their peaks into the very face of the sun. The music lessens to diminuendo among the pastel beauties of the Blue Ridge and, reaching Alabama and Georgia, the vox humana sings its nostalgic theme, dying away as the echo organ is heard. So is there music in the souls and in the voices of our Southern mountain people. Among the elders, the speaking voice is often plaintively sweet, pitched in minor key, but among the younger ones, soft and melodious often with a lilt seldom heard elsewhere. We assume an inherent love of music in every normal child and along with it some instinct for its expression. But here in the mountains, where for so long music represented not only a means of emotional expression but recreation in an area isolated from the outer world, Youth gives an even readier response to music. It has been said that in the field of music, theSouthern Mountaineer has made his greatest contribution, as he has kept alive the Anglo-American ballad, carol, and folk-song. So it seems especially imperative that our present generation shall know, value, and perpetuate these noble songs. Remember, however, that there is a vast difference between these folk-songs, whose excel-lent tunes and powerful poetic verses have proved their worth, and the so-called "hill-billy" songs which dominate many programs. Exposed daily to these inferior artificial musical impressions, the young people, naturally rhythmic and music-loving, are fearfully well informed of the former but are sadly ignorant of the beautiful songs which are their real treasures. In our major effort to help our students re-gain their rightful heritage, we have found the glorious-toned Majestic radio-phonograph com bination given by the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, an indispensable ally. Here we can acquaint them with the melody, the appeal of folk-songs. Here the songs are beautifully and correctly sung. As they play the record again and again the youngsters begin to sing along. We believe any child can be taught to sing by ear, just as he is taught to speak, and can later on be taught to read music as it is presented by way of the songbook. 466 THE MAY. ARROW Especially with the Stephen Foster Album, we have by means of records so quickened interest that our pupils not only love to sing the songs, but turn to the better radio programs in order to report their use. In addition, interest in Foster's song and life has inspired original projects in several elementary grades. The older boys have proved very difficult in the matter of enlisting in chorus work. We have found that recordings of fine male choruses have done much to dispel the legend that "singing is sissy." In one class where the boys refused to sing, we hit upon the idea of a class song. We, collectively, wrote the lyrics, extolling the merits of a really fine basketball team. It worked like magic and lusty male participation proved that a move toward the joy of singing had been made. In the accompanying group picture the elementary grade has been studying a recording of a two-part arrangement of "Home Sweet Home." They first listened to the pleasing effect of two soft, sweet voices. Then they studied the relation of the two voices, finally singing along with the soprano and then the alto voice. This method is of invaluable aid for here unison singing is universally practiced, (although when I first came it was boasted that they had quartettes even an octette which I discovered to mean four or eight people stood together and sang the same part) . This class, by the way, was the very first to do two-part singing and actually read notes of the two parts. Their singing of old French carols was an outstanding achievement of the Christmas program. In our mass-singing among the High School group, we use many of the better popular songs and are elated to find more and more of the pupils entering in with enthusiasm. One of the most popular scores is the "Oklahoma" album with its many hit tunes. Several such albumshave been presented as memorial gifts, from friends among the Pi Phis and we can assure you they are being used to excellent advantage. Truly the rich-toned Majestic Phonograph is proving a tremendous help as we crusade in be-half of these objectives of the Music department: To give these wonderfully-endowed students the emotional lift, the enjoyment that music provides. To enable them to use their voices correctly, developing them, safe-guarding them into maturity. To give an opportunity for self-expression and an outlet for the creative urge. To gain ability to read music, and discrimination that the pupil may be independent in selection. Finally to promote the feeling of co-operation and service through group activity, and the contribution of skill to be enjoyed in home, church and community. This last aim is being realized increasingly. The elementary chorus has made several appearances, singing for P.T.A. meetings and for the school Open House program. The various groups are often presented at the Weavers' meetings while the Glee Club has sung at many community gatherings at Thanksgiving services, at various churches. In no small way do our students aid the local church choirs and several are now being coached to do solo work. Together we are striving to make our community GOOD MUSIC conscious and aware of that vast and noble treasure they possess, and of which the bard sings "That old and antique song we heard last night; Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times."
