        Sharon Hon ore by AusoN HOWE, New York Gamma Moving-Up Day Ceremonies last April proved to be very special for one New York Gamma Pi Phi. Sharon Duffy was named the Outstanding Sophomore Greek Woman of the campus for the 1976-77 school year. Sharon has been active in both Greek and non-Greek programs since her first semester at SLU. She has been on the varsity basketball team, has participated in intramural activities, and organized a women's volleyball club. A four-year Army ROTC scholarship winner, she is a member of the women's color guard, the Cadet Association, and is editor of the Cadet Journal, which was named the best student ROTC publication in the country for 1976-77. Sharon was designated a President's Scholar when accepted at St. Lawrence in recognition of her high school achievements. Greek activities include filling a number of different posts in the chapter, as well as serving as a Panhellenic Hall Representative to fresh-men, explaining the Greek system. During the current school year she is serving as a resident assistant to freshmen women. An English-Sociology double major, Sharon hopes to work in the field of public relations or journalism following graduation. Top Freshman Named Each year at the University of Louisville's annual spring Fryberger Songfest, Mortar Board recognizes the Most Outstanding Fresh-man. The selection is based on academic excellence as well as participation in campus activities. Paula Cvengros, Kentucky Alpha, was the 1976-77 winner. She made a 4.0 last fall semester and was a Dean's Scholar. She also lettered in women's varsity tennis as she represented U of L in state competition. Paula is actively involved in Pi Phi and participates on the chapter intramural teams.

Holds 4-H Scholarship by JEAN JONES, Illinois Eta Many students receive scholarships, but few students win a national 4-H Scholarship as has Illinois Eta Debbie Grendlund. A new initiate, Debbie participated in the National 4-H Congress held in Chicago last November. To get there she won over 10,000 other Illinois girls in the dress revue competition. In Chicago, she competed with forty-nine others and became one of four winners receiving a $800 scholar-ship. She had made a jacket, blouse, vest and skirt ensemble. Besides her 4-H membership, Debbie belongs to the James Millikin Scholars program at Millikin University. She is also active in the Blackstone Law Society and tutors for the DOVE program. Announcement The Grand Council of Pi Beta Phi has accepted with regret the decision of the active chapter of Florida Delta to relinquish its charter. Grand Council and the Fraternity hope that, one day in the future, Florida Delta will be able to recolonize and take its rightful place on the University of Florida campus. 26 Edited by MARY ALICE BARBER PERSCHE Board of Governors Marian G. Heard, Cherished Pi Phi (67) 27 Library Fund Honors Marian Grand President Elizabeth Turner Orr announced the establishment by the Fraternity of the Marian G. Heard Library Fund at Arrowmont before approximately 800 Pi Phis attending the Arrowmont Dinner June 20 at the 51st Biennial Convention in Minneapolis, Minn. The announcement came as a surprise to the dinner guest of honor, Marian G. Heard, former director of Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts who received a standing ovation. The fund will provide additional books and periodicals for the Arrowmont School library. Mrs. Orr expressed her "humble thanks and gratitude for your guidance and most of all for your vision" as she also presented Ms. Heard with a tribute book filled with photographs covering the 32 years she has been at the school. "One of the greatest honors I have received was when you bestowed membership in Pi Beta Phi on me" replied Ms. Heard, the Convention Initiate in 1954. A longtime friend of Arrowmont School and of Marian G. Heard, Dr. Donald L. Wykoff told the Convention that "Arrowrnont is vital, Special Booklet Is Created From Love For Arrowmont "ARROWMONT MONTAGES," a hand-some 28-page booklet designed and created by Eleanor Bushnell Lehner, is being sold by the Arrowmont Board of Governors with proceeds to benefit the Marian G. Heard Library Fund. It features many photographs of the school and area taken by Eleanor, former national public relations chairman and member of the Arrowmont Board of Governors. Included are her articles on Arrowmont, an introduction by Marian Heard, former director of Arrowmont, and a tribute to Marian written by ARRow editor Marilyn Simpson Ford. Cover designs are photo-montages showing ramps leading to the various studio and office levels at Arrowmont. Copies of the booklet may be ordered by writing Helen Anderson Lewis, Rt. 1, Box 175, Gatlinburg, Tenn. 37738, and enclosing a check for $3.50 each postpaid, payable to Pi Beta Phi Settlement School.vibrant, vigorous, and very, very important. Arrowmont's role in the craft movement, now a national phenomenom, has been of major significance." Wykoff, president of his own consulting firm in New York City, is the former president of the 37,000 member American Crafts Council which publishes Crafts Horizons magazine. He is an art educator, writer, lecturer, consultant, and artist-craftsman. "Contemporary crafts people are creating the antiquities of tomorrow," Wykoff believes. He referred to Ms. Heard as "a person devoted to the best in art education and as a person who has a deep concern for the craft movement in our country. I say, `Thank you, Arrowmont! Thank you, Marian Heard, and thank you, Pi Beta Phi!' " Members of Pi Beta Phi who wish to contribute to the Library Fund may do so by sending a check to Helen A. Lewis, Rt. 1, Box 175, Gatlinburg, Tenn. 37738. Checks should be made out to Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, indicating they are for the Heard Library Fund. Neal Watson, supervisor of maintenance for Arrowmont and Arrowcraft, recently was honored for thirty years of service to Pi Beta Phi at an employee picnic in Red Barn. Grand Council gave Neal a gold watch, and the employees presented him an afghan. Congratulations and thank you, Neal! 28 Noted Craftsman Lauds Arrowmont (Ed. note: The following is the text of Dr. Donald Wycoff's address to the Convention on Arrowmont Night.) It was a crisp, fall day, and the brilliant colors of the leaves reflected the sun through a light, mountain haze. An odor of wood fires from fireplaces permeated the air. Dotted on the hillside were what seemed to be small farm houses, a large red barn, some out buildings, and nestled in this sublime atmosphere was a beautifully and sensitively designed building housing studios, galleries, libraries, and lecture areas . . . obviously the key element in a well-thought-out master plan. I was greeted in the cozy living room in front of a welcoming fire by a vigorous and lovely lady. This was Arrowmont and this was Marian Heard. How serene, how lovely, how perfect . . . this was to be the first of ever so many visits, and the beginning of my love affair with Arrowmont. My next visit was in early summer, and the warm air smelled of pine following a drenching, mountain thunder storm. Arrowmont was alive with people of all ages. The studios were crowded with jewelers, potters, weavers, enamelists, fabric printers all extremely busy and intent on their work. The main gallery, housing an exhibition of student and staff works, vied with most any gallery in the nation. And this, too was Arrowmont vital, vibrant, vigorous and very, very important. I have often thought of the hundreds, in-deed thousands, of people who have, through the years (since 1945) been influenced by Arrowmont, and who have contributed as artists and teachers in our society, whose lives have been enriched as a result of interaction with fellow students and teachers, and who are, in turn, influencing and enriching the lives of so many others. Arrowmont's role in the craft movement, now a national phenomenon, has been of major significance. Who are these artists, these craftspeople, these teachers, these beautiful human beings whom Arrowmont has helped to provide for our society and to be a part of our cultural heritage? Are they potters? Are they weavers? Are they candlemakers? Are they jewelers, wood-turners? Are they blacksmiths, sculptors, enamelists? Are they knotters, embroiderers,glass blowers? Are they cabinetmakers .and basket weavers? Are they knitters, needle-pointers, whittlers, broom makers? Or are they conceptual fiber sculptors? Is this person trained by Arrowmont a teacher, an independent studio artist, a designer? Is this person a housewife, who embroiders in her spare time? Is he a banker who works with enamels in his basement? Is she an American Indian? Is he a potter who lives in the Appalachian mountains? Is she a quiltmaker in West Virginia? Does he create liturgical fiber hangings in New Jersey? Are these people whose lives have been enriched at our school concerned with being exhibiting artists? Are they concerned with making a living from their work? Are they committed professionals? Are they serious avocationalists? They are all of these. In 1977, the crafts have become one of the most positive aspects of our daily lives. Through the craft experience, one still controls the beginning, the middle and the end of the total experience in most other endeavors in our daily lives, we control but a part. Think of the numbers of craft exhibitions, craft fairs and festivals, craft shops, articles in magazines on crafts . . . think of the people whom you know who work with the materials of craft. I will admit, however, that the crafts are still greatly misunderstood as are the people who create them. As an aside, it is interesting to note how quickly our society has accepted early crafts pre-Columbian, Scythian, Egyptian, Greek and also folk crafts of other countries. These crafts are very much a part of the exhibition programs of major, cultural institutions, and we have spent countless sums of monies researching, collecting, restoring, and exhibiting the work of the craftspeople of centuries past. We are only now realizing that the con-temporary craftspeople are creating the antiquities of tomorrow, and we are realizing that our society has a difficult time discriminating between the good and the mediocre . .. and mediocrity is one of the most dangerous elements in our culture. According to a recent Harris Poll, over 25,000,000 people in the United States are involved in some way with experiences in the craft field at all levels of the creative continuum from rank, by-the-numbers hobby work to outstanding work reflecting the 29 30 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Dr. Donald L. Wyckoff highest creative expression. We know, as a result of the large number of participants, that the crafts have become a factor in our nation's economy as were the' crafts in earlier years. Consequently, there must be the "keepers of the quality" and these are the Arrowmonts, Penlands, Haystacks our schools that have been thoughtfully designed to extend, to supplement, to enrich, to complete the education of so many people. The "Typical" Craftperson The "typical" American craftsperson today what is she like, or what is he like? ... The "typical" craftsperson is most likely to be a woman, based on recent studies and observations. ... She or he can be almost any age. [We see many young people entering the field as a result of increased emphasis on crafts in our learning institutions and because young people have a new commitment to expressing them-selves as individuals.] However, the greater number of people seem to fall between the ages of 22 to 58, and very likely may be a woman. ... Most likely, the professional craftsperson today will be a potter, there still being a considerable number of potters. However, I do notice fewer ceramic submissions to exhibitions. ...The craftsperson is next most likely to be working in one of the many fibers areas weaving, macrame, knotting, wrapping, pre-knotting, embroidery, knitting, stitchery, and so forth. ... The craftsperson today seems least likely to be working in wood, although there are growing numbers in wood, and almost never working in plastics. ... There are growing numbers of metalsmiths and most are working in jewelry and sculptural forms. Very few people seem to be working in hollow or flat ware. In the area of metal, there is a renewed interest in wrought iron. ... The numbers who work in glass seem to increase, but I worry about the attitude that permits any piece of blown glass, by its novelty, to be accepted as a professional piece. ... Almost no people are involved in book-binding and the making of fine papers, al-though there is evidence of a growing interest in paper. ... There is much work in leather being produced, and I am pleased to see a greater concern for quality of design and craftsmanship. ... At the professional level, I see fewer and fewer people involved in work in more than one medium. ... Craftspeople tend to live in greatest numbers in the north and southeast and far and southwest with the north central part of the country providing increasing numbers. The least number of craftspeople are found in the plains and Rocky Mountain areas. The greatest professional activity tends to concentrate in the general vicinity of outstanding craft training institutions. ... The craftsperson is well trained. ... The craftsperson is extremely self-sufficient and often isolates himself or herself in order to survive emotionally and financially. ..: He works hard, is usually self-critical, and very modest. ... She tends to be constantly seeking new materials, new sources for materials, and new ideas. ... He vacillates between wanting to be considered an artist on a par with the painter and sculptor and not caring. Actually, the arbitrary line between crafts and art was unfortunate and should be erased. ... She is realizing a much broader definition of the field and has become involved with modifying the environment in which the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 31 members of our society live from bank walls to park planters. He is becoming more concerned with his relationship with the architect, the industrial designer, and the interior de-signer. ... He tends to be a "good" person with tremendous integrity and great human concern. Through his work, he has found a certain amount of the "good life." ... The craftsperson is a fantastic cook. He drinks a lot of beer and/ or wine. ... She is a photographer. ... She is a bookkeeper and an accountant. ... He is a carpenter, a plumber, an electrician. ... He is a display artist. ... She is a promotion and merchandising expert. ... They are lawyers, tax attorneys, financial wizards and customs brokers. . ... He is a packer and a shipper. ... He and she are teachers public school, college and university, adult school, private studio, workshop, geriatric centers, schools for people with learning disabilities, sheltered workshops for the handicapped, community art centers. Often the reasons for teaching have nothing to do with commitment to education, however. ... He and she are most likely involved with one-of-a-kind exhibition items and shy away from production. ... These are the people who have, for many years, come to Arrowmont . . . a unique school. Arrowmont is Different Arrowmont, in comparison to most of the other well-known craft education centers, differs in that it has wisely chosen to maintain standards for its student performance whether or not the student is attending for one week or ten weeks. There is structure without stultifying creativity, and students leave Arrowmont knowing what they have accomplished a completed work of art worthy of exhibition and/or sale; some new technology; a new way to teach; a new concept; a new hold on life and many new friends. Arrowmont also differs from its peer schools in the makeup of its student body. Arrowmont has not organized to enrich only the lives of the accomplished artists, but to make the beginner feel comfortable as well. Last year,for example, the internationally famous fabric collage artist and author, Alma Lesch from Kentucky, came to Arrowmont to study weaving with Mahboob Shahazman, from the Near East, a major weaver and teacher now from Illinois. In the same class was a young girl from Nebraska for whom weaving was a new experience. What a moment of enrichment for this young girl, who is importantly also a high school teacher in a small regional school. What subsequent moments of enrichment for her students. Who comes to Arrowmont? Young, old one lady, well known to me, has come to Arrowmont to "continue her education" each year for at least fifteen years. She drives from Massachusetts, and she told me last year that she expects to continue to come to Arrowmont for twenty more years. She is now 80! Women, men, all races, all ethnic backgrounds, people from many countries. In one specific class with which I was familiar last year, there were, among others, a highly successful professional weaver; the president of a state crafts council with thousands of members; the new executive director of another state craft council; a' teacher of crafts in a geriatric institute; a graduate weaving student; a craft teacher in a community recreation center for the disadvantaged; the director of a large cultural center; a beginning potter, and a graduate student from Nigeria. And these people, one year later, are still in close contact with each other. Just imagine the influence that each person has had on the lives of their colleagues and subsequently on the lives of the others with whom they will come in contact. There has, of course, always been a need for education programs that are alternatives to the established, academic institutions, but perhaps never before has such a need been so acute. Older people wish to continue their education and enrich their lives without the rigid requirements of academic matriculation and time-consuming "basic" and peripheral courses. Younger people have a new sense of urgency and practicality in connection with their education: They want immediate and meaningful experiences. At the same time they want and need a structure, a framework, within which to work. Our country, our world, is slowly beginning to recognize its dependence on the artists .. . 32 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the craftspeople, the painters, the sculptors, the designers, the architects. These are the people who are documenting our society . . . documenting our society with the objects which they create . . . objects which are extensions of themselves. Aristotle submitted that "the aim of art is to present not only the outward appearance of things, but their in-ward significance." And philosopher Suzanne Langer emphasized that "man has become estranged from himself and there must be a reconciliation: a society that is not aware of this and neglects art education, gives itself up to a formless emotion" . . . and we have seen this happen in several societies. Perhaps you have read John Adams' letter to his wife. I do like his priorities for the later years. "I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy, geography and natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain." Arrowmont has been, and very much is, meeting these challenges. Arrowmont has been, and very much is, providing our nation with a new professionalism in the crafts, with enrichment for the non-professional, with a sensitivity to humankind for all who pass through its campus. Arrowmont Teaches You, who are here this evening, and your sisters who have been present before you have made this happen. I do hope that you all realize the importance and significance of your past and continued efforts. Arrowmont is a cornerstone in alternative education in the arts, in extension education in the arts, in terminal education . . . . Your organization heard Marcus Aurelius when he said, "Men (and I might add, women), exist for the sake of one another. Teach them, then, or bear with them." How pleased I am that Pi Phi chose to teach them. How rewarded you should all feel. How challenged you now must be to continue what you have started. There is so much yet to do. "That which makes the day worthwhile is indeed the highest of all the arts," Thoreausaid to us. You and that beautiful, great, warm-hearted lady who greeted me many years ago in front of the fireplace at Staff House have been making the day worthwhile for so many, many people. As a citizen, as a person devoted to the best in arts education, and as a person who has a deep concern for the craft movement in our country, I say, "thank you, Arrowmont, thank you Marian Heard . . . , and thank you Pi Beta Phi." Gatlinburg Residents Enjoy Craft Courses A number of residents of the Gatlinburg area took courses in photography, pottery, watercolor painting, and off and on loom weaving this past fall and spring at Arrowmont. The community courses, arranged by Marian Heard, Director, and Caroline Riddle, Administrator, are part of Arrowmont's continuing effort to provide educational opportunities for the Gatlinburg community where Pi Beta Phi first began its philanthropic work. Classes offered were those most requested in response to a community survey made through a questionnaire in the local press. Photography for beginners and inter-mediates was taught by Jim Ayers, free lance photographer, with the class using the new Edythe M. Brack Photographic Studio at Arrowmont. Gary Gerhart, a production potter in Gatlinburg who supplies Pi Phi mugs and other items for Arrowcraft, taught both beginning and advanced pottery. Watercolor painting was taught by Ken Schulz, one of America's foremost watercolorists who does painting, drawings, and limited edition prints of the Smokies and other Americana scenes. A well-known area weaver and former Arrowmont student, Judi Gaston, was instructor for the off and on loom weaving class. In cooperation with the Recreation Department of the City of Gatlinburg, courses in art were offered fifth and sixth graders and seventh and eighth grade students with Janis Fraley as the instructor. Barbara Brubaker Neff, president of the Knoxville A.C., Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, and Stephanie Plemmons, Tennessee Gamma president, are served some cooling punch by Michelle Melloy, coordinator of the tea. Tennessee Gammas Honor Prof . Heard by CINDY SMITH, Tennessee Gamma Miss Marian Heard has retired this year from her position as Director of Arrowmont, after being with the school for over thirty years. On May 21, Tennessee Gamma and the Knoxville Alumnae Club honored Miss Heard with a tea in the Pi Phi suite on campus at the University of Tennessee. Actives, alumnae, Arrowmont administrators, and friends from the Home Economics Department at UT came to express their appreciation for Professor Heard's fine work. The tea was a colorful event, with baskets of flowers, silver trays of refreshments, and punch. The results were two-fold: a warm atmosphere of Pi Phi friendship, and the expression of gratitude for one of our finest ladies. The hostesses presented Miss Heard with an engraved silver .trivet. Cards and letters from Grand Council members were appreciated by the chapter. Tennessee Gamma's were delighted to haveMiss Heard speak to them on Founders' Day, celebrated May 7. She spoke optimistically about the progress of Arrowmont and of "pioneering for minds." We are certain that progress is due in large part to the strong guidance of the school's director, who holds our deepest respect. Editor Is National Mother of Year Gloria Berry Langdon, Oklahoma Beta, of Tonkawa, Okla., has been designated "National American Mother of 1977" by the American Mothers Committee. Gloria was honored at a luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, along with state mothers of the other 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico Gloria never expected an award for all the love, guidance, understanding, and devotion she has given to her five children, her husband, her friends, and her community, but she set such a beautiful example for all mothers in Oklahoma that she truly deserved the honor. Gloria and her family are active members of the United Methodist Church, where she has been a Sunday School teacher, a sponsor of the MYF for five years, and a member of the choir. She was Camp Fire leader for 12 years, a Cub Scout den mother, and is active in the Tonkawa Band Parents Organization. She and her husband are publishers of the Tonkawa News where she is a news writer and columnist. Her weekly column was first place winner in the Oklahoma State Fair Newspaper contest. She also won the Marshall Gregory award presented by the Oklahoma Education Association for feature writing on education. 33

These are the people who have, for many years, come to Arrowmont . . . a unique school. Arrowmont is Different Arrowmont, in comparison to most of the other well-known craft education centers, differs in that it has wisely chosen to maintain standards for its student performance whether or not the student is attending for one week or ten weeks. There is structure without stultifying creativity, and students leave Arrowmont knowing what they have accomplished a completed work of art worthy of exhibition and/or sale; some new technology; a new way to teach; a new concept; a new hold on life and many new friends. Arrowmont also differs from its peer schools in the makeup of its student body. Arrowmont has not organized to enrich only the lives of the accomplished artists, but to make the beginner feel comfortable as well. Last year,for example, the internationally famous fabric collage artist and author, Alma Lesch from Kentucky, came to Arrowmont to study weaving with Mahboob Shahazman, from the Near East, a major weaver and teacher now from Illinois. In the same class was a young girl from Nebraska for whom weaving was a new experience. What a moment of enrichment for this young girl, who is importantly also a high school teacher in a small regional school. What subsequent moments of enrichment for her students. Who comes to Arrowmont? Young, old one lady, well known to me, has come to Arrowmont to "continue her education" each year for at least fifteen years. She drives from Massachusetts, and she told me last year that she expects to continue to come to Arrowmont for twenty more years. She is now 80! Women, men, all races, all ethnic backgrounds, people from many countries. In one specific class with which I was familiar last year, there were, among others, a highly successful professional weaver; the president of a state crafts council with thousands of members; the new executive director of another state craft council; a' teacher of crafts in a geriatric institute; a graduate weaving student; a craft teacher in a community recreation center for the disadvantaged; the director of a large cultural center; a beginning potter, and a graduate student from Nigeria. And these people, one year later, are still in close contact with each other. Just imagine the influence that each person has had on the lives of their colleagues and subsequently on the lives of the others with whom they will come in contact. There has, of course, always been a need for education programs that are alternatives to the established, academic institutions, but perhaps never before has such a need been so acute. Older people wish to continue their education and enrich their lives without the rigid requirements of academic matriculation and time-consuming "basic" and peripheral courses. Younger people have a new sense of urgency and practicality in connection with their education: They want immediate and meaningful experiences. At the same time they want and need a structure, a framework, within which to work. Our country, our world, is slowly beginning to recognize its dependence on the artists .. . 32 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the craftspeople, the painters, the sculptors, the designers, the architects. These are the people who are documenting our society . . . documenting our society with the objects which they create . . . objects which are extensions of themselves. Aristotle submitted that "the aim of art is to present not only the outward appearance of things, but their in-ward significance." And philosopher Suzanne Langer emphasized that "man has become estranged from himself and there must be a reconciliation: a society that is not aware of this and neglects art education, gives itself up to a formless emotion" . . . and we have seen this happen in several societies. Perhaps you have read John Adams' letter to his wife. I do like his priorities for the later years. "I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy, geography and natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain." Arrowmont has been, and very much is, meeting these challenges. Arrowmont has been, and very much is, providing our nation with a new professionalism in the crafts, with enrichment for the non-professional, with a sensitivity to humankind for all who pass through its campus. Arrowmont Teaches You, who are here this evening, and your sisters who have been present before you have made this happen. I do hope that you all realize the importance and significance of your past and continued efforts. Arrowmont is a cornerstone in alternative education in the arts, in extension education in the arts, in terminal education . . . . Your organization heard Marcus Aurelius when he said, "Men (and I might add, women), exist for the sake of one another. Teach them, then, or bear with them." How pleased I am that Pi Phi chose to teach them. How rewarded you should all feel. How challenged you now must be to continue what you have started. There is so much yet to do. "That which makes the day worthwhile is indeed the highest of all the arts," Thoreausaid to us. You and that beautiful, great, warm-hearted lady who greeted me many years ago in front of the fireplace at Staff House have been making the day worthwhile for so many, many people. As a citizen, as a person devoted to the best in arts education, and as a person who has a deep concern for the craft movement in our country, I say, "thank you, Arrowmont, thank you Marian Heard . . . , and thank you Pi Beta Phi." Gatlinburg Residents Enjoy Craft Courses A number of residents of the Gatlinburg area took courses in photography, pottery, watercolor painting, and off and on loom weaving this past fall and spring at Arrowmont. The community courses, arranged by Marian Heard, Director, and Caroline Riddle, Administrator, are part of Arrowmont's continuing effort to provide educational opportunities for the Gatlinburg community where Pi Beta Phi first began its philanthropic work. Classes offered were those most requested in response to a community survey made through a questionnaire in the local press. Photography for beginners and inter-mediates was taught by Jim Ayers, free lance photographer, with the class using the new Edythe M. Brack Photographic Studio at Arrowmont. Gary Gerhart, a production potter in Gatlinburg who supplies Pi Phi mugs and other items for Arrowcraft, taught both beginning and advanced pottery. Watercolor painting was taught by Ken Schulz, one of America's foremost watercolorists who does painting, drawings, and limited edition prints of the Smokies and other Americana scenes. A well-known area weaver and former Arrowmont student, Judi Gaston, was instructor for the off and on loom weaving class. In cooperation with the Recreation Department of the City of Gatlinburg, courses in art were offered fifth and sixth graders and seventh and eighth grade students with Janis Fraley as the instructor. Barbara Brubaker Neff, president of the Knoxville A.C., Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, and Stephanie Plemmons, Tennessee Gamma president, are served some cooling punch by Michelle Melloy, coordinator of the tea. Tennessee Gammas Honor Prof . Heard by CINDY SMITH, Tennessee Gamma Miss Marian Heard has retired this year from her position as Director of Arrowmont, after being with the school for over thirty years. On May 21, Tennessee Gamma and the Knoxville Alumnae Club honored Miss Heard with a tea in the Pi Phi suite on campus at the University of Tennessee. Actives, alumnae, Arrowmont administrators, and friends from the Home Economics Department at UT came to express their appreciation for Professor Heard's fine work. The tea was a colorful event, with baskets of flowers, silver trays of refreshments, and punch. The results were two-fold: a warm atmosphere of Pi Phi friendship, and the expression of gratitude for one of our finest ladies. The hostesses presented Miss Heard with an engraved silver .trivet. Cards and letters from Grand Council members were appreciated by the chapter. Tennessee Gamma's were delighted to haveMiss Heard speak to them on Founders' Day, celebrated May 7. She spoke optimistically about the progress of Arrowmont and of "pioneering for minds." We are certain that progress is due in large part to the strong guidance of the school's director, who holds our deepest respect. Editor Is National Mother of Year Gloria Berry Langdon, Oklahoma Beta, of Tonkawa, Okla., has been designated "National American Mother of 1977" by the American Mothers Committee. Gloria was honored at a luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, along with state mothers of the other 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico Gloria never expected an award for all the love, guidance, understanding, and devotion she has given to her five children, her husband, her friends, and her community, but she set such a beautiful example for all mothers in Oklahoma that she truly deserved the honor. Gloria and her family are active members of the United Methodist Church, where she has been a Sunday School teacher, a sponsor of the MYF for five years, and a member of the choir. She was Camp Fire leader for 12 years, a Cub Scout den mother, and is active in the Tonkawa Band Parents Organization. She and her husband are publishers of the Tonkawa News where she is a news writer and columnist. Her weekly column was first place winner in the Oklahoma State Fair Newspaper contest. She also won the Marshall Gregory award presented by the Oklahoma Education Association for feature writing on education. 33

        30 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Dr. Donald L. Wyckoff highest creative expression. We know, as a result of the large number of participants, that the crafts have become a factor in our nation's economy as were the' crafts in earlier years. Consequently, there must be the "keepers of the quality" and these are the Arrowmonts, Penlands, Haystacks our schools that have been thoughtfully designed to extend, to supplement, to enrich, to complete the education of so many people. The "Typical" Craftperson The "typical" American craftsperson today what is she like, or what is he like? ... The "typical" craftsperson is most likely to be a woman, based on recent studies and observations. ... She or he can be almost any age. [We see many young people entering the field as a result of increased emphasis on crafts in our learning institutions and because young people have a new commitment to expressing them-selves as individuals.] However, the greater number of people seem to fall between the ages of 22 to 58, and very likely may be a woman. ... Most likely, the professional craftsperson today will be a potter, there still being a considerable number of potters. However, I do notice fewer ceramic submissions to exhibitions. ...The craftsperson is next most likely to be working in one of the many fibers areas weaving, macrame, knotting, wrapping, pre-knotting, embroidery, knitting, stitchery, and so forth. ... The craftsperson today seems least likely to be working in wood, although there are growing numbers in wood, and almost never working in plastics. ... There are growing numbers of metalsmiths and most are working in jewelry and sculptural forms. Very few people seem to be working in hollow or flat ware. In the area of metal, there is a renewed interest in wrought iron. ... The numbers who work in glass seem to increase, but I worry about the attitude that permits any piece of blown glass, by its novelty, to be accepted as a professional piece. ... Almost no people are involved in book-binding and the making of fine papers, al-though there is evidence of a growing interest in paper. ... There is much work in leather being produced, and I am pleased to see a greater concern for quality of design and craftsmanship. ... At the professional level, I see fewer and fewer people involved in work in more than one medium. ... Craftspeople tend to live in greatest numbers in the north and southeast and far and southwest with the north central part of the country providing increasing numbers. The least number of craftspeople are found in the plains and Rocky Mountain areas. The greatest professional activity tends to concentrate in the general vicinity of outstanding craft training institutions. ... The craftsperson is well trained. ... The craftsperson is extremely self-sufficient and often isolates himself or herself in order to survive emotionally and financially. ..: He works hard, is usually self-critical, and very modest. ... She tends to be constantly seeking new materials, new sources for materials, and new ideas. ... He vacillates between wanting to be considered an artist on a par with the painter and sculptor and not caring. Actually, the arbitrary line between crafts and art was unfortunate and should be erased. ... She is realizing a much broader definition of the field and has become involved with modifying the environment in which the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 31 members of our society live from bank walls to park planters. He is becoming more concerned with his relationship with the architect, the industrial designer, and the interior de-signer. ... He tends to be a "good" person with tremendous integrity and great human concern. Through his work, he has found a certain amount of the "good life." ... The craftsperson is a fantastic cook. He drinks a lot of beer and/ or wine. ... She is a photographer. ... She is a bookkeeper and an accountant. ... He is a carpenter, a plumber, an electrician. ... He is a display artist. ... She is a promotion and merchandising expert. ... They are lawyers, tax attorneys, financial wizards and customs brokers. . ... He is a packer and a shipper. ... He and she are teachers public school, college and university, adult school, private studio, workshop, geriatric centers, schools for people with learning disabilities, sheltered workshops for the handicapped, community art centers. Often the reasons for teaching have nothing to do with commitment to education, however. ... He and she are most likely involved with one-of-a-kind exhibition items and shy away from production. ...

Sharon Duffy was named the Outstanding Sophomore Greek Woman of the campus for the 1976-77 school year. Sharon has been active in both Greek and non-Greek programs since her first semester at SLU. She has been on the varsity basketball team, has participated in intramural activities, and organized a women's volleyball club. A four-year Army ROTC scholarship winner, she is a member of the women's color guard, the Cadet Association, and is editor of the Cadet Journal, which was named the best student ROTC publication in the country for 1976-77. Sharon was designated a President's Scholar when accepted at St. Lawrence in recognition of her high school achievements. Greek activities include filling a number of different posts in the chapter, as well as serving as a Panhellenic Hall Representative to fresh-men, explaining the Greek system. During the current school year she is serving as a resident assistant to freshmen women. An English-Sociology double major, Sharon hopes to work in the field of public relations or journalism following graduation. Top Freshman Named Each year at the University of Louisville's annual spring Fryberger Songfest, Mortar Board recognizes the Most Outstanding Fresh-man. The selection is based on academic excellence as well as participation in campus activities. Paula Cvengros, Kentucky Alpha, was the 1976-77 winner. She made a 4.0 last fall semester and was a Dean's Scholar. She also lettered in women's varsity tennis as she represented U of L in state competition. Paula is actively involved in Pi Phi and participates on the chapter intramural teams.

She will have responsibility for 43 leagues in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, part of New York, and the Province of Ontario. Holds 4-H Scholarship by JEAN JONES, Illinois Eta Many students receive scholarships, but few students win a national 4-H Scholarship as has Illinois Eta Debbie Grendlund. A new initiate, Debbie participated in the National 4-H Congress held in Chicago last November. To get there she won over 10,000 other Illinois girls in the dress revue competition. In Chicago, she competed with forty-nine others and became one of four winners receiving a $800 scholar-ship. She had made a jacket, blouse, vest and skirt ensemble. Besides her 4-H membership, Debbie belongs to the James Millikin Scholars program at Millikin University. She is also active in the Blackstone Law Society and tutors for the DOVE program. Announcement The Grand Council of Pi Beta Phi has accepted with regret the decision of the active chapter of Florida Delta to relinquish its charter. Grand Council and the Fraternity hope that, one day in the future, Florida Delta will be able to recolonize and take its rightful place on the University of Florida campus. 26 Edited by MARY ALICE BARBER PERSCHE Board of Governors Marian G. Heard, Cherished Pi Phi (67) 27 Library Fund Honors Marian Grand President Elizabeth Turner Orr announced the establishment by the Fraternity of the Marian G. Heard Library Fund at Arrowmont before approximately 800 Pi Phis attending the Arrowmont Dinner June 20 at the 51st Biennial Convention in Minneapolis, Minn. The announcement came as a surprise to the dinner guest of honor, Marian G. Heard, former director of Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts who received a standing ovation. The fund will provide additional books and periodicals for the Arrowmont School library. Mrs. Orr expressed her "humble thanks and gratitude for your guidance and most of all for your vision" as she also presented Ms. Heard with a tribute book filled with photographs covering the 32 years she has been at the school. "One of the greatest honors I have received was when you bestowed membership in Pi Beta Phi on me" replied Ms. Heard, the Convention Initiate in 1954. A longtime friend of Arrowmont School and of Marian G. Heard, Dr. Donald L. Wykoff told the Convention that "Arrowrnont is vital, Special Booklet Is Created From Love For Arrowmont "ARROWMONT MONTAGES," a hand-some 28-page booklet designed and created by Eleanor Bushnell Lehner, is being sold by the Arrowmont Board of Governors with proceeds to benefit the Marian G. Heard Library Fund. It features many photographs of the school and area taken by Eleanor, former national public relations chairman and member of the Arrowmont Board of Governors. Included are her articles on Arrowmont, an introduction by Marian Heard, former director of Arrowmont, and a tribute to Marian written by ARRow editor Marilyn Simpson Ford.

Arrowmont's role in the craft movement, now a national phenomenom, has been of major significance." Wykoff, president of his own consulting firm in New York City, is the former president of the 37,000 member American Crafts Council which publishes Crafts Horizons magazine. He is an art educator, writer, lecturer, consultant, and artist-craftsman. "Contemporary crafts people are creating the antiquities of tomorrow," Wykoff believes. He referred to Ms. Heard as "a person devoted to the best in art education and as a person who has a deep concern for the craft movement in our country. I say, `Thank you, Arrowmont! Thank you, Marian Heard, and thank you, Pi Beta Phi!' " Members of Pi Beta Phi who wish to contribute to the Library Fund may do so by sending a check to Helen A. Lewis, Rt. 1, Box 175, Gatlinburg, Tenn. 37738. Checks should be made out to Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, indicating they are for the Heard Library Fund. Neal Watson, supervisor of maintenance for Arrowmont and Arrowcraft, recently was honored for thirty years of service to Pi Beta Phi at an employee picnic in Red Barn. Grand Council gave Neal a gold watch, and the employees presented him an afghan. Congratulations and thank you, Neal! 28 Noted Craftsman Lauds Arrowmont (Ed. note: The following is the text of Dr. Donald Wycoff's address to the Convention on Arrowmont Night.) It was a crisp, fall day, and the brilliant colors of the leaves reflected the sun through a light, mountain haze. An odor of wood fires from fireplaces permeated the air. Dotted on the hillside were what seemed to be small farm houses, a large red barn, some out buildings, and nestled in this sublime atmosphere was a beautifully and sensitively designed building housing studios, galleries, libraries, and lecture areas . . . obviously the key element in a well-thought-out master plan. I was greeted in the cozy living room in front of a welcoming fire by a vigorous and lovely lady. This was Arrowmont and this was Marian Heard. How serene, how lovely, how perfect . . . this was to be the first of ever so many visits, and the beginning of my love affair with Arrowmont. My next visit was in early summer, and the warm air smelled of pine following a drenching, mountain thunder storm. Arrowmont was alive with people of all ages. The studios were crowded with jewelers, potters, weavers, enamelists, fabric printers all extremely busy and intent on their work. The main gallery, housing an exhibition of student and staff works, vied with most any gallery in the nation. And this, too was Arrowmont vital, vibrant, vigorous and very, very important. I have often thought of the hundreds, in-deed thousands, of people who have, through the years (since 1945) been influenced by Arrowmont, and who have contributed as artists and teachers in our society, whose lives have been enriched as a result of interaction with fellow students and teachers, and who are, in turn, influencing and enriching the lives of so many others. Arrowmont's role in the craft movement, now a national phenomenon, has been of major significance. Who are these artists, these craftspeople, these teachers, these beautiful human beings whom Arrowmont has helped to provide for our society and to be a part of our cultural heritage? Are they potters? Are they weavers? Are they candlemakers? Are they jewelers, wood-turners? Are they blacksmiths, sculptors, enamelists? Are they knotters, embroiderers,glass blowers? Are they cabinetmakers .and basket weavers? Are they knitters, needle-pointers, whittlers, broom makers? Or are they conceptual fiber sculptors? Is this person trained by Arrowmont a teacher, an independent studio artist, a designer? Is this person a housewife, who embroiders in her spare time? Is he a banker who works with enamels in his basement? Is she an American Indian? Is he a potter who lives in the Appalachian mountains? Is she a quiltmaker in West Virginia? Does he create liturgical fiber hangings in New Jersey? Are these people whose lives have been enriched at our school concerned with being exhibiting artists? Are they concerned with making a living from their work? Are they committed professionals? Are they serious avocationalists? They are all of these. In 1977, the crafts have become one of the most positive aspects of our daily lives. Through the craft experience, one still controls the beginning, the middle and the end of the total experience in most other endeavors in our daily lives, we control but a part. Think of the numbers of craft exhibitions, craft fairs and festivals, craft shops, articles in magazines on crafts . . . think of the people whom you know who work with the materials of craft. I will admit, however, that the crafts are still greatly misunderstood as are the people who create them. As an aside, it is interesting to note how quickly our society has accepted early crafts pre-Columbian, Scythian, Egyptian, Greek and also folk crafts of other countries. These crafts are very much a part of the exhibition programs of major, cultural institutions, and we have spent countless sums of monies researching, collecting, restoring, and exhibiting the work of the craftspeople of centuries past. We are only now realizing that the con-temporary craftspeople are creating the antiquities of tomorrow, and we are realizing that our society has a difficult time discriminating between the good and the mediocre . .. and mediocrity is one of the most dangerous elements in our culture. According to a recent Harris Poll, over 25,000,000 people in the United States are involved in some way with experiences in the craft field at all levels of the creative continuum from rank, by-the-numbers hobby work to outstanding work reflecting the 29 30 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Dr. Donald L. Wyckoff highest creative expression. We know, as a result of the large number of participants, that the crafts have become a factor in our nation's economy as were the' crafts in earlier years. Consequently, there must be the "keepers of the quality" and these are the Arrowmonts, Penlands, Haystacks our schools that have been thoughtfully designed to extend, to supplement, to enrich, to complete the education of so many people. The "Typical" Craftperson The "typical" American craftsperson today what is she like, or what is he like? ... The "typical" craftsperson is most likely to be a woman, based on recent studies and observations. ... She or he can be almost any age. [We see many young people entering the field as a result of increased emphasis on crafts in our learning institutions and because young people have a new commitment to expressing them-selves as individuals.] However, the greater number of people seem to fall between the ages of 22 to 58, and very likely may be a woman. ... Most likely, the professional craftsperson today will be a potter, there still being a considerable number of potters. However, I do notice fewer ceramic submissions to exhibitions. ...The craftsperson is next most likely to be working in one of the many fibers areas weaving, macrame, knotting, wrapping, pre-knotting, embroidery, knitting, stitchery, and so forth. ... The craftsperson today seems least likely to be working in wood, although there are growing numbers in wood, and almost never working in plastics. ... There are growing numbers of metalsmiths and most are working in jewelry and sculptural forms. Very few people seem to be working in hollow or flat ware. In the area of metal, there is a renewed interest in wrought iron. ... The numbers who work in glass seem to increase, but I worry about the attitude that permits any piece of blown glass, by its novelty, to be accepted as a professional piece. ... Almost no people are involved in book-binding and the making of fine papers, al-though there is evidence of a growing interest in paper. ... There is much work in leather being produced, and I am pleased to see a greater concern for quality of design and craftsmanship. ... At the professional level, I see fewer and fewer people involved in work in more than one medium. ... Craftspeople tend to live in greatest numbers in the north and southeast and far and southwest with the north central part of the country providing increasing numbers. The least number of craftspeople are found in the plains and Rocky Mountain areas. The greatest professional activity tends to concentrate in the general vicinity of outstanding craft training institutions. ... The craftsperson is well trained. ... The craftsperson is extremely self-sufficient and often isolates himself or herself in order to survive emotionally and financially. ..: He works hard, is usually self-critical, and very modest. ... She tends to be constantly seeking new materials, new sources for materials, and new ideas. ... He vacillates between wanting to be considered an artist on a par with the painter and sculptor and not caring. Actually, the arbitrary line between crafts and art was unfortunate and should be erased. ... She is realizing a much broader definition of the field and has become involved with modifying the environment in which the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 31 members of our society live from bank walls to park planters. He is becoming more concerned with his relationship with the architect, the industrial designer, and the interior de-signer. ... He tends to be a "good" person with tremendous integrity and great human concern. Through his work, he has found a certain amount of the "good life." ... The craftsperson is a fantastic cook. He drinks a lot of beer and/ or wine. ... She is a photographer. ... She is a bookkeeper and an accountant. ... He is a carpenter, a plumber, an electrician. ... He is a display artist. ... She is a promotion and merchandising expert. ... They are lawyers, tax attorneys, financial wizards and customs brokers. . ... He is a packer and a shipper. ... He and she are teachers public school, college and university, adult school, private studio, workshop, geriatric centers, schools for people with learning disabilities, sheltered workshops for the handicapped, community art centers. Often the reasons for teaching have nothing to do with commitment to education, however. ... He and she are most likely involved with one-of-a-kind exhibition items and shy away from production. ... These are the people who have, for many years, come to Arrowmont . . . a unique school. Arrowmont is Different Arrowmont, in comparison to most of the other well-known craft education centers, differs in that it has wisely chosen to maintain standards for its student performance whether or not the student is attending for one week or ten weeks. There is structure without stultifying creativity, and students leave Arrowmont knowing what they have accomplished a completed work of art worthy of exhibition and/or sale; some new technology; a new way to teach; a new concept; a new hold on life and many new friends. Arrowmont also differs from its peer schools in the makeup of its student body. Arrowmont has not organized to enrich only the lives of the accomplished artists, but to make the beginner feel comfortable as well. Last year,for example, the internationally famous fabric collage artist and author, Alma Lesch from Kentucky, came to Arrowmont to study weaving with Mahboob Shahazman, from the Near East, a major weaver and teacher now from Illinois. In the same class was a young girl from Nebraska for whom weaving was a new experience. What a moment of enrichment for this young girl, who is importantly also a high school teacher in a small regional school. What subsequent moments of enrichment for her students. Who comes to Arrowmont? Young, old one lady, well known to me, has come to Arrowmont to "continue her education" each year for at least fifteen years. She drives from Massachusetts, and she told me last year that she expects to continue to come to Arrowmont for twenty more years. She is now 80! Women, men, all races, all ethnic backgrounds, people from many countries. In one specific class with which I was familiar last year, there were, among others, a highly successful professional weaver; the president of a state crafts council with thousands of members; the new executive director of another state craft council; a' teacher of crafts in a geriatric institute; a graduate weaving student; a craft teacher in a community recreation center for the disadvantaged; the director of a large cultural center; a beginning potter, and a graduate student from Nigeria. And these people, one year later, are still in close contact with each other. Just imagine the influence that each person has had on the lives of their colleagues and subsequently on the lives of the others with whom they will come in contact. There has, of course, always been a need for education programs that are alternatives to the established, academic institutions, but perhaps never before has such a need been so acute. Older people wish to continue their education and enrich their lives without the rigid requirements of academic matriculation and time-consuming "basic" and peripheral courses. Younger people have a new sense of urgency and practicality in connection with their education: They want immediate and meaningful experiences. At the same time they want and need a structure, a framework, within which to work. Our country, our world, is slowly beginning to recognize its dependence on the artists .. . 32 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the craftspeople, the painters, the sculptors, the designers, the architects. These are the people who are documenting our society . . . documenting our society with the objects which they create . . . objects which are extensions of themselves. Aristotle submitted that "the aim of art is to present not only the outward appearance of things, but their in-ward significance." And philosopher Suzanne Langer emphasized that "man has become estranged from himself and there must be a reconciliation: a society that is not aware of this and neglects art education, gives itself up to a formless emotion" . . . and we have seen this happen in several societies. Perhaps you have read John Adams' letter to his wife. I do like his priorities for the later years. "I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy, geography and natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain." Arrowmont has been, and very much is, meeting these challenges. Arrowmont has been, and very much is, providing our nation with a new professionalism in the crafts, with enrichment for the non-professional, with a sensitivity to humankind for all who pass through its campus. Arrowmont Teaches You, who are here this evening, and your sisters who have been present before you have made this happen. I do hope that you all realize the importance and significance of your past and continued efforts. Arrowmont is a cornerstone in alternative education in the arts, in extension education in the arts, in terminal education . . . . Your organization heard Marcus Aurelius when he said, "Men (and I might add, women), exist for the sake of one another. Teach them, then, or bear with them." How pleased I am that Pi Phi chose to teach them. How rewarded you should all feel. How challenged you now must be to continue what you have started. There is so much yet to do. "That which makes the day worthwhile is indeed the highest of all the arts," Thoreausaid to us. You and that beautiful, great, warm-hearted lady who greeted me many years ago in front of the fireplace at Staff House have been making the day worthwhile for so many, many people. As a citizen, as a person devoted to the best in arts education, and as a person who has a deep concern for the craft movement in our country, I say, "thank you, Arrowmont, thank you Marian Heard . . . , and thank you Pi Beta Phi." Gatlinburg Residents Enjoy Craft Courses A number of residents of the Gatlinburg area took courses in photography, pottery, watercolor painting, and off and on loom weaving this past fall and spring at Arrowmont. The community courses, arranged by Marian Heard, Director, and Caroline Riddle, Administrator, are part of Arrowmont's continuing effort to provide educational opportunities for the Gatlinburg community where Pi Beta Phi first began its philanthropic work. Classes offered were those most requested in response to a community survey made through a questionnaire in the local press. Photography for beginners and inter-mediates was taught by Jim Ayers, free lance photographer, with the class using the new Edythe M. Brack Photographic Studio at Arrowmont. Gary Gerhart, a production potter in Gatlinburg who supplies Pi Phi mugs and other items for Arrowcraft, taught both beginning and advanced pottery. Watercolor painting was taught by Ken Schulz, one of America's foremost watercolorists who does painting, drawings, and limited edition prints of the Smokies and other Americana scenes. A well-known area weaver and former Arrowmont student, Judi Gaston, was instructor for the off and on loom weaving class. In cooperation with the Recreation Department of the City of Gatlinburg, courses in art were offered fifth and sixth graders and seventh and eighth grade students with Janis Fraley as the instructor. Barbara Brubaker Neff, president of the Knoxville A.C., Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont, and Stephanie Plemmons, Tennessee Gamma president, are served some cooling punch by Michelle Melloy, coordinator of the tea. Tennessee Gammas Honor Prof . Heard by CINDY SMITH, Tennessee Gamma Miss Marian Heard has retired this year from her position as Director of Arrowmont, after being with the school for over thirty years. On May 21, Tennessee Gamma and the Knoxville Alumnae Club honored Miss Heard with a tea in the Pi Phi suite on campus at the University of Tennessee. Actives, alumnae, Arrowmont administrators, and friends from the Home Economics Department at UT came to express their appreciation for Professor Heard's fine work. The tea was a colorful event, with baskets of flowers, silver trays of refreshments, and punch. The results were two-fold: a warm atmosphere of Pi Phi friendship, and the expression of gratitude for one of our finest ladies. The hostesses presented Miss Heard with an engraved silver .trivet. Cards and letters from Grand Council members were appreciated by the chapter. Tennessee Gamma's were delighted to haveMiss Heard speak to them on Founders' Day, celebrated May 7. She spoke optimistically about the progress of Arrowmont and of "pioneering for minds." We are certain that progress is due in large part to the strong guidance of the school's director, who holds our deepest respect.
