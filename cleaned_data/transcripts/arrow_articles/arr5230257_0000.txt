The more than three hundred guests, which included students, faculty, and townspeople, gathered in the hospitable home which had been made unusually beautiful with many lovely .flowers, spoke of a welcome to Pi Beta Phi which was most colorful and heartfelt. On Friday evening, Helen Booker Sawyer entertained with a delightful dinner at the Monmouth Country Club and gave to new and old Pi Phis a last cherished opportunity for happy fellowship. Eyes were misty when the old Zeta hymn rang out for the last time "in the old way" but as the beautiful "Pi Beta Phi Anthem" succeeded it there remained in the hearts of all only a strong loyal love for Pi Beta Phi and a deep .happiness in a "dream come true.". .

They inspected Jellico Plains; and attended a convention of all of the public school teachers of Sevier county at Sevierville, at which Emma Harper Turner was asked to speak. One of the teachers, Miss Mabel Moore of Greenville, Tenn., who at tended the meeting went to Miss Turner afterwards and told her about the Gat linburg community, earnestly urging that the committee visit there before making a decision relative to a site for a school. After returning to Knoxville from Sevierville, the committee made plans for a visit to Gatlinburg. Unforeseen circumstances, how-ever, arose, and Miss Turner and Miss Pettit felt it necessary to return to their homes, so Dr. Keller made the trip alone. In writing of this first trip to Little Pigeon, Dr. Keller said: "My trip began with a long distance message from Sevierville summoning me to appear there the next day when a mythical Mr. Drinnen would meet me at the train and drive me up into the mountains. Early the next morning at six-thirty I took my seat in the single passenger coach drawn by a diminutive engine, which burned wood, not coal. We puffed, snorted, and panted our way up to Sevierville, the terminal of the toy road. Arrived at the station, Mr. Drinnen, then County Superintendent of Schools, and one of the finest friends our school has ever had, met me, drove me to the hotel, and left me with the assurance he would call for me the next morning at five and drive me to Gatlin-burg where there was a community without school facilities, and without the prospect of attaining any. . . Early the next morning Mr. Drinnen appeared in a small, light buggy. His greeting was 'I am sure glad you came.' On further inquiry I elicited the information that I had `kind of that healthy look' which would be necessary to sustain me over seventeen miles of the worst road in Tennessee. At that time there were no bridges, the road to Pigeon Forge had not been built, and we forded creeks up to the floor of the buggy. The road was beautiful running along the edge of Birds Creek, bordered with mountain laurel, with here and there a grassy meadow set down right in the middle of the mountains. One funny experience we had ; we passed a man, who looked and walked as if afflicted with hookworm, and a minute later TYPICAL OLD SCHOOL HOUSE 1912 the local Washington committee be serve as a subcommittee. at the national committee be em-to send out requests for contribu-I pledges at their discretion. :onvention most enthusiastically ac-le recommendations and voted thanks rashington Alumnae Club for its sug was launched a project which has the pride of every wearer of the Dn as possible after the Convention nvestigation of possible school sites ed.

He saw the hind wheel coming and never even moved, so we had to descend and pull him out of the way, that done he rose, shook himself, gave a little yelp, and slowly betook himself elsewhere. "The first school we visited was at the Glades. It was situated on a high hill, and was the usual wooden structure of one room. All the children were dressed in calico and were bare-footed, but had bright intelligent faces, and they were clean. "The trouble with the schools seems to be "At dinner we h dodgers, ate with tiny true mountain hospit to pay for our meal ( saying that he also wa and was glad to cute] who has taught seve unusually intelligent, talk to me.

I think TYPICAL MOUNTAIN HOME NEAR GATLINBURG that few of the teachers have ever gone to a high school, and that they are teaching the same grade work they have done themselves. In this school the teacher, a man, had adopted the labor-saving device of having an older girl or boy hear the younger ones recite. "The next school was larger, there were 120 children, and the whole place was so crowded that the younger children were dismissed early to give the older ones more room. A man and a woman taught this school, and I was particularly attracted by the latter. The cry is everywhere more room needed and more teachers. Here as in the other schools we visited, both Mr. Drinnen and I gave the school a talk and in Gatlinburg, a good many of the men came to hear what we had to say.

The Committee, however, was not sure that it was what it wanted. At Wears Valley a school had been established originally under Presbyterian auspices and thus continued for a time. The property was valued at $3,000 with a comparatively large school in successful operation and supported by the good will and cooperation of the people. The entire plant was offered to Pi Beta Phi outright as a gift for the simple taking. A second meeting of the Committee was held in Philadelphia in .May "911, at the home of Anna F. T. Pettit. At this meeting a decision was reached favoring Gatlinburg for the school site instead of Wears Valley. The factors determining this were: Need, opportunities for influence as to territory and population, ability of Pi Beta Phi to meet the special local need. Gatlinburg had been settled sometime b tween 1801 and 1807 by the first settlers coming over the Indian. Gap Trail on horse-back and on foot from North and South Carolina. It was first called "The White Oak Flats," but the postoffice name was changed to Gatlinburg in honor of a man who kept a store there just before the Civil War. According to a description in one of the Committee reports: "Gatlinburg is in the eastern part of Sevier County; a center of teaming routes into the mountains; a point of large influence; no railroad connections but the prospective terminus of a branch road from Sevierville; wildly beautiful country; not a town but a community along the big road; served by rural mail carriers; has a little public school house that has not been re-roofed in 30. years; school furniture home-made and 20 years old. (Steps are being taken at present to build a new school house.) About 200 children are within school influence of this point and many very needy out-lying coves are accessible from it. The public school term usually begins in August and closes at Christmas--teachers' salary $30." The Committee appropriated $500 as a maximum limit for school expenses of the first session, that amount to be repaid to the Endowment Fund as soon as other contributions should come in. After careful study the Committee recommended that the fraternity 'ooperate with the public schools, if possible, under arrange THE FEBRUARY ARROW ments satisfactory to Pi Beta Phi, rather than to undertake an independent work since it was felt that this Public School cooperation "would be the best means of help towards Negotiations were opened at once with the School Board and citizens at Gatlinburg but delays almost disheartening attended every step, County school officials had been changed since Miss Keller 's visit and the new officials had to be informed about the proposed work and had to be interested.for the removal of `thi! among us."

Growing desperate from the delays, the National Committee at last decided not to wait longer for public school cooperation, but to enter the community by an independent and perhaps temporary school, and to con-duct all further negotiations through a representative on the field. The Grand Council officially endorsed such action. It was discovered later that one cause of many delays in getting the work started, was the fact that part of the community was op-posed to our advent for fear of a new church establishment. Such a thing had happened under similar circumstances in a nearby community. The idea of a purely altruistic project was entirely foreign to local conception. "Certain church men were particularly virulent in their opposition to us, and even after the school was established one minister prayed At last a Pi Phi was ( was forced to decline illness.

Most of the alumnm clubs were interested in the Settlement School project and up to March 15, 1912 the receipts totaled $2,775.63. It was necessary, however, to do much pioneer work in "selling" the idea of the School to many, just as it is necessary to do publicity work on any new undertaking. In 1911 one club reported: "Our club was divided somewhat on the Settlement School project. Some liked it, others did not. Those against it seemed to feel it is a missionary MISS HILL AND THE FIRST PI BETA PHI SCHOOL March 1912 letter written while she was getting open the school, Miss Hill said: y every woman I met expressed a desire your school.

Indeed you can think of of educational or settlement work that !eded at Gatlinburg. It is a splendid place efforts. Hill was authorized by the committee ge as assistant, a nurse from a train venture and thought churches covered that field." The club nevertheless loyally made a contribution. Another club wrote: "We are sorry to say that the Settlement School proposition failed to interest our club to the extent of any accomplishment." Some of the clubs raised money through benefit plays, stereopticon lectures, etc., but for the most part the first money raised was chiefly by special assessment of members voluntarily set by the clubs. As soon, however, as it was known that we had a worker in the field, interest among the clubs grew rapidly and has since kept pace with the development of the work on Little Pigeon. Miss Louise Van Sant, Maryland A, acted as chairman of special furnishing for the teach THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' cottage at Gatlinburg, leading a spirited campaign of solicitation among the clubs. The most outstanding gift was that of an organ provided by the Washington and Baltimore Clubs, for which they sacrificed their Founders' Day banquet. Mr. Percy Foster of Washington, piano dealer, furnished the organ at cost and attended to the shipment. Early reports of Miss Van Sant showed a pledge of table silver from the Los Angeles club, of linen from Boston, of a sewing ma-chine from Franklin, window shades from Baltimore, a box of rugs and books from Washington, a cereal double boiler from Philadelphia, magazine subscriptions from Syracuse, a clock from the mother of a Michigan Pi Phi, sheets and bird pictures from Carrie Flagler Shantz, of Iowa ,0, napkins and dish towels from the Chicago Alum= Club, damask towels and books and pictures from the Boston Club, and 12 yards of blackboard cloth and a box of books from St. Louis. Although January 1912 had been set as the date for the opening of the school, more than two months were required in making preparations for the opening, which took place in March with 14 pupils enrolled. The session lasted three months and dosed with 33 enrolled. This first Pi Beta Phi school was held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, destined to be-come famous in later years as the Arrowcraft Shop. On June 28, Miss Hill gave a school pro-gram which was pronounced a great success and it was said that "nothing like it had ever been held there before."

The people, especially the women, begged that the school remain in the Burg. Two of the most interested persons were Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff. They were not natives of the community, but had come in. Mrs. Huff was born in another part of Tennessee and Mr. Huff's home state was Pennsylvania. Mr. Huff owned large lumber interests. They were progressive people and wanted education for SCHOOL BUILDING USED BY PI BETA PHI: AUGUST 1912, 1913, 1914 tuber 30, since a term from August nher was all that the public funds 'ply. ptember 1912, Mrs. Helmick, as of the Committee, made a trip to rg with a view to selecting a build-She called a community meeting and people about Pi Beta Phi and ex-bat the fraternity proposed to give permanent, lasting gift in a new Mrs. Helmick had finished her talk d for expressions from the audience s not a sound.

I replied," Helmick, " `No one church, and yet Christian churches' and gave the their four children who were then in the school. In trying to find a suitable building site, Mrs. Helmick told Mr. Huff that in the progressive west where she lived, when an enterprise like the Settlement School thought of coming to a place permanently, "it was customary if the people wanted it, for the business men to get together, and offer an inducement to its coming." She explained that she had been obliged to hunt up proper-ties and to urge men to put a reasonable valuation upon their land when they had a month ago expressed a desire to sell. Mr. Huff took his cue and before Mrs. Helmick left that afternoon, met her on the road to tell her that: "We men have gotten together, and if you folks want the Richard ogle place, and you feel $2000 is too much, I have a man who will give you $800 for the store, and if THE 'FEBRUARY ARROW $1200 is more than you want to pay, we propose making up the difference among us. We want your school right here. ' e know Miss Hill and we know what you have done, and we stand together to do anything you wish to keep you here. Please don't let any-thing influence you to go elsewhere." The next day the County Superintendent, J. S. Keeble, after talking with Mr. Huff, made the proposition that the fraternity take the entire charge of the school management in the Gatlinburg district. He offered to give a clear, absolute deed to all the public school property, including a new building valued at $1000 which stood on a bill overlooking the Burg, and to turn over, in cash, the pay allotted the school teachers by the school authorities annually, without a "string" of any kind, as long as Pi Beta Phi maintained a public and free school in the lower grades. As a result of her trip to Tennessee, Mrs. Helmick asked the Chicago Club to authorize the Sub-Committee to hire an assistant to Miss Hill; to take over the public school property and obligation; to buy the necessary property; and to put up the necessary buildings, with the understanding that all was to be done when the money was available. The club gave the authorization. A vivid description of the "closes" of the school on November 30, 1912 was written by Kate B. Miller of the Committee after she had visited Gatlinburg. Miss Miller said: "They had come at night, some of them at half-past six, though that was the bedtime of many of them. They had come from up Baskins' way, on Mill Creek, down Roaring Brook, farther up Little Pigeon, from Holy Top, and Dick's Range, over devious mountain trails and rocky, muddy mountain roads of so modest a nature that they were often difficult to find. Most of them came afoot, carrying babies, leading little children, and lighting their uncertain way with lamps and lanterns. Their goal was the school house on the small high nob, which had but one way of rational approach. The person who sought to scale the rocky bluff of seventy-five or a hundred feet from. the Roaring Brook side or the Little Pigeon and bad road side would have stood small chance of reaching Minerva's temple on top. And so they plodded along the meandering muddy road, around and up the hill. They were all there waiting when Miss Hill, Miss Gillette, Mrs. J. R. Keeble, the County Superintendent of Schools, Dr. E. A. Bishop, the president of Murray College, and I stumbled our lamp down and up the slim Phi cottage, half a mil( lute quiet during the p except by the processi who passed to and fry the stove reserved for warm themselves, and DELL GILLET First Pi Beta Phi Teach as one and all at vari( necks to see how the , the efforts of the chile sided with boards, w2. the lamps and lantern had brought.

The first piece of work which each made was a white linen collar. While the girls sewed "Miss Dell" or someone reed aloud. For the boys, Miss Gillette adopted certain Boy Scout rules for behaviour and development in two baseball teams. One was an indoor team which played in the abandoned Methodist Church, and the other was a regular outside team which played in the "flats." The school closed on the last of March. For the first time in the history of the community, the children had gone to school for eight months in one year! Although the school had progressed splendidly and Pi Beta Phi had made wonderful friends in the community, two things happened which almost caused the withdrawal of the fraternity from Gatlinburg to some other locality. It will be recalled that the county superintendent had assured the Committee that the whole school situation would be given into Pi Beta Phi's control, but Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller found upon their arrival at Gatlinburg in July 1913, that although al-most everyone in the community wanted Pi Beta Phi to conduct the school, a local man was hired through a misunderstanding. By the opening of the next term, however, the misunderstanding had been deared. The Board voted that after Christmas, the public school building should be given to PI Beta Phi for its use and that another year the fraternity should have the whole school situation in its hands. The next and very vital matter to be settled was that of acquiring land. Although several places were considered, the only really desirable tract seemed to be that owned by E. E. Ogle, but the men of the village did not think that he would sell even if the money could be raised. Despite the fact that the men had some time before agreed to help with the purchase of property for the school, they now seemed to hang back and to want Pi Beta Phi to try to raise the money and to persuade Mr. Ogle to sell. It was not that they were shirking a promise but rather that they had never assisted with the promotion of any community project such as this and seemingly did not know how to go about it. Mrs. Helmick talked with Mr. Ogle and found that he would sell for $1800. If the fraternity would put in $600 and the men of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the community, $1.200, the land no doubt could be obtained. . Since the matter had dragged along for months with nothing accomplished, Mrs. Helmick issued an ultimatum saying that if the Ogle land were not obtained for the fraternity (we contributing $600) by the next day at noon, Pi Beta Phi would go elsewhere and establish a school where land would be given to us. Kate Miller's graphic description shows the tenseness of the situation: We now wondered what they would do. They were at last convinced that "those wimmin" meant what they said, We packed our trunks, began to get the household things ready to leave until we should have them sent elsewhere, ordered the hack from Sevierville to come for us the next day, and wondered what the next twenty-four hours would bring forth. Mr. Huff was sent for in his lumber camp eight miles away; everyone gave up his busi ness and those who had no lousiness gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for a public affair. They said that there was no one who could go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Andy Huff was drawn forth. As think back over the stirring weeks, it seems to me that nothing which came cut of them will be of greater good to these men and women than this: the knowledge that they can do things themselves. Tuesday evening we had many callers, three of the women staying until after dark. They said they just couldn't let us go, that they knew the men would try their best, but that perhaps they couldn't raise enough money. For women in the mountains to stay out after dark was a violation of their social code, but they were forgetting even their social customs now. The next morning while we were at breakfast, Mr. Huff and Steve Whaley came to get us to draw up a subscription paper. Mrs. Helmick wrote the heading for one, putting Pi Beta Phi down for $600. Andy Huff put down $250 and Steve Whaley $250. Then they started off saying that the hack would not take us back. After the men had left, Mrs. Huff came to us and told us of her dream. She dropped into a chair in our kitchen as we were washing the dishes that morning and said: "I had a dream last night." It seemed that she had dreamt that she and the children were all down by the river bank playing. The children had pushed through the bushes and had slipped down to the river bed where they were playing on the dry gravelly bottom in the pools. She had stayed up on the road and suddenly she looked up the river to the distant mountains that seemed to close it in. There she saw rising and clinging to the mountain sides a "big steam, a fog." Then the fog began to roll in clouds, and to come down the river slowly. It kept getting bigger and bigger and kept rolling and rolling down towards the place where the children were playing. Her eyes grew large and her voice tense as the vividness of her vision cameback to her. She repeater fog kept rolling and rollii bigger and coming down the river she also saw, in danger, the Reagan an, thought that the fog was as her own children.

Asheville, N.C., asking if she could y help, was sent for. ugust 4, 1913, Kate Miller assisted ,angmaid in opening the school in old school house on Baskins and peon. That was the beginning of the first year in our own buildings and with entirely Pi Phi teachers. Two months later, Miss Langmaid re-signed and was succeeded by Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, who was given the title of Head Resident. The outstanding accomplishment of the year 1913-14, in addition to the acquiring of the land, was the building of a new school building, plans for which had been drawn originally by Mr. and Mrs. Von Hoist of Chicago, Mrs. Von Hoist (Lucy Hammond, Colorado B) , being a member of the Chicago Alumnae Club. This new building, a one-story frame structure 60 x 84 feet, with its rather low, projecting roof, resembled a bungalow and was built at an approximate cost of $3,735.30. The main entrance was from a porch into a large hall, from which five class rooms opened, one on each side, and three in the rear. The hall was used as a reading and rest room. A large fireplace was opposite the entrance. The three class rooms at the rear were separated by sliding doors which could be thrown back, making the room into one large room. In December the work of the school having increased to such proportions, Miss Pollard requested two additional teachers and Leah Stock (Helmick) , Michigan A, and Edith Wilson, Indiana A, volunteered their services. The session closed on April 3 with 127 pupils. During the year the young orchard was pruned and cared for; gardens were planted and were worked "on shares," and much thought was given to beautifying the grounds. The Department of Agriculture at Washington furnished the school with a liberal supply of bulbs, shrubs, and seeds, which were planted to good effect. A Tomato Club the only one in Sevier county was organized by Miss Virginia Moore, state organizer of Tomato Canning Clubs for girls. Dr. Yancy, the state hookworm specialist, made three visits to the school and con-ducted a free clinic during the summer months. Miss Pollard remained at the school during the summer, giving her time and strength without reserve, walking miles and miles to tell the people of the danger of hookworm and urging them to come in to receive the free treatment at the Pi Phi school. She assisted the doctor personally in giving out medicines and in making examinations. THE FEBRUARY ARROW The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee reported at the end of the school year that a fund had been started by three of our Founders, with the result that $150 was then in the bank for the establishment of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital at Gatlinburg, in loving memory of Jennie Nicol of "Alpha." Late in June, the Settlement School Committee sent out attractive invitations to the dedication of the new school building which took place on July 9.

Onken, Anne Stuart, and Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) were in attendance and as sisted in preparing for the guests of the day whom they entertained at luncheon. Extracts from the description of the dedi cation of Pi Beta Phi's first school building, as recorded by Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) follow: Long before the appointed time on that sultry summer day guests from a distance began to arrive; they came on foot and on horseback; a few rode in buggies or mountain wagons but the vast majority patronized the "shoe leather express," walking five, eight, or even ten miles to be present at the great occasion. The seats, desks and other school furniture had already been placed, and the fire-place in the entrance hall was banked with ferns and wild flowers, for every effort was made to decorate our building as a northern school building would be decked on a similar occasion. The first to arrive were Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A, and her friend, Miss Walker, who had driven up from Sevierville. Then came Vera Kerr Kessler, Massachusetts A, and her husband, Lt. Kessler, U. S. Navy, who had been spending a few days at Wonderland Park, a mountain resort some nine miles from Gatlinburg. Hearing of the dedication they came over with two friends, Miss Oldman and Miss Hazard.

She was a remarkable woman, having raised her family of children after her husband was killed almost on her doorstep during the Civil War. The "Aunt Lyddie" baskets were known far and wide. In March 1915, Miss Pollard wrote to THE ARROW: "We are hoping to emphasize the industrial side of our work more and more. We are hoping to start basket making in the school, hoping that it will prove a profitable industry. Many of the women make exquisite patchwork quilts and some still mare the hand woven coverlids and blankets. If a sale could be found for these articles, many might undertake the work." And that is where the alumnae department of Pi Beta Phi has accomplished a marvelous work by making a "sale for these articles." In May of that year, Caroline Mc Knight Hughes, Minnesota A, a graduate of the University of Michigan, of Cooper Union School of Art and of Prang Normal, took charge of the business and industrial work, spending some time in the summer looking the situation over, and starting the fall as Head Resident in charge of industrial work, with Mary O. Pollard as Principal of the school. Miss Hughes installed a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 with which she gave instruction to 52 boys and a beginning was made of a department which it was hoped in time would be of great benefit to the community and to the school. It was noised about that "them wimmin" were going to "teach tools," and the curiosity of the Burg was so great that some of the residents ran down the country road to meet the wagon bringing in the tools. All they saw were some boxes, nailed up tight, and some crates with they knew not what inside. The excitement and curiosity was equal to a circus coming to town and when the five benches were in place, with the tools set out, every man and boy able to come to the School, did so. Apparently no one knew much about tools, except the saw, plane and hammer, and the first day of class work was a queer one. As soon as possible the weaving department was equipped, spinning bees and quilting parties were given with the hope of reviving those almost lost industries. For the first time in the fall of 1915 the school began the sale of baskets, purchasing THE FEBRUARY ARROW THE LOOMS ARE PUT TO WORK materials and articles for the industrial work, trying to raise the standard of workmanship, and endeavoring to find a market for the products. In urging the revival of industrial work, Miss Hughes said: "In the yesteryear this country was a community of weavers, but after the War `store cloth' was cheap so that one woman after another put the old loom aside, but many of our neighbors today know how to spin and weave though it has been a 'tol'able long spell' since any of them havedone such a thing. 01 the school, has her willing to make `kivi dear to the hearts o the women still use twist stocking yarn flax has disappeared. mond Dyes to color ti cent know how to m; roots, weeds, etc. Al are either the one `g from Car'liny when THE FEBRUARY ARROW these old ones, and of course one are crude homemade affairs.

Hlughes instructed the children in the art of weaving tiny rugs, mats mocks. In response to her call for in the work, the Springfield, Mo., ed $100 for the buying of looms. the first year that the Chicago Club had charge of the Settlement ,,ork, the Committee met once a [ devoted much time, thought, and the school business. The members ab earned $10 each for the School e 1914, Mrs. Helmick moved away icago but the Chicago club asked ain the Directorship of the School, of residence. For the following managed the School practically being able to hold conferences committee members. In making her the convention, Mrs. Helmick 1ded that the direction of the Setchool should be in the hands of the )uncil and that the general manage-:he affairs of the Settlement School, those of the treasurer, should be t the hands of the ' Grand Vice ingly the Alum= Session of Con-a 1915, authorized that the Settleool be placed under the control of f Managers appointed by the Grand nd also made the Chairman of the rational officer with all privileges as e to convention.

October, 1915, the church held meetings at Gatlinburg for two Id the school became badly disor-Ind did not recover fully until afterthe Christmas holidays. The most important thing, perhaps, which was accomplished in the school work was the grading of the classes. Improvement in singing was reported during the year. The children were learning to sing the same songs as other primary children. Too, there was a noticeable change in the faces of the children from the days when Dell Gillette spoke of the "sad faces" of the little ones. These children were learning to play games such as Fanner-in-the-Dell and to jump rope with a grape vine. There was the usual Christmas tree, also carols. Cooking classes were held for the girls in the teachers' cottage. A debating club and other school activities aroused a new spirit in the children and their people took pride in theirwork. The mothers and fathers though did not approve of the girls playing basketball in bloomers just as they disapproved of the teachers riding a horse astride. The older boys loved to sing and spent most of their time at recess and at noon singing hymns. Attendance was still a problem. The school terms were arranged in order to fit the needs of the community. As soon as the weather began to be settled in the spring all of the older children, both the boys and girls, "stopped out" to help plant corn and were busy helping with the crop until it was "laid by" about the first of July, then there was a month of respite when they had singing school and a picnic at Elkmont; by the first of August, the children were ready to attend school. For a week or two they left again to "pull fodder," then they were in again for a few days and out again to pick beans. Between times They made molasses, and then came the picking of peas. After the corn was shocked the first of November they came to school with fair regularity. During 1914-15 a new orchard of three dozen trees was started; a model hen house was built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk was laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field was cleaned and leveled, some of the picking of rocks being performed by tardy pupils, the old barn was torn down; basket-ball posts were made; a bridge was built across Baskins; about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes were set out; a straw-berry bed was started and a new garden fenced in; a new 60 foot well was dug and the teachers' residence was remodeled. THE FEBRUARY ARROW A change in routine came, however, in 1916 with the resignation of Miss Pollard who asked for a leave of absence in order to prepare for greater development of the industrial work. Miss Hughes also resigned. Elva Plank, Iowa E, took charge of the business details of the school and served as Head Resident until called home by illness the following January. There was no Head Resident during the spring session of 1917 but Mr. Norman Prickett, manual training teacher, acted as Principal of the School.she was forced to go foot, Mrs. Helmick ) men to see that the 1 The building of especial attention at One cold frosty mot of the oldest inhabit Mrs. Helmick to sa and solicitude: "Ma. it no longer ; we sail( and tell you that it that that ere watery THE CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED TO SMILE! Mr. and Mrs. Prickett who had joined the staff in 1916 were mountain born and bred with mountain sympathies and education. They were able to get in closer touch with a certain class of recluse and backward people than our more cosmopolitan Pi Phis could do. The school staff that year had grown to six. During the autumn of 1916, a ten-room teachers' residence, designed and planned by Aida and Almina Wilson, Iowa r, experienced architects, was built and was ready for occupancy by Christmas time. The house had furnace heat, running water, bath, and was modern in every respect built as a model home in addition to furnishing quarters for the teachers. All materials except the lumber, were freighted over the rough roads from the "outside." The carpenters' work was done entirely by mountain men under the guidance of an experienced builder, imported for the occasion.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots. Marjorie Jackson said ( pupils, "They are in assembly with vanced grades, and the sight of their scared faces in contrast with the eager ing faces of our regular pupils touching." Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France. Dallard Ownby Training camp, overseas service. This was the first time he ever had been away from home and he wrote of wanting to get back to the quiet of the mountains and asked how the hunting and trapping were. He left a little wife of about sixteen who was in our School for a time. Elder Ogle Enlisted in the navy April 5, 1917. Trained at Norfolk. In two weeks was sent aboard the Louisiana and was later on a transport. (Note: The boys on the Louisiana were trained by T. N.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident.

She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting. The teachers had it a great task to keep the pupils in regularly and the home visiting had this problem in some respects. Now with splendid progress being at the School there came the problem ( could be done to help the people back creeks in Sugarlands and Little Baskins and Spruce Flats, and Mill and Little Dudley. Four adjoining districts wished to their county schools which they rea were inferior to the Pi Phi School in ment, length of school year, and qu, teaching, and to send all the children School.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead. I've lived in the san for twenty years sometimes I think a sight to change. When I heered weaving I jest thought I'd quit worki field an' let the young uns do hit.

For some women like this, we emancipation from tending the others the money it brings means ne a new dress for one of the childrer of meal for the family, or a new ant piece of furniture.

The prize for the best design, an arrowhead, went to Alice Wright (Wallace) , a pledge of Wyoming A. This design was used as the basis for a trademark which was finally registered with the United States .Government through the kindness of Mr. Hadley Freeman.

Every effort was made to e workmanship on the baskets better. 1 the baskets came in as never before attic of the teachers' cottage was re-o be "running over with them." 24 the Grand Council and Settlement :ommittee voted to secure and use a rk for articles made at the School, and ad Council recommended that a con the protests of Cluett, Peabody, and Company. By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields.

He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

"The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

        THE FEBRUARY ARROW of the three most mountainous counties in Tennessee, holding a conference with the influential men at Madisonville. They inspected Jellico Plains; and attended a convention of all of the public school teachers of Sevier county at Sevierville, at which Emma Harper Turner was asked to speak. One of the teachers, Miss Mabel Moore of Greenville, Tenn., who at tended the meeting went to Miss Turner afterwards and told her about the Gat linburg community, earnestly urging that the committee visit there before making a decision relative to a site for a school. After returning to Knoxville from Sevierville, the committee made plans for a visit to Gatlinburg. Unforeseen circumstances, how-ever, arose, and Miss Turner and Miss Pettit felt it necessary to return to their homes, so Dr. Keller made the trip alone. In writing of this first trip to Little Pigeon, Dr. Keller said: "My trip began with a long distance message from Sevierville summoning me to appear there the next day when a mythical Mr. Drinnen would meet me at the train and drive me up into the mountains. Early the next morning at six-thirty I took my seat in the single passenger coach drawn by a diminutive engine, which burned wood, not coal. We puffed, snorted, and panted our way up to Sevierville, the terminal of the toy road. Arrived at the station, Mr. Drinnen, then County Superintendent of Schools, and one of the finest friends our school has ever had, met me, drove me to the hotel, and left me with the assurance he would call for me the next morning at five and drive me to Gatlin-burg where there was a community without school facilities, and without the prospect of attaining any. . . Early the next morning Mr. Drinnen appeared in a small, light buggy. His greeting was 'I am sure glad you came.' On further inquiry I elicited the information that I had `kind of that healthy look' which would be necessary to sustain me over seventeen miles of the worst road in Tennessee. At that time there were no bridges, the road to Pigeon Forge had not been built, and we forded creeks up to the floor of the buggy. The road was beautiful running along the edge of Birds Creek, bordered with mountain laurel, with here and there a grassy meadow set down right in the middle of the mountains. One funny experience we had ; we passed a man, who looked and walked as if afflicted with hookworm, and a minute later TYPICAL OLD SCHOOL HOUSE 1912 the local Washington committee be serve as a subcommittee. at the national committee be em-to send out requests for contribu-I pledges at their discretion. :onvention most enthusiastically ac-le recommendations and voted thanks rashington Alumnae Club for its sug was launched a project which has the pride of every wearer of the Dn as possible after the Convention nvestigation of possible school sites ed.

He saw the hind wheel coming and never even moved, so we had to descend and pull him out of the way, that done he rose, shook himself, gave a little yelp, and slowly betook himself elsewhere. "The first school we visited was at the Glades. It was situated on a high hill, and was the usual wooden structure of one room. All the children were dressed in calico and were bare-footed, but had bright intelligent faces, and they were clean. "The trouble with the schools seems to be "At dinner we h dodgers, ate with tiny true mountain hospit to pay for our meal ( saying that he also wa and was glad to cute] who has taught seve unusually intelligent, talk to me.

I think TYPICAL MOUNTAIN HOME NEAR GATLINBURG that few of the teachers have ever gone to a high school, and that they are teaching the same grade work they have done themselves. In this school the teacher, a man, had adopted the labor-saving device of having an older girl or boy hear the younger ones recite. "The next school was larger, there were 120 children, and the whole place was so crowded that the younger children were dismissed early to give the older ones more room. A man and a woman taught this school, and I was particularly attracted by the latter. The cry is everywhere more room needed and more teachers. Here as in the other schools we visited, both Mr. Drinnen and I gave the school a talk and in Gatlinburg, a good many of the men came to hear what we had to say.

The Committee, however, was not sure that it was what it wanted. At Wears Valley a school had been established originally under Presbyterian auspices and thus continued for a time. The property was valued at $3,000 with a comparatively large school in successful operation and supported by the good will and cooperation of the people. The entire plant was offered to Pi Beta Phi outright as a gift for the simple taking. A second meeting of the Committee was held in Philadelphia in .May "911, at the home of Anna F. T. Pettit. At this meeting a decision was reached favoring Gatlinburg for the school site instead of Wears Valley. The factors determining this were: Need, opportunities for influence as to territory and population, ability of Pi Beta Phi to meet the special local need. Gatlinburg had been settled sometime b tween 1801 and 1807 by the first settlers coming over the Indian. Gap Trail on horse-back and on foot from North and South Carolina. It was first called "The White Oak Flats," but the postoffice name was changed to Gatlinburg in honor of a man who kept a store there just before the Civil War. According to a description in one of the Committee reports: "Gatlinburg is in the eastern part of Sevier County; a center of teaming routes into the mountains; a point of large influence; no railroad connections but the prospective terminus of a branch road from Sevierville; wildly beautiful country; not a town but a community along the big road; served by rural mail carriers; has a little public school house that has not been re-roofed in 30. years; school furniture home-made and 20 years old. (Steps are being taken at present to build a new school house.) About 200 children are within school influence of this point and many very needy out-lying coves are accessible from it. The public school term usually begins in August and closes at Christmas--teachers' salary $30." The Committee appropriated $500 as a maximum limit for school expenses of the first session, that amount to be repaid to the Endowment Fund as soon as other contributions should come in. After careful study the Committee recommended that the fraternity 'ooperate with the public schools, if possible, under arrange THE FEBRUARY ARROW ments satisfactory to Pi Beta Phi, rather than to undertake an independent work since it was felt that this Public School cooperation "would be the best means of help towards Negotiations were opened at once with the School Board and citizens at Gatlinburg but delays almost disheartening attended every step, County school officials had been changed since Miss Keller 's visit and the new officials had to be informed about the proposed work and had to be interested.for the removal of `thi! among us."

Growing desperate from the delays, the National Committee at last decided not to wait longer for public school cooperation, but to enter the community by an independent and perhaps temporary school, and to con-duct all further negotiations through a representative on the field. The Grand Council officially endorsed such action. It was discovered later that one cause of many delays in getting the work started, was the fact that part of the community was op-posed to our advent for fear of a new church establishment. Such a thing had happened under similar circumstances in a nearby community. The idea of a purely altruistic project was entirely foreign to local conception. "Certain church men were particularly virulent in their opposition to us, and even after the school was established one minister prayed At last a Pi Phi was ( was forced to decline illness.

Most of the alumnm clubs were interested in the Settlement School project and up to March 15, 1912 the receipts totaled $2,775.63. It was necessary, however, to do much pioneer work in "selling" the idea of the School to many, just as it is necessary to do publicity work on any new undertaking. In 1911 one club reported: "Our club was divided somewhat on the Settlement School project. Some liked it, others did not. Those against it seemed to feel it is a missionary MISS HILL AND THE FIRST PI BETA PHI SCHOOL March 1912 letter written while she was getting open the school, Miss Hill said: y every woman I met expressed a desire your school.

Indeed you can think of of educational or settlement work that !eded at Gatlinburg. It is a splendid place efforts. Hill was authorized by the committee ge as assistant, a nurse from a train venture and thought churches covered that field." The club nevertheless loyally made a contribution. Another club wrote: "We are sorry to say that the Settlement School proposition failed to interest our club to the extent of any accomplishment." Some of the clubs raised money through benefit plays, stereopticon lectures, etc., but for the most part the first money raised was chiefly by special assessment of members voluntarily set by the clubs. As soon, however, as it was known that we had a worker in the field, interest among the clubs grew rapidly and has since kept pace with the development of the work on Little Pigeon. Miss Louise Van Sant, Maryland A, acted as chairman of special furnishing for the teach THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' cottage at Gatlinburg, leading a spirited campaign of solicitation among the clubs. The most outstanding gift was that of an organ provided by the Washington and Baltimore Clubs, for which they sacrificed their Founders' Day banquet. Mr. Percy Foster of Washington, piano dealer, furnished the organ at cost and attended to the shipment. Early reports of Miss Van Sant showed a pledge of table silver from the Los Angeles club, of linen from Boston, of a sewing ma-chine from Franklin, window shades from Baltimore, a box of rugs and books from Washington, a cereal double boiler from Philadelphia, magazine subscriptions from Syracuse, a clock from the mother of a Michigan Pi Phi, sheets and bird pictures from Carrie Flagler Shantz, of Iowa ,0, napkins and dish towels from the Chicago Alum= Club, damask towels and books and pictures from the Boston Club, and 12 yards of blackboard cloth and a box of books from St. Louis. Although January 1912 had been set as the date for the opening of the school, more than two months were required in making preparations for the opening, which took place in March with 14 pupils enrolled. The session lasted three months and dosed with 33 enrolled. This first Pi Beta Phi school was held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, destined to be-come famous in later years as the Arrowcraft Shop. On June 28, Miss Hill gave a school pro-gram which was pronounced a great success and it was said that "nothing like it had ever been held there before."

This term expired reasons. This brought a visible sigh of relief in the audience, and the spell was broken, as one by one they spoke earnestly and thoughtfully." The people, especially the women, begged that the school remain in the Burg. Two of the most interested persons were Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff. They were not natives of the community, but had come in. Mrs. Huff was born in another part of Tennessee and Mr. Huff's home state was Pennsylvania. Mr. Huff owned large lumber interests. They were progressive people and wanted education for SCHOOL BUILDING USED BY PI BETA PHI: AUGUST 1912, 1913, 1914 tuber 30, since a term from August nher was all that the public funds 'ply. ptember 1912, Mrs. Helmick, as of the Committee, made a trip to rg with a view to selecting a build-She called a community meeting and people about Pi Beta Phi and ex-bat the fraternity proposed to give permanent, lasting gift in a new Mrs. Helmick had finished her talk d for expressions from the audience s not a sound.

I replied," Helmick, " `No one church, and yet Christian churches' and gave the their four children who were then in the school. In trying to find a suitable building site, Mrs. Helmick told Mr. Huff that in the progressive west where she lived, when an enterprise like the Settlement School thought of coming to a place permanently, "it was customary if the people wanted it, for the business men to get together, and offer an inducement to its coming." She explained that she had been obliged to hunt up proper-ties and to urge men to put a reasonable valuation upon their land when they had a month ago expressed a desire to sell. Mr. Huff took his cue and before Mrs. Helmick left that afternoon, met her on the road to tell her that: "We men have gotten together, and if you folks want the Richard ogle place, and you feel $2000 is too much, I have a man who will give you $800 for the store, and if THE 'FEBRUARY ARROW $1200 is more than you want to pay, we propose making up the difference among us. We want your school right here. ' e know Miss Hill and we know what you have done, and we stand together to do anything you wish to keep you here. Please don't let any-thing influence you to go elsewhere." The next day the County Superintendent, J. S. Keeble, after talking with Mr. Huff, made the proposition that the fraternity take the entire charge of the school management in the Gatlinburg district. He offered to give a clear, absolute deed to all the public school property, including a new building valued at $1000 which stood on a bill overlooking the Burg, and to turn over, in cash, the pay allotted the school teachers by the school authorities annually, without a "string" of any kind, as long as Pi Beta Phi maintained a public and free school in the lower grades. As a result of her trip to Tennessee, Mrs. Helmick asked the Chicago Club to authorize the Sub-Committee to hire an assistant to Miss Hill; to take over the public school property and obligation; to buy the necessary property; and to put up the necessary buildings, with the understanding that all was to be done when the money was available. The club gave the authorization. A vivid description of the "closes" of the school on November 30, 1912 was written by Kate B. Miller of the Committee after she had visited Gatlinburg. Miss Miller said: "They had come at night, some of them at half-past six, though that was the bedtime of many of them. They had come from up Baskins' way, on Mill Creek, down Roaring Brook, farther up Little Pigeon, from Holy Top, and Dick's Range, over devious mountain trails and rocky, muddy mountain roads of so modest a nature that they were often difficult to find. Most of them came afoot, carrying babies, leading little children, and lighting their uncertain way with lamps and lanterns. Their goal was the school house on the small high nob, which had but one way of rational approach. The person who sought to scale the rocky bluff of seventy-five or a hundred feet from. the Roaring Brook side or the Little Pigeon and bad road side would have stood small chance of reaching Minerva's temple on top. And so they plodded along the meandering muddy road, around and up the hill. They were all there waiting when Miss Hill, Miss Gillette, Mrs. J. R. Keeble, the County Superintendent of Schools, Dr. E. A.

The presented by Worth Schantz, the )n of Carrie Flagler Schantz, Iowa 0. after taking up her work at the Miss Gillette organized the older the School and Gatlinburg into a club which met every Friday after noon. The first piece of work which each made was a white linen collar. While the girls sewed "Miss Dell" or someone reed aloud. For the boys, Miss Gillette adopted certain Boy Scout rules for behaviour and development in two baseball teams. One was an indoor team which played in the abandoned Methodist Church, and the other was a regular outside team which played in the "flats." The school closed on the last of March. For the first time in the history of the community, the children had gone to school for eight months in one year! Although the school had progressed splendidly and Pi Beta Phi had made wonderful friends in the community, two things happened which almost caused the withdrawal of the fraternity from Gatlinburg to some other locality. It will be recalled that the county superintendent had assured the Committee that the whole school situation would be given into Pi Beta Phi's control, but Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller found upon their arrival at Gatlinburg in July 1913, that although al-most everyone in the community wanted Pi Beta Phi to conduct the school, a local man was hired through a misunderstanding. By the opening of the next term, however, the misunderstanding had been deared. The Board voted that after Christmas, the public school building should be given to PI Beta Phi for its use and that another year the fraternity should have the whole school situation in its hands. The next and very vital matter to be settled was that of acquiring land. Although several places were considered, the only really desirable tract seemed to be that owned by E. E. Ogle, but the men of the village did not think that he would sell even if the money could be raised. Despite the fact that the men had some time before agreed to help with the purchase of property for the school, they now seemed to hang back and to want Pi Beta Phi to try to raise the money and to persuade Mr. Ogle to sell. It was not that they were shirking a promise but rather that they had never assisted with the promotion of any community project such as this and seemingly did not know how to go about it. Mrs. Helmick talked with Mr. Ogle and found that he would sell for $1800. If the fraternity would put in $600 and the men of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the community, $1.200, the land no doubt could be obtained. . Since the matter had dragged along for months with nothing accomplished, Mrs. Helmick issued an ultimatum saying that if the Ogle land were not obtained for the fraternity (we contributing $600) by the next day at noon, Pi Beta Phi would go elsewhere and establish a school where land would be given to us. Kate Miller's graphic description shows the tenseness of the situation: We now wondered what they would do. They were at last convinced that "those wimmin" meant what they said, We packed our trunks, began to get the household things ready to leave until we should have them sent elsewhere, ordered the hack from Sevierville to come for us the next day, and wondered what the next twenty-four hours would bring forth. Mr. Huff was sent for in his lumber camp eight miles away; everyone gave up his busi ness and those who had no lousiness gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for a public affair. They said that there was no one who could go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Andy Huff was drawn forth. As think back over the stirring weeks, it seems to me that nothing which came cut of them will be of greater good to these men and women than this: the knowledge that they can do things themselves. Tuesday evening we had many callers, three of the women staying until after dark. They said they just couldn't let us go, that they knew the men would try their best, but that perhaps they couldn't raise enough money. For women in the mountains to stay out after dark was a violation of their social code, but they were forgetting even their social customs now. The next morning while we were at breakfast, Mr. Huff and Steve Whaley came to get us to draw up a subscription paper. Mrs. Helmick wrote the heading for one, putting Pi Beta Phi down for $600. Andy Huff put down $250 and Steve Whaley $250. Then they started off saying that the hack would not take us back. After the men had left, Mrs. Huff came to us and told us of her dream. She dropped into a chair in our kitchen as we were washing the dishes that morning and said: "I had a dream last night." It seemed that she had dreamt that she and the children were all down by the river bank playing. The children had pushed through the bushes and had slipped down to the river bed where they were playing on the dry gravelly bottom in the pools. She had stayed up on the road and suddenly she looked up the river to the distant mountains that seemed to close it in. There she saw rising and clinging to the mountain sides a "big steam, a fog." Then the fog began to roll in clouds, and to come down the river slowly. It kept getting bigger and bigger and kept rolling and rolling down towards the place where the children were playing. Her eyes grew large and her voice tense as the vividness of her vision cameback to her. She repeater fog kept rolling and rollii bigger and coming down the river she also saw, in danger, the Reagan an, thought that the fog was as her own children.

That was the beginning of the first year in our own buildings and with entirely Pi Phi teachers. Two months later, Miss Langmaid re-signed and was succeeded by Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, who was given the title of Head Resident. The outstanding accomplishment of the year 1913-14, in addition to the acquiring of the land, was the building of a new school building, plans for which had been drawn originally by Mr. and Mrs. Von Hoist of Chicago, Mrs. Von Hoist (Lucy Hammond, Colorado B) , being a member of the Chicago Alumnae Club. This new building, a one-story frame structure 60 x 84 feet, with its rather low, projecting roof, resembled a bungalow and was built at an approximate cost of $3,735.30. The main entrance was from a porch into a large hall, from which five class rooms opened, one on each side, and three in the rear. The hall was used as a reading and rest room. A large fireplace was opposite the entrance. The three class rooms at the rear were separated by sliding doors which could be thrown back, making the room into one large room. In December the work of the school having increased to such proportions, Miss Pollard requested two additional teachers and Leah Stock (Helmick) , Michigan A, and Edith Wilson, Indiana A, volunteered their services. The session closed on April 3 with 127 pupils. During the year the young orchard was pruned and cared for; gardens were planted and were worked "on shares," and much thought was given to beautifying the grounds. The Department of Agriculture at Washington furnished the school with a liberal supply of bulbs, shrubs, and seeds, which were planted to good effect. A Tomato Club the only one in Sevier county was organized by Miss Virginia Moore, state organizer of Tomato Canning Clubs for girls. Dr. Yancy, the state hookworm specialist, made three visits to the school and con-ducted a free clinic during the summer months. Miss Pollard remained at the school during the summer, giving her time and strength without reserve, walking miles and miles to tell the people of the danger of hookworm and urging them to come in to receive the free treatment at the Pi Phi school. She assisted the doctor personally in giving out medicines and in making examinations. THE FEBRUARY ARROW The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee reported at the end of the school year that a fund had been started by three of our Founders, with the result that $150 was then in the bank for the establishment of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital at Gatlinburg, in loving memory of Jennie Nicol of "Alpha." Late in June, the Settlement School Committee sent out attractive invitations to the dedication of the new school building which took place on July 9.

Onken, Anne Stuart, and Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) were in attendance and as sisted in preparing for the guests of the day whom they entertained at luncheon. Extracts from the description of the dedi cation of Pi Beta Phi's first school building, as recorded by Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) follow: Long before the appointed time on that sultry summer day guests from a distance began to arrive; they came on foot and on horseback; a few rode in buggies or mountain wagons but the vast majority patronized the "shoe leather express," walking five, eight, or even ten miles to be present at the great occasion. The seats, desks and other school furniture had already been placed, and the fire-place in the entrance hall was banked with ferns and wild flowers, for every effort was made to decorate our building as a northern school building would be decked on a similar occasion. The first to arrive were Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A, and her friend, Miss Walker, who had driven up from Sevierville. Then came Vera Kerr Kessler, Massachusetts A, and her husband, Lt. Kessler, U. S. Navy, who had been spending a few days at Wonderland Park, a mountain resort some nine miles from Gatlinburg. Hearing of the dedication they came over with two friends, Miss Oldman and Miss Hazard.

She was a remarkable woman, having raised her family of children after her husband was killed almost on her doorstep during the Civil War. The "Aunt Lyddie" baskets were known far and wide. In March 1915, Miss Pollard wrote to THE ARROW: "We are hoping to emphasize the industrial side of our work more and more. We are hoping to start basket making in the school, hoping that it will prove a profitable industry. Many of the women make exquisite patchwork quilts and some still mare the hand woven coverlids and blankets. If a sale could be found for these articles, many might undertake the work." And that is where the alumnae department of Pi Beta Phi has accomplished a marvelous work by making a "sale for these articles." In May of that year, Caroline Mc Knight Hughes, Minnesota A, a graduate of the University of Michigan, of Cooper Union School of Art and of Prang Normal, took charge of the business and industrial work, spending some time in the summer looking the situation over, and starting the fall as Head Resident in charge of industrial work, with Mary O. Pollard as Principal of the school. Miss Hughes installed a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 with which she gave instruction to 52 boys and a beginning was made of a department which it was hoped in time would be of great benefit to the community and to the school. It was noised about that "them wimmin" were going to "teach tools," and the curiosity of the Burg was so great that some of the residents ran down the country road to meet the wagon bringing in the tools. All they saw were some boxes, nailed up tight, and some crates with they knew not what inside. The excitement and curiosity was equal to a circus coming to town and when the five benches were in place, with the tools set out, every man and boy able to come to the School, did so. Apparently no one knew much about tools, except the saw, plane and hammer, and the first day of class work was a queer one. As soon as possible the weaving department was equipped, spinning bees and quilting parties were given with the hope of reviving those almost lost industries. For the first time in the fall of 1915 the school began the sale of baskets, purchasing THE FEBRUARY ARROW THE LOOMS ARE PUT TO WORK materials and articles for the industrial work, trying to raise the standard of workmanship, and endeavoring to find a market for the products. In urging the revival of industrial work, Miss Hughes said: "In the yesteryear this country was a community of weavers, but after the War `store cloth' was cheap so that one woman after another put the old loom aside, but many of our neighbors today know how to spin and weave though it has been a 'tol'able long spell' since any of them havedone such a thing. 01 the school, has her willing to make `kivi dear to the hearts o the women still use twist stocking yarn flax has disappeared. mond Dyes to color ti cent know how to m; roots, weeds, etc. Al are either the one `g from Car'liny when THE FEBRUARY ARROW these old ones, and of course one are crude homemade affairs.

Hlughes instructed the children in the art of weaving tiny rugs, mats mocks. In response to her call for in the work, the Springfield, Mo., ed $100 for the buying of looms. the first year that the Chicago Club had charge of the Settlement ,,ork, the Committee met once a [ devoted much time, thought, and the school business. The members ab earned $10 each for the School e 1914, Mrs. Helmick moved away icago but the Chicago club asked ain the Directorship of the School, of residence. For the following managed the School practically being able to hold conferences committee members. In making her the convention, Mrs. Helmick 1ded that the direction of the Setchool should be in the hands of the )uncil and that the general manage-:he affairs of the Settlement School, those of the treasurer, should be t the hands of the ' Grand Vice ingly the Alum= Session of Con-a 1915, authorized that the Settleool be placed under the control of f Managers appointed by the Grand nd also made the Chairman of the rational officer with all privileges as e to convention.

October, 1915, the church held meetings at Gatlinburg for two Id the school became badly disor-Ind did not recover fully until afterthe Christmas holidays. The most important thing, perhaps, which was accomplished in the school work was the grading of the classes. Improvement in singing was reported during the year. The children were learning to sing the same songs as other primary children. Too, there was a noticeable change in the faces of the children from the days when Dell Gillette spoke of the "sad faces" of the little ones. These children were learning to play games such as Fanner-in-the-Dell and to jump rope with a grape vine. There was the usual Christmas tree, also carols. Cooking classes were held for the girls in the teachers' cottage. A debating club and other school activities aroused a new spirit in the children and their people took pride in theirwork. The mothers and fathers though did not approve of the girls playing basketball in bloomers just as they disapproved of the teachers riding a horse astride. The older boys loved to sing and spent most of their time at recess and at noon singing hymns. Attendance was still a problem. The school terms were arranged in order to fit the needs of the community. As soon as the weather began to be settled in the spring all of the older children, both the boys and girls, "stopped out" to help plant corn and were busy helping with the crop until it was "laid by" about the first of July, then there was a month of respite when they had singing school and a picnic at Elkmont; by the first of August, the children were ready to attend school. For a week or two they left again to "pull fodder," then they were in again for a few days and out again to pick beans. Between times They made molasses, and then came the picking of peas. After the corn was shocked the first of November they came to school with fair regularity. During 1914-15 a new orchard of three dozen trees was started; a model hen house was built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk was laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field was cleaned and leveled, some of the picking of rocks being performed by tardy pupils, the old barn was torn down; basket-ball posts were made; a bridge was built across Baskins; about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes were set out; a straw-berry bed was started and a new garden fenced in; a new 60 foot well was dug and the teachers' residence was remodeled. THE FEBRUARY ARROW A change in routine came, however, in 1916 with the resignation of Miss Pollard who asked for a leave of absence in order to prepare for greater development of the industrial work. Miss Hughes also resigned. Elva Plank, Iowa E, took charge of the business details of the school and served as Head Resident until called home by illness the following January. There was no Head Resident during the spring session of 1917 but Mr. Norman Prickett, manual training teacher, acted as Principal of the School.she was forced to go foot, Mrs. Helmick ) men to see that the 1 The building of especial attention at One cold frosty mot of the oldest inhabit Mrs. Helmick to sa and solicitude: "Ma. it no longer ; we sail( and tell you that it that that ere watery THE CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED TO SMILE! Mr. and Mrs. Prickett who had joined the staff in 1916 were mountain born and bred with mountain sympathies and education. They were able to get in closer touch with a certain class of recluse and backward people than our more cosmopolitan Pi Phis could do. The school staff that year had grown to six. During the autumn of 1916, a ten-room teachers' residence, designed and planned by Aida and Almina Wilson, Iowa r, experienced architects, was built and was ready for occupancy by Christmas time. The house had furnace heat, running water, bath, and was modern in every respect built as a model home in addition to furnishing quarters for the teachers. All materials except the lumber, were freighted over the rough roads from the "outside." The carpenters' work was done entirely by mountain men under the guidance of an experienced builder, imported for the occasion.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots. Marjorie Jackson said ( pupils, "They are in assembly with vanced grades, and the sight of their scared faces in contrast with the eager ing faces of our regular pupils touching." Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France. Dallard Ownby Training camp, overseas service. This was the first time he ever had been away from home and he wrote of wanting to get back to the quiet of the mountains and asked how the hunting and trapping were.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident.

Bishop, ay College at Sevier-end of the Settlement ag. Until the time of ras never too busy to early visitor to the cate position. She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting. The teachers had it a great task to keep the pupils in regularly and the home visiting had this problem in some respects. Now with splendid progress being at the School there came the problem ( could be done to help the people back creeks in Sugarlands and Little Baskins and Spruce Flats, and Mill and Little Dudley. Four adjoining districts wished to their county schools which they rea were inferior to the Pi Phi School in ment, length of school year, and qu, teaching, and to send all the children School.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead. I've lived in the san for twenty years sometimes I think a sight to change. When I heered weaving I jest thought I'd quit worki field an' let the young uns do hit.

For some women like this, we emancipation from tending the others the money it brings means ne a new dress for one of the childrer of meal for the family, or a new ant piece of furniture.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality. Among the improve 1922-23 was the con; water reservoir with a i ions, which appreciabI3 ard. Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

"The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop.

In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ? This is a question often asked and rarely answered. We can .only suggest possible means.

The Committee, however, was not sure that it was what it wanted. At Wears Valley a school had been established originally under Presbyterian auspices and thus continued for a time. The property was valued at $3,000 with a comparatively large school in successful operation and supported by the good will and cooperation of the people. The entire plant was offered to Pi Beta Phi outright as a gift for the simple taking. A second meeting of the Committee was held in Philadelphia in .May "911, at the home of Anna F. T. Pettit. At this meeting a decision was reached favoring Gatlinburg for the school site instead of Wears Valley. The factors determining this were: Need, opportunities for influence as to territory and population, ability of Pi Beta Phi to meet the special local need. Gatlinburg had been settled sometime b tween 1801 and 1807 by the first settlers coming over the Indian. Gap Trail on horse-back and on foot from North and South Carolina. It was first called "The White Oak Flats," but the postoffice name was changed to Gatlinburg in honor of a man who kept a store there just before the Civil War. According to a description in one of the Committee reports: "Gatlinburg is in the eastern part of Sevier County; a center of teaming routes into the mountains; a point of large influence; no railroad connections but the prospective terminus of a branch road from Sevierville; wildly beautiful country; not a town but a community along the big road; served by rural mail carriers; has a little public school house that has not been re-roofed in 30. years; school furniture home-made and 20 years old. (Steps are being taken at present to build a new school house.) About 200 children are within school influence of this point and many very needy out-lying coves are accessible from it. The public school term usually begins in August and closes at Christmas--teachers' salary $30." The Committee appropriated $500 as a maximum limit for school expenses of the first session, that amount to be repaid to the Endowment Fund as soon as other contributions should come in. After careful study the Committee recommended that the fraternity 'ooperate with the public schools, if possible, under arrange THE FEBRUARY ARROW ments satisfactory to Pi Beta Phi, rather than to undertake an independent work since it was felt that this Public School cooperation "would be the best means of help towards Negotiations were opened at once with the School Board and citizens at Gatlinburg but delays almost disheartening attended every step, County school officials had been changed since Miss Keller 's visit and the new officials had to be informed about the proposed work and had to be interested.for the removal of `thi! among us." In January 1912, a sc mittee was authorized b mittee to make all arrar of the first school sessic consist of delegates frog B.

Growing desperate from the delays, the National Committee at last decided not to wait longer for public school cooperation, but to enter the community by an independent and perhaps temporary school, and to con-duct all further negotiations through a representative on the field. The Grand Council officially endorsed such action. It was discovered later that one cause of many delays in getting the work started, was the fact that part of the community was op-posed to our advent for fear of a new church establishment. Such a thing had happened under similar circumstances in a nearby community. The idea of a purely altruistic project was entirely foreign to local conception. "Certain church men were particularly virulent in their opposition to us, and even after the school was established one minister prayed At last a Pi Phi was ( was forced to decline illness.

Since there was no near or on the field "n cretion was necessarily the matter of equipmer preliminary trip of hive$ merits, rental of a hous simple essentials, kitche of domestic science tea( THE FEBRUARY ARROW at, and materials for kindergarten."

Most of the alumnm clubs were interested in the Settlement School project and up to March 15, 1912 the receipts totaled $2,775.63. It was necessary, however, to do much pioneer work in "selling" the idea of the School to many, just as it is necessary to do publicity work on any new undertaking. In 1911 one club reported: "Our club was divided somewhat on the Settlement School project. Some liked it, others did not. Those against it seemed to feel it is a missionary MISS HILL AND THE FIRST PI BETA PHI SCHOOL March 1912 letter written while she was getting open the school, Miss Hill said: y every woman I met expressed a desire your school.

Indeed you can think of of educational or settlement work that !eded at Gatlinburg. It is a splendid place efforts. Hill was authorized by the committee ge as assistant, a nurse from a train venture and thought churches covered that field." The club nevertheless loyally made a contribution. Another club wrote: "We are sorry to say that the Settlement School proposition failed to interest our club to the extent of any accomplishment." Some of the clubs raised money through benefit plays, stereopticon lectures, etc., but for the most part the first money raised was chiefly by special assessment of members voluntarily set by the clubs. As soon, however, as it was known that we had a worker in the field, interest among the clubs grew rapidly and has since kept pace with the development of the work on Little Pigeon. Miss Louise Van Sant, Maryland A, acted as chairman of special furnishing for the teach THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' cottage at Gatlinburg, leading a spirited campaign of solicitation among the clubs. The most outstanding gift was that of an organ provided by the Washington and Baltimore Clubs, for which they sacrificed their Founders' Day banquet. Mr. Percy Foster of Washington, piano dealer, furnished the organ at cost and attended to the shipment. Early reports of Miss Van Sant showed a pledge of table silver from the Los Angeles club, of linen from Boston, of a sewing ma-chine from Franklin, window shades from Baltimore, a box of rugs and books from Washington, a cereal double boiler from Philadelphia, magazine subscriptions from Syracuse, a clock from the mother of a Michigan Pi Phi, sheets and bird pictures from Carrie Flagler Shantz, of Iowa ,0, napkins and dish towels from the Chicago Alum= Club, damask towels and books and pictures from the Boston Club, and 12 yards of blackboard cloth and a box of books from St. Louis. Although January 1912 had been set as the date for the opening of the school, more than two months were required in making preparations for the opening, which took place in March with 14 pupils enrolled. The session lasted three months and dosed with 33 enrolled. This first Pi Beta Phi school was held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, destined to be-come famous in later years as the Arrowcraft Shop. On June 28, Miss Hill gave a school pro-gram which was pronounced a great success and it was said that "nothing like it had ever been held there before."

The people, especially the women, begged that the school remain in the Burg. Two of the most interested persons were Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff. They were not natives of the community, but had come in. Mrs. Huff was born in another part of Tennessee and Mr. Huff's home state was Pennsylvania. Mr. Huff owned large lumber interests. They were progressive people and wanted education for SCHOOL BUILDING USED BY PI BETA PHI: AUGUST 1912, 1913, 1914 tuber 30, since a term from August nher was all that the public funds 'ply. ptember 1912, Mrs. Helmick, as of the Committee, made a trip to rg with a view to selecting a build-She called a community meeting and people about Pi Beta Phi and ex-bat the fraternity proposed to give permanent, lasting gift in a new Mrs. Helmick had finished her talk d for expressions from the audience s not a sound.

I replied," Helmick, " `No one church, and yet Christian churches' and gave the their four children who were then in the school. In trying to find a suitable building site, Mrs. Helmick told Mr. Huff that in the progressive west where she lived, when an enterprise like the Settlement School thought of coming to a place permanently, "it was customary if the people wanted it, for the business men to get together, and offer an inducement to its coming." She explained that she had been obliged to hunt up proper-ties and to urge men to put a reasonable valuation upon their land when they had a month ago expressed a desire to sell. Mr. Huff took his cue and before Mrs. Helmick left that afternoon, met her on the road to tell her that: "We men have gotten together, and if you folks want the Richard ogle place, and you feel $2000 is too much, I have a man who will give you $800 for the store, and if THE 'FEBRUARY ARROW $1200 is more than you want to pay, we propose making up the difference among us. We want your school right here. ' e know Miss Hill and we know what you have done, and we stand together to do anything you wish to keep you here. Please don't let any-thing influence you to go elsewhere." The next day the County Superintendent, J. S. Keeble, after talking with Mr. Huff, made the proposition that the fraternity take the entire charge of the school management in the Gatlinburg district. He offered to give a clear, absolute deed to all the public school property, including a new building valued at $1000 which stood on a bill overlooking the Burg, and to turn over, in cash, the pay allotted the school teachers by the school authorities annually, without a "string" of any kind, as long as Pi Beta Phi maintained a public and free school in the lower grades. As a result of her trip to Tennessee, Mrs. Helmick asked the Chicago Club to authorize the Sub-Committee to hire an assistant to Miss Hill; to take over the public school property and obligation; to buy the necessary property; and to put up the necessary buildings, with the understanding that all was to be done when the money was available. The club gave the authorization. A vivid description of the "closes" of the school on November 30, 1912 was written by Kate B. Miller of the Committee after she had visited Gatlinburg. Miss Miller said: "They had come at night, some of them at half-past six, though that was the bedtime of many of them. They had come from up Baskins' way, on Mill Creek, down Roaring Brook, farther up Little Pigeon, from Holy Top, and Dick's Range, over devious mountain trails and rocky, muddy mountain roads of so modest a nature that they were often difficult to find. Most of them came afoot, carrying babies, leading little children, and lighting their uncertain way with lamps and lanterns. Their goal was the school house on the small high nob, which had but one way of rational approach. The person who sought to scale the rocky bluff of seventy-five or a hundred feet from. the Roaring Brook side or the Little Pigeon and bad road side would have stood small chance of reaching Minerva's temple on top. And so they plodded along the meandering muddy road, around and up the hill. They were all there waiting when Miss Hill, Miss Gillette, Mrs. J. R. Keeble, the County Superintendent of Schools, Dr. E. A. Bishop, the president of Murray College, and I stumbled our lamp down and up the slim Phi cottage, half a mil( lute quiet during the p except by the processi who passed to and fry the stove reserved for warm themselves, and DELL GILLET First Pi Beta Phi Teach as one and all at vari( necks to see how the , the efforts of the chile sided with boards, w2. the lamps and lantern had brought.

The first piece of work which each made was a white linen collar. While the girls sewed "Miss Dell" or someone reed aloud. For the boys, Miss Gillette adopted certain Boy Scout rules for behaviour and development in two baseball teams. One was an indoor team which played in the abandoned Methodist Church, and the other was a regular outside team which played in the "flats." The school closed on the last of March. For the first time in the history of the community, the children had gone to school for eight months in one year! Although the school had progressed splendidly and Pi Beta Phi had made wonderful friends in the community, two things happened which almost caused the withdrawal of the fraternity from Gatlinburg to some other locality. It will be recalled that the county superintendent had assured the Committee that the whole school situation would be given into Pi Beta Phi's control, but Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller found upon their arrival at Gatlinburg in July 1913, that although al-most everyone in the community wanted Pi Beta Phi to conduct the school, a local man was hired through a misunderstanding. By the opening of the next term, however, the misunderstanding had been deared. The Board voted that after Christmas, the public school building should be given to PI Beta Phi for its use and that another year the fraternity should have the whole school situation in its hands. The next and very vital matter to be settled was that of acquiring land. Although several places were considered, the only really desirable tract seemed to be that owned by E. E. Ogle, but the men of the village did not think that he would sell even if the money could be raised. Despite the fact that the men had some time before agreed to help with the purchase of property for the school, they now seemed to hang back and to want Pi Beta Phi to try to raise the money and to persuade Mr. Ogle to sell. It was not that they were shirking a promise but rather that they had never assisted with the promotion of any community project such as this and seemingly did not know how to go about it. Mrs. Helmick talked with Mr. Ogle and found that he would sell for $1800. If the fraternity would put in $600 and the men of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the community, $1.200, the land no doubt could be obtained. . Since the matter had dragged along for months with nothing accomplished, Mrs. Helmick issued an ultimatum saying that if the Ogle land were not obtained for the fraternity (we contributing $600) by the next day at noon, Pi Beta Phi would go elsewhere and establish a school where land would be given to us. Kate Miller's graphic description shows the tenseness of the situation: We now wondered what they would do. They were at last convinced that "those wimmin" meant what they said, We packed our trunks, began to get the household things ready to leave until we should have them sent elsewhere, ordered the hack from Sevierville to come for us the next day, and wondered what the next twenty-four hours would bring forth. Mr. Huff was sent for in his lumber camp eight miles away; everyone gave up his busi ness and those who had no lousiness gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for a public affair. They said that there was no one who could go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Andy Huff was drawn forth. As think back over the stirring weeks, it seems to me that nothing which came cut of them will be of greater good to these men and women than this: the knowledge that they can do things themselves. Tuesday evening we had many callers, three of the women staying until after dark. They said they just couldn't let us go, that they knew the men would try their best, but that perhaps they couldn't raise enough money. For women in the mountains to stay out after dark was a violation of their social code, but they were forgetting even their social customs now. The next morning while we were at breakfast, Mr. Huff and Steve Whaley came to get us to draw up a subscription paper. Mrs. Helmick wrote the heading for one, putting Pi Beta Phi down for $600. Andy Huff put down $250 and Steve Whaley $250. Then they started off saying that the hack would not take us back. After the men had left, Mrs. Huff came to us and told us of her dream. She dropped into a chair in our kitchen as we were washing the dishes that morning and said: "I had a dream last night." It seemed that she had dreamt that she and the children were all down by the river bank playing. The children had pushed through the bushes and had slipped down to the river bed where they were playing on the dry gravelly bottom in the pools. She had stayed up on the road and suddenly she looked up the river to the distant mountains that seemed to close it in. There she saw rising and clinging to the mountain sides a "big steam, a fog." Then the fog began to roll in clouds, and to come down the river slowly. It kept getting bigger and bigger and kept rolling and rolling down towards the place where the children were playing. Her eyes grew large and her voice tense as the vividness of her vision cameback to her. She repeater fog kept rolling and rollii bigger and coming down the river she also saw, in danger, the Reagan an, thought that the fog was as her own children.

Asheville, N.C., asking if she could y help, was sent for. ugust 4, 1913, Kate Miller assisted ,angmaid in opening the school in old school house on Baskins and peon. That was the beginning of the first year in our own buildings and with entirely Pi Phi teachers. Two months later, Miss Langmaid re-signed and was succeeded by Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, who was given the title of Head Resident. The outstanding accomplishment of the year 1913-14, in addition to the acquiring of the land, was the building of a new school building, plans for which had been drawn originally by Mr. and Mrs. Von Hoist of Chicago, Mrs. Von Hoist (Lucy Hammond, Colorado B) , being a member of the Chicago Alumnae Club. This new building, a one-story frame structure 60 x 84 feet, with its rather low, projecting roof, resembled a bungalow and was built at an approximate cost of $3,735.30. The main entrance was from a porch into a large hall, from which five class rooms opened, one on each side, and three in the rear. The hall was used as a reading and rest room. A large fireplace was opposite the entrance. The three class rooms at the rear were separated by sliding doors which could be thrown back, making the room into one large room. In December the work of the school having increased to such proportions, Miss Pollard requested two additional teachers and Leah Stock (Helmick) , Michigan A, and Edith Wilson, Indiana A, volunteered their services. The session closed on April 3 with 127 pupils. During the year the young orchard was pruned and cared for; gardens were planted and were worked "on shares," and much thought was given to beautifying the grounds. The Department of Agriculture at Washington furnished the school with a liberal supply of bulbs, shrubs, and seeds, which were planted to good effect. A Tomato Club the only one in Sevier county was organized by Miss Virginia Moore, state organizer of Tomato Canning Clubs for girls. Dr. Yancy, the state hookworm specialist, made three visits to the school and con-ducted a free clinic during the summer months. Miss Pollard remained at the school during the summer, giving her time and strength without reserve, walking miles and miles to tell the people of the danger of hookworm and urging them to come in to receive the free treatment at the Pi Phi school. She assisted the doctor personally in giving out medicines and in making examinations. THE FEBRUARY ARROW The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee reported at the end of the school year that a fund had been started by three of our Founders, with the result that $150 was then in the bank for the establishment of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital at Gatlinburg, in loving memory of Jennie Nicol of "Alpha." Late in June, the Settlement School Committee sent out attractive invitations to the dedication of the new school building which took place on July 9.

Onken, Anne Stuart, and Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) were in attendance and as sisted in preparing for the guests of the day whom they entertained at luncheon. Extracts from the description of the dedi cation of Pi Beta Phi's first school building, as recorded by Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) follow: Long before the appointed time on that sultry summer day guests from a distance began to arrive; they came on foot and on horseback; a few rode in buggies or mountain wagons but the vast majority patronized the "shoe leather express," walking five, eight, or even ten miles to be present at the great occasion. The seats, desks and other school furniture had already been placed, and the fire-place in the entrance hall was banked with ferns and wild flowers, for every effort was made to decorate our building as a northern school building would be decked on a similar occasion. The first to arrive were Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A, and her friend, Miss Walker, who had driven up from Sevierville. Then came Vera Kerr Kessler, Massachusetts A, and her husband, Lt. Kessler, U. S. Navy, who had been spending a few days at Wonderland Park, a mountain resort some nine miles from Gatlinburg. Hearing of the dedication they came over with two friends, Miss Oldman and Miss Hazard.

She was a remarkable woman, having raised her family of children after her husband was killed almost on her doorstep during the Civil War. The "Aunt Lyddie" baskets were known far and wide. In March 1915, Miss Pollard wrote to THE ARROW: "We are hoping to emphasize the industrial side of our work more and more. We are hoping to start basket making in the school, hoping that it will prove a profitable industry. Many of the women make exquisite patchwork quilts and some still mare the hand woven coverlids and blankets. If a sale could be found for these articles, many might undertake the work." And that is where the alumnae department of Pi Beta Phi has accomplished a marvelous work by making a "sale for these articles." In May of that year, Caroline Mc Knight Hughes, Minnesota A, a graduate of the University of Michigan, of Cooper Union School of Art and of Prang Normal, took charge of the business and industrial work, spending some time in the summer looking the situation over, and starting the fall as Head Resident in charge of industrial work, with Mary O. Pollard as Principal of the school. Miss Hughes installed a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 with which she gave instruction to 52 boys and a beginning was made of a department which it was hoped in time would be of great benefit to the community and to the school. It was noised about that "them wimmin" were going to "teach tools," and the curiosity of the Burg was so great that some of the residents ran down the country road to meet the wagon bringing in the tools. All they saw were some boxes, nailed up tight, and some crates with they knew not what inside. The excitement and curiosity was equal to a circus coming to town and when the five benches were in place, with the tools set out, every man and boy able to come to the School, did so. Apparently no one knew much about tools, except the saw, plane and hammer, and the first day of class work was a queer one. As soon as possible the weaving department was equipped, spinning bees and quilting parties were given with the hope of reviving those almost lost industries. For the first time in the fall of 1915 the school began the sale of baskets, purchasing THE FEBRUARY ARROW THE LOOMS ARE PUT TO WORK materials and articles for the industrial work, trying to raise the standard of workmanship, and endeavoring to find a market for the products. In urging the revival of industrial work, Miss Hughes said: "In the yesteryear this country was a community of weavers, but after the War `store cloth' was cheap so that one woman after another put the old loom aside, but many of our neighbors today know how to spin and weave though it has been a 'tol'able long spell' since any of them havedone such a thing. 01 the school, has her willing to make `kivi dear to the hearts o the women still use twist stocking yarn flax has disappeared. mond Dyes to color ti cent know how to m; roots, weeds, etc. Al are either the one `g from Car'liny when THE FEBRUARY ARROW these old ones, and of course one are crude homemade affairs.

Hlughes instructed the children in the art of weaving tiny rugs, mats mocks. In response to her call for in the work, the Springfield, Mo., ed $100 for the buying of looms. the first year that the Chicago Club had charge of the Settlement ,,ork, the Committee met once a [ devoted much time, thought, and the school business. The members ab earned $10 each for the School e 1914, Mrs. Helmick moved away icago but the Chicago club asked ain the Directorship of the School, of residence. For the following managed the School practically being able to hold conferences committee members. In making her the convention, Mrs. Helmick 1ded that the direction of the Setchool should be in the hands of the )uncil and that the general manage-:he affairs of the Settlement School, those of the treasurer, should be t the hands of the ' Grand Vice ingly the Alum= Session of Con-a 1915, authorized that the Settleool be placed under the control of f Managers appointed by the Grand nd also made the Chairman of the rational officer with all privileges as e to convention.

October, 1915, the church held meetings at Gatlinburg for two Id the school became badly disor-Ind did not recover fully until afterthe Christmas holidays. The most important thing, perhaps, which was accomplished in the school work was the grading of the classes. Improvement in singing was reported during the year. The children were learning to sing the same songs as other primary children. Too, there was a noticeable change in the faces of the children from the days when Dell Gillette spoke of the "sad faces" of the little ones. These children were learning to play games such as Fanner-in-the-Dell and to jump rope with a grape vine. There was the usual Christmas tree, also carols. Cooking classes were held for the girls in the teachers' cottage. A debating club and other school activities aroused a new spirit in the children and their people took pride in theirwork. The mothers and fathers though did not approve of the girls playing basketball in bloomers just as they disapproved of the teachers riding a horse astride. The older boys loved to sing and spent most of their time at recess and at noon singing hymns. Attendance was still a problem. The school terms were arranged in order to fit the needs of the community. As soon as the weather began to be settled in the spring all of the older children, both the boys and girls, "stopped out" to help plant corn and were busy helping with the crop until it was "laid by" about the first of July, then there was a month of respite when they had singing school and a picnic at Elkmont; by the first of August, the children were ready to attend school. For a week or two they left again to "pull fodder," then they were in again for a few days and out again to pick beans. Between times They made molasses, and then came the picking of peas. After the corn was shocked the first of November they came to school with fair regularity. During 1914-15 a new orchard of three dozen trees was started; a model hen house was built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk was laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field was cleaned and leveled, some of the picking of rocks being performed by tardy pupils, the old barn was torn down; basket-ball posts were made; a bridge was built across Baskins; about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes were set out; a straw-berry bed was started and a new garden fenced in; a new 60 foot well was dug and the teachers' residence was remodeled. THE FEBRUARY ARROW A change in routine came, however, in 1916 with the resignation of Miss Pollard who asked for a leave of absence in order to prepare for greater development of the industrial work. Miss Hughes also resigned. Elva Plank, Iowa E, took charge of the business details of the school and served as Head Resident until called home by illness the following January. There was no Head Resident during the spring session of 1917 but Mr. Norman Prickett, manual training teacher, acted as Principal of the School.she was forced to go foot, Mrs. Helmick ) men to see that the 1 The building of especial attention at One cold frosty mot of the oldest inhabit Mrs. Helmick to sa and solicitude: "Ma. it no longer ; we sail( and tell you that it that that ere watery THE CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED TO SMILE! Mr. and Mrs. Prickett who had joined the staff in 1916 were mountain born and bred with mountain sympathies and education. They were able to get in closer touch with a certain class of recluse and backward people than our more cosmopolitan Pi Phis could do. The school staff that year had grown to six. During the autumn of 1916, a ten-room teachers' residence, designed and planned by Aida and Almina Wilson, Iowa r, experienced architects, was built and was ready for occupancy by Christmas time. The house had furnace heat, running water, bath, and was modern in every respect built as a model home in addition to furnishing quarters for the teachers. All materials except the lumber, were freighted over the rough roads from the "outside." The carpenters' work was done entirely by mountain men under the guidance of an experienced builder, imported for the occasion.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots. Marjorie Jackson said ( pupils, "They are in assembly with vanced grades, and the sight of their scared faces in contrast with the eager ing faces of our regular pupils touching." Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France. Dallard Ownby Training camp, overseas service. This was the first time he ever had been away from home and he wrote of wanting to get back to the quiet of the mountains and asked how the hunting and trapping were. He left a little wife of about sixteen who was in our School for a time. Elder Ogle Enlisted in the navy April 5, 1917. Trained at Norfolk. In two weeks was sent aboard the Louisiana and was later on a transport. (Note: The boys on the Louisiana were trained by T. N.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting. The teachers had it a great task to keep the pupils in regularly and the home visiting had this problem in some respects. Now with splendid progress being at the School there came the problem ( could be done to help the people back creeks in Sugarlands and Little Baskins and Spruce Flats, and Mill and Little Dudley. Four adjoining districts wished to their county schools which they rea were inferior to the Pi Phi School in ment, length of school year, and qu, teaching, and to send all the children School.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead. I've lived in the san for twenty years sometimes I think a sight to change. When I heered weaving I jest thought I'd quit worki field an' let the young uns do hit.

For some women like this, we emancipation from tending the others the money it brings means ne a new dress for one of the childrer of meal for the family, or a new ant piece of furniture.

The prize for the best design, an arrowhead, went to Alice Wright (Wallace) , a pledge of Wyoming A. This design was used as the basis for a trademark which was finally registered with the United States .Government through the kindness of Mr. Hadley Freeman.

Every effort was made to e workmanship on the baskets better. 1 the baskets came in as never before attic of the teachers' cottage was re-o be "running over with them." 24 the Grand Council and Settlement :ommittee voted to secure and use a rk for articles made at the School, and ad Council recommended that a con the protests of Cluett, Peabody, and Company. By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

"The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

Constitution, which stated that "Members of the several chapters shall, upon graduation, become members of the alumna chapter, but shall retain connection with their former chapter. The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ? This is a question often asked and rarely answered. We can .only suggest possible means. Every old member of the chapter should hear from the chapter at least twice a year, and regular correspondence should be maintained with as large a number as possible, even if a specialofficer has to be app( They should be urge( and a sample copy c all the alumnae at the so that their attentio No chapter banquet c held without inviting and alumna.

Inside the walls, ceiling, of native woods were without paint ;h. ing school at Madison, Tenn., but there is no record that she succeeded in getting any-one. Most of the alumnm clubs were interested in the Settlement School project and up to March 15, 1912 the receipts totaled $2,775.63. It was necessary, however, to do much pioneer work in "selling" the idea of the School to many, just as it is necessary to do publicity work on any new undertaking. In 1911 one club reported: "Our club was divided somewhat on the Settlement School project. Some liked it, others did not. Those against it seemed to feel it is a missionary MISS HILL AND THE FIRST PI BETA PHI SCHOOL March 1912 letter written while she was getting open the school, Miss Hill said: y every woman I met expressed a desire your school.

Indeed you can think of of educational or settlement work that !eded at Gatlinburg. It is a splendid place efforts. Hill was authorized by the committee ge as assistant, a nurse from a train venture and thought churches covered that field." The club nevertheless loyally made a contribution. Another club wrote: "We are sorry to say that the Settlement School proposition failed to interest our club to the extent of any accomplishment." Some of the clubs raised money through benefit plays, stereopticon lectures, etc., but for the most part the first money raised was chiefly by special assessment of members voluntarily set by the clubs. As soon, however, as it was known that we had a worker in the field, interest among the clubs grew rapidly and has since kept pace with the development of the work on Little Pigeon. Miss Louise Van Sant, Maryland A, acted as chairman of special furnishing for the teach THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' cottage at Gatlinburg, leading a spirited campaign of solicitation among the clubs. The most outstanding gift was that of an organ provided by the Washington and Baltimore Clubs, for which they sacrificed their Founders' Day banquet. Mr. Percy Foster of Washington, piano dealer, furnished the organ at cost and attended to the shipment. Early reports of Miss Van Sant showed a pledge of table silver from the Los Angeles club, of linen from Boston, of a sewing ma-chine from Franklin, window shades from Baltimore, a box of rugs and books from Washington, a cereal double boiler from Philadelphia, magazine subscriptions from Syracuse, a clock from the mother of a Michigan Pi Phi, sheets and bird pictures from Carrie Flagler Shantz, of Iowa ,0, napkins and dish towels from the Chicago Alum= Club, damask towels and books and pictures from the Boston Club, and 12 yards of blackboard cloth and a box of books from St. Louis. Although January 1912 had been set as the date for the opening of the school, more than two months were required in making preparations for the opening, which took place in March with 14 pupils enrolled. The session lasted three months and dosed with 33 enrolled. This first Pi Beta Phi school was held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, destined to be-come famous in later years as the Arrowcraft Shop. On June 28, Miss Hill gave a school pro-gram which was pronounced a great success and it was said that "nothing like it had ever been held there before."

This term expired reasons. This brought a visible sigh of relief in the audience, and the spell was broken, as one by one they spoke earnestly and thoughtfully." The people, especially the women, begged that the school remain in the Burg. Two of the most interested persons were Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff. They were not natives of the community, but had come in. Mrs. Huff was born in another part of Tennessee and Mr. Huff's home state was Pennsylvania. Mr. Huff owned large lumber interests. They were progressive people and wanted education for SCHOOL BUILDING USED BY PI BETA PHI: AUGUST 1912, 1913, 1914 tuber 30, since a term from August nher was all that the public funds 'ply. ptember 1912, Mrs. Helmick, as of the Committee, made a trip to rg with a view to selecting a build-She called a community meeting and people about Pi Beta Phi and ex-bat the fraternity proposed to give permanent, lasting gift in a new Mrs. Helmick had finished her talk d for expressions from the audience s not a sound. Waiting some time called Mr. Ogle, the native teacher . "Shambling to his feet, he asked ermined and agitated voice `What o you folks belong to?' I replied," Helmick, " `No one church, and yet Christian churches' and gave the their four children who were then in the school. In trying to find a suitable building site, Mrs. Helmick told Mr. Huff that in the progressive west where she lived, when an enterprise like the Settlement School thought of coming to a place permanently, "it was customary if the people wanted it, for the business men to get together, and offer an inducement to its coming." She explained that she had been obliged to hunt up proper-ties and to urge men to put a reasonable valuation upon their land when they had a month ago expressed a desire to sell. Mr. Huff took his cue and before Mrs. Helmick left that afternoon, met her on the road to tell her that: "We men have gotten together, and if you folks want the Richard ogle place, and you feel $2000 is too much, I have a man who will give you $800 for the store, and if THE 'FEBRUARY ARROW $1200 is more than you want to pay, we propose making up the difference among us. We want your school right here. ' e know Miss Hill and we know what you have done, and we stand together to do anything you wish to keep you here. Please don't let any-thing influence you to go elsewhere." The next day the County Superintendent, J. S. Keeble, after talking with Mr. Huff, made the proposition that the fraternity take the entire charge of the school management in the Gatlinburg district. He offered to give a clear, absolute deed to all the public school property, including a new building valued at $1000 which stood on a bill overlooking the Burg, and to turn over, in cash, the pay allotted the school teachers by the school authorities annually, without a "string" of any kind, as long as Pi Beta Phi maintained a public and free school in the lower grades. As a result of her trip to Tennessee, Mrs. Helmick asked the Chicago Club to authorize the Sub-Committee to hire an assistant to Miss Hill; to take over the public school property and obligation; to buy the necessary property; and to put up the necessary buildings, with the understanding that all was to be done when the money was available. The club gave the authorization. A vivid description of the "closes" of the school on November 30, 1912 was written by Kate B. Miller of the Committee after she had visited Gatlinburg. Miss Miller said: "They had come at night, some of them at half-past six, though that was the bedtime of many of them. They had come from up Baskins' way, on Mill Creek, down Roaring Brook, farther up Little Pigeon, from Holy Top, and Dick's Range, over devious mountain trails and rocky, muddy mountain roads of so modest a nature that they were often difficult to find. Most of them came afoot, carrying babies, leading little children, and lighting their uncertain way with lamps and lanterns. Their goal was the school house on the small high nob, which had but one way of rational approach. The person who sought to scale the rocky bluff of seventy-five or a hundred feet from. the Roaring Brook side or the Little Pigeon and bad road side would have stood small chance of reaching Minerva's temple on top. And so they plodded along the meandering muddy road, around and up the hill. They were all there waiting when Miss Hill, Miss Gillette, Mrs. J. R. Keeble, the County Superintendent of Schools, Dr. E. A. Bishop, the president of Murray College, and I stumbled our lamp down and up the slim Phi cottage, half a mil( lute quiet during the p except by the processi who passed to and fry the stove reserved for warm themselves, and DELL GILLET First Pi Beta Phi Teach as one and all at vari( necks to see how the , the efforts of the chile sided with boards, w2. the lamps and lantern had brought.

The presented by Worth Schantz, the )n of Carrie Flagler Schantz, Iowa 0. after taking up her work at the Miss Gillette organized the older the School and Gatlinburg into a club which met every Friday after noon. The first piece of work which each made was a white linen collar. While the girls sewed "Miss Dell" or someone reed aloud. For the boys, Miss Gillette adopted certain Boy Scout rules for behaviour and development in two baseball teams. One was an indoor team which played in the abandoned Methodist Church, and the other was a regular outside team which played in the "flats." The school closed on the last of March. For the first time in the history of the community, the children had gone to school for eight months in one year! Although the school had progressed splendidly and Pi Beta Phi had made wonderful friends in the community, two things happened which almost caused the withdrawal of the fraternity from Gatlinburg to some other locality. It will be recalled that the county superintendent had assured the Committee that the whole school situation would be given into Pi Beta Phi's control, but Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller found upon their arrival at Gatlinburg in July 1913, that although al-most everyone in the community wanted Pi Beta Phi to conduct the school, a local man was hired through a misunderstanding. By the opening of the next term, however, the misunderstanding had been deared. The Board voted that after Christmas, the public school building should be given to PI Beta Phi for its use and that another year the fraternity should have the whole school situation in its hands. The next and very vital matter to be settled was that of acquiring land. Although several places were considered, the only really desirable tract seemed to be that owned by E. E. Ogle, but the men of the village did not think that he would sell even if the money could be raised. Despite the fact that the men had some time before agreed to help with the purchase of property for the school, they now seemed to hang back and to want Pi Beta Phi to try to raise the money and to persuade Mr. Ogle to sell. It was not that they were shirking a promise but rather that they had never assisted with the promotion of any community project such as this and seemingly did not know how to go about it. Mrs. Helmick talked with Mr. Ogle and found that he would sell for $1800. If the fraternity would put in $600 and the men of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the community, $1.200, the land no doubt could be obtained. . Since the matter had dragged along for months with nothing accomplished, Mrs. Helmick issued an ultimatum saying that if the Ogle land were not obtained for the fraternity (we contributing $600) by the next day at noon, Pi Beta Phi would go elsewhere and establish a school where land would be given to us. Kate Miller's graphic description shows the tenseness of the situation: We now wondered what they would do. They were at last convinced that "those wimmin" meant what they said, We packed our trunks, began to get the household things ready to leave until we should have them sent elsewhere, ordered the hack from Sevierville to come for us the next day, and wondered what the next twenty-four hours would bring forth. Mr. Huff was sent for in his lumber camp eight miles away; everyone gave up his busi ness and those who had no lousiness gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for a public affair. They said that there was no one who could go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Andy Huff was drawn forth. As think back over the stirring weeks, it seems to me that nothing which came cut of them will be of greater good to these men and women than this: the knowledge that they can do things themselves. Tuesday evening we had many callers, three of the women staying until after dark. They said they just couldn't let us go, that they knew the men would try their best, but that perhaps they couldn't raise enough money. For women in the mountains to stay out after dark was a violation of their social code, but they were forgetting even their social customs now. The next morning while we were at breakfast, Mr. Huff and Steve Whaley came to get us to draw up a subscription paper. Mrs. Helmick wrote the heading for one, putting Pi Beta Phi down for $600. Andy Huff put down $250 and Steve Whaley $250. Then they started off saying that the hack would not take us back. After the men had left, Mrs. Huff came to us and told us of her dream. She dropped into a chair in our kitchen as we were washing the dishes that morning and said: "I had a dream last night." It seemed that she had dreamt that she and the children were all down by the river bank playing. The children had pushed through the bushes and had slipped down to the river bed where they were playing on the dry gravelly bottom in the pools. She had stayed up on the road and suddenly she looked up the river to the distant mountains that seemed to close it in. There she saw rising and clinging to the mountain sides a "big steam, a fog." Then the fog began to roll in clouds, and to come down the river slowly. It kept getting bigger and bigger and kept rolling and rolling down towards the place where the children were playing. Her eyes grew large and her voice tense as the vividness of her vision cameback to her. She repeater fog kept rolling and rollii bigger and coming down the river she also saw, in danger, the Reagan an, thought that the fog was as her own children.

That was the beginning of the first year in our own buildings and with entirely Pi Phi teachers. Two months later, Miss Langmaid re-signed and was succeeded by Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, who was given the title of Head Resident. The outstanding accomplishment of the year 1913-14, in addition to the acquiring of the land, was the building of a new school building, plans for which had been drawn originally by Mr. and Mrs. Von Hoist of Chicago, Mrs. Von Hoist (Lucy Hammond, Colorado B) , being a member of the Chicago Alumnae Club. This new building, a one-story frame structure 60 x 84 feet, with its rather low, projecting roof, resembled a bungalow and was built at an approximate cost of $3,735.30. The main entrance was from a porch into a large hall, from which five class rooms opened, one on each side, and three in the rear. The hall was used as a reading and rest room. A large fireplace was opposite the entrance. The three class rooms at the rear were separated by sliding doors which could be thrown back, making the room into one large room. In December the work of the school having increased to such proportions, Miss Pollard requested two additional teachers and Leah Stock (Helmick) , Michigan A, and Edith Wilson, Indiana A, volunteered their services. The session closed on April 3 with 127 pupils. During the year the young orchard was pruned and cared for; gardens were planted and were worked "on shares," and much thought was given to beautifying the grounds. The Department of Agriculture at Washington furnished the school with a liberal supply of bulbs, shrubs, and seeds, which were planted to good effect. A Tomato Club the only one in Sevier county was organized by Miss Virginia Moore, state organizer of Tomato Canning Clubs for girls. Dr. Yancy, the state hookworm specialist, made three visits to the school and con-ducted a free clinic during the summer months. Miss Pollard remained at the school during the summer, giving her time and strength without reserve, walking miles and miles to tell the people of the danger of hookworm and urging them to come in to receive the free treatment at the Pi Phi school. She assisted the doctor personally in giving out medicines and in making examinations. THE FEBRUARY ARROW The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee reported at the end of the school year that a fund had been started by three of our Founders, with the result that $150 was then in the bank for the establishment of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital at Gatlinburg, in loving memory of Jennie Nicol of "Alpha." Late in June, the Settlement School Committee sent out attractive invitations to the dedication of the new school building which took place on July 9.

Onken, Anne Stuart, and Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) were in attendance and as sisted in preparing for the guests of the day whom they entertained at luncheon. Extracts from the description of the dedi cation of Pi Beta Phi's first school building, as recorded by Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) follow: Long before the appointed time on that sultry summer day guests from a distance began to arrive; they came on foot and on horseback; a few rode in buggies or mountain wagons but the vast majority patronized the "shoe leather express," walking five, eight, or even ten miles to be present at the great occasion. The seats, desks and other school furniture had already been placed, and the fire-place in the entrance hall was banked with ferns and wild flowers, for every effort was made to decorate our building as a northern school building would be decked on a similar occasion. The first to arrive were Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A, and her friend, Miss Walker, who had driven up from Sevierville. Then came Vera Kerr Kessler, Massachusetts A, and her husband, Lt. Kessler, U. S. Navy, who had been spending a few days at Wonderland Park, a mountain resort some nine miles from Gatlinburg. Hearing of the dedication they came over with two friends, Miss Oldman and Miss Hazard.

She was a remarkable woman, having raised her family of children after her husband was killed almost on her doorstep during the Civil War. The "Aunt Lyddie" baskets were known far and wide. In March 1915, Miss Pollard wrote to THE ARROW: "We are hoping to emphasize the industrial side of our work more and more. We are hoping to start basket making in the school, hoping that it will prove a profitable industry. Many of the women make exquisite patchwork quilts and some still mare the hand woven coverlids and blankets. If a sale could be found for these articles, many might undertake the work." And that is where the alumnae department of Pi Beta Phi has accomplished a marvelous work by making a "sale for these articles." In May of that year, Caroline Mc Knight Hughes, Minnesota A, a graduate of the University of Michigan, of Cooper Union School of Art and of Prang Normal, took charge of the business and industrial work, spending some time in the summer looking the situation over, and starting the fall as Head Resident in charge of industrial work, with Mary O. Pollard as Principal of the school. Miss Hughes installed a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 with which she gave instruction to 52 boys and a beginning was made of a department which it was hoped in time would be of great benefit to the community and to the school. It was noised about that "them wimmin" were going to "teach tools," and the curiosity of the Burg was so great that some of the residents ran down the country road to meet the wagon bringing in the tools. All they saw were some boxes, nailed up tight, and some crates with they knew not what inside. The excitement and curiosity was equal to a circus coming to town and when the five benches were in place, with the tools set out, every man and boy able to come to the School, did so. Apparently no one knew much about tools, except the saw, plane and hammer, and the first day of class work was a queer one. As soon as possible the weaving department was equipped, spinning bees and quilting parties were given with the hope of reviving those almost lost industries. For the first time in the fall of 1915 the school began the sale of baskets, purchasing THE FEBRUARY ARROW THE LOOMS ARE PUT TO WORK materials and articles for the industrial work, trying to raise the standard of workmanship, and endeavoring to find a market for the products. In urging the revival of industrial work, Miss Hughes said: "In the yesteryear this country was a community of weavers, but after the War `store cloth' was cheap so that one woman after another put the old loom aside, but many of our neighbors today know how to spin and weave though it has been a 'tol'able long spell' since any of them havedone such a thing. 01 the school, has her willing to make `kivi dear to the hearts o the women still use twist stocking yarn flax has disappeared. mond Dyes to color ti cent know how to m; roots, weeds, etc. Al are either the one `g from Car'liny when THE FEBRUARY ARROW these old ones, and of course one are crude homemade affairs.

Hlughes instructed the children in the art of weaving tiny rugs, mats mocks. In response to her call for in the work, the Springfield, Mo., ed $100 for the buying of looms. the first year that the Chicago Club had charge of the Settlement ,,ork, the Committee met once a [ devoted much time, thought, and the school business. The members ab earned $10 each for the School e 1914, Mrs. Helmick moved away icago but the Chicago club asked ain the Directorship of the School, of residence. For the following managed the School practically being able to hold conferences committee members.

October, 1915, the church held meetings at Gatlinburg for two Id the school became badly disor-Ind did not recover fully until afterthe Christmas holidays. The most important thing, perhaps, which was accomplished in the school work was the grading of the classes. Improvement in singing was reported during the year. The children were learning to sing the same songs as other primary children. Too, there was a noticeable change in the faces of the children from the days when Dell Gillette spoke of the "sad faces" of the little ones. These children were learning to play games such as Fanner-in-the-Dell and to jump rope with a grape vine. There was the usual Christmas tree, also carols. Cooking classes were held for the girls in the teachers' cottage. A debating club and other school activities aroused a new spirit in the children and their people took pride in theirwork. The mothers and fathers though did not approve of the girls playing basketball in bloomers just as they disapproved of the teachers riding a horse astride. The older boys loved to sing and spent most of their time at recess and at noon singing hymns. Attendance was still a problem. The school terms were arranged in order to fit the needs of the community. As soon as the weather began to be settled in the spring all of the older children, both the boys and girls, "stopped out" to help plant corn and were busy helping with the crop until it was "laid by" about the first of July, then there was a month of respite when they had singing school and a picnic at Elkmont; by the first of August, the children were ready to attend school. For a week or two they left again to "pull fodder," then they were in again for a few days and out again to pick beans. Between times They made molasses, and then came the picking of peas. After the corn was shocked the first of November they came to school with fair regularity. During 1914-15 a new orchard of three dozen trees was started; a model hen house was built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk was laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field was cleaned and leveled, some of the picking of rocks being performed by tardy pupils, the old barn was torn down; basket-ball posts were made; a bridge was built across Baskins; about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes were set out; a straw-berry bed was started and a new garden fenced in; a new 60 foot well was dug and the teachers' residence was remodeled. THE FEBRUARY ARROW A change in routine came, however, in 1916 with the resignation of Miss Pollard who asked for a leave of absence in order to prepare for greater development of the industrial work. Miss Hughes also resigned. Elva Plank, Iowa E, took charge of the business details of the school and served as Head Resident until called home by illness the following January. There was no Head Resident during the spring session of 1917 but Mr. Norman Prickett, manual training teacher, acted as Principal of the School.she was forced to go foot, Mrs. Helmick ) men to see that the 1 The building of especial attention at One cold frosty mot of the oldest inhabit Mrs. Helmick to sa and solicitude: "Ma. it no longer ; we sail( and tell you that it that that ere watery THE CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED TO SMILE! Mr. and Mrs. Prickett who had joined the staff in 1916 were mountain born and bred with mountain sympathies and education. They were able to get in closer touch with a certain class of recluse and backward people than our more cosmopolitan Pi Phis could do. The school staff that year had grown to six. During the autumn of 1916, a ten-room teachers' residence, designed and planned by Aida and Almina Wilson, Iowa r, experienced architects, was built and was ready for occupancy by Christmas time. The house had furnace heat, running water, bath, and was modern in every respect built as a model home in addition to furnishing quarters for the teachers. All materials except the lumber, were freighted over the rough roads from the "outside." The carpenters' work was done entirely by mountain men under the guidance of an experienced builder, imported for the occasion.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots. Marjorie Jackson said ( pupils, "They are in assembly with vanced grades, and the sight of their scared faces in contrast with the eager ing faces of our regular pupils touching." Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France. Dallard Ownby Training camp, overseas service. This was the first time he ever had been away from home and he wrote of wanting to get back to the quiet of the mountains and asked how the hunting and trapping were. He left a little wife of about sixteen who was in our School for a time. Elder Ogle Enlisted in the navy April 5, 1917. Trained at Norfolk.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident.

Bishop, ay College at Sevier-end of the Settlement ag. Until the time of ras never too busy to early visitor to the cate position. She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?"

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting.

Now with splendid progress being at the School there came the problem ( could be done to help the people back creeks in Sugarlands and Little Baskins and Spruce Flats, and Mill and Little Dudley.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead.

For some women like this, we emancipation from tending the others the money it brings means ne a new dress for one of the childrer of meal for the family, or a new ant piece of furniture.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields.

He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows. Too, he supervised fol the regular farm work at the School, i: in g the helpers in scientific methoc chain Pig Clubs were a marked succes Mr. Denton, also of the staff, at Mattil organized a basketball team companied the team on their seven for games with neighboring schools. the first year that the boys had playe petitive ball, in fact, many of them ha seen a game of basketball before an were reluctant to wear their suits, insist on wearing overalls under their trunks. insisted on keeping their caps on wh. played.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

This term expired reasons. This brought a visible sigh of relief in the audience, and the spell was broken, as one by one they spoke earnestly and thoughtfully." The people, especially the women, begged that the school remain in the Burg. Two of the most interested persons were Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff. They were not natives of the community, but had come in. Mrs. Huff was born in another part of Tennessee and Mr. Huff's home state was Pennsylvania. Mr. Huff owned large lumber interests. They were progressive people and wanted education for SCHOOL BUILDING USED BY PI BETA PHI: AUGUST 1912, 1913, 1914 tuber 30, since a term from August nher was all that the public funds 'ply. ptember 1912, Mrs. Helmick, as of the Committee, made a trip to rg with a view to selecting a build-She called a community meeting and people about Pi Beta Phi and ex-bat the fraternity proposed to give permanent, lasting gift in a new Mrs. Helmick had finished her talk d for expressions from the audience s not a sound.

I replied," Helmick, " `No one church, and yet Christian churches' and gave the their four children who were then in the school. In trying to find a suitable building site, Mrs. Helmick told Mr. Huff that in the progressive west where she lived, when an enterprise like the Settlement School thought of coming to a place permanently, "it was customary if the people wanted it, for the business men to get together, and offer an inducement to its coming." She explained that she had been obliged to hunt up proper-ties and to urge men to put a reasonable valuation upon their land when they had a month ago expressed a desire to sell. Mr. Huff took his cue and before Mrs. Helmick left that afternoon, met her on the road to tell her that: "We men have gotten together, and if you folks want the Richard ogle place, and you feel $2000 is too much, I have a man who will give you $800 for the store, and if THE 'FEBRUARY ARROW $1200 is more than you want to pay, we propose making up the difference among us. We want your school right here. ' e know Miss Hill and we know what you have done, and we stand together to do anything you wish to keep you here. Please don't let any-thing influence you to go elsewhere." The next day the County Superintendent, J. S. Keeble, after talking with Mr. Huff, made the proposition that the fraternity take the entire charge of the school management in the Gatlinburg district. He offered to give a clear, absolute deed to all the public school property, including a new building valued at $1000 which stood on a bill overlooking the Burg, and to turn over, in cash, the pay allotted the school teachers by the school authorities annually, without a "string" of any kind, as long as Pi Beta Phi maintained a public and free school in the lower grades. As a result of her trip to Tennessee, Mrs. Helmick asked the Chicago Club to authorize the Sub-Committee to hire an assistant to Miss Hill; to take over the public school property and obligation; to buy the necessary property; and to put up the necessary buildings, with the understanding that all was to be done when the money was available. The club gave the authorization. A vivid description of the "closes" of the school on November 30, 1912 was written by Kate B. Miller of the Committee after she had visited Gatlinburg. Miss Miller said: "They had come at night, some of them at half-past six, though that was the bedtime of many of them. They had come from up Baskins' way, on Mill Creek, down Roaring Brook, farther up Little Pigeon, from Holy Top, and Dick's Range, over devious mountain trails and rocky, muddy mountain roads of so modest a nature that they were often difficult to find. Most of them came afoot, carrying babies, leading little children, and lighting their uncertain way with lamps and lanterns. Their goal was the school house on the small high nob, which had but one way of rational approach. The person who sought to scale the rocky bluff of seventy-five or a hundred feet from. the Roaring Brook side or the Little Pigeon and bad road side would have stood small chance of reaching Minerva's temple on top. And so they plodded along the meandering muddy road, around and up the hill. They were all there waiting when Miss Hill, Miss Gillette, Mrs. J. R. Keeble, the County Superintendent of Schools, Dr. E. A. Bishop, the president of Murray College, and I stumbled our lamp down and up the slim Phi cottage, half a mil( lute quiet during the p except by the processi who passed to and fry the stove reserved for warm themselves, and DELL GILLET First Pi Beta Phi Teach as one and all at vari( necks to see how the , the efforts of the chile sided with boards, w2. the lamps and lantern had brought.

The first piece of work which each made was a white linen collar. While the girls sewed "Miss Dell" or someone reed aloud. For the boys, Miss Gillette adopted certain Boy Scout rules for behaviour and development in two baseball teams. One was an indoor team which played in the abandoned Methodist Church, and the other was a regular outside team which played in the "flats." The school closed on the last of March. For the first time in the history of the community, the children had gone to school for eight months in one year! Although the school had progressed splendidly and Pi Beta Phi had made wonderful friends in the community, two things happened which almost caused the withdrawal of the fraternity from Gatlinburg to some other locality. It will be recalled that the county superintendent had assured the Committee that the whole school situation would be given into Pi Beta Phi's control, but Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller found upon their arrival at Gatlinburg in July 1913, that although al-most everyone in the community wanted Pi Beta Phi to conduct the school, a local man was hired through a misunderstanding. By the opening of the next term, however, the misunderstanding had been deared. The Board voted that after Christmas, the public school building should be given to PI Beta Phi for its use and that another year the fraternity should have the whole school situation in its hands. The next and very vital matter to be settled was that of acquiring land. Although several places were considered, the only really desirable tract seemed to be that owned by E. E. Ogle, but the men of the village did not think that he would sell even if the money could be raised. Despite the fact that the men had some time before agreed to help with the purchase of property for the school, they now seemed to hang back and to want Pi Beta Phi to try to raise the money and to persuade Mr. Ogle to sell. It was not that they were shirking a promise but rather that they had never assisted with the promotion of any community project such as this and seemingly did not know how to go about it. Mrs. Helmick talked with Mr. Ogle and found that he would sell for $1800. If the fraternity would put in $600 and the men of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the community, $1.200, the land no doubt could be obtained. . Since the matter had dragged along for months with nothing accomplished, Mrs. Helmick issued an ultimatum saying that if the Ogle land were not obtained for the fraternity (we contributing $600) by the next day at noon, Pi Beta Phi would go elsewhere and establish a school where land would be given to us. Kate Miller's graphic description shows the tenseness of the situation: We now wondered what they would do. They were at last convinced that "those wimmin" meant what they said, We packed our trunks, began to get the household things ready to leave until we should have them sent elsewhere, ordered the hack from Sevierville to come for us the next day, and wondered what the next twenty-four hours would bring forth. Mr. Huff was sent for in his lumber camp eight miles away; everyone gave up his busi ness and those who had no lousiness gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for a public affair. They said that there was no one who could go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Andy Huff was drawn forth. As think back over the stirring weeks, it seems to me that nothing which came cut of them will be of greater good to these men and women than this: the knowledge that they can do things themselves. Tuesday evening we had many callers, three of the women staying until after dark. They said they just couldn't let us go, that they knew the men would try their best, but that perhaps they couldn't raise enough money. For women in the mountains to stay out after dark was a violation of their social code, but they were forgetting even their social customs now. The next morning while we were at breakfast, Mr. Huff and Steve Whaley came to get us to draw up a subscription paper. Mrs. Helmick wrote the heading for one, putting Pi Beta Phi down for $600. Andy Huff put down $250 and Steve Whaley $250. Then they started off saying that the hack would not take us back. After the men had left, Mrs. Huff came to us and told us of her dream. She dropped into a chair in our kitchen as we were washing the dishes that morning and said: "I had a dream last night." It seemed that she had dreamt that she and the children were all down by the river bank playing. The children had pushed through the bushes and had slipped down to the river bed where they were playing on the dry gravelly bottom in the pools. She had stayed up on the road and suddenly she looked up the river to the distant mountains that seemed to close it in. There she saw rising and clinging to the mountain sides a "big steam, a fog." Then the fog began to roll in clouds, and to come down the river slowly. It kept getting bigger and bigger and kept rolling and rolling down towards the place where the children were playing. Her eyes grew large and her voice tense as the vividness of her vision cameback to her. She repeater fog kept rolling and rollii bigger and coming down the river she also saw, in danger, the Reagan an, thought that the fog was as her own children.

That was the beginning of the first year in our own buildings and with entirely Pi Phi teachers. Two months later, Miss Langmaid re-signed and was succeeded by Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, who was given the title of Head Resident. The outstanding accomplishment of the year 1913-14, in addition to the acquiring of the land, was the building of a new school building, plans for which had been drawn originally by Mr. and Mrs. Von Hoist of Chicago, Mrs. Von Hoist (Lucy Hammond, Colorado B) , being a member of the Chicago Alumnae Club. This new building, a one-story frame structure 60 x 84 feet, with its rather low, projecting roof, resembled a bungalow and was built at an approximate cost of $3,735.30. The main entrance was from a porch into a large hall, from which five class rooms opened, one on each side, and three in the rear. The hall was used as a reading and rest room. A large fireplace was opposite the entrance. The three class rooms at the rear were separated by sliding doors which could be thrown back, making the room into one large room. In December the work of the school having increased to such proportions, Miss Pollard requested two additional teachers and Leah Stock (Helmick) , Michigan A, and Edith Wilson, Indiana A, volunteered their services. The session closed on April 3 with 127 pupils. During the year the young orchard was pruned and cared for; gardens were planted and were worked "on shares," and much thought was given to beautifying the grounds. The Department of Agriculture at Washington furnished the school with a liberal supply of bulbs, shrubs, and seeds, which were planted to good effect. A Tomato Club the only one in Sevier county was organized by Miss Virginia Moore, state organizer of Tomato Canning Clubs for girls. Dr. Yancy, the state hookworm specialist, made three visits to the school and con-ducted a free clinic during the summer months. Miss Pollard remained at the school during the summer, giving her time and strength without reserve, walking miles and miles to tell the people of the danger of hookworm and urging them to come in to receive the free treatment at the Pi Phi school. She assisted the doctor personally in giving out medicines and in making examinations. THE FEBRUARY ARROW The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee reported at the end of the school year that a fund had been started by three of our Founders, with the result that $150 was then in the bank for the establishment of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital at Gatlinburg, in loving memory of Jennie Nicol of "Alpha." Late in June, the Settlement School Committee sent out attractive invitations to the dedication of the new school building which took place on July 9.

Onken, Anne Stuart, and Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) were in attendance and as sisted in preparing for the guests of the day whom they entertained at luncheon. Extracts from the description of the dedi cation of Pi Beta Phi's first school building, as recorded by Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) follow: Long before the appointed time on that sultry summer day guests from a distance began to arrive; they came on foot and on horseback; a few rode in buggies or mountain wagons but the vast majority patronized the "shoe leather express," walking five, eight, or even ten miles to be present at the great occasion. The seats, desks and other school furniture had already been placed, and the fire-place in the entrance hall was banked with ferns and wild flowers, for every effort was made to decorate our building as a northern school building would be decked on a similar occasion. The first to arrive were Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A, and her friend, Miss Walker, who had driven up from Sevierville. Then came Vera Kerr Kessler, Massachusetts A, and her husband, Lt. Kessler, U. S. Navy, who had been spending a few days at Wonderland Park, a mountain resort some nine miles from Gatlinburg. Hearing of the dedication they came over with two friends, Miss Oldman and Miss Hazard.

She was a remarkable woman, having raised her family of children after her husband was killed almost on her doorstep during the Civil War. The "Aunt Lyddie" baskets were known far and wide. In March 1915, Miss Pollard wrote to THE ARROW: "We are hoping to emphasize the industrial side of our work more and more. We are hoping to start basket making in the school, hoping that it will prove a profitable industry. Many of the women make exquisite patchwork quilts and some still mare the hand woven coverlids and blankets. If a sale could be found for these articles, many might undertake the work." And that is where the alumnae department of Pi Beta Phi has accomplished a marvelous work by making a "sale for these articles." In May of that year, Caroline Mc Knight Hughes, Minnesota A, a graduate of the University of Michigan, of Cooper Union School of Art and of Prang Normal, took charge of the business and industrial work, spending some time in the summer looking the situation over, and starting the fall as Head Resident in charge of industrial work, with Mary O. Pollard as Principal of the school. Miss Hughes installed a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 with which she gave instruction to 52 boys and a beginning was made of a department which it was hoped in time would be of great benefit to the community and to the school. It was noised about that "them wimmin" were going to "teach tools," and the curiosity of the Burg was so great that some of the residents ran down the country road to meet the wagon bringing in the tools. All they saw were some boxes, nailed up tight, and some crates with they knew not what inside. The excitement and curiosity was equal to a circus coming to town and when the five benches were in place, with the tools set out, every man and boy able to come to the School, did so. Apparently no one knew much about tools, except the saw, plane and hammer, and the first day of class work was a queer one. As soon as possible the weaving department was equipped, spinning bees and quilting parties were given with the hope of reviving those almost lost industries. For the first time in the fall of 1915 the school began the sale of baskets, purchasing THE FEBRUARY ARROW THE LOOMS ARE PUT TO WORK materials and articles for the industrial work, trying to raise the standard of workmanship, and endeavoring to find a market for the products. In urging the revival of industrial work, Miss Hughes said: "In the yesteryear this country was a community of weavers, but after the War `store cloth' was cheap so that one woman after another put the old loom aside, but many of our neighbors today know how to spin and weave though it has been a 'tol'able long spell' since any of them havedone such a thing. 01 the school, has her willing to make `kivi dear to the hearts o the women still use twist stocking yarn flax has disappeared. mond Dyes to color ti cent know how to m; roots, weeds, etc. Al are either the one `g from Car'liny when THE FEBRUARY ARROW these old ones, and of course one are crude homemade affairs.

In response to her call for in the work, the Springfield, Mo., ed $100 for the buying of looms. the first year that the Chicago Club had charge of the Settlement ,,ork, the Committee met once a [ devoted much time, thought, and the school business. The members ab earned $10 each for the School e 1914, Mrs. Helmick moved away icago but the Chicago club asked ain the Directorship of the School, of residence. For the following managed the School practically being able to hold conferences committee members.

October, 1915, the church held meetings at Gatlinburg for two Id the school became badly disor-Ind did not recover fully until afterthe Christmas holidays. The most important thing, perhaps, which was accomplished in the school work was the grading of the classes. Improvement in singing was reported during the year. The children were learning to sing the same songs as other primary children. Too, there was a noticeable change in the faces of the children from the days when Dell Gillette spoke of the "sad faces" of the little ones. These children were learning to play games such as Fanner-in-the-Dell and to jump rope with a grape vine. There was the usual Christmas tree, also carols. Cooking classes were held for the girls in the teachers' cottage. A debating club and other school activities aroused a new spirit in the children and their people took pride in theirwork. The mothers and fathers though did not approve of the girls playing basketball in bloomers just as they disapproved of the teachers riding a horse astride. The older boys loved to sing and spent most of their time at recess and at noon singing hymns. Attendance was still a problem. The school terms were arranged in order to fit the needs of the community. As soon as the weather began to be settled in the spring all of the older children, both the boys and girls, "stopped out" to help plant corn and were busy helping with the crop until it was "laid by" about the first of July, then there was a month of respite when they had singing school and a picnic at Elkmont; by the first of August, the children were ready to attend school. For a week or two they left again to "pull fodder," then they were in again for a few days and out again to pick beans. Between times They made molasses, and then came the picking of peas. After the corn was shocked the first of November they came to school with fair regularity. During 1914-15 a new orchard of three dozen trees was started; a model hen house was built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk was laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field was cleaned and leveled, some of the picking of rocks being performed by tardy pupils, the old barn was torn down; basket-ball posts were made; a bridge was built across Baskins; about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes were set out; a straw-berry bed was started and a new garden fenced in; a new 60 foot well was dug and the teachers' residence was remodeled. THE FEBRUARY ARROW A change in routine came, however, in 1916 with the resignation of Miss Pollard who asked for a leave of absence in order to prepare for greater development of the industrial work. Miss Hughes also resigned. Elva Plank, Iowa E, took charge of the business details of the school and served as Head Resident until called home by illness the following January. There was no Head Resident during the spring session of 1917 but Mr. Norman Prickett, manual training teacher, acted as Principal of the School.she was forced to go foot, Mrs. Helmick ) men to see that the 1 The building of especial attention at One cold frosty mot of the oldest inhabit Mrs. Helmick to sa and solicitude: "Ma. it no longer ; we sail( and tell you that it that that ere watery THE CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED TO SMILE! Mr. and Mrs. Prickett who had joined the staff in 1916 were mountain born and bred with mountain sympathies and education. They were able to get in closer touch with a certain class of recluse and backward people than our more cosmopolitan Pi Phis could do. The school staff that year had grown to six. During the autumn of 1916, a ten-room teachers' residence, designed and planned by Aida and Almina Wilson, Iowa r, experienced architects, was built and was ready for occupancy by Christmas time. The house had furnace heat, running water, bath, and was modern in every respect built as a model home in addition to furnishing quarters for the teachers. All materials except the lumber, were freighted over the rough roads from the "outside." The carpenters' work was done entirely by mountain men under the guidance of an experienced builder, imported for the occasion.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots.

Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident.

Bishop, ay College at Sevier-end of the Settlement ag. Until the time of ras never too busy to early visitor to the cate position. She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting. The teachers had it a great task to keep the pupils in regularly and the home visiting had this problem in some respects. Now with splendid progress being at the School there came the problem ( could be done to help the people back creeks in Sugarlands and Little Baskins and Spruce Flats, and Mill and Little Dudley. Four adjoining districts wished to their county schools which they rea were inferior to the Pi Phi School in ment, length of school year, and qu, teaching, and to send all the children School.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead. I've lived in the san for twenty years sometimes I think a sight to change. When I heered weaving I jest thought I'd quit worki field an' let the young uns do hit.

For some women like this, we emancipation from tending the others the money it brings means ne a new dress for one of the childrer of meal for the family, or a new ant piece of furniture.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Since Mr. contract has been terminated, the is used now as headquarters for the .g Department and for other interests g around the girls and women. Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality. Among the improve 1922-23 was the con; water reservoir with a i ions, which appreciabI3 ard. Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

"The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

The presented by Worth Schantz, the )n of Carrie Flagler Schantz, Iowa 0. after taking up her work at the Miss Gillette organized the older the School and Gatlinburg into a club which met every Friday after noon. The first piece of work which each made was a white linen collar. While the girls sewed "Miss Dell" or someone reed aloud. For the boys, Miss Gillette adopted certain Boy Scout rules for behaviour and development in two baseball teams. One was an indoor team which played in the abandoned Methodist Church, and the other was a regular outside team which played in the "flats." The school closed on the last of March. For the first time in the history of the community, the children had gone to school for eight months in one year! Although the school had progressed splendidly and Pi Beta Phi had made wonderful friends in the community, two things happened which almost caused the withdrawal of the fraternity from Gatlinburg to some other locality. It will be recalled that the county superintendent had assured the Committee that the whole school situation would be given into Pi Beta Phi's control, but Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller found upon their arrival at Gatlinburg in July 1913, that although al-most everyone in the community wanted Pi Beta Phi to conduct the school, a local man was hired through a misunderstanding. By the opening of the next term, however, the misunderstanding had been deared. The Board voted that after Christmas, the public school building should be given to PI Beta Phi for its use and that another year the fraternity should have the whole school situation in its hands. The next and very vital matter to be settled was that of acquiring land. Although several places were considered, the only really desirable tract seemed to be that owned by E. E. Ogle, but the men of the village did not think that he would sell even if the money could be raised. Despite the fact that the men had some time before agreed to help with the purchase of property for the school, they now seemed to hang back and to want Pi Beta Phi to try to raise the money and to persuade Mr. Ogle to sell. It was not that they were shirking a promise but rather that they had never assisted with the promotion of any community project such as this and seemingly did not know how to go about it. Mrs. Helmick talked with Mr. Ogle and found that he would sell for $1800. If the fraternity would put in $600 and the men of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the community, $1.200, the land no doubt could be obtained. . Since the matter had dragged along for months with nothing accomplished, Mrs. Helmick issued an ultimatum saying that if the Ogle land were not obtained for the fraternity (we contributing $600) by the next day at noon, Pi Beta Phi would go elsewhere and establish a school where land would be given to us. Kate Miller's graphic description shows the tenseness of the situation: We now wondered what they would do. They were at last convinced that "those wimmin" meant what they said, We packed our trunks, began to get the household things ready to leave until we should have them sent elsewhere, ordered the hack from Sevierville to come for us the next day, and wondered what the next twenty-four hours would bring forth. Mr. Huff was sent for in his lumber camp eight miles away; everyone gave up his busi ness and those who had no lousiness gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for a public affair. They said that there was no one who could go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Andy Huff was drawn forth. As think back over the stirring weeks, it seems to me that nothing which came cut of them will be of greater good to these men and women than this: the knowledge that they can do things themselves. Tuesday evening we had many callers, three of the women staying until after dark. They said they just couldn't let us go, that they knew the men would try their best, but that perhaps they couldn't raise enough money. For women in the mountains to stay out after dark was a violation of their social code, but they were forgetting even their social customs now. The next morning while we were at breakfast, Mr. Huff and Steve Whaley came to get us to draw up a subscription paper. Mrs. Helmick wrote the heading for one, putting Pi Beta Phi down for $600. Andy Huff put down $250 and Steve Whaley $250. Then they started off saying that the hack would not take us back. After the men had left, Mrs. Huff came to us and told us of her dream. She dropped into a chair in our kitchen as we were washing the dishes that morning and said: "I had a dream last night." It seemed that she had dreamt that she and the children were all down by the river bank playing. The children had pushed through the bushes and had slipped down to the river bed where they were playing on the dry gravelly bottom in the pools. She had stayed up on the road and suddenly she looked up the river to the distant mountains that seemed to close it in. There she saw rising and clinging to the mountain sides a "big steam, a fog." Then the fog began to roll in clouds, and to come down the river slowly. It kept getting bigger and bigger and kept rolling and rolling down towards the place where the children were playing. Her eyes grew large and her voice tense as the vividness of her vision cameback to her. She repeater fog kept rolling and rollii bigger and coming down the river she also saw, in danger, the Reagan an, thought that the fog was as her own children.

That was the beginning of the first year in our own buildings and with entirely Pi Phi teachers. Two months later, Miss Langmaid re-signed and was succeeded by Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, who was given the title of Head Resident. The outstanding accomplishment of the year 1913-14, in addition to the acquiring of the land, was the building of a new school building, plans for which had been drawn originally by Mr. and Mrs. Von Hoist of Chicago, Mrs. Von Hoist (Lucy Hammond, Colorado B) , being a member of the Chicago Alumnae Club. This new building, a one-story frame structure 60 x 84 feet, with its rather low, projecting roof, resembled a bungalow and was built at an approximate cost of $3,735.30. The main entrance was from a porch into a large hall, from which five class rooms opened, one on each side, and three in the rear. The hall was used as a reading and rest room. A large fireplace was opposite the entrance. The three class rooms at the rear were separated by sliding doors which could be thrown back, making the room into one large room. In December the work of the school having increased to such proportions, Miss Pollard requested two additional teachers and Leah Stock (Helmick) , Michigan A, and Edith Wilson, Indiana A, volunteered their services. The session closed on April 3 with 127 pupils. During the year the young orchard was pruned and cared for; gardens were planted and were worked "on shares," and much thought was given to beautifying the grounds. The Department of Agriculture at Washington furnished the school with a liberal supply of bulbs, shrubs, and seeds, which were planted to good effect. A Tomato Club the only one in Sevier county was organized by Miss Virginia Moore, state organizer of Tomato Canning Clubs for girls. Dr. Yancy, the state hookworm specialist, made three visits to the school and con-ducted a free clinic during the summer months. Miss Pollard remained at the school during the summer, giving her time and strength without reserve, walking miles and miles to tell the people of the danger of hookworm and urging them to come in to receive the free treatment at the Pi Phi school. She assisted the doctor personally in giving out medicines and in making examinations. THE FEBRUARY ARROW The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee reported at the end of the school year that a fund had been started by three of our Founders, with the result that $150 was then in the bank for the establishment of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital at Gatlinburg, in loving memory of Jennie Nicol of "Alpha." Late in June, the Settlement School Committee sent out attractive invitations to the dedication of the new school building which took place on July 9.

Extracts from the description of the dedi cation of Pi Beta Phi's first school building, as recorded by Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) follow: Long before the appointed time on that sultry summer day guests from a distance began to arrive; they came on foot and on horseback; a few rode in buggies or mountain wagons but the vast majority patronized the "shoe leather express," walking five, eight, or even ten miles to be present at the great occasion. The seats, desks and other school furniture had already been placed, and the fire-place in the entrance hall was banked with ferns and wild flowers, for every effort was made to decorate our building as a northern school building would be decked on a similar occasion. The first to arrive were Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A, and her friend, Miss Walker, who had driven up from Sevierville. Then came Vera Kerr Kessler, Massachusetts A, and her husband, Lt. Kessler, U. S. Navy, who had been spending a few days at Wonderland Park, a mountain resort some nine miles from Gatlinburg. Hearing of the dedication they came over with two friends, Miss Oldman and Miss Hazard.

She was a remarkable woman, having raised her family of children after her husband was killed almost on her doorstep during the Civil War. The "Aunt Lyddie" baskets were known far and wide. In March 1915, Miss Pollard wrote to THE ARROW: "We are hoping to emphasize the industrial side of our work more and more. We are hoping to start basket making in the school, hoping that it will prove a profitable industry. Many of the women make exquisite patchwork quilts and some still mare the hand woven coverlids and blankets. If a sale could be found for these articles, many might undertake the work." And that is where the alumnae department of Pi Beta Phi has accomplished a marvelous work by making a "sale for these articles." In May of that year, Caroline Mc Knight Hughes, Minnesota A, a graduate of the University of Michigan, of Cooper Union School of Art and of Prang Normal, took charge of the business and industrial work, spending some time in the summer looking the situation over, and starting the fall as Head Resident in charge of industrial work, with Mary O. Pollard as Principal of the school. Miss Hughes installed a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 with which she gave instruction to 52 boys and a beginning was made of a department which it was hoped in time would be of great benefit to the community and to the school. It was noised about that "them wimmin" were going to "teach tools," and the curiosity of the Burg was so great that some of the residents ran down the country road to meet the wagon bringing in the tools. All they saw were some boxes, nailed up tight, and some crates with they knew not what inside. The excitement and curiosity was equal to a circus coming to town and when the five benches were in place, with the tools set out, every man and boy able to come to the School, did so. Apparently no one knew much about tools, except the saw, plane and hammer, and the first day of class work was a queer one. As soon as possible the weaving department was equipped, spinning bees and quilting parties were given with the hope of reviving those almost lost industries. For the first time in the fall of 1915 the school began the sale of baskets, purchasing THE FEBRUARY ARROW THE LOOMS ARE PUT TO WORK materials and articles for the industrial work, trying to raise the standard of workmanship, and endeavoring to find a market for the products. In urging the revival of industrial work, Miss Hughes said: "In the yesteryear this country was a community of weavers, but after the War `store cloth' was cheap so that one woman after another put the old loom aside, but many of our neighbors today know how to spin and weave though it has been a 'tol'able long spell' since any of them havedone such a thing. 01 the school, has her willing to make `kivi dear to the hearts o the women still use twist stocking yarn flax has disappeared. mond Dyes to color ti cent know how to m; roots, weeds, etc. Al are either the one `g from Car'liny when THE FEBRUARY ARROW these old ones, and of course one are crude homemade affairs.

In response to her call for in the work, the Springfield, Mo., ed $100 for the buying of looms. the first year that the Chicago Club had charge of the Settlement ,,ork, the Committee met once a [ devoted much time, thought, and the school business. The members ab earned $10 each for the School e 1914, Mrs. Helmick moved away icago but the Chicago club asked ain the Directorship of the School, of residence. For the following managed the School practically being able to hold conferences committee members. In making her the convention, Mrs. Helmick 1ded that the direction of the Setchool should be in the hands of the )uncil and that the general manage-:he affairs of the Settlement School, those of the treasurer, should be t the hands of the ' Grand Vice ingly the Alum= Session of Con-a 1915, authorized that the Settleool be placed under the control of f Managers appointed by the Grand nd also made the Chairman of the rational officer with all privileges as e to convention.

October, 1915, the church held meetings at Gatlinburg for two Id the school became badly disor-Ind did not recover fully until afterthe Christmas holidays. The most important thing, perhaps, which was accomplished in the school work was the grading of the classes. Improvement in singing was reported during the year. The children were learning to sing the same songs as other primary children. Too, there was a noticeable change in the faces of the children from the days when Dell Gillette spoke of the "sad faces" of the little ones. These children were learning to play games such as Fanner-in-the-Dell and to jump rope with a grape vine. There was the usual Christmas tree, also carols. Cooking classes were held for the girls in the teachers' cottage. A debating club and other school activities aroused a new spirit in the children and their people took pride in theirwork. The mothers and fathers though did not approve of the girls playing basketball in bloomers just as they disapproved of the teachers riding a horse astride. The older boys loved to sing and spent most of their time at recess and at noon singing hymns. Attendance was still a problem. The school terms were arranged in order to fit the needs of the community. As soon as the weather began to be settled in the spring all of the older children, both the boys and girls, "stopped out" to help plant corn and were busy helping with the crop until it was "laid by" about the first of July, then there was a month of respite when they had singing school and a picnic at Elkmont; by the first of August, the children were ready to attend school. For a week or two they left again to "pull fodder," then they were in again for a few days and out again to pick beans. Between times They made molasses, and then came the picking of peas. After the corn was shocked the first of November they came to school with fair regularity. During 1914-15 a new orchard of three dozen trees was started; a model hen house was built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk was laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field was cleaned and leveled, some of the picking of rocks being performed by tardy pupils, the old barn was torn down; basket-ball posts were made; a bridge was built across Baskins; about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes were set out; a straw-berry bed was started and a new garden fenced in; a new 60 foot well was dug and the teachers' residence was remodeled. THE FEBRUARY ARROW A change in routine came, however, in 1916 with the resignation of Miss Pollard who asked for a leave of absence in order to prepare for greater development of the industrial work. Miss Hughes also resigned. Elva Plank, Iowa E, took charge of the business details of the school and served as Head Resident until called home by illness the following January. There was no Head Resident during the spring session of 1917 but Mr. Norman Prickett, manual training teacher, acted as Principal of the School.she was forced to go foot, Mrs. Helmick ) men to see that the 1 The building of especial attention at One cold frosty mot of the oldest inhabit Mrs. Helmick to sa and solicitude: "Ma. it no longer ; we sail( and tell you that it that that ere watery THE CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED TO SMILE! Mr. and Mrs. Prickett who had joined the staff in 1916 were mountain born and bred with mountain sympathies and education. They were able to get in closer touch with a certain class of recluse and backward people than our more cosmopolitan Pi Phis could do. The school staff that year had grown to six. During the autumn of 1916, a ten-room teachers' residence, designed and planned by Aida and Almina Wilson, Iowa r, experienced architects, was built and was ready for occupancy by Christmas time. The house had furnace heat, running water, bath, and was modern in every respect built as a model home in addition to furnishing quarters for the teachers. All materials except the lumber, were freighted over the rough roads from the "outside." The carpenters' work was done entirely by mountain men under the guidance of an experienced builder, imported for the occasion.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots. Marjorie Jackson said ( pupils, "They are in assembly with vanced grades, and the sight of their scared faces in contrast with the eager ing faces of our regular pupils touching." Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident.

She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

Bryan, New York B, who had writ-. Asheville, N.C., asking if she could y help, was sent for. ugust 4, 1913, Kate Miller assisted ,angmaid in opening the school in old school house on Baskins and peon. That was the beginning of the first year in our own buildings and with entirely Pi Phi teachers. Two months later, Miss Langmaid re-signed and was succeeded by Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, who was given the title of Head Resident. The outstanding accomplishment of the year 1913-14, in addition to the acquiring of the land, was the building of a new school building, plans for which had been drawn originally by Mr. and Mrs. Von Hoist of Chicago, Mrs. Von Hoist (Lucy Hammond, Colorado B) , being a member of the Chicago Alumnae Club. This new building, a one-story frame structure 60 x 84 feet, with its rather low, projecting roof, resembled a bungalow and was built at an approximate cost of $3,735.30. The main entrance was from a porch into a large hall, from which five class rooms opened, one on each side, and three in the rear. The hall was used as a reading and rest room. A large fireplace was opposite the entrance. The three class rooms at the rear were separated by sliding doors which could be thrown back, making the room into one large room. In December the work of the school having increased to such proportions, Miss Pollard requested two additional teachers and Leah Stock (Helmick) , Michigan A, and Edith Wilson, Indiana A, volunteered their services. The session closed on April 3 with 127 pupils. During the year the young orchard was pruned and cared for; gardens were planted and were worked "on shares," and much thought was given to beautifying the grounds. The Department of Agriculture at Washington furnished the school with a liberal supply of bulbs, shrubs, and seeds, which were planted to good effect. A Tomato Club the only one in Sevier county was organized by Miss Virginia Moore, state organizer of Tomato Canning Clubs for girls. Dr. Yancy, the state hookworm specialist, made three visits to the school and con-ducted a free clinic during the summer months. Miss Pollard remained at the school during the summer, giving her time and strength without reserve, walking miles and miles to tell the people of the danger of hookworm and urging them to come in to receive the free treatment at the Pi Phi school. She assisted the doctor personally in giving out medicines and in making examinations. THE FEBRUARY ARROW The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee reported at the end of the school year that a fund had been started by three of our Founders, with the result that $150 was then in the bank for the establishment of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital at Gatlinburg, in loving memory of Jennie Nicol of "Alpha." Late in June, the Settlement School Committee sent out attractive invitations to the dedication of the new school building which took place on July 9.

Onken, Anne Stuart, and Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) were in attendance and as sisted in preparing for the guests of the day whom they entertained at luncheon. Extracts from the description of the dedi cation of Pi Beta Phi's first school building, as recorded by Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) follow: Long before the appointed time on that sultry summer day guests from a distance began to arrive; they came on foot and on horseback; a few rode in buggies or mountain wagons but the vast majority patronized the "shoe leather express," walking five, eight, or even ten miles to be present at the great occasion. The seats, desks and other school furniture had already been placed, and the fire-place in the entrance hall was banked with ferns and wild flowers, for every effort was made to decorate our building as a northern school building would be decked on a similar occasion. The first to arrive were Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A, and her friend, Miss Walker, who had driven up from Sevierville. Then came Vera Kerr Kessler, Massachusetts A, and her husband, Lt. Kessler, U. S. Navy, who had been spending a few days at Wonderland Park, a mountain resort some nine miles from Gatlinburg.

She was a remarkable woman, having raised her family of children after her husband was killed almost on her doorstep during the Civil War. The "Aunt Lyddie" baskets were known far and wide. In March 1915, Miss Pollard wrote to THE ARROW: "We are hoping to emphasize the industrial side of our work more and more. We are hoping to start basket making in the school, hoping that it will prove a profitable industry. Many of the women make exquisite patchwork quilts and some still mare the hand woven coverlids and blankets. If a sale could be found for these articles, many might undertake the work." And that is where the alumnae department of Pi Beta Phi has accomplished a marvelous work by making a "sale for these articles." In May of that year, Caroline Mc Knight Hughes, Minnesota A, a graduate of the University of Michigan, of Cooper Union School of Art and of Prang Normal, took charge of the business and industrial work, spending some time in the summer looking the situation over, and starting the fall as Head Resident in charge of industrial work, with Mary O. Pollard as Principal of the school. Miss Hughes installed a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 with which she gave instruction to 52 boys and a beginning was made of a department which it was hoped in time would be of great benefit to the community and to the school. It was noised about that "them wimmin" were going to "teach tools," and the curiosity of the Burg was so great that some of the residents ran down the country road to meet the wagon bringing in the tools. All they saw were some boxes, nailed up tight, and some crates with they knew not what inside. The excitement and curiosity was equal to a circus coming to town and when the five benches were in place, with the tools set out, every man and boy able to come to the School, did so. Apparently no one knew much about tools, except the saw, plane and hammer, and the first day of class work was a queer one. As soon as possible the weaving department was equipped, spinning bees and quilting parties were given with the hope of reviving those almost lost industries. For the first time in the fall of 1915 the school began the sale of baskets, purchasing THE FEBRUARY ARROW THE LOOMS ARE PUT TO WORK materials and articles for the industrial work, trying to raise the standard of workmanship, and endeavoring to find a market for the products. In urging the revival of industrial work, Miss Hughes said: "In the yesteryear this country was a community of weavers, but after the War `store cloth' was cheap so that one woman after another put the old loom aside, but many of our neighbors today know how to spin and weave though it has been a 'tol'able long spell' since any of them havedone such a thing. 01 the school, has her willing to make `kivi dear to the hearts o the women still use twist stocking yarn flax has disappeared. mond Dyes to color ti cent know how to m; roots, weeds, etc. Al are either the one `g from Car'liny when THE FEBRUARY ARROW these old ones, and of course one are crude homemade affairs.

Hlughes instructed the children in the art of weaving tiny rugs, mats mocks. In response to her call for in the work, the Springfield, Mo., ed $100 for the buying of looms. the first year that the Chicago Club had charge of the Settlement ,,ork, the Committee met once a [ devoted much time, thought, and the school business. The members ab earned $10 each for the School e 1914, Mrs. Helmick moved away icago but the Chicago club asked ain the Directorship of the School, of residence. For the following managed the School practically being able to hold conferences committee members.

October, 1915, the church held meetings at Gatlinburg for two Id the school became badly disor-Ind did not recover fully until afterthe Christmas holidays. The most important thing, perhaps, which was accomplished in the school work was the grading of the classes. Improvement in singing was reported during the year. The children were learning to sing the same songs as other primary children. Too, there was a noticeable change in the faces of the children from the days when Dell Gillette spoke of the "sad faces" of the little ones. These children were learning to play games such as Fanner-in-the-Dell and to jump rope with a grape vine. There was the usual Christmas tree, also carols. Cooking classes were held for the girls in the teachers' cottage. A debating club and other school activities aroused a new spirit in the children and their people took pride in theirwork. The mothers and fathers though did not approve of the girls playing basketball in bloomers just as they disapproved of the teachers riding a horse astride. The older boys loved to sing and spent most of their time at recess and at noon singing hymns. Attendance was still a problem. The school terms were arranged in order to fit the needs of the community. As soon as the weather began to be settled in the spring all of the older children, both the boys and girls, "stopped out" to help plant corn and were busy helping with the crop until it was "laid by" about the first of July, then there was a month of respite when they had singing school and a picnic at Elkmont; by the first of August, the children were ready to attend school. For a week or two they left again to "pull fodder," then they were in again for a few days and out again to pick beans. Between times They made molasses, and then came the picking of peas. After the corn was shocked the first of November they came to school with fair regularity. During 1914-15 a new orchard of three dozen trees was started; a model hen house was built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk was laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field was cleaned and leveled, some of the picking of rocks being performed by tardy pupils, the old barn was torn down; basket-ball posts were made; a bridge was built across Baskins; about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes were set out; a straw-berry bed was started and a new garden fenced in; a new 60 foot well was dug and the teachers' residence was remodeled. THE FEBRUARY ARROW A change in routine came, however, in 1916 with the resignation of Miss Pollard who asked for a leave of absence in order to prepare for greater development of the industrial work. Miss Hughes also resigned. Elva Plank, Iowa E, took charge of the business details of the school and served as Head Resident until called home by illness the following January. There was no Head Resident during the spring session of 1917 but Mr. Norman Prickett, manual training teacher, acted as Principal of the School.she was forced to go foot, Mrs. Helmick ) men to see that the 1 The building of especial attention at One cold frosty mot of the oldest inhabit Mrs. Helmick to sa and solicitude: "Ma. it no longer ; we sail( and tell you that it that that ere watery THE CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED TO SMILE! Mr. and Mrs. Prickett who had joined the staff in 1916 were mountain born and bred with mountain sympathies and education. They were able to get in closer touch with a certain class of recluse and backward people than our more cosmopolitan Pi Phis could do. The school staff that year had grown to six. During the autumn of 1916, a ten-room teachers' residence, designed and planned by Aida and Almina Wilson, Iowa r, experienced architects, was built and was ready for occupancy by Christmas time. The house had furnace heat, running water, bath, and was modern in every respect built as a model home in addition to furnishing quarters for the teachers. All materials except the lumber, were freighted over the rough roads from the "outside." The carpenters' work was done entirely by mountain men under the guidance of an experienced builder, imported for the occasion.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots. Marjorie Jackson said ( pupils, "They are in assembly with vanced grades, and the sight of their scared faces in contrast with the eager ing faces of our regular pupils touching." Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France. Dallard Ownby Training camp, overseas service. This was the first time he ever had been away from home and he wrote of wanting to get back to the quiet of the mountains and asked how the hunting and trapping were. He left a little wife of about sixteen who was in our School for a time. Elder Ogle Enlisted in the navy April 5, 1917. Trained at Norfolk.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident.

Bishop, ay College at Sevier-end of the Settlement ag. Until the time of ras never too busy to early visitor to the cate position. She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead.

For some women like this, we emancipation from tending the others the money it brings means ne a new dress for one of the childrer of meal for the family, or a new ant piece of furniture.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields.

He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

She was a remarkable woman, having raised her family of children after her husband was killed almost on her doorstep during the Civil War. The "Aunt Lyddie" baskets were known far and wide. In March 1915, Miss Pollard wrote to THE ARROW: "We are hoping to emphasize the industrial side of our work more and more. We are hoping to start basket making in the school, hoping that it will prove a profitable industry. Many of the women make exquisite patchwork quilts and some still mare the hand woven coverlids and blankets. If a sale could be found for these articles, many might undertake the work." And that is where the alumnae department of Pi Beta Phi has accomplished a marvelous work by making a "sale for these articles." In May of that year, Caroline Mc Knight Hughes, Minnesota A, a graduate of the University of Michigan, of Cooper Union School of Art and of Prang Normal, took charge of the business and industrial work, spending some time in the summer looking the situation over, and starting the fall as Head Resident in charge of industrial work, with Mary O. Pollard as Principal of the school. Miss Hughes installed a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 with which she gave instruction to 52 boys and a beginning was made of a department which it was hoped in time would be of great benefit to the community and to the school. It was noised about that "them wimmin" were going to "teach tools," and the curiosity of the Burg was so great that some of the residents ran down the country road to meet the wagon bringing in the tools. All they saw were some boxes, nailed up tight, and some crates with they knew not what inside. The excitement and curiosity was equal to a circus coming to town and when the five benches were in place, with the tools set out, every man and boy able to come to the School, did so. Apparently no one knew much about tools, except the saw, plane and hammer, and the first day of class work was a queer one. As soon as possible the weaving department was equipped, spinning bees and quilting parties were given with the hope of reviving those almost lost industries. For the first time in the fall of 1915 the school began the sale of baskets, purchasing THE FEBRUARY ARROW THE LOOMS ARE PUT TO WORK materials and articles for the industrial work, trying to raise the standard of workmanship, and endeavoring to find a market for the products. In urging the revival of industrial work, Miss Hughes said: "In the yesteryear this country was a community of weavers, but after the War `store cloth' was cheap so that one woman after another put the old loom aside, but many of our neighbors today know how to spin and weave though it has been a 'tol'able long spell' since any of them havedone such a thing. 01 the school, has her willing to make `kivi dear to the hearts o the women still use twist stocking yarn flax has disappeared. mond Dyes to color ti cent know how to m; roots, weeds, etc. Al are either the one `g from Car'liny when THE FEBRUARY ARROW these old ones, and of course one are crude homemade affairs.

Hlughes instructed the children in the art of weaving tiny rugs, mats mocks. In response to her call for in the work, the Springfield, Mo., ed $100 for the buying of looms. the first year that the Chicago Club had charge of the Settlement ,,ork, the Committee met once a [ devoted much time, thought, and the school business. The members ab earned $10 each for the School e 1914, Mrs. Helmick moved away icago but the Chicago club asked ain the Directorship of the School, of residence. For the following managed the School practically being able to hold conferences committee members. In making her the convention, Mrs. Helmick 1ded that the direction of the Setchool should be in the hands of the )uncil and that the general manage-:he affairs of the Settlement School, those of the treasurer, should be t the hands of the ' Grand Vice ingly the Alum= Session of Con-a 1915, authorized that the Settleool be placed under the control of f Managers appointed by the Grand nd also made the Chairman of the rational officer with all privileges as e to convention.

October, 1915, the church held meetings at Gatlinburg for two Id the school became badly disor-Ind did not recover fully until afterthe Christmas holidays. The most important thing, perhaps, which was accomplished in the school work was the grading of the classes. Improvement in singing was reported during the year. The children were learning to sing the same songs as other primary children. Too, there was a noticeable change in the faces of the children from the days when Dell Gillette spoke of the "sad faces" of the little ones. These children were learning to play games such as Fanner-in-the-Dell and to jump rope with a grape vine. There was the usual Christmas tree, also carols. Cooking classes were held for the girls in the teachers' cottage. A debating club and other school activities aroused a new spirit in the children and their people took pride in theirwork. The mothers and fathers though did not approve of the girls playing basketball in bloomers just as they disapproved of the teachers riding a horse astride. The older boys loved to sing and spent most of their time at recess and at noon singing hymns. Attendance was still a problem. The school terms were arranged in order to fit the needs of the community. As soon as the weather began to be settled in the spring all of the older children, both the boys and girls, "stopped out" to help plant corn and were busy helping with the crop until it was "laid by" about the first of July, then there was a month of respite when they had singing school and a picnic at Elkmont; by the first of August, the children were ready to attend school. For a week or two they left again to "pull fodder," then they were in again for a few days and out again to pick beans. Between times They made molasses, and then came the picking of peas. After the corn was shocked the first of November they came to school with fair regularity. During 1914-15 a new orchard of three dozen trees was started; a model hen house was built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk was laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field was cleaned and leveled, some of the picking of rocks being performed by tardy pupils, the old barn was torn down; basket-ball posts were made; a bridge was built across Baskins; about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes were set out; a straw-berry bed was started and a new garden fenced in; a new 60 foot well was dug and the teachers' residence was remodeled. THE FEBRUARY ARROW A change in routine came, however, in 1916 with the resignation of Miss Pollard who asked for a leave of absence in order to prepare for greater development of the industrial work. Miss Hughes also resigned. Elva Plank, Iowa E, took charge of the business details of the school and served as Head Resident until called home by illness the following January. There was no Head Resident during the spring session of 1917 but Mr. Norman Prickett, manual training teacher, acted as Principal of the School.she was forced to go foot, Mrs. Helmick ) men to see that the 1 The building of especial attention at One cold frosty mot of the oldest inhabit Mrs. Helmick to sa and solicitude: "Ma. it no longer ; we sail( and tell you that it that that ere watery THE CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED TO SMILE! Mr. and Mrs. Prickett who had joined the staff in 1916 were mountain born and bred with mountain sympathies and education. They were able to get in closer touch with a certain class of recluse and backward people than our more cosmopolitan Pi Phis could do. The school staff that year had grown to six. During the autumn of 1916, a ten-room teachers' residence, designed and planned by Aida and Almina Wilson, Iowa r, experienced architects, was built and was ready for occupancy by Christmas time. The house had furnace heat, running water, bath, and was modern in every respect built as a model home in addition to furnishing quarters for the teachers. All materials except the lumber, were freighted over the rough roads from the "outside." The carpenters' work was done entirely by mountain men under the guidance of an experienced builder, imported for the occasion.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots. Marjorie Jackson said ( pupils, "They are in assembly with vanced grades, and the sight of their scared faces in contrast with the eager ing faces of our regular pupils touching." Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France.

He left a little wife of about sixteen who was in our School for a time. Elder Ogle Enlisted in the navy April 5, 1917. Trained at Norfolk.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident.

She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

Constitution, which stated that "Members of the several chapters shall, upon graduation, become members of the alumna chapter, but shall retain connection with their former chapter. The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ? This is a question often asked and rarely answered. We can .only suggest possible means.

October, 1915, the church held meetings at Gatlinburg for two Id the school became badly disor-Ind did not recover fully until afterthe Christmas holidays. The most important thing, perhaps, which was accomplished in the school work was the grading of the classes. Improvement in singing was reported during the year. The children were learning to sing the same songs as other primary children. Too, there was a noticeable change in the faces of the children from the days when Dell Gillette spoke of the "sad faces" of the little ones. These children were learning to play games such as Fanner-in-the-Dell and to jump rope with a grape vine. There was the usual Christmas tree, also carols. Cooking classes were held for the girls in the teachers' cottage. A debating club and other school activities aroused a new spirit in the children and their people took pride in theirwork. The mothers and fathers though did not approve of the girls playing basketball in bloomers just as they disapproved of the teachers riding a horse astride. The older boys loved to sing and spent most of their time at recess and at noon singing hymns. Attendance was still a problem. The school terms were arranged in order to fit the needs of the community. As soon as the weather began to be settled in the spring all of the older children, both the boys and girls, "stopped out" to help plant corn and were busy helping with the crop until it was "laid by" about the first of July, then there was a month of respite when they had singing school and a picnic at Elkmont; by the first of August, the children were ready to attend school. For a week or two they left again to "pull fodder," then they were in again for a few days and out again to pick beans. Between times They made molasses, and then came the picking of peas. After the corn was shocked the first of November they came to school with fair regularity. During 1914-15 a new orchard of three dozen trees was started; a model hen house was built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk was laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field was cleaned and leveled, some of the picking of rocks being performed by tardy pupils, the old barn was torn down; basket-ball posts were made; a bridge was built across Baskins; about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes were set out; a straw-berry bed was started and a new garden fenced in; a new 60 foot well was dug and the teachers' residence was remodeled. THE FEBRUARY ARROW A change in routine came, however, in 1916 with the resignation of Miss Pollard who asked for a leave of absence in order to prepare for greater development of the industrial work. Miss Hughes also resigned. Elva Plank, Iowa E, took charge of the business details of the school and served as Head Resident until called home by illness the following January. There was no Head Resident during the spring session of 1917 but Mr. Norman Prickett, manual training teacher, acted as Principal of the School.she was forced to go foot, Mrs. Helmick ) men to see that the 1 The building of especial attention at One cold frosty mot of the oldest inhabit Mrs. Helmick to sa and solicitude: "Ma. it no longer ; we sail( and tell you that it that that ere watery THE CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED TO SMILE!

They were able to get in closer touch with a certain class of recluse and backward people than our more cosmopolitan Pi Phis could do. The school staff that year had grown to six. During the autumn of 1916, a ten-room teachers' residence, designed and planned by Aida and Almina Wilson, Iowa r, experienced architects, was built and was ready for occupancy by Christmas time. The house had furnace heat, running water, bath, and was modern in every respect built as a model home in addition to furnishing quarters for the teachers.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots. Marjorie Jackson said ( pupils, "They are in assembly with vanced grades, and the sight of their scared faces in contrast with the eager ing faces of our regular pupils touching." Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident.

Bishop, ay College at Sevier-end of the Settlement ag. Until the time of ras never too busy to early visitor to the cate position. She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting.

Now with splendid progress being at the School there came the problem ( could be done to help the people back creeks in Sugarlands and Little Baskins and Spruce Flats, and Mill and Little Dudley.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead.

For some women like this, we emancipation from tending the others the money it brings means ne a new dress for one of the childrer of meal for the family, or a new ant piece of furniture.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

After the shop was corn-the School deemed it wise to lease it Mattil rather than to attempt to put paying basis at that time. Since Mr. contract has been terminated, the is used now as headquarters for the .g Department and for other interests g around the girls and women. Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

"The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

Constitution, which stated that "Members of the several chapters shall, upon graduation, become members of the alumna chapter, but shall retain connection with their former chapter. The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ? This is a question often asked and rarely answered. We can .only suggest possible means.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots. Marjorie Jackson said ( pupils, "They are in assembly with vanced grades, and the sight of their scared faces in contrast with the eager ing faces of our regular pupils touching." Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting. The teachers had it a great task to keep the pupils in regularly and the home visiting had this problem in some respects. Now with splendid progress being at the School there came the problem ( could be done to help the people back creeks in Sugarlands and Little Baskins and Spruce Flats, and Mill and Little Dudley. Four adjoining districts wished to their county schools which they rea were inferior to the Pi Phi School in ment, length of school year, and qu, teaching, and to send all the children School.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead. I've lived in the san for twenty years sometimes I think a sight to change. When I heered weaving I jest thought I'd quit worki field an' let the young uns do hit.

For some women like this, we emancipation from tending the others the money it brings means ne a new dress for one of the childrer of meal for the family, or a new ant piece of furniture.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France. Dallard Ownby Training camp, overseas service. This was the first time he ever had been away from home and he wrote of wanting to get back to the quiet of the mountains and asked how the hunting and trapping were. He left a little wife of about sixteen who was in our School for a time. Elder Ogle Enlisted in the navy April 5, 1917. Trained at Norfolk. In two weeks was sent aboard the Louisiana and was later on a transport. (Note: The boys on the Louisiana were trained by T. N.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident. She is well equipped mentally, and naturally gifted in character for the understakincr of such a deli "MISS EVELYN" ood mountain people )se musical talent was r contacts with the , Dr. E. A. Bishop, ay College at Sevier-end of the Settlement ag. Until the time of ras never too busy to early visitor to the cate position. She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old. "And water on a baby -c death unless used in small doses!" The fall of 1918 was a busy sea every one. About fifteeen of the gir. their own hats for the first time with purchased by the School, and eagc laundry work or washed windows to the cost. Several of the pupils tool lessons. Baseball teams were organic a new clock golf ground was fixed. 'I the School won prizes for exhibits at t at Sevierville and at Knoxville. Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting. The teachers had it a great task to keep the pupils in regularly and the home visiting had this problem in some respects. Now with splendid progress being at the School there came the problem ( could be done to help the people back creeks in Sugarlands and Little Baskins and Spruce Flats, and Mill and Little Dudley. Four adjoining districts wished to their county schools which they rea were inferior to the Pi Phi School in ment, length of school year, and qu, teaching, and to send all the children School.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead.

For some women like this, we emancipation from tending the others the money it brings means ne a new dress for one of the childrer of meal for the family, or a new ant piece of furniture.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows. Too, he supervised fol the regular farm work at the School, i: in g the helpers in scientific methoc chain Pig Clubs were a marked succes Mr. Denton, also of the staff, at Mattil organized a basketball team companied the team on their seven for games with neighboring schools. the first year that the boys had playe petitive ball, in fact, many of them ha seen a game of basketball before an were reluctant to wear their suits, insist on wearing overalls under their trunks. insisted on keeping their caps on wh. played.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

After the shop was corn-the School deemed it wise to lease it Mattil rather than to attempt to put paying basis at that time. Since Mr. contract has been terminated, the is used now as headquarters for the .g Department and for other interests g around the girls and women. Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

Constitution, which stated that "Members of the several chapters shall, upon graduation, become members of the alumna chapter, but shall retain connection with their former chapter. The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ? This is a question often asked and rarely answered. We can .only suggest possible means.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident.

She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old. "And water on a baby -c death unless used in small doses!" The fall of 1918 was a busy sea every one.

Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting. The teachers had it a great task to keep the pupils in regularly and the home visiting had this problem in some respects. Now with splendid progress being at the School there came the problem ( could be done to help the people back creeks in Sugarlands and Little Baskins and Spruce Flats, and Mill and Little Dudley.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?"

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields.

He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

"The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed.

In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

With ble sometimes to use a car and longer trips could be made. Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead. I've lived in the san for twenty years sometimes I think a sight to change. When I heered weaving I jest thought I'd quit worki field an' let the young uns do hit.

By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community.

He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

After the shop was corn-the School deemed it wise to lease it Mattil rather than to attempt to put paying basis at that time. Since Mr. contract has been terminated, the is used now as headquarters for the .g Department and for other interests g around the girls and women. Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

By 1925 Gatlinburg had become mountain summer resort, with electri supplied from a dam, with picture given regularly once a week by the with a demand for better drinking all things hygienic, with a radio at the with growing demands for pure and stock and chickens, with an annual F early each September, from which were sent to the outside world.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ? This is a question often asked and rarely answered. We can .only suggest possible means.

The prize for the best design, an arrowhead, went to Alice Wright (Wallace) , a pledge of Wyoming A. This design was used as the basis for a trademark which was finally registered with the United States .Government through the kindness of Mr. Hadley Freeman. The Arrowcraft Trademark was held up at first because of complications arising from ARROWCRAFT TREASURES taken much planning on the part of )ol staff to keep the weaving evenly :ed as there are now many more seeking work than can be supplied the resignation of Miss Redding, Strand became the weaving teacher is later followed by Mrs. Irene L.

Every effort was made to e workmanship on the baskets better. 1 the baskets came in as never before attic of the teachers' cottage was re-o be "running over with them." 24 the Grand Council and Settlement :ommittee voted to secure and use a rk for articles made at the School, and ad Council recommended that a con the protests of Cluett, Peabody, and Company. By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows. Too, he supervised fol the regular farm work at the School, i: in g the helpers in scientific methoc chain Pig Clubs were a marked succes Mr. Denton, also of the staff, at Mattil organized a basketball team companied the team on their seven for games with neighboring schools. the first year that the boys had playe petitive ball, in fact, many of them ha seen a game of basketball before an were reluctant to wear their suits, insist on wearing overalls under their trunks. insisted on keeping their caps on wh. played.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

After the shop was corn-the School deemed it wise to lease it Mattil rather than to attempt to put paying basis at that time. Since Mr. contract has been terminated, the is used now as headquarters for the .g Department and for other interests g around the girls and women. Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

Constitution, which stated that "Members of the several chapters shall, upon graduation, become members of the alumna chapter, but shall retain connection with their former chapter. The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

After the shop was corn-the School deemed it wise to lease it Mattil rather than to attempt to put paying basis at that time. Since Mr. contract has been terminated, the is used now as headquarters for the .g Department and for other interests g around the girls and women. Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality. Among the improve 1922-23 was the con; water reservoir with a i ions, which appreciabI3 ard. Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

"The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to help keep the flies off and protecthe gave demonstrations with moving 1 in many outlying school houses and t present as vividly as possible and in a tical a way as he could the things wl hoped would be of the greatest benefit community. Mr. Mattil was especially successful work with the Fairs at Gatlinburg and ville and in the East Tennessee Fair at ville. He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows. Too, he supervised fol the regular farm work at the School, i: in g the helpers in scientific methoc chain Pig Clubs were a marked succes Mr. Denton, also of the staff, at Mattil organized a basketball team companied the team on their seven for games with neighboring schools. the first year that the boys had playe petitive ball, in fact, many of them ha seen a game of basketball before an were reluctant to wear their suits, insist on wearing overalls under their trunks. insisted on keeping their caps on wh. played.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Since Mr. contract has been terminated, the is used now as headquarters for the .g Department and for other interests g around the girls and women. Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg. To follow a leisurely chronologic tailed account of the developments Settlement School at Gatlinburg duri VIEWS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING OF INDUSTRIAL UNIT Omega, University of Tennessee, was the Demonstration Better Home. Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess.

Every teacher state certificate at the opening of the ssion and there was no longer any out our rating with the state depart went of education. "The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas.

"The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

L"NICE WEAVER, Illinois 2 Director xrace Coolidge Library of the School, ms so named by the Committee in ntained in 1930 some 3500 volumes ere rearranged by Miss McCullough, In from Evansville, Ind. Efforts have de and are being made to furnish 1i-:Ides to the Community. school workers are active in County ;' Meetings, in the Southern Handiaild, the Women's Institutes, the n Workers' Conference, and in all nal activities that are planned for the nt of the Southern Highlander. ates have been sent from the School us have been read at the conferences ur School has now a recognized place he educational institutions and influthe southern mountains. The county and state recognize our value and each year larger grants are given for the grade school teachers' salaries, agriculture and domestic science and weaving. In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop.

On Friday evening, Helen Booker Sawyer entertained with a delightful dinner at the Monmouth Country Club and gave to new and old Pi Phis a last cherished opportunity for happy fellowship. Eyes were misty when the old Zeta hymn rang out for the last time "in the old way" but as the beautiful "Pi Beta Phi Anthem" succeeded it there remained in the hearts of all only a strong loyal love for Pi Beta Phi and a deep .happiness in a "dream come true.". .

They inspected Jellico Plains; and attended a convention of all of the public school teachers of Sevier county at Sevierville, at which Emma Harper Turner was asked to speak. One of the teachers, Miss Mabel Moore of Greenville, Tenn., who at tended the meeting went to Miss Turner afterwards and told her about the Gat linburg community, earnestly urging that the committee visit there before making a decision relative to a site for a school. After returning to Knoxville from Sevierville, the committee made plans for a visit to Gatlinburg. Unforeseen circumstances, how-ever, arose, and Miss Turner and Miss Pettit felt it necessary to return to their homes, so Dr. Keller made the trip alone. In writing of this first trip to Little Pigeon, Dr. Keller said: "My trip began with a long distance message from Sevierville summoning me to appear there the next day when a mythical Mr. Drinnen would meet me at the train and drive me up into the mountains. Early the next morning at six-thirty I took my seat in the single passenger coach drawn by a diminutive engine, which burned wood, not coal. We puffed, snorted, and panted our way up to Sevierville, the terminal of the toy road. Arrived at the station, Mr. Drinnen, then County Superintendent of Schools, and one of the finest friends our school has ever had, met me, drove me to the hotel, and left me with the assurance he would call for me the next morning at five and drive me to Gatlin-burg where there was a community without school facilities, and without the prospect of attaining any. . . Early the next morning Mr. Drinnen appeared in a small, light buggy. His greeting was 'I am sure glad you came.' On further inquiry I elicited the information that I had `kind of that healthy look' which would be necessary to sustain me over seventeen miles of the worst road in Tennessee. At that time there were no bridges, the road to Pigeon Forge had not been built, and we forded creeks up to the floor of the buggy. The road was beautiful running along the edge of Birds Creek, bordered with mountain laurel, with here and there a grassy meadow set down right in the middle of the mountains. One funny experience we had ; we passed a man, who looked and walked as if afflicted with hookworm, and a minute later TYPICAL OLD SCHOOL HOUSE 1912 the local Washington committee be serve as a subcommittee. at the national committee be em-to send out requests for contribu-I pledges at their discretion. :onvention most enthusiastically ac-le recommendations and voted thanks rashington Alumnae Club for its sug was launched a project which has the pride of every wearer of the Dn as possible after the Convention nvestigation of possible school sites ed.

He saw the hind wheel coming and never even moved, so we had to descend and pull him out of the way, that done he rose, shook himself, gave a little yelp, and slowly betook himself elsewhere. "The first school we visited was at the Glades. It was situated on a high hill, and was the usual wooden structure of one room. All the children were dressed in calico and were bare-footed, but had bright intelligent faces, and they were clean. "The trouble with the schools seems to be "At dinner we h dodgers, ate with tiny true mountain hospit to pay for our meal ( saying that he also wa and was glad to cute] who has taught seve unusually intelligent, talk to me.

I think TYPICAL MOUNTAIN HOME NEAR GATLINBURG that few of the teachers have ever gone to a high school, and that they are teaching the same grade work they have done themselves. In this school the teacher, a man, had adopted the labor-saving device of having an older girl or boy hear the younger ones recite. "The next school was larger, there were 120 children, and the whole place was so crowded that the younger children were dismissed early to give the older ones more room. A man and a woman taught this school, and I was particularly attracted by the latter. The cry is everywhere more room needed and more teachers. Here as in the other schools we visited, both Mr. Drinnen and I gave the school a talk and in Gatlinburg, a good many of the men came to hear what we had to say.

The Committee, however, was not sure that it was what it wanted. At Wears Valley a school had been established originally under Presbyterian auspices and thus continued for a time. The property was valued at $3,000 with a comparatively large school in successful operation and supported by the good will and cooperation of the people. The entire plant was offered to Pi Beta Phi outright as a gift for the simple taking. A second meeting of the Committee was held in Philadelphia in .May "911, at the home of Anna F. T. Pettit. At this meeting a decision was reached favoring Gatlinburg for the school site instead of Wears Valley. The factors determining this were: Need, opportunities for influence as to territory and population, ability of Pi Beta Phi to meet the special local need. Gatlinburg had been settled sometime b tween 1801 and 1807 by the first settlers coming over the Indian. Gap Trail on horse-back and on foot from North and South Carolina. It was first called "The White Oak Flats," but the postoffice name was changed to Gatlinburg in honor of a man who kept a store there just before the Civil War. According to a description in one of the Committee reports: "Gatlinburg is in the eastern part of Sevier County; a center of teaming routes into the mountains; a point of large influence; no railroad connections but the prospective terminus of a branch road from Sevierville; wildly beautiful country; not a town but a community along the big road; served by rural mail carriers; has a little public school house that has not been re-roofed in 30. years; school furniture home-made and 20 years old. (Steps are being taken at present to build a new school house.) About 200 children are within school influence of this point and many very needy out-lying coves are accessible from it. The public school term usually begins in August and closes at Christmas--teachers' salary $30." The Committee appropriated $500 as a maximum limit for school expenses of the first session, that amount to be repaid to the Endowment Fund as soon as other contributions should come in. After careful study the Committee recommended that the fraternity 'ooperate with the public schools, if possible, under arrange THE FEBRUARY ARROW ments satisfactory to Pi Beta Phi, rather than to undertake an independent work since it was felt that this Public School cooperation "would be the best means of help towards Negotiations were opened at once with the School Board and citizens at Gatlinburg but delays almost disheartening attended every step, County school officials had been changed since Miss Keller 's visit and the new officials had to be informed about the proposed work and had to be interested.for the removal of `thi! among us."

Growing desperate from the delays, the National Committee at last decided not to wait longer for public school cooperation, but to enter the community by an independent and perhaps temporary school, and to con-duct all further negotiations through a representative on the field. The Grand Council officially endorsed such action. It was discovered later that one cause of many delays in getting the work started, was the fact that part of the community was op-posed to our advent for fear of a new church establishment. Such a thing had happened under similar circumstances in a nearby community. The idea of a purely altruistic project was entirely foreign to local conception. "Certain church men were particularly virulent in their opposition to us, and even after the school was established one minister prayed At last a Pi Phi was ( was forced to decline illness.

Most of the alumnm clubs were interested in the Settlement School project and up to March 15, 1912 the receipts totaled $2,775.63. It was necessary, however, to do much pioneer work in "selling" the idea of the School to many, just as it is necessary to do publicity work on any new undertaking. In 1911 one club reported: "Our club was divided somewhat on the Settlement School project. Some liked it, others did not. Those against it seemed to feel it is a missionary MISS HILL AND THE FIRST PI BETA PHI SCHOOL March 1912 letter written while she was getting open the school, Miss Hill said: y every woman I met expressed a desire your school.

Indeed you can think of of educational or settlement work that !eded at Gatlinburg. It is a splendid place efforts. Hill was authorized by the committee ge as assistant, a nurse from a train venture and thought churches covered that field." The club nevertheless loyally made a contribution. Another club wrote: "We are sorry to say that the Settlement School proposition failed to interest our club to the extent of any accomplishment." Some of the clubs raised money through benefit plays, stereopticon lectures, etc., but for the most part the first money raised was chiefly by special assessment of members voluntarily set by the clubs. As soon, however, as it was known that we had a worker in the field, interest among the clubs grew rapidly and has since kept pace with the development of the work on Little Pigeon. Miss Louise Van Sant, Maryland A, acted as chairman of special furnishing for the teach THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' cottage at Gatlinburg, leading a spirited campaign of solicitation among the clubs. The most outstanding gift was that of an organ provided by the Washington and Baltimore Clubs, for which they sacrificed their Founders' Day banquet. Mr. Percy Foster of Washington, piano dealer, furnished the organ at cost and attended to the shipment. Early reports of Miss Van Sant showed a pledge of table silver from the Los Angeles club, of linen from Boston, of a sewing ma-chine from Franklin, window shades from Baltimore, a box of rugs and books from Washington, a cereal double boiler from Philadelphia, magazine subscriptions from Syracuse, a clock from the mother of a Michigan Pi Phi, sheets and bird pictures from Carrie Flagler Shantz, of Iowa ,0, napkins and dish towels from the Chicago Alum= Club, damask towels and books and pictures from the Boston Club, and 12 yards of blackboard cloth and a box of books from St. Louis. Although January 1912 had been set as the date for the opening of the school, more than two months were required in making preparations for the opening, which took place in March with 14 pupils enrolled. The session lasted three months and dosed with 33 enrolled. This first Pi Beta Phi school was held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, destined to be-come famous in later years as the Arrowcraft Shop. On June 28, Miss Hill gave a school pro-gram which was pronounced a great success and it was said that "nothing like it had ever been held there before."

The people, especially the women, begged that the school remain in the Burg. Two of the most interested persons were Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff. They were not natives of the community, but had come in. Mrs. Huff was born in another part of Tennessee and Mr. Huff's home state was Pennsylvania. Mr. Huff owned large lumber interests. They were progressive people and wanted education for SCHOOL BUILDING USED BY PI BETA PHI: AUGUST 1912, 1913, 1914 tuber 30, since a term from August nher was all that the public funds 'ply. ptember 1912, Mrs. Helmick, as of the Committee, made a trip to rg with a view to selecting a build-She called a community meeting and people about Pi Beta Phi and ex-bat the fraternity proposed to give permanent, lasting gift in a new Mrs. Helmick had finished her talk d for expressions from the audience s not a sound.

I replied," Helmick, " `No one church, and yet Christian churches' and gave the their four children who were then in the school. In trying to find a suitable building site, Mrs. Helmick told Mr. Huff that in the progressive west where she lived, when an enterprise like the Settlement School thought of coming to a place permanently, "it was customary if the people wanted it, for the business men to get together, and offer an inducement to its coming." She explained that she had been obliged to hunt up proper-ties and to urge men to put a reasonable valuation upon their land when they had a month ago expressed a desire to sell. Mr. Huff took his cue and before Mrs. Helmick left that afternoon, met her on the road to tell her that: "We men have gotten together, and if you folks want the Richard ogle place, and you feel $2000 is too much, I have a man who will give you $800 for the store, and if THE 'FEBRUARY ARROW $1200 is more than you want to pay, we propose making up the difference among us. We want your school right here. ' e know Miss Hill and we know what you have done, and we stand together to do anything you wish to keep you here. Please don't let any-thing influence you to go elsewhere." The next day the County Superintendent, J. S. Keeble, after talking with Mr. Huff, made the proposition that the fraternity take the entire charge of the school management in the Gatlinburg district. He offered to give a clear, absolute deed to all the public school property, including a new building valued at $1000 which stood on a bill overlooking the Burg, and to turn over, in cash, the pay allotted the school teachers by the school authorities annually, without a "string" of any kind, as long as Pi Beta Phi maintained a public and free school in the lower grades. As a result of her trip to Tennessee, Mrs. Helmick asked the Chicago Club to authorize the Sub-Committee to hire an assistant to Miss Hill; to take over the public school property and obligation; to buy the necessary property; and to put up the necessary buildings, with the understanding that all was to be done when the money was available. The club gave the authorization. A vivid description of the "closes" of the school on November 30, 1912 was written by Kate B. Miller of the Committee after she had visited Gatlinburg. Miss Miller said: "They had come at night, some of them at half-past six, though that was the bedtime of many of them. They had come from up Baskins' way, on Mill Creek, down Roaring Brook, farther up Little Pigeon, from Holy Top, and Dick's Range, over devious mountain trails and rocky, muddy mountain roads of so modest a nature that they were often difficult to find. Most of them came afoot, carrying babies, leading little children, and lighting their uncertain way with lamps and lanterns. Their goal was the school house on the small high nob, which had but one way of rational approach. The person who sought to scale the rocky bluff of seventy-five or a hundred feet from. the Roaring Brook side or the Little Pigeon and bad road side would have stood small chance of reaching Minerva's temple on top. And so they plodded along the meandering muddy road, around and up the hill. They were all there waiting when Miss Hill, Miss Gillette, Mrs. J. R. Keeble, the County Superintendent of Schools, Dr. E. A. Bishop, the president of Murray College, and I stumbled our lamp down and up the slim Phi cottage, half a mil( lute quiet during the p except by the processi who passed to and fry the stove reserved for warm themselves, and DELL GILLET First Pi Beta Phi Teach as one and all at vari( necks to see how the , the efforts of the chile sided with boards, w2. the lamps and lantern had brought.

The first piece of work which each made was a white linen collar. While the girls sewed "Miss Dell" or someone reed aloud. For the boys, Miss Gillette adopted certain Boy Scout rules for behaviour and development in two baseball teams. One was an indoor team which played in the abandoned Methodist Church, and the other was a regular outside team which played in the "flats." The school closed on the last of March. For the first time in the history of the community, the children had gone to school for eight months in one year! Although the school had progressed splendidly and Pi Beta Phi had made wonderful friends in the community, two things happened which almost caused the withdrawal of the fraternity from Gatlinburg to some other locality. It will be recalled that the county superintendent had assured the Committee that the whole school situation would be given into Pi Beta Phi's control, but Mrs. Helmick and Miss Miller found upon their arrival at Gatlinburg in July 1913, that although al-most everyone in the community wanted Pi Beta Phi to conduct the school, a local man was hired through a misunderstanding. By the opening of the next term, however, the misunderstanding had been deared. The Board voted that after Christmas, the public school building should be given to PI Beta Phi for its use and that another year the fraternity should have the whole school situation in its hands. The next and very vital matter to be settled was that of acquiring land. Although several places were considered, the only really desirable tract seemed to be that owned by E. E. Ogle, but the men of the village did not think that he would sell even if the money could be raised. Despite the fact that the men had some time before agreed to help with the purchase of property for the school, they now seemed to hang back and to want Pi Beta Phi to try to raise the money and to persuade Mr. Ogle to sell. It was not that they were shirking a promise but rather that they had never assisted with the promotion of any community project such as this and seemingly did not know how to go about it. Mrs. Helmick talked with Mr. Ogle and found that he would sell for $1800. If the fraternity would put in $600 and the men of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the community, $1.200, the land no doubt could be obtained. . Since the matter had dragged along for months with nothing accomplished, Mrs. Helmick issued an ultimatum saying that if the Ogle land were not obtained for the fraternity (we contributing $600) by the next day at noon, Pi Beta Phi would go elsewhere and establish a school where land would be given to us. Kate Miller's graphic description shows the tenseness of the situation: We now wondered what they would do. They were at last convinced that "those wimmin" meant what they said, We packed our trunks, began to get the household things ready to leave until we should have them sent elsewhere, ordered the hack from Sevierville to come for us the next day, and wondered what the next twenty-four hours would bring forth. Mr. Huff was sent for in his lumber camp eight miles away; everyone gave up his busi ness and those who had no lousiness gave that up, all more deeply excited than they had ever been. We were now to see the miracle: these mountain men and women, moved by their very strong desire to keep the fraternity school, forgot their reserve, threw off their easy-going ways, and went to work for a community enterprise. Never before had they cooperated for a public affair. They said that there was no one who could go ahead, but the necessity for a leader developed one, and Andy Huff was drawn forth. As think back over the stirring weeks, it seems to me that nothing which came cut of them will be of greater good to these men and women than this: the knowledge that they can do things themselves. Tuesday evening we had many callers, three of the women staying until after dark. They said they just couldn't let us go, that they knew the men would try their best, but that perhaps they couldn't raise enough money. For women in the mountains to stay out after dark was a violation of their social code, but they were forgetting even their social customs now. The next morning while we were at breakfast, Mr. Huff and Steve Whaley came to get us to draw up a subscription paper. Mrs. Helmick wrote the heading for one, putting Pi Beta Phi down for $600. Andy Huff put down $250 and Steve Whaley $250. Then they started off saying that the hack would not take us back. After the men had left, Mrs. Huff came to us and told us of her dream. She dropped into a chair in our kitchen as we were washing the dishes that morning and said: "I had a dream last night." It seemed that she had dreamt that she and the children were all down by the river bank playing. The children had pushed through the bushes and had slipped down to the river bed where they were playing on the dry gravelly bottom in the pools. She had stayed up on the road and suddenly she looked up the river to the distant mountains that seemed to close it in. There she saw rising and clinging to the mountain sides a "big steam, a fog." Then the fog began to roll in clouds, and to come down the river slowly. It kept getting bigger and bigger and kept rolling and rolling down towards the place where the children were playing. Her eyes grew large and her voice tense as the vividness of her vision cameback to her. She repeater fog kept rolling and rollii bigger and coming down the river she also saw, in danger, the Reagan an, thought that the fog was as her own children.

Asheville, N.C., asking if she could y help, was sent for. ugust 4, 1913, Kate Miller assisted ,angmaid in opening the school in old school house on Baskins and peon. That was the beginning of the first year in our own buildings and with entirely Pi Phi teachers. Two months later, Miss Langmaid re-signed and was succeeded by Mary O. Pollard, Vermont A, who was given the title of Head Resident. The outstanding accomplishment of the year 1913-14, in addition to the acquiring of the land, was the building of a new school building, plans for which had been drawn originally by Mr. and Mrs. Von Hoist of Chicago, Mrs. Von Hoist (Lucy Hammond, Colorado B) , being a member of the Chicago Alumnae Club. This new building, a one-story frame structure 60 x 84 feet, with its rather low, projecting roof, resembled a bungalow and was built at an approximate cost of $3,735.30. The main entrance was from a porch into a large hall, from which five class rooms opened, one on each side, and three in the rear. The hall was used as a reading and rest room. A large fireplace was opposite the entrance. The three class rooms at the rear were separated by sliding doors which could be thrown back, making the room into one large room. In December the work of the school having increased to such proportions, Miss Pollard requested two additional teachers and Leah Stock (Helmick) , Michigan A, and Edith Wilson, Indiana A, volunteered their services. The session closed on April 3 with 127 pupils. During the year the young orchard was pruned and cared for; gardens were planted and were worked "on shares," and much thought was given to beautifying the grounds. The Department of Agriculture at Washington furnished the school with a liberal supply of bulbs, shrubs, and seeds, which were planted to good effect. A Tomato Club the only one in Sevier county was organized by Miss Virginia Moore, state organizer of Tomato Canning Clubs for girls. Dr. Yancy, the state hookworm specialist, made three visits to the school and con-ducted a free clinic during the summer months. Miss Pollard remained at the school during the summer, giving her time and strength without reserve, walking miles and miles to tell the people of the danger of hookworm and urging them to come in to receive the free treatment at the Pi Phi school. She assisted the doctor personally in giving out medicines and in making examinations. THE FEBRUARY ARROW The Chairman of the Settlement School Committee reported at the end of the school year that a fund had been started by three of our Founders, with the result that $150 was then in the bank for the establishment of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital at Gatlinburg, in loving memory of Jennie Nicol of "Alpha." Late in June, the Settlement School Committee sent out attractive invitations to the dedication of the new school building which took place on July 9.

Onken, Anne Stuart, and Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) were in attendance and as sisted in preparing for the guests of the day whom they entertained at luncheon. Extracts from the description of the dedi cation of Pi Beta Phi's first school building, as recorded by Sarah G. Pomeroy (Rugg) follow: Long before the appointed time on that sultry summer day guests from a distance began to arrive; they came on foot and on horseback; a few rode in buggies or mountain wagons but the vast majority patronized the "shoe leather express," walking five, eight, or even ten miles to be present at the great occasion. The seats, desks and other school furniture had already been placed, and the fire-place in the entrance hall was banked with ferns and wild flowers, for every effort was made to decorate our building as a northern school building would be decked on a similar occasion. The first to arrive were Miss Evelyn Bishop, New York A, and her friend, Miss Walker, who had driven up from Sevierville. Then came Vera Kerr Kessler, Massachusetts A, and her husband, Lt. Kessler, U. S. Navy, who had been spending a few days at Wonderland Park, a mountain resort some nine miles from Gatlinburg. Hearing of the dedication they came over with two friends, Miss Oldman and Miss Hazard.

She was a remarkable woman, having raised her family of children after her husband was killed almost on her doorstep during the Civil War. The "Aunt Lyddie" baskets were known far and wide. In March 1915, Miss Pollard wrote to THE ARROW: "We are hoping to emphasize the industrial side of our work more and more. We are hoping to start basket making in the school, hoping that it will prove a profitable industry. Many of the women make exquisite patchwork quilts and some still mare the hand woven coverlids and blankets. If a sale could be found for these articles, many might undertake the work." And that is where the alumnae department of Pi Beta Phi has accomplished a marvelous work by making a "sale for these articles." In May of that year, Caroline Mc Knight Hughes, Minnesota A, a graduate of the University of Michigan, of Cooper Union School of Art and of Prang Normal, took charge of the business and industrial work, spending some time in the summer looking the situation over, and starting the fall as Head Resident in charge of industrial work, with Mary O. Pollard as Principal of the school. Miss Hughes installed a manual training outfit at a cost of $172.81 with which she gave instruction to 52 boys and a beginning was made of a department which it was hoped in time would be of great benefit to the community and to the school. It was noised about that "them wimmin" were going to "teach tools," and the curiosity of the Burg was so great that some of the residents ran down the country road to meet the wagon bringing in the tools. All they saw were some boxes, nailed up tight, and some crates with they knew not what inside. The excitement and curiosity was equal to a circus coming to town and when the five benches were in place, with the tools set out, every man and boy able to come to the School, did so. Apparently no one knew much about tools, except the saw, plane and hammer, and the first day of class work was a queer one. As soon as possible the weaving department was equipped, spinning bees and quilting parties were given with the hope of reviving those almost lost industries. For the first time in the fall of 1915 the school began the sale of baskets, purchasing THE FEBRUARY ARROW THE LOOMS ARE PUT TO WORK materials and articles for the industrial work, trying to raise the standard of workmanship, and endeavoring to find a market for the products. In urging the revival of industrial work, Miss Hughes said: "In the yesteryear this country was a community of weavers, but after the War `store cloth' was cheap so that one woman after another put the old loom aside, but many of our neighbors today know how to spin and weave though it has been a 'tol'able long spell' since any of them havedone such a thing. 01 the school, has her willing to make `kivi dear to the hearts o the women still use twist stocking yarn flax has disappeared. mond Dyes to color ti cent know how to m; roots, weeds, etc. Al are either the one `g from Car'liny when THE FEBRUARY ARROW these old ones, and of course one are crude homemade affairs.

Hlughes instructed the children in the art of weaving tiny rugs, mats mocks. In response to her call for in the work, the Springfield, Mo., ed $100 for the buying of looms. the first year that the Chicago Club had charge of the Settlement ,,ork, the Committee met once a [ devoted much time, thought, and the school business. The members ab earned $10 each for the School e 1914, Mrs. Helmick moved away icago but the Chicago club asked ain the Directorship of the School, of residence. For the following managed the School practically being able to hold conferences committee members. In making her the convention, Mrs. Helmick 1ded that the direction of the Setchool should be in the hands of the )uncil and that the general manage-:he affairs of the Settlement School, those of the treasurer, should be t the hands of the ' Grand Vice ingly the Alum= Session of Con-a 1915, authorized that the Settleool be placed under the control of f Managers appointed by the Grand nd also made the Chairman of the rational officer with all privileges as e to convention.

October, 1915, the church held meetings at Gatlinburg for two Id the school became badly disor-Ind did not recover fully until afterthe Christmas holidays. The most important thing, perhaps, which was accomplished in the school work was the grading of the classes. Improvement in singing was reported during the year. The children were learning to sing the same songs as other primary children. Too, there was a noticeable change in the faces of the children from the days when Dell Gillette spoke of the "sad faces" of the little ones. These children were learning to play games such as Fanner-in-the-Dell and to jump rope with a grape vine. There was the usual Christmas tree, also carols. Cooking classes were held for the girls in the teachers' cottage. A debating club and other school activities aroused a new spirit in the children and their people took pride in theirwork. The mothers and fathers though did not approve of the girls playing basketball in bloomers just as they disapproved of the teachers riding a horse astride. The older boys loved to sing and spent most of their time at recess and at noon singing hymns. Attendance was still a problem. The school terms were arranged in order to fit the needs of the community. As soon as the weather began to be settled in the spring all of the older children, both the boys and girls, "stopped out" to help plant corn and were busy helping with the crop until it was "laid by" about the first of July, then there was a month of respite when they had singing school and a picnic at Elkmont; by the first of August, the children were ready to attend school. For a week or two they left again to "pull fodder," then they were in again for a few days and out again to pick beans. Between times They made molasses, and then came the picking of peas. After the corn was shocked the first of November they came to school with fair regularity. During 1914-15 a new orchard of three dozen trees was started; a model hen house was built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk was laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field was cleaned and leveled, some of the picking of rocks being performed by tardy pupils, the old barn was torn down; basket-ball posts were made; a bridge was built across Baskins; about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes were set out; a straw-berry bed was started and a new garden fenced in; a new 60 foot well was dug and the teachers' residence was remodeled. THE FEBRUARY ARROW A change in routine came, however, in 1916 with the resignation of Miss Pollard who asked for a leave of absence in order to prepare for greater development of the industrial work. Miss Hughes also resigned. Elva Plank, Iowa E, took charge of the business details of the school and served as Head Resident until called home by illness the following January. There was no Head Resident during the spring session of 1917 but Mr. Norman Prickett, manual training teacher, acted as Principal of the School.she was forced to go foot, Mrs. Helmick ) men to see that the 1 The building of especial attention at One cold frosty mot of the oldest inhabit Mrs. Helmick to sa and solicitude: "Ma. it no longer ; we sail( and tell you that it that that ere watery THE CHILDREN HAVE LEARNED TO SMILE! Mr. and Mrs. Prickett who had joined the staff in 1916 were mountain born and bred with mountain sympathies and education. They were able to get in closer touch with a certain class of recluse and backward people than our more cosmopolitan Pi Phis could do. The school staff that year had grown to six. During the autumn of 1916, a ten-room teachers' residence, designed and planned by Aida and Almina Wilson, Iowa r, experienced architects, was built and was ready for occupancy by Christmas time. The house had furnace heat, running water, bath, and was modern in every respect built as a model home in addition to furnishing quarters for the teachers. All materials except the lumber, were freighted over the rough roads from the "outside." The carpenters' work was done entirely by mountain men under the guidance of an experienced builder, imported for the occasion.

Through the work of Mr. and Mrs. Prickett and Ruth Meacham, Illinois ,A, of the School staff and with the aid of the new piano in the school room and new songbooks a wonderful improvement was evident in both the voices of the children and in the nature of the songs which they sang. In addition to having regular room work, each teacher under the direction of Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, Supervisor, was as-signed a definite responsibility in the settlement. Regular work in teaching of home economics was emphasized and the lower part of Mrs. Prickett's room was partitioned off by the manual training boys for the cooking department, which had been located in the teachers' cottage. Two three-holed kerosene stoves, with a complete working outfit for each, delighted the girls. Mrs. Prickett con-ducted the classes in cooking and sewing. Mr. Prickett endeavored to work up a Community Club among the men to be held in the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon. Under his direction, too, the mountain people began to make furniture: mountain porch chairs of hickory, black walnut chairs, stools, bookcases, etc. Soon after the entrance of the United States into the World War, Mrs. Helmick, who had served the School so efficiently as Chairman and treasurer of the Committee, was forced by home duties to resign the position. This resignation was accepted by the Grand Council at its meeting in Chicago in October, 1917 with the following expression of appreciation: "The Grand Council realizes the deep debt of gratitude which the fraternity owes Mrs. Helmick and it accepted her resignation only after it had been repeatedly given and when it seemed unfair longer to insist on her remaining in office." Mrs. Helmick's name will always be linked with the pioneer days of the Settlement School to which she gave much time and energy and made many personal sacrifices. The new Chairman, Waneta Bunting Richardson, Nebraska B, began her duties about December 1. During the strenuous year of 1917-18 everyone on the school staff, which then numbered seven, did double and triple duty. Since there was no Head Resident, Marjorie Jackson, Wisconsin A, acted as Secretary and Supervisor, taught the intermediate grades, wrote all letters to the chapters, clubs and THE ARROW, and carried on the duties of THE FEBRUARY ARROW the Head Resident. Ruth Meachem, Illinois A, taught the higher grades and music and had charge of the library. Emily Burton taught the little children and acted as house-mother, having charge of the meals, planning the work for the outside helpers, and was responsible for everything inside of the teachers' cottage. Later, Mrs. Emily Platt, mother of a Pi Phi, came to help with this work, relieving Miss Burton until the last of February. From then until the session closed, Estella Walters Ball of Iowa City, a charter talk was given by Ford J. Allen, and of greeting from Pi Phis all over the States was expressed by Mrs. Allen, Vice-President, who was visiting the in her official capacity. Steps were taken to form an orchesi composed of school students, two parents, and the teachers. On the last Friday of each moat was an educational entertainment g the students of the various rooms. was hoped, would be the nucleus of a POLLARD COTTAGE, STUART COTTAGE, TEACHERS' COTTAGE member of Iowa B, took over the work. Mrs. Platt and Mrs. Ball gave their services to the school, accepting only expenses to and from Gatlinburg. Upon a visit to the School of the Chair-man, Mrs. Richardson, accompanied by Melinda Stuart, Nebraska B, decision was made to hire Marshal Ogle to care for the farm and garden, secure wood for winter, have charge of the furnace and gas engine, and keep up necessary repairs. The school year 1917-18 saw the inauguration of several innovations. A lyceum course, held in the school every two weeks, was attended by the people of the community en masse. The first entertainment given by Mr. Prickett was a radiopticon lecture on the city of Birmingham, Ala. Next came a musical given by Evelyn Bishop, New York A, teacher of music at Murphy College. One evening was devoted to music furnished by Harve Reagan, Lawson Maples, and Henry Quarrels at which a splendid war Teachers' Club. It was a radical dl from anything before attempted. A class was organized for so-calle quents. In this class the older boys a were placed who barely knew how to write and who had not entered schoc because they were ashamed to start little tots. Marjorie Jackson said ( pupils, "They are in assembly with vanced grades, and the sight of their scared faces in contrast with the eager ing faces of our regular pupils touching." Too, Miss Jackson said of the cha contrast in social conditions at the "Recently we visited at the cabin of our children, one of the well-known in the Burg.

Most of the actual work was done in the homes, the school children being given special instructions. The real interest of course lay in the boys from the Burg who were in service. Pi Beta Phi Alumnae clubs "adopted" these boys, writing letters to them and sending them many gifts. Often a mother brought a letter from her boy to read at Red Cross meeting, or a proud father held the center of the stage at Charley's store as he gave the latest news from the Front. It was a far cry from the quiet road along Little Pigeon to the deck of a battleship or a mud-filled and bullet-riddled trench in France. Most of the Gatlinburg boys who went overseas belonged to the Thirtieth Division. "They went out from the mountains, serious and quiet, with a full knowledge of what war really means for the effects of our last war have not yet died in this part of the country." The service flag of the school had 19 stars, three of which were changed to gold. The following is the Pi Beta Phi War Roll: Otis Trentham Enlisted in Knoxville, sent to France from training camp. Arlie Watson Left for Camp Wadsworth, transferred to Camp Sherman, and sent abroad after short training. Quartermaster's Department. Charlie Clabo Sent to training camp and then to France. Dallard Ownby Training camp, overseas service. This was the first time he ever had been away from home and he wrote of wanting to get back to the quiet of the mountains and asked how the hunting and trapping were. He left a little wife of about sixteen who was in our School for a time. Elder Ogle Enlisted in the navy April 5, 1917. Trained at Norfolk. In two weeks was sent aboard the Louisiana and was later on a transport. (Note: The boys on the Louisiana were trained by T. N.

DEDICATION From the very first conception of the Settlement School by Emma Harper Turner and the Washington Alumnre Club, the idea had been to create a project worthy of dedication to our Founders and the founding of Pi Beta Phi. It was proposed that such a dedication should be made upon the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Fraternity in 1917. Due to the fact that the 1917 Convention was postponed on account of the War, the presentation was delayed until the Charlevoix Convention of 1918. The Four Founders present at Charlevoix: Inez Smith Soule, Fannie Whitenack Libbey, Libbie Brook Gaddis, and Emma Brownlee Kilgore, chose Mrs. Gaddis to be their spokesman on July 4, when the Settlement School was formally presented to them. Elizabeth Clarke Helmick, who had served so long as Chairman and Director of the Committee, "made the presentation speech in a few brief, extemporaneous sentences which were full of deep feeling and meaning. "In response, Mrs. Gaddis spoke as fol-lows: `This is one o in the lives of yon watched with great and development of To you, who have ti out the problems of great credit is due; a] gratitude of the whc this great work is a have a right to a ;Iv "Our hearts are st when we think of Founders, and we w; fully appreciate the wading the whole or,; whelmed when we have conferred upo Settlement School to your Founders.

In recommending Miss Bishop to the Committee, the Chairman said: "Evelyn Bishop is well fitted for Head Resident.

She has the ability to mix and mingle with people of every locality." Too, she possessed a sense of humor-a most essential asset. When told that Miss Bishop had been selected to direct the work of the School, Andy Huff said enthusiastically: "I have been wanting her for several years. I am glad she has come." And so in 191S the School came under the THE FEBRUARY ARROW direction of one who steered its course through fifteen years of progress, some of which were the most strenuous years in the history of the School. When "Miss Evelyn," as everyone called her, took up her duties as Head Resident there also came to the School, Aunt Lizzie Reagan, a mountain woman, whose chief object in coming was to take care of the Prickett baby, the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Prickett of the School staff. Aunt Lizzie soon took care of everyone and became the regular School housekeeper. She was a most important link between the mountain people and the School. Everyone depended upon her. She insisted on milking the cow; she made the butter; picked wild berries and canned them, helped with the garden; and kept the house in order though she did say one morning, "You uns mustn't patronize after me." Aunt Lizzie was a true mountain woman but she admitted later after living in the new model cottage that living in our "tight house" had "plumb bodaciously sp'iled" her for a cabin such as numerous children and grandchildren found very comfortable. Aunt Lizzie knew everyone for miles around and their family history and after the nurse came to the School, few long trips were ever taken without first consulting Aunt Lizzie about direction, roads, and family. For nine years she was on the School staff. As changes came, however, she did not enjoy the bustle and the work was too hard for one of her age, so she bought a little place on Mill Creek, with a house at the brow of the hill, from which she can look down on the valley and says she "hears our dinner bell and some days watches us go to dinner." She still puts in crop, garden, and has her pet cow. When the School bought the big old-fashioned loom that used to belong to Aunt Lydia Whaley, it couldn't be set up. After 35 years away from a loom, Aunt Lizzie set up the loom, put on a warp and threaded it. Not a single thing had she forgotten in all that time. In fact, she knew many a little turn that the weaving teacher had never heard of and Aunt Lizzie told her with great pride. She weaves and winds bobbins for others. In appreciation of all that Aunt Lizzie had done and had meant to the School, the Settlement School Committee presented to her a Pi Beta Phi Patroness pin. To return to 1918-Dr. May L. Keller represented the Committee at the regular opening of the School session in August andwas much pleased and amazed to many changes in the School since visit. Early in the fall, Mrs. Warner, Te State Health Specialist, came to the Sc talk to the mothers of the Burg at Babies meeting. Since it was quite ti thing to feed green beans, fried eg AUNT LIZ= REAGAN cheese to babies of five or six mon women of the community felt sure tl Prickett would starve her boy because sisted that biscuits, corn, and beans necessary foods for a little chap less year old.

Interest in singing also kept inc "The war inspired the composing ballads, each one with about fifteer for the story must all be told, from t the war began until the boys return ous."

The Head Resident reported that a great deal of the narrow prejudice was gone and that several times the minister had spoken out publicly for the School. "Right now," she said, "while feeling is good and people are speaking well of the School is when we can broaden out and increase our usefulness and what greater work can we hope to accomplish than to teach the boys and girls what a real home can be ?" Basketmaking continued as a fireside industry and by the spring of 1919, Mr. BASKET MAKERS had sung some of .ads told the workers were "love songs" is home knew.

It took much patience and perseverance to raise the standard of workmanship among the basketmakers. The best basketmakers were beginning to find ready sale, at good prices, among the visitors to the hotel. The School often bought baskets that were not up to standard for the simple reason that it wanted to encourage the maker and to increase the output hoping to raise the quality gradually. The basketmakers felt they were not getting justice for their work if they were paid less than the experienced workers nor could they understand the School's method of being agent in selling the wares. They insisted on "spot cash," "hand go, hand come" money THE FEBRUARY ARROW or they wouldn't work, thus making it necessary for the School to do a great deal of managing to keep the work going. Mr. Prickett reported in 1919 that "despite the ups and downs in basketdom, we have sold in the neighborhood of one thousand per year and this income not only helps the native workers, but is helping to equip the School with some very necessary things such as supplies for the cooking and sewing classes and a few new tools for manual training." The second week of January, 1919, the the epidemic of influenza struck Gatlinburg, causing the closing of the School for two weeks. Within a day almost every person was down with the disease. With no doctor within seven miles and no nurses anywhere the well ones, including the School staff, put their shoulders to the wheel. The people showed their confidence in the School by turning to it for aid and advice. Miss Evelyn directed the work among the sick and not one case proved fatal. In writing to the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Dr. Massey of Sevierville said: "I must express to you the great work that Miss Bishop is doing in the community. Last winter, during the flu epidemic, she went into the homes and nursed and cared for the sick. I believe her physical powers were kept up by her confidence in God and her loyalty to goodness. Since that great scourge the sentiment is entirely changed toward the School. Before this I noticed there was a prejudice, very largely from a denominational standpoint. They were afraid that this was some secret way in which some denominational tribe was to be educated." The doctor also told of one case where Miss Bishop was his only assistant in amputating the limb of a man hurt in a mill. He said that her work was equal to any trained nurse he had ever had. To make things more difficult just at this time, Mrs. Prickett's health made it necessary for her to discontinue her work in the school-room, and, on February 1, Mr. Prickett unexpectedly tendered his resignation. "Through all of this upheaval Miss Bishop was equal to the occasion and by reason of her familiarity with local conditions and her wide acquaintance, she was able to fill the vacancies immediately and the work went on." In the spring which followed the flu epidemic new duties were undertaken by the School staff in helping to revive interest inthe church and Sunday School affairs miffing the women's society of the ch hold meetings in the teachers' cottak in view of the fact that the Tennessee had been given the vote for the firs some civic training for them was fel a necessity and was given. Having steered the work of the Cor successfully through the war period Richardson felt she could no longer the heavy responsibility and upon he nation in August, 1919, Abbie Lar Minnesota A, became the Chairman Committee. Miss Langmaid had been ber of the School staff a few months i and reported upon her visit to Gat in 1920 that she was unprepared for ti derful change which had taken place i years. "Only among such a people cated but highly cultured' and only Ns zealous, wise, untiring work of many could results such as these have been plished," she said. Up to this time the work of the Soh necessarily for the most part been trated upon the work in the grades ar community visiting. The teachers had it a great task to keep the pupils in regularly and the home visiting had this problem in some respects. Now with splendid progress being at the School there came the problem ( could be done to help the people back creeks in Sugarlands and Little Baskins and Spruce Flats, and Mill and Little Dudley. Four adjoining districts wished to their county schools which they rea were inferior to the Pi Phi School in ment, length of school year, and qu, teaching, and to send all the children School.

While he New York Alum nx Club she heard Evelyn Bishop tell of the need of a nurse at Gatlinburg. "Miss Phyllis" answered the call and for six years ministered to the sick up and down the hollers in every direction from the Burg. When the nurse arrived at Gatlinburg there was nothing for her to work with no office, no supplies, nothing but a great need. There was the building which had been used as a teachers' cottage and there was a fund which had been started by the Founders and which had grown steadily for the proposed Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital. By the summer of 1917 the sum had reached $909.68. In six years Nurse Higinbotham built up such a health center that one of the leading doctors from the State Medical University at Memphis, after looking it over thoroughly, wrote a report in detail, in which he advised the state to use this rural health center and emergency hospital as a model for any rural centers they might establish in the state! Miss Higinbotham's personality, as well as her ability, won the cooperation of the doctors. Doctors Massey, Hoffman, Rogers, and Ogle all agreed to keep office hours in Gatlinburg once a month as soon as Miss Higinbotham's office was in readiness. She said of them: "First, last and always, there could have been no running without the loyalty, support and help of the doctors. It was they who, while not living here, came into the district when called, who paved the way for a nurse, have stood firm and strong for everything done and have taught me much that belongs to the sphere of a doctor because they felt there were emergencies to be met when they weren't there." Soon after Miss Phyllis's arrival at the School, one large clinic nose and throat was held, resulting in light operations and thirty examinations. Several cases of trachoma were treated and cured. Dental examinations, too, were made and the children's teeth improved almost at once, Miss Phyllis "pulling" some when necessary. After consultation with a number of representative native women the nurse decided that a definite fee should be charged for her services when such could be paid. The fees set were: 50c for a home visit, 25c for an office visit. The nurse made examinations of the school children for eye, nose, and throat troubles and attended to the general health of the School; she answered calls day and night on foot or on horseback over terrible roads, ford THE FEBRUARY ARROW ing swollen streams, ploughing through mud, or negotiating rickety footlogs. One night Miss Evelyn and Miss Phyllis carried a lad with a broken leg down a mountainside and over one of those footlogs so that he could be cared for in the little School hospital. There were no telephones. And since the doctors lived long distances away, the responsibility of a doctor as well as a nurse fell upon Miss Higinbotham. Having been trained to act only on doctor's orders there were times when all that training had to be forgotten and the emergency met. Saddle bags had to carry every kind of supply and utensil that might be needed. The nurse had three sets of equipment: one for office use, one for saddle bags, and one for the obstetrical bag, but she never went on the obstetrical cases unless the people JENNIE NICOL MEMORIAL HOSPIT.

In order to help with these latter cases the Nurse trained a class of Midwives or "Granny Women," as they were called. In the spring of 1922 came the opening of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Hospital on May 8, at which time the Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and many visitors attended the dedication. The building was divided into an office, workroom, bathroom, and emergency operating room or bedroom, equipped with running water, oil stove, electric lights, and linen supply a loan cupboard for the people. The alumnae clubs contributed generously towards the hospital: the Ontario Club sup-plied the operating room with gowns, caps, dressing gowns, old linen, breast binders, THE FEBRUARY ARROW support.

Miss Ryman organized classes in home hygiene and in addition to answering the many sick calls of the people, vaccinated dogs against rabies. In one day she reported: "Largest group was 89 people and 12 dogs at a one-room school." Another day: "229 people and 37 dogs at another three-room school." Miss Ryazan was followed in 1928 by Florence Howard and Frances Moore, the latter remaining until 1931 when Virginia Moore took up the work at the Jennie Nicol Hospital. In Virginia Moore's first year she visited 13 schools in the district regularly and stressed preventive tubercular work, in addition to carrying on the routine work of her office. In 1931-32 the School received from the Friends of the Mountain Children $200, half to be used for special eye and dental work and the other half for work with children. In the winter of 1932-33 a doctor moved to Sevierville, thus relieving the nurse of many cases. At Sevierville in March, 1935, the Pi Beta Phi School won first place in the large school section in the contest and Health parade, there being 145 Blue Ribbon Children from our School! The building of the new highway through Gatlinburg and the resulting influx of tourists brings to the hospital emergency cases of those injured on the highway. These are given first aid and sent to larger hospitals in ambulances if the case demands. Since the telling of this history is like the weaving of a large tapestry, we must drop back and work forward again. In the fall of 1920, much outside visiting was done by the teachers in the homes, and efforts were made to find a skilled worker who could teach weaving of small pieces on small looms. It was felt that the girls would take an interest in such work where they refused to make the heavy covedids woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. A very active part was taken by the Pi Phis this year in the work of the B.Y.P.U., Miss Bishop being in charge of the Music. Mr. Creswell, a member of the School staff, was a good church worker and his influence was felt among the boys and young men. After thorough investigation it was found that the proposed furniture factory would require too much capital, so the machinery which had been purchased from an old mill THE FEBRUARY ARROW was sold to a local group, and a new industry was started which gave employment to several men of the Burg. At this time the Chairman of the Committee began to talk of plans for the future when an Auditorium or Community House should be built, "where all neighborhood meetings could be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic homecomings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics, and social gatherings, as well as clinics." Dormitories, too, were needed. In her annual report the Chairman made an appeal for more land and buildings, equipment and endowment funds, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children "for whom the present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles." During the year sixty-seven acres of land "more or less," generally considered the most desirable that could be acquired for the School, were purchased. A Delco plant, large enough not only for the School but for lighting the homes of Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples, the hotel, and the church was in-stalled, and other improvements were added. Melinda Stuart, as a member of the committee, gave much time to directing the finances of the School, and with the contributions coming in splendidly from clubs and chapters, the School flourished. For two years the School had been offering first-year high school work. But for the advanced work the pupils were going away whenever possible. One went to Athens University, preparatory department; another boy and girl went to a North Carolina school, some attended Murphy College, and several went to Carson Newman. With the addition to the School staff in 1920 of Lucy Nicholson of Berea, to teach weaving, interest was immediately revived among the women of the Burg. Two women, Mrs. Anderson and Mary Ogle, "Marsh's wife," had their own looms made and started work at home. Mrs. Anderson soon began selling her rugs and table scarfs to the tourists at the hotel. Three looms were added to the School equipment in 1921. Six looms were reported in operation in the School in 1921-22, and six looms were installed in various homes, the girls and women having many articles ready for the summer hotel trade. As fast as possible the School arranged to take these products believing that, if theweaving prospered as the basket burin done in the past few years, it "shoul tually be a source of income to the S as well as to the people. In order to popularize the Fireside tries the Chairman of the Committe Hill Stark, got out a new booklet. I letters were sent to each president an tary of the alumnre dubs and slides School were prepared and displayed Eastern Conference in the spring of The Committee was especially deb that the development of the weaving stressed and inspiration provided f designs, new combinations of cold originality in the weaving of rugs, c and baskets. In 1925 Winogene Redding, a ver did weaving teacher, was employed ft She walked miles and miles throug cold winter months, instructing the in this revived art. As the standard of quality increase weaving, orders increased and soon t began to mount. From $1,000 in 1S jumped to $14,000 in 1927. Several exhibits were sent away f School in 1927 and it was found work of our School compared well v from other well-known places. The for our work became so great that it possible to keep up with the ord( school girls became interested in the smaller pieces. It was not at all uncommon for a with from four to seven children to to weave three and sometimes Iii towels in a day. One woman walked f with her young daughter one cold in winter with high hopes to learn ti "I've worked hard all my life," ; "I started to hoe corn and 'taters was a little 'un an' I been hoein' ev I've had nine chillun, seven are 1 two are dead. I've lived in the san for twenty years sometimes I think a sight to change. When I heered weaving I jest thought I'd quit worki field an' let the young uns do hit.

For some women like this, we emancipation from tending the others the money it brings means ne a new dress for one of the childrer of meal for the family, or a new ant piece of furniture.

The prize for the best design, an arrowhead, went to Alice Wright (Wallace) , a pledge of Wyoming A. This design was used as the basis for a trademark which was finally registered with the United States .Government through the kindness of Mr. Hadley Freeman.

Every effort was made to e workmanship on the baskets better. 1 the baskets came in as never before attic of the teachers' cottage was re-o be "running over with them." 24 the Grand Council and Settlement :ommittee voted to secure and use a rk for articles made at the School, and ad Council recommended that a con the protests of Cluett, Peabody, and Company. By 1926 the Industrial work had grown to such great proportions that it took more time than any other one department. The buying, packing, shipping, storing, and tending to orders demanded ceaseless labor, much of which was performed by Miss Bishop and the teachers. In the spring of 1926 the Gift Shop was established by Harmo Taylor, Texas A, and Lois Rogers, North Carolina A, as an experiment, each girl taking one-third interest and the School owning one-third. Mr. L. S. Hall of Knoxville, who owned a summer home in the Burg, was a particular friend of the "Shop," which opened first in the Teachers' Cottage and was later moved to the Stuart Cottage. During the first month of its operation the Shop sales reached $1000. In the Shop were: baskets, brooms, rugs, wooden napkin rings, a number of whittled things such as log cabin cigarette boxes, letter knives, THE FEBRUARY ARROW salad sets of rhododendron, toasting forks, doll furniture, fans of pressed rye stalks, pillowtops, bags, towels, balsam pillows, Izorie runners, hooked rugs, etc. Although the trade at the Shop during the summer was most satisfactory the big sale of products and the heavy work came usually between September and December when the shipments were made to the alumnae clubs. During that fall the School shipped $10,000 worth of products, the work of shipping being attended to by LaDelle Allen, Winogene Redding, and Evelyn Bishop. With the success of the Gift Shop proven, the decision was made in 1927 to place the products in the Arrowcraft Shop to be kept open the entire year and to be managed by one person on full time. It is interesting to note that some of the first things offered for sale by the Shop were made by Richard Ogle, whose father had been taught basketmaking and broom tying by an Indian. Lois Rogers returned to Gatlinburg in April, 1927, and opened the Arrowcraft Shop, assisted later by Eugenia Dilworth, Texas A. The following fall the old school building at the junction of Baskins and Little Pigeon, was moved back from the road and a new addition built on, converting it into a permanent Arrowcraft Shop. LaDelle Allen took charge. Sales of the products have never slackened. In 1929 quilts and hooked mats were added to the weaving and baskets, next furniture claimed especial attention. In 1929 the School gave a demonstration of its industrial work at the East Tennessee Division State Fair, winning a prize of $75, and also exhibited at the Tri State Fair at Memphis where the alumnre club generously attended to expenses. That year the sum of$22,000 was paid by the makers of the fir( In 1931, upon the new Mountain View Pi Beta Phi Shop under the manaaemer MOLLIE MOOB field.

Corcoran Art .Gallery, Washington, D.C., and at Berea, Ky., always winning high praise and most outstanding honors. In 1935 the School decided to buy shares of stock of the Southern Highlanders, Inc., which will allow the sale of Arrowcraft products at the Norris Shop, Norris Dam, about 60 miles from Gatlinburg. Dresses woven by the girls at the Settlement School have been worn by two First Ladies. In 1926, the Kansas City Alumni Club presented to Mrs. Coolidge a lovely dress pattern in soft cream wool, with a deep block pattern of self color, which had been woven by Edna McCarter; and in 1935 the Arrowcrafters presented to Mrs. Roosevelt, a lovely pattern edged with a three-inch band of white Angora, woven by Maggie Parton, because of Mrs. Roosevelt's well known interest in handicrafts. To return to the chronological order in 1921, the Pi Beta Phi School had reached the place where its influence was being felt through the efforts of some of its former pupils who were teaching in the little isolated schoolhouses in various parts of the county. In that year Mattie Ogle Watson was teaching Fork-of-the-River Sugarlands ; Elder Maples, Brackins. one in Tennessee Carolina border.

Too, the joint session moved that hence-forth in all records of the fraternity the original cottage on the School grounds should be known as the Mary Pollard Cottage, in recognition of her "loyal and worthy service to the fraternity as the first Pi Beta Phi Head Resident." That year inaugurated the system of holding annual meetings of the Settlement School Committee at Gatlinburg. The total enrollment for the year was 125, including 14 high school students. More than 25 came in from the creeks schools after the free school closed but the difficulties of walking from four to six miles twice a day, and the more serious difficulties of trying to keep up with the children who had so much better opportunities and instruction proved too much for nearly all of them. That winter noon lunch was furnished to the youngest children. A little unfinished room in the basement of the school was simply equipped and used for the purpose. Etiquette was taught with the meal that is, the children were instructed not to talk with food in their mouths, to say Grace at the table and to take turns at host and hostess. New dishes were viewed with suspicion by the children. Cocoa was not especially enjoyed until someone called it "hot ice cream." A boiled custard was called "sweet gravy." One reason for having the noon lunch was that it had been discovered that the children often hid their lunches along the way rather than carry them to school, consequently many had nothing from before daylight until after dark. The noon lunch then answered a real need. The children took pride in helping to pre-pare the meal and everyone showed a gain in weight. These noon lunches were served until 1928 when they were dropped because of financial necessity. They were resumed in 1931 and were provided by the Parent Teach ) THE FEBRUARY ARROW ers' Association which raised money in various ways and solicited all kinds of canned goods. A dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English class by Cecil Maples is worth recording here: WHY A TOAD HAS No TAIL think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields.

He conducted junior poultry c four communities and in between PI BETA PHI BASKETBALL TEAM their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. In accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Council and the Committee, Miss Bishop secured for the School, after much effort and careful consideration, a teacher of vocational agriculture under the provision of the Smith-Hughes Act: Mr. O. J. Mattil, Delta Tau Delta, of the University of Tennessee, who had already had two years in Smith-Hughes work. As the pioneer agriculturist of the School, Mr. Mattil spent seven years organizing and building up the department. Not only did he do the regular work required but shouldered innumerable responsibilities which daily arose. He taught classes in shop work, animal husbandry, horticulture, and poultry raising. He visited orchards and taught the mountaineers the art of spraying and pruning their trees, or how to eradicate weeds, and how to rotate crops. Using his Ford car as a motoranswered calls day and night to atte horses or cows.

In addition to teaching classes, doing ex-tension work in various localities and carrying on all the necessary Smith-Hughes work, Don Smith developed the School farm to an amazing extent. The Director said in 1935: MODEL BARN WHERE MOVIES WERE HELD AND BASKETBALL GAMES PLAYED :shing which Mr. Mattil gave them. work was a great stimulus to better s in the industry in general. 31, Mr. L.

Smith, who became the Smith-Hughes at the School in 1929 developed the lal agriculture work to such an extent Decame a wonderful influence for the tending our School, as well as being iration to the adults in the Gatlinburg fr. Smith developed athletics at the his Pi Beta Phi chapter of the Future "The farm is well managed under the direction of Don Smith who has been with us six years. His assistants, Ambers Ogle and Arlie Watson, are distinct assets to the place. Mr. Smith has made the farm self-supporting, and a wonderful example to the community. The herd of cows and the fine condition in which they are kept receive the admiration of all who see them. The fast rotating feed crops which he plans, supply a big part of the huge amount of feed needed to feed the cows, horses, hogs, sheep, and chickens. His farming methods and practices have proved very successful here and have received favor-able comments by many authorities. His ad-vice is continually sought by people in the community, and he is considered, an authority on farming problems in this section of the country by his department and State Extension workers. Considerable interest was shown in the new part time class for boys out of school. Its major advantage was giving these boys some activity which they could THE FEBRUARY ARROW feel was their own. The school farm furnished, as usual, many opportunities for practical application of farm jobs learned in the classroom. Prizes were won for outstanding work done in the farm shop and exhibited at the Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair." After six years of splendid, constructive work at the School, Don Smith resigned in the summer of 1935 and was succeeded by Elmer Kite, Tennessee University, Smith-Hughes teacher last year at the Claibornetures on the whole w( quality.

Although it had b, could be started on there were not suffici such a move and appe viduals were made wit "THEY-HILLFOLK SISTERS" county high school, who is carrying on the work most efficiently. In the spring of 1923, the Indianapolis Alumnx Club furnished a motion picture machine to the School, which provided entertainment that delighted the School and the entire community. Aunt Lizzie Reagan went both nights, the first time the machine was put into operation, reporting that she saw folks there that she hadn't seen for years. Whole families walked anywhere from one to six miles and back in the darkness to at-tend. There on the silver screen there came into being things which they had never been able to vision in their imagination air lanes and battleships oceans and streets of roaring traffic became real. The motion picture show at once became an established part of the School routine. For a time the pictures were shown in the hayloft of the new barn, and later, upon the completion of the fine new industrial building have been shown there. Although it was not always .possible to obtain just the type of pictures desired, the pic-would give large sums mg.

Cora McCarter went with her, also as a teacher. According to Miss Chew: "To the fortunate few, the Sugarlands is a country of higher mountains, rockier streams, and rougher fords, a valley of delight to the hiker. To those who have lived within the shadow of these hills it is a home of poorer, less en-lightened people, whose lives are bounded by the sky line of Bull Head, Balsam Top, and the Great Smokies." In the fall of 1924 the two teachers, with the aid of the School at Gatlinburg, and some assistance from the local people, fixed up an old mountain house for living quarters and taught 89 pupils in the one-room school building. Many of the people from the Burg had never been to Sugarlands although it was only five miles away since its roads were almost impassable. Little was known of the community except its liquor. Said Miss Chew: The seed of many a Gatlinburg tree was planted in its soil. The most progressive blood moved to the plain country, leaving the more inert to struggle with the rocky hillsides. It is a land of poorer homes." One family where the teachers ate Sunday dinner served the food on lard pail lids. Three broken dishes held the other food to be served. "Four of us sat on the only chairs while the boys stood up. Chickens picked up crumbs under foot while we ate. The walls were blackened with smoke. Large bright blue paper bows had been fastened on the walls by the little girls to brighten this cheerless existence." One mother with a tubercular husband had for five years planted and gathered and pre-pared every bite of food her family of five had eaten. With the help of her 14 year old daughter she sawed down the trees from which she chopped the winter firewood. The only money she had seen in months had come from the teachers who bought potatoes or a chicken now and then. Barter was the only means of securing shoes from the store. The Sugarlands was the highest infected region examined for hookworm that summer. All the women used snuff and the people were divided in religion "those up the river and those down the river." The preaching once a month could not hold them together. One of the most vivid experiences of Miss Chew that first year follows: THE FEBRUARY ARROW "Yesterday from the last house up the river, the parents brought down their little six months old baby to be buried in the little graveyard on a hill not far beyond the school house. The crowd had gathered and I could see them waiting. Presently a committee of two boys came for me to conduct the funeral services. There was no one else. Our week-end preachers were in the lumber camp during the week. What could I do? Helpless as I was I had to go. When I reached the spot they were standing about in a large circle. Within, beside the deep hole, stood this girl, scarcely seventeen, alone with that little wooden box covered with white muslin, over the top of which she had laid a piece of embroidery work evidently taken from the fire-board of her cabin. No one within ten feet of her to comfort her or to support her in this fi rst great sorrow of her life. I asked where the father was and a rough looking creature with a cigarette was pointed out, a fellow who had been arrested the day before for making liquor. The revenue officers had entered his house just as the baby was dying the day before and had given him permission to stay until after the funeral. She surely had more than her baby's death to cause tears. When our little service was over the man who stepped forward to lower the little white muslin covered box into the ground was another of the same liquor crowd, but because he could pay his fine was free to do his community and his friend this service. With a cigarette in his mouth he did the last service for the little mountain baby. After all was over the mother went home across the hill, her husband down the river to work out his fine. Life seems so much uglier sometimes when contrasted with our gorgeous hillsides this time of year." Then there was the story of a thirty-three year old mother of seven children who put up sixty gallons of kraut to feed them through the winter and the story of how Miss Chew met an old woman hobbling down the road in the pouring rain taking the last look of the Sugarlands, the mortgage had taken her farm and she had to leave. . The second year at Sugarlands there was difficulty with one of the school board, who felt he should have been consulted relative to the hiring of the teachers, and through a misunderstanding Miss Chew was not re-hired. The man's son-in-law was given the school instead. What at first looked discourag-ing and unfair, really proved Miss Chew then had time to ti the adult work which she had b^ do, holding night classes, doing etc. The next term, however, of man of the Committee, Nita I had a definite understanding men and the county board, Mist HAZEL TODD MEADEN CC Sugarlands hired and the Pi Beta Phi work under the old agreement.

With the closing of the Sugarlands school, 56 people from Laurel Lick petitioned to have Eva Hathaway come to them. The county paid the expenses of Miss Hathaway and an assistant teacher, who taught the Laurel Lick school during the 1932-33 season. This was another isolated region. There was little or no school equipment and the children bartered for the few pencils and tablets which AN EXTENSION WORKER STARTING OUT assist in community just before she was of illness in the fainnitiated into Pi Beta )f Tennessee A went nitiation, and with a m Grand Council in did work which Miss Beta Phi, she became e arrow.

This was a real piece of modern pioneer work. In 1934 the Government purchased the Hazel Todd Meaden Cottage at Sugarlands and our two acres of land for $3,000, which sum was applied on a mortgage held on the Industrial Building at Gatlinburg. In 1925 a report from the School stated: "At last succeeded in getting Smith-Hughes work for the months of April, May, June, and July in the Home Demonstration Department." Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, took up the work and with her patterns, needles, tape, thread, scissors, and a sandwich in her saddle bags rode sometimes as many as 28 to 30 miles in a day. Like all other new projects, the work went slowly at first among the older women. Gradually, however, the extension work progressed, the influence of the children from the School being felt in home after home. Jean Steele, who succeeded Barbara Dewell spent much time in visiting and trying to interest the women. It was difficult to get the women to come to Gatlinburg for afternoon classes, so much of the work was done in the homes. Miss Steele helped to start many with THE FEBRUARY ARROW their sewing and worked up a good canning class. Gradually classes in domestic science were worked up in Laurel Lick, Sugarlands, Pigeon Forge, Benner Fork-of-the-River, and Gatlinburg. So successful was she with her work, Miss Steele was called into state work in 1927, being made Supervisor of Rural Home Economics for the State of Tennessee. One of the big projects supervised by her successor, Katherine Watson (Farmer), Chicottage at Gatlinburg received $100 as prize in the National Better Homes I Mrs. Anna, Dowell, who was chairman Better Home Week in Gatlinburg in received an invitation from President I to attend the Home Conference in IsIV ton in December of that year, because work in the Burg.

Miss Watson took a little cabin in her father's orchard which "looked hopeless in-deed" and with her high school girls, the evening school class and Mr. Mattil's boys, planned and completed a most attractive piece of work. It included everything from planning the changes in the rooms, putting clothes closets, shelves, bathroom, etc., making kitchen cabinet from materials at hand and weaving curtains, staining and painting inside and out to planting shrubbery and garden. For one week the house was open every day and was visited by about 300 people. Different women took turns acting as hostess. Programs were planned for each day, speakers coming from the University of Tennessee. The School Nurse gave a. Home Nursing demonstration with some of her school girls, and women ex-changed flower and garden seeds.

"The state was willing to give us any aid possible, and sent a number of advisers and visitors to the different departments of the School." In 1926 the third year of high school was approved but was not added to the curriculum until 1935-36. The teachers' salaries were arranged on a sliding scale: ranging from $50 and transportation and board for the first year, to $65 for the fifth year. Later, in 1931, all teachers' salaries were placed on a complete cash basis to replace the former arrangement of cash-board-travel payment, and all teachers paid by the county received their salaries direct from the County. (For the past few years the County has paid the salary of all grade school teachers and has provided school sup-plies and has helped with the salary of the principal. This year, 1935-36, the County is also paying the salary of a high school teacher and allowing the usual amount for the principal of the school.) Steady development was shown under Principal Overton's direction. More time was spent on supervised play and upon the improvement in athletics, as well as upon advancement in the school room. Mr. Overton resigned in 1930 and was followed by William King, who was away during the year 1933-3d when Virgil Hampton was Principal. Mr. King returned again in 1934 and. is at present the efficient principal of the School. One of the far-reaching achievements of the School during Miss Bishop's administration was the issuing of the Gatlinburg News, which was begun in 1924 first as a mimeo-graphed sheet and was later printed. About 6C)0 copies were issued each month, some being sent to alumni clubs and isolated alumnx, about 250 going up and down the creeks to furnish the only printed news in many mountain homes. The cost of the publication was 50c a year outside of Gatlinburg. The News was distributed free to the people of the corntnunity. In its columns they could read about everything from when to spray the apple trees and what to feed the cow to who had the newest baby. The Gatlinburg News was discontinued in November 1931 when paring of the budget became absolutely necessary. One of the projects planned by Chairman Nita Hill Stark the Industrial Building was built during the administration of Gertrude Freeman, as chairman, being completed in the spring of 1928. Original plans had been obtained from James White, architect THE FEBRUARY ARROW for the University of Illinois, who gave his time and effort to the work. These plans later had to be altered but were used as the basis of the work which was carried to completion by Contractor John Turner, an uncle of Agnes Miller Turner, California B, and Mr. Matta. In the spring of 1928 the building was completed as far as the exterior was concerned, the interior being finished the following fall. The farm-shop and agriculture classes moved into the building at once, followed soon by the weaving classes, classes in home economics, high school, and junior high school classes. Too, the much longed for Auditorium was put to use at once, providing ample room for basketball games, for community meetings, for socials, in fact, was the meeting place for all occasions of any size. One must look back in order to appreciate what community gatherings meant to the people of the Burg. Not so many years ago they held no public meetings except when they gathered at the church-house or had "sings." Today there is a well-organized Community Club, a splendid Pi Beta Phi Parent-Teachers' Association (of which a past president is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma) , a Weavers' Guild which meets monthly and at which the women plan their spring gardens and which sponsored the wayside Market so successfully in 1935. Evening School meets twice a month, which is social as well as educational in character. There are Canning Clubs and Dressmaking Groups, there are movies, basketball games, operettas and plays by the school and school staff, and many rummage sales and box suppers. And of course, the usual picnics which are always attended by old and young alike. Among other community entertainments in 1935, Harve Reagan lead a "Harp Singing," the name originating from a title of an old-time song book, "Harp of Columbia." Recent editions of this book have continued the use of the word "harp" in the titles and thus all singing from these books is so named. Too, last summer (1935) the church had a "homecoming" and "decoration" that was attended by 500 people, who were served dinner under the trees on the School grounds. The outstanding annual Community affair is Old Timers' Day, started and sponsored by the School some eighteen years ago. It was originated in the beginning with a hope that the older people could have a day when they could get together for visiting and good times and to keep alive some of the old customs.

In 1933 the Gatlinburg community and Pi Beta Phi suffered a distinct loss in the death of Mrs. Andy Huff, who with her family, had always been a most ardent supporter of the School, and who, it may be said, had through a dream been responsible for making the men of the community save the Pi Beta Phi School for Little Pigeon. Mrs. Huff's daughter, Mattie, who first attended the School when she was four years old, later be-came a member of Iowa Gamma, at Iowa State College; two sons married Pi Beta Phi teachers at the School ; Jim married Henrietta McCutchan, Missouri B, and jack married Pauline Whaling, Illinois A. Both Mattie and Stella Huff are now on the School staff. The story of how the son, jack, carried his mother on his back to the top of Mt. Le Conte shortly before she died, so that she might look through the clouds over the vast mountain country is a story that some day may become a saga. No history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School could be written without including the names of Mr. and Mrs. Andy Huff and their family. In that same year, 1933, came the resignation of Miss Evelyn Bishop as Director of the School, after fifteen years of splendid service. Never were hours too long for her nor tasks too arduous. During her administration "new departments were created and added to the School, the standard of work in all handicrafts was greatly raised, extension work was organized and became a wonderful success at Sugarlands and outlying districts, the mountain children were taught to play and to develop as all splendid Americans should, scientific farming became established, and the fine new Administration Building became a reality. The people who live up and down the creeks and hollers that lead into Gatlinburg now live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives because they were privileged to have Miss Evelyn." The Resolution passed by the Convention of 1929 expresses Pi Beta Phi's appreciation of Miss Evelyn: "We thank Evelyn Bishop, Director of the Settlement School, whose life has been one of sacrificing devotion to the altruistic work of the fraternity." Maryalice Chaffee, Michigan A, succeeded Miss Bishop as Director and remained at the School a year, meeting its problems splendid THE FEBRUARY ARROW a ly and carrying on the work of the School. Following the resignation of Miss Chaffee, Mrs, Eunice weaver, Illinois Z, was appointed Director in 1934 and is now at the helm of our work on Little Pigeon, bringing to her tasks a background of experience and understanding so needed in these strenuous days of 1936. "How much longer will Pi Beta Phi be needed at Gatlinburg ?" has been asked frequently. Answer for yourself. Gatlinburg has grown from a "community along the road" to the rgest town in Sevier County, and now has a population of 1500 souls. The National Park Headquarters are there and the head-quarters of the Bureau of Roads ; a telephone exchange building faces our School gate, next to which is the postoffice where not so long ago 60,000 stamps were sold in one' day , commemorating the opening of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nine gift shops, a number of filling stations, dance halls, tea rooms, tourist camps, hot-dog stands now clutter the banks of the little mountain stream. Tourists whirl by our gateway in an endless procession and the stillness of the mountains, which not so long ago was broken only by the wailing of a distant violin, the call of a fox horn, or the trilling of tree toads is now blasted by the incessant honking of the automobile sirens. "Many people who had gone to towns or cities have come back to the hills since work has been scarce; every little cabin is again occupied and steep hillsides are growing something of a crop. It is difficult times for many . . . many families there are where the girls or women with their weaving are bringing in all the cash the families have." In 1935 we had 91 women doing our weaving, Our School enrollment had climbed to 335, fifty-eight being in the high school. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the big stabilizing force. Community work is needed as never before at the Burg. And, too, "there are still remote homes lost up the valleys and hidden on the mountain sides that are very little nearer the varied life of the community than they were twenty years ago. In them poverty and disease still exist to be met and conquered."

Constitution, which stated that "Members of the several chapters shall, upon graduation, become members of the alumna chapter, but shall retain connection with their former chapter. The alumna chapter shall have no power to transact business." These chapters were given the name of the parent chapter followed by Omega. Of these alumna groups formed in the eighties, three remained purely alumnae : one at Des Moines, one at Iowa City, and one at Lawrence, Kansas. The subject of alumna interest was one which was discussed widely in the eighties. In September 1885, Leota Kennedy, Iowa B, wrote in THE ARROW: "What can we do to keep up interest among alumna ?

Every old member of the chapter should hear from the chapter at least twice a year, and regular correspondence should be maintained with as large a number as possible, even if a specialofficer has to be app( They should be urge( and a sample copy c all the alumnae at the so that their attentio No chapter banquet c held without inviting and alumna.
