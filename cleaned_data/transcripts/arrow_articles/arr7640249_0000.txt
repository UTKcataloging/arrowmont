Brooks Department of Physical Therapy in the $601,862 Rehabilitation Center of Syracuse University Hosptial represents the signal honor accorded a New York Alpha Pi Beta Phi for her years of devoted service to her university and community. Gertrude Skerritt Brooks (Mrs. John W.), a 1913 graduate of Syracuse University, had an active part in the new Center's planning and construction as a member of the SU Board of Trustees and chairman of the Board's University Hospital Committee. The new facility is providing central New York with its first comprehensive rehabilitation program for the community at large. The dedication of its third floor department to Mrs. Brooks is a fitting tribute in light of her civic service. In Syracuse she has: served the Council of Social Agencies, Child Guidance Clinic, Cerebral Palsy Clinic, Crime Prevention Committee, Council on the Aging, Legal Aid Society, and Citizens Committee on Health and Hospital Survey. She was vice chair-man of the Onondaga County Republican Committee 12 years and served two five year terms on the New York State Board of Welfare. In 1954 she was awarded the university's Arents Medal for "excellence in political and social betterment." Pi Phis everywhere will find special meaning in a portion of Mrs. Brooks' remarks as she presided at the Rehabilitation Center's dedication May 30, 1959. She said: "Paul told the early Christians that their business was good business. He wrote them: `Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsover things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things.' " "Our community will `think on these things' as our university reaches out to help a neighbor and rehabilitate a life back to usefulness." Staff Member Carla Williams, Wiscon sin B, People-to-People Program Aid for Consumer Relations Carla Williams was attracted to her staff position with, the People-to-People Program, quite naturally. Having an instinctive interest in people she brought to her present position experience in personnel, social welfare work, recreational work and a variety of civic and political activities. Considering Mrs. Williams' youth she has crowded many fascinating experiences into her varied career. Born in the heart of the Scandinavian settlement of the Middle-West, Carla Williams attended 2 colleges in Wisconsin and then, following her graduation, obtained the first position of her many faceted career. Working first in personnel for the Western Electric Co., she soon moved into the social welfare field with the Chicago Red Cross Chapter Headquarters. At the end of the war, having impatiently reached the age requirement, Mrs. Williams then travelled to the Philippines, Okinawa and Japan with the Overseas' Red Cross Forces. It was here that she realized her deep interest in meeting and getting to know other peoples of the world on a people-to-people basis. Carla says that she will never be without a ride, for while in the Far East she developed the hitchhiking technique to a point of perfection. Hiking, bicycling and motoring took her to remote villages throughout Japan and in-stilled in her a deep appreciation and loyalty for the Japanese people. Upon her return from japan, Mrs. Williams turned from career activities to the raising of a family. However, she did not completely "retire" as she did extensive work with civic and charity organizations and at the same time represented, as President, a state-wide legislative organization, working toward improved juvenile detention and mental health facilities. In 1956, her intense interest in politics returned her to the work-a-day-world and a public relations job with one of the major political parties. This experience led to a later position on Capitol Hill where Mrs. Williams worked briefly for a U.S. Congressman. Today, though married to a Washington lawyer and the mother of two small children, Carla Williams devotes her hours away from the home to directing activities of the Speakers Committee of 249 PI PHI HILL MOUNTAINS NATtOtW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOO THE RED BARN LOG CABIN 1TORY POLLARD COTTAGE RU$ BOYS DORM.
