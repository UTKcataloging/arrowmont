The picture was made in Fairbanks, Alaska. From Fairbanks, writes Mary Shipman, Washing-ton Alpha. I am married to Alfred J. Lomen, member of a pioneer Alaskan family from Nome. Our two children (Gilbert, 13, and Julie, 10) are 4th generation of the family to live in Alaska which is rather unusual in this young country. I was president of the Seattle Alum= 'Club for the year 1953-1954. We moved to Fairbanks in July, 1954, where my husband is manager of Yukon Equipment Company. Previously we had lived in Nome. I have been fairly active in community affairs. I have been on the Girl Scout board, the Federated Fund board (United Good Neighbors) and in 1957 was the first woman to be drive chairman. In 1958 I was president of the Fairbanks Garden Club which is affiliated with the National Federation of Garden Clubs. The same year former Gov. Mike Stepovich appointed me to represent the Central District of Alaska on a five member board for the Dept. of Library Service. Recently I have become interested in Republican politics and am now president of the Women's Republican Club of Fairbanks and am vice-chairman of the Republican Central District Committee of Alaska. This district we laughingly say is about the size of Texas. Clare came to Fairbanks Feb. 25th where she spoke at a banquet on the 26th. I accompanied her then to Anchorage, Juneau and Ketchikan where she met with Republican leaders. This picture was taken when Clare was given a The University of Alaska is in Fairbanks, but dog team ride by Libby Westcott, one of our leading there are no sororities or fraternities. We have no lady dog mushers. This month the North American Panhellenic organization here, but I believe they do Championship races will be held here in Fairbanks. in Anchorage. As intelligent members of the human race we know that the purpose of the world is not to provide us with constant bliss or aimless gaiety, but with opportunities to strengthen and develop our moral and spiritual selves. The world provides us with ever-changing challenges to our faith, our courage, and our dreams and ever-changing opportunities to develop ourselves beyond our earth bound beginnings. Sometimes I think that by giving of our personal intangibles such as love, friendship, respect, and kindness to those whom we hold dear we are( giving to ourselves a bit of eternal life whose value is beyond human comprehension. Every organism has one central need, and that is fulfill itself. The central drive of an acorn is to become an oak, of a puppy to become a dog, of a child to become a person in the full sense of the word. It is these steps of fulfillment which give joy and meaning to life. Excerpts from: "An Investment In Youth," Convention Speech by Edith Huey Shelton, The Alpha Phi Quarterly 258 ~ew~ FROM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by Lois Snyder Finger, Iowa Z Forty-nine years have passed since the Pi Phis first set foot in Gatlinburg in 1910. By 1912 the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School was a going concern with a one room, one teacher, thirteen pupil school. In 1913 Mary O. Pollard became the teacher. Here is her word picture of the first days of what is now Pi Phi's astonishing and successful philanthropic accomplishment. "My arrival in Gatlinburg in the fall of 1913 was most inauspicious. It was hot. The letter notifying the previous teacher that I was coming to take her place did not arrive till after I did, and I had to break the news myself. "What the Burg was like when I first saw it as we rounded the curve to Miss Nancy's house no one who enters now can imagine. Only old inhabitants know what it looked like the old Methodist Church with gaping holes where windows had been ; the narrow, rough road full of boulders; Squire Maple's store and house; the little old school house on the corner where the Arrowcraft Shop now stands; the old `church house' with no foundations and with coarse wire over the windows; the miry road leading to the Huff's house; and Squire Ogle's store. Up the lane from the main road was the lone teacher's cottage with the old barn in front of it at the foot of the hill. "My heart stood still. I wondered how I could ever make friends. I pulled myself together and used my common sense. I just lived there, laughed at my countless mistakes, visited, received visitors, proved myself just folks like the people around me, and I never had friends whom I more esteemed and ad-mired than those I saw in Gatlinburg from 1913 to 1916. "Some things that stick in my memory calling on Mrs. Ogle to teach me how to make a nest for a setting hen ; the first auto that came to the Burg with me and the entire school rushing to the door to watch it splash through the ford over to Ogle's store ; the first Christmas tree in the Burg for which the pro-gram was to begin at 10 in the morning and how everybody was there at eight and the whole pro-gram was over by ten; visits to Aunt Liddy Whaley and the morning she brought me a basket as a gift and seated herself on the floor to watch the teacher dress; how cold we were that first winter with no foundation under the cottage and wind whistling up through the floor cracks, and only green wood to burn in the fireplace; Mattie Ogle counting 32 Early Gatlinburg, the hills (Great Smokies) the same-the valley (Gatlinburg) well populated. kinds of flowers on her trip for the cows in the Turkey Nest; taking my Tomato Club girls to Maryville College and introducing them to their first train ride, first electric light, toilet, and bathtub; prayer meetings at the fork of the river ; the sings including an Old Harp Singing at Pigeon Forge; and the spellings." As we approach the Golden Anniversary of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School (1962), a review of the project indicates that the school, itself, has be-come a four building, twelve grade, twenty-five full-time and three part-time teacher, 600 pupil, county supervised school. (Besides the four school buildings there are eight other buildings in use on the property.) In 1949 Pi Phi leased to the county, for $1.00 per 259 260 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI year and upkeep, its school buildings and play-ground, and gave enough land upon which to erect a grade school. Pi Phi continues to pay the salaries of three teachers to make for a fuller curriculum, and gives moral and supervisory support to the school. When the county assumed most of the responsibility for the school the Fraternity was freed to extend its efforts and capabilities in other fields. It had had a nurse since 1919 and it was free to build a Health Center; it had revived the almost lost art of weaving and it was free to build the Arrowcraft Shop; it converted the first buildings which housed the teachers and the staff into two dormitories one for girls and one for boys, and built the Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House; and fifteen years ago it launched a Summer Craft Workshop in conjunction with the University of Tennessee, and so put into summer use its buildings and grounds. The Craft Workshop has followed the usual amazing progress of Pi Phi undertakings. To meet the demands of this new, popular, and fast growing e,project whose fame and value extend not only to the boundaries of our own country but to many foreign lands and also to government craft circles, to meet the Workshop needs, Pi Phi's newest and possibly the most fascinating and unusual of all its building projects will be completed for use in the Workshop this summer, the remodeling of the red barn to become The Red Barn. This converted building is made possible to a great extent because of two legacies received by the Settlement School. The furnishings, in some part, will be made possible because some members of the Fraternity have sent memorial gifts to the School. It is exciting and enticing to contemplate the boundless potentialities which exist for the Fraternity on its approximately 77 acres of scenic property in Gatlinburg with the varied and well established buildings there. Vision, imagination, and long range planning can result in extending Pi Phi's sphere of spiritual influence and material assistance to far, limitless horizons. - CENTENNIAL FUND COMMITTEE Chairman Mrs. T.

At the university, Malinda was both an honor student and beauty queen. A junior majoring in English and history, she was on the Dean's list and was a member of Sigma Tau Delta, honorary English sorority.

In 1957 she was National American Royal Queen in Kansas City, Missouri. Malinda competed with 19 other Cotton Belt beauties for the honor of representing the American cotton industry on a world-wide fashion and good will tour which began in late January. After visiting Nassau and 29 major cities in the United States and Canada, she will be the first Maid of Cotton to fly around the world.
