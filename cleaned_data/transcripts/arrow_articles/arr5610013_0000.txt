        1 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Settlement School Il',eports CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEMBERS of Grand Council and of the Settlement School Committee: It is a pleasure to report to you and to the Fraternity at large the progress that has been made at the Settlement School in the past year, and to outline to you some of the possibilities for future work. Last year I made an exhaustive report to Convention of the past, present, and future work of the School which, together with surveys by Edwin L. Holton and H. Lutcher Stark, was published in the 1938 Information ARROW. I shall not repeat, except for emphasis, information contained in that report which was accepted by Convention. After the approval of that report, the Committee . has gone ahead with plans suggested in it and I am now reporting the progress made along these lines in the year ending June 30, 1939. The greatest change has been in the high school, brought about by the addition of a wing to the high school building. This wing contains the beautiful new home economics laboratory and a science laboratory. The latter is a light, airy room well equipped for work in chemistry and general science. Five hundred dollars of the cook book profits were used for the equipment of the home economics laboratory. The walls of knotty pine, the hand woven draperies, the cherry drop leaf tables and ladder back chairs are all appropriate to the mountain village as well as being most attractive. Sewing machines and unit kitchens with wood, oil, and electric stoves make sewing and cooking a pleasure for the girls. As a luncheon guest, I par-took of an excellent, well-served meal and found the girls delightful hostesses. This new laboratory gave opportunity for expanding the home economics course into one which was approved by the state board of vocational education for Smith-Hughes aid and supervision. Rosalie Ellis, Kansas B, began her second year as home economics teacher in the new laboratory and has been most successful in carrying on the vocational course. Marion Ryan, New York r, took charge of the high school library, now housed in a larger room, in addition to teaching the English courses and coaching the plays. Her work has been most satisfactory is every way and we are glad that she is to return. Three men, William King, principal and science teacher, Ben Fleming, history, and William Coe, agriculture, made up the rest of the high school faculty and all will return next year. The older part of the high school building was improved by the addition of store rooms, toilets, and inside painting. The sixth, seventh, and eighth grades occupied two large rooms with a connecting office for Mr. Price, our fine elementary principal. This left only five grades in the five-room elementary building so that it was not overcrowded as it has been the last few years. An excellent staff including Ruth Rowe, Nevada A, Ruth Parker, Pennsylvania B, and Eleanor Pack, Tennessee A, has done fine work in the classroom and have entered into community activities. The two Ruths have taken charge of the Girl Scout troup and Eleanor has organized and led the girls' glee club and a rhythm band, and had charge of the music for chapel and for all school activities. It is with regret that we accept the resignations of Eleanor Pack and Ruth Rowe for next year. Two Pi Phis will take their places, Mary Rupard, Missouri I', and Pauline Morris, New York r, both of whom come with the best of recommendations and with great interest in teaching at the Settlement School. Eleanor Brabson of Sevierville, Tennessee, who has taught ten years, has resigned to become post-mistress of Gatlinburg. We regret losing her as a teacher but know that she will continue to help with all community activities. Mattie Huff Law-son, Iowa r, who taught for us some years ago, will again teach in the elementary school. Pauline Sharp and Grace Kerley, county girls, will continue next year. Both are good teachers and community workers. With another teacher added to the staff, it was necessary to add a bedroom to the hospital building, that being deemed the most convenient and the least expensive place to build. The room was built at a cost of less than $200.00 and is a very attractive and comfortable place for two teachers to live. Marjorie Chalmers has her combination bed and living room there. The rest of the staff were housed as before, Mr. King and Mr. Coe in the boys' dormitory, Miss Morse, house manager, and two teachers in the girls' dormitory, and the rest of the staff in Teachers' Cottage which was made more convenient by increasing the bathroom facilities. Annette Morse, Illinois A, took up her work as house manager last fall and has been competent, and a helpful adviser to the boys and girls in the dormitories. It is the first time that there has been a Pi Phi in this position. With the six Pi Phi teachers, Mrs. Snow, Mrs. Weaver, and Frances Brown, all Pi Phis, there are now ten Pi Phis on the staff, the greatest number that there has been since I became a member of the committee and, I feel sure, that there has ever been at the same time. Marjorie Chalmers has carried on the health work in the same efficient, cheerful, and loving way that has endeared her to the whole community in the four years she has been with the school. She seems to do a little more than is humanly possible and she does it with a smile. With all her other work, she finds time to sing at church affairs and funerals, and if the high school glee club needs another alto she helps there too. This year the grade school brought home the Blue Rib-bon health cup in the county contest for the third time, thus making it a permanent possession. Marjorie dreams of the time when some interested Pi Phi or other friend of the school may give a modern building for the health work, and if ear-nest endeavor and faithfulness to one's work could bring that reward, Marjorie's dream would come true. That the work of the staff and weavers of Arrow THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Craft has been excellent is attested by the many satisfied customers. In my own alumni club in a town of 12,000, we have in the last four years sold in round numbers, $225, $275, $400, and $300, making a total of $1,200 worth of Arrow Craft products. This could not be done if customers were not pleased and if there were not variety in the stock, new things each year, and above all, high level of material and workmanship. A great number of alumnae clubs report a similar continued high amount of sales from year to year. Some clubs wish to stress the sale of products only every other year, or to leave out a year occasionally. This is left to the discretion of the clubs, but we want all clubs to know that we appreciate greatly the effort that goes into these sales. If all Pi Phis could attend, as I have, the Weavers' Guild, when nearly a hundred of our women weavers meet, and see and hear what this work means to them, there would be no need to urge clubs to sell their work. Our shops in Gatlinburg have had a good year, but we must still depend upon our clubs for the larger part of our business. The Arrow Craft staff is the same as last year with Mrs. Ethel Snow, as director. Mrs. Snow is well and favorably known to those club members who have had charge of Arrow Craft sales. Even if she has to reprimand a chairman for not keeping to the rules, which by the way, are most necessary, she does it in such a way that there is no lasting hurt. When one realizes that she must deal by correspondence with over one hundred club chairmen, buy all the stock except the weaving, manage the packing and shipping, run a shop, and wait on customers, one knows that she is a busy and efficient woman. Her helpers, Edna McCarter and Ava Clabo, two of our Gatlinburg girls, are efficient in every line of the work, and customers find them attractive, quick, and reliable. Mrs. Georgia Duffield is still to be found in the Mountain View Hotel where the guests spend much time, and money, in our Arrow Craft shop which she manages so well. Miss Georgie, as she is affectionately known, plays the piano for Sun-day school, church, Young People's meetings, and Missionary Society and is always ready to help in trouble or illness. Her friends include those from the rich and prominent who come to the hotel to the lowliest in the burg. In the weaving building, in some mountain home, or working with the garden club on a community project, one finds Gene'Redding, our weaving supervisor. She does the designing and super-vises the weaving for Arrow Craft. Her artistic ability along with good business sense is unusual and her management of the weavers combines teaching them to make products of high standard and making their lives happier and more comfortable. Lura Owenby is still her capable assistant. Frances Brown, Missouri I', is starting her third year as bookkeeper for Arrow Craft and the school. This is no small job with a business the size of Arrow Craft, and the school books besides, but Frances, in her quiet efficient way, does the work well and fills an important place in the community. These women have taken care of the increase in the Arrow Craft business with very little extra overhead. We pay our weavers more than any other shop in Gatlinburg and so can demand the best of workmanship and loyalty to Arrow Craft. Due to our teaching ,of weaving over a long perick there are many more weavers in and around Gat linburg than we can take care of, so many shop have been opened for the tourist trade, and "wean ing for sale" is seen on many cabins along th mountain roads. Our shop sets a high standarc something for others to work toward, but whicl as yet, no other shop has attained. The profit of Arrow Craft will be shown in th report of our treasurer. It has increased steadil for the past five years. Now the committee, wit] the approval of Grand Council, feels justified i using a part of Arrow Craft profit each year, b( ginning with the 1939-40 school year, to add crafts teacher to the high school staff, thus givin, our boys and girls training which will give then an outlet for creative work and an economic ir come in their home environment. This will event. ally add variety and attractiveness to Arrow Crai stock and thus bring monetary value back in prc portion to that expended. Several applications haN been received for this position and great care wi. be used in the selection. Miss Jessie Harris, Dire for of Home Economics of the University of Ter nessee, our Asheville Convention initiate, is a: sisting the committee in getting this crafts wor started. It is hoped that a new Arrow Craft built ing can be built within the next year, and then tit Voorheis building can be used for a crafts labor: tory. Coordinating and supervising the work of tr schools, the health center, and Arrow Craft is Mr Eunice Weaver, our director. Good judgment i making decisions and firmness in carrying them ou combined with a pleasing personality and a kind: disposition, make her respected and loved by al I have tried to give a brief review of the wol at Gatlinburg and the staff who are carrying it of This is all made possible by the contributions ( clubs and chapters, and by the magazine agency used by these clubs and chapters. For these contl butions, made possible by work and sacrifice ( club members, we are grateful. If our work to continue as needed and planned, we must d pend upon your continued support. The Magazit Agency has increased each year and this last ye was placed in the Central Office where, undo Mrs. Purdunn's management, it has had its be year. Its possibilities are almost unlimited an clubs should make the most of this means of hel ing the school. The Settlement School Committee began ti year with two new members. Irene Eldridge, Wi consin B, took the place of Josephine McClever whose term expired. Although a busy teacher . the Milwaukee High School, Irene has given ti necessary time to keep the books and to check tl accounts kept by the bookkeeper at the school at Arrow Craft. This is no small task and in additic Irene has kept up her part of the general comm. tee work, sending each member monthly repoi of the school finances, and helping to decide matters brought to the committee. Ethel Hog Copp, California I', the second new member, h came secretary of the committee and did her wo most acceptably. Her enthusiasm and good jud ment have made her an excellent member of t: committee. Jeffries Green Pace took over the editorship "News from Little Pigeon" and has made ff. 14 THE SEPTEMBER ARRow department of the ARROW readable and interesting to all. Her three years' experience on the commit-tee made her advice on general matters most valuable. This is also true of Marie Bacon Hagee who has also served three years. She took over the publicity and club program part of the committee work and did it most efficiently. The Settlement School film was sent to many clubs. Great care was taken in working out a schedule so that the firm could make the rounds of the Canadian clubs after a great deal of investigation in regard to getting the film into Canada. Unfortunately there was a mistake made in carrying out the schedule prepared by Mrs. Hagee so some clubs did not get the film at the time set, and one club did not get it at all. The committee regrets this and wishes to point out to clubs that their cooperation is necessary at all times in getting the film on to the next club on schedule time. An additional 400 feet of colored film depicting the whole process of weaving is being added to the film already available. Mrs. Hagee has also handled pictures and material for club programs and newspaper publicity for club sales. The annual meeting of the committee was held at the school immediately following the Asheville Convention, with the four members above listed and me as chairman presiding. The minutes of that meeting with accompanying recommendations were sent to Grand Council and approved by them as well as by the committee. These included up-keep and improvement of buildings, approving plans for the elementary and high schools submitted by the principals, going over Arrow Craft business with the Director and Weaving Super-visor, reviewing and planning the health work with the nurse and making budgets for Arrow Craft and the school. The report of the Director covering all phases of the work and making recommendations for the year was the basis on which the committee worked. An addition to the social work in the community was suggested by Mr. Price and approved by the committee in the form of a summer recreation program for children. The cost was shared by the school and voluntary contributions of business men. A successful program was carried out last summer and is being continued this summer. As chairman of the committee, I made a mid-year trip to Gatlinburg to see that the plans and policies were being carried out, and to aid the Director in planning for things which had come up during the year. I wrote a full report of this visit with recommendations to the committee and council. I timed my visit so that I could attend the meeting of the Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville with several members of the staff. I found time to visit all departments of the school and many of the extracurricular activities. I spent considerable time going into the various phases of the Arrow Craft business. I attended a meeting of the Weavers' Guild and one of the Parent-Teacher Associations, thus meeting many women of the community. The hospital and the farm were not neglected. A week's time is barely enough for this visit, even if the days do begin at six A.M. During the rest of the year I kept in constant communication by letter with Mrs. Weaver and less frequently with other members of the staff. At least once a month and usually more often, I wrote to the committee after we received the monthly let-ter from Mrs. Weaver. Then each member of the committee wrote to me and voted on things which needed decision. Besides this, I have kept in touch with Miss Onken whose advice is valued greatly because of her knowledge of the school and her unbounded good judgment. There has also been much general correspondence and twice during the year I have edited and mailed the Settlement School News to all officers, clubs, and chapters. I attended the Delta Province Conference as an official representative of the Fraternity and spoke on the Settlement School. During the four years that I have served on the committee, three years of that time as chairman, I have seen the high school grow from a twoto a four-year standard course, the agriculture and home economics put on Smith-Hughes vocational basis, and a new wing added to the building to take care of the increased attendance and improved program. The elementary school has also been much improved by better lighting and equipment of the rooms and by the addition of, a grade school principal. Arrow Craft has grown from a barely paying business to one paying almost $10,000 yearly profit. The Health Center has increased in efficiency, and community work has been organized to fit into the growing community life. I feel satisfied with these accomplishments, but there are other things which should be stressed for development in the near future. The addition of a crafts teacher in the high school has been planned for next year. This should be the beginning of a larger plan for making our project at Gatlinburg a crafts center of national scope. A new Arrow Craft building, for which funds have accumulated, should become a reality in another year and a plan for future development decided upon. The grade and high schools are in excellent condition and most of the expense of teachers' salaries is being taken care of by the county, the health work seems adequate for the present and near future, so the expansion of the crafts work seems the logical way for our project to grow. I do not advocate great immediate changes, but a program of gradual expansion after an exhaustive study of future possibilities has been made. It is with this idea in mind that I have accepted the Chairmanship of the Settlement School Committee for another year and I hope that a report of progress and of future possibilities along this line may be made to Grand Council and the Fraternity at the 1940 Convention. Respectfully submitted, LILLIAN B. HOLTON DID You know that most all the leading women's fraternities now have magazine agencies? This is an easy way to make money for your fraternity. Send all your magazine orders to the Pi Beta Phi Magazine Agency, Marshall, Illinois. DI THE SEPTEMBER ARROW TO OF T E H PI ETA PHI 1'' \ SETTLEMENT SCHOOL, 1938.39 1.5 Community ATLINBURG presents a new picture in this, the summer of 1939. With its four-lane highway, bordered on either side with walks, the way is made safe for pedestrians for the first time. Especially do we at the school appreciate this because of the 418 children in attendance. The Garden Club has placed rustic benches along the highway, intended as resting places for tourists. Preparation is being made for the dedication of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on June 21, at New Found Gap, with President Roosevelt as the principal speaker.. Mrs. Roosevelt will accompany the president. This will make their second visit here. Old Timers' Day is set for Saturday, June 24. This annual event with its amusing contests of longest whiskers, homeliest man, best joke, hog-calling, and many other old-time features, is the favorite occasion of the mountain people. A Regional Planning Board was organized, representing six Tennessee counties, including Sevier County, which is nearest the National Park. Its object is to assist this community in protecting its natural heritage in beauty, while growing and building. It will act in a purely advisory capacity. Mr. Medlin was chosen from Gatlinburg as one of the Sevier County representatives. The Little Theater Guild has been organized by Mr. Charles Palmer, pastor of the Methodist Church. It meets and rehearses in the school gymnasium. The Gatlinburg Business Men's Club has elected Mr. King, high school principal, as its president. The Settlement School playgrounds offering recreation for all ages, is being supervised by Mr. Price, elementary school principal. After trying this out for a part of last summer, it was pronounced one of the best things the school has undertaken. After a storm a year ago, the flood from the mountain streams did great damage to a few homes on Roarin' Fork, leaving two families destitute. The Red Cross, through the school, provided these families with all necessary supplies for two weeks and replaced some of their kitchen furnishings. The School gave the usual Christmas entertainment with a Christmas play and a distribution of stockings filled with candy. If it were not for the school's party and the Christmas boxes from Pi Phis, many of our mountain children would not know Christmas. High School The Staff William King, Principal, History, Chemistry, Coach. Ben Fleming, Mathematics, General Science. Marian Ryan, English, History, Library. William Coe, Vocational Agriculture. Rosalie Ellis, Vocational Home Economics. After being advised by the State High School Supervisor that our laboratories were too small, we were faced with the necessity of building larger and better ones and, along with this, making some minor improvements. Part of the building was made possible by the sale of a piece of land along the Little Pigeon River, owned by the Settlement School, but not adjacent to the school grounds. A wing of stone construction was built connecting the high school building with the weaving building large enough for both general science and home economics laboratories. By making certain structural changes inside the high school building, we were able to provide two new toilet rooms, two small store rooms, one off the gymnasium and one belonging to the general science room. The coat closet serving the eighth grade room was divided and one-half made into an office for Mr. Price. Vocational agriculture was given a larger class room. Another large class room was converted into a study hall-library with new tables, chairs, and a few new shelves. The whole interior was made lighter by painting walls a cream color. One hundred steel folding chairs were bought for the gymnasium, also chairs and tables for the science laboratory. The home economics laboratory was equipped throughout by the Los Angeles Club. A new removable extension was built for the stage and a panel of wood placed above the stage, filling in the open space and giving a better appearance. A gift of $300 from Mr. L. E. Voorheis made possible the installation of a stoker for the big furnace in the school heating plant. The Little Pigeon Alumnie Club presented to the library a new set of encyclopedia. Other books were sent by Pi Phis and some were bought by the school. The name "Grace Coolidge Library" on copper plate has been placed on the door. The home economics room has been named "Burton-Thomas" and the name "Voorheis Building" placed above the door of the weaving building. The high school enrollment was 111, the average daily attendance 96.2. Students living in the vicinity of Pigeon Forge had transportation on the regular bus line into Gatlinburg for the same low rate the school charged them the preceding year when using the truck. Marian Ryan, New York r, the new English teacher, met with real success in teaching and with the supervision of plays and entertainment. With the assistance of Eleanor Pack, Tennessee A, and Marjorie Chalmers, a girls' glee club was organized. This filled a long felt want on the programs of our school entertainments. High school assembly meetings which included sixth, seventh, and eighth grades had True or False contests, spelling matches, and debates. At commencement time, May 12, James Waycaster was awarded the athletic cup. The Little Pigeon Alumnie cup for the outstanding senior boy was awarded to Wayne Cardwell. The F.F.A. cup was presented to Martha Butler for being the outstanding senior girl. Elementary School Pern Price, Principal, Seventh and Eighth grades. Eleanor Brabson, First grade. Ruth Parker, Second grade. 16 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Grace Kerley, Third grade. Ruth Rowe, Fourth grade. Pauline Sharp, Fifth grade. Eleanor Pack, Sixth grade. Enrollment for the elementary school was 307, the average daily attendance 245.27, showing that the seventh teacher, granted us by the County Board, was needed. Mr. Price has been striving to bring up the sanitary rating, and this year we stood within one of the top in the Sevier County contest. The new sanitary drinking fountain and the adjustable window shades were a help in this advancement. The silver cup awarded to the school by the County Board of Health is to be seen in a case above the fireplace in the school house. Grades six, seven, and eight occupied rooms in the high school building. The elementary school accomplished many worthwhile things such as the starting of a newspaper, which later became a joint project of both elementary and high school. They had a Fall Carnival, taking in $60.00 which was later used to buy books for their library. They bought playground equipment with the proceeds from their play. Another contribution by the eighth grade was an American flag, which has just been mounted on a thirty-foot iron pole. The P.T.A. organization has been stronger financially than ever before. Bulah Lowe took charge of cooking and serving the hot lunch in the children's lunch room. Ruth Rowe and Ruth Parker were councilors for the Girl Scouts. A play was given by them and a foimal tea at the Teachers' Cottage. They are trying to get enough money to fit up a room in the grade school basement as a place for Scout use. Mr. Price was Scout Master for the Boy Scouts. They will camp at Lake Norris the last week of June. Home Economics Rosalie Ellis, teacher. We were successful in having home economics made vocational the past year, and consequently we were granted state aid for 50 per cent of the teacher's salary. In moving the department into its new quarters, much of the old equipment had to be discarded. A few things were sold. Into the new attractive laboratory with native wood finish and excellent lighting were built kitchen cabinets in such a way as to form five small kitchenettes. Jessie Harris, of University of Tennessee Home Economics department, working with the architect, Charles Barber, made the plans and assigned to a class in the U.T. summer school, the project of planning our equipment. The five new tables and the twenty-four chairs to match were made by native craftsmen, the chairs finished by the students. The curtains were woven by native weavers. As a result, we have a laboratory which the State High School Supervisor, L. E. Derthick, the State Supervisor of Home Economics, Margaret Brouder, and the East Tennessee Supervisor of Home Economics, Miss Herne, are referring to as a model. One new electric sewing machine, one electric cookstove, and one new oil cookstove were added. Rosalie Ellis, Home Economics teacher, carried out her regular yearly program. The Settlement School Chairman and I enjoyed being entertained for luncheon one day in March by the freshmen. We members of the staff had an example of cooking at Christmas time when we were invited to a fine Christmas dinner. This was followed by a stunt program. Again they showed good training in serving dinner for the Father and Son Banquet for the Future Farmers. This occasion proved the convenience of having the science and home economics laboratories adjoining, so that both rooms can be thrown together for community affairs. At the University of Tennessee open house, one of our girls was asked to model a dress of her own making, at the style show. Twice at high school assembly the girls exhibited their dress-making. Agriculture William Coe, Teacher. Ambers Ogle, Farmer. Vocational agriculture has thrived and Mr. Coe has continued his work with great enthusiasm, though he was disappointed at the beginning of the year that there were not enough farm-minded juniors to institute a third-year class. However, there were twenty-two boys in the freshman class and sixteen made up the second year class. Every-thing possible is done to keep up a lively interest in farm work. First in importance of these are the evening classes held in the rural communities where the fathers and brothers of these students gather during the winter months to study farm problems. Dormitory students are given as nearly as possible the kind of farm work they like best to do. Their products were exhibited at the county fair and prizes won on poultry, hogs, Jersey cattle, garden products, and shop work. When the time came for "slaughtering" for the purpose of class demonstration, our entire family was interested. We enjoyed some very good meat as the result. Many snow white chickens adorned the hillside. There were 120 layers and 800 broilers. The F.F.A. organization is quite important to the farmer boys and our chapter has been very active the past year. Their activities included a special basketball team, which won the fifth district championship, a public speaking contest, an experiment with renting an extra acre of land for potatoes, hybrid seed corn production, parties including the home economics girls, and last, the Parent and Son Banquet which was an innovation for the F.F.A.'s. It proved to be such a pleasant occasion that it will be given annually hereafter. Although it was not absolutely required by the Vocational agriculture program, Mr. Coe went once a week to CCC Camp Morgan to teach a class of boys who formerly lived on farms Arrow Craft Ethel Snow, Manager. The Shops: Georgia Duffield, Ava Clabo, Edna McCarter. Weaving Building: Gene Redding, Lura Owen-by. Arrow Craft shows steady growth and Mrs. Ethel Snow calls attention to the fact that in the last five years the ninety-seven clubs, fifteen shops THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 17 and two active chapters which were purchasers have increased to 121 clubs, thirty-five shops, and thirteen active chapters. Business from these and the growing tourist trade have increased the profits by $7,863.64. Arrow Craft stood third highest among the Craft Centers in the amount of stock sold to Southern Highlanders, Inc. We think the Convention's visit to the school last summer stimulated an interest in Arrow Craft products among active chapters. The new wine and blue scarfs designed by a Chicago alumna, have been much admired by chapters. Because of the World's Fairs, Miss Redding has curtailed some-what her production for the coming season, feeling that we may have less tourist trade. Price tags and stickers of new design have been ordered for fall. The fall price list will mention among its new things carved animals. The Basket Room which is the front room of the Arrow Craft shop and used only in summer because of the difficulty in heating, has had some new cup-boards and shelves added this spring. The bright-colored woven paper curtains are a curiosity to the customers. The Weaver's Guild has been active. Their monthly meeting programs had a variety of subjects such as making their home surroundings at-tractive by planting flowers around the mail boxes and other conspicuous places. Mr. Coe lectured to them twice on poultry raising. They have started a new play. The annual picnic, held at the Chimneys Camp ground, and their Christmas celebration were their highlights of the season. They have had occasion to make use, many times, of the loan fund started three years ago, for having eyes examined and glasses fitted. Miss Redding, assisted by Lura Owenby, inaugurated a six weeks' course in weaving for the sophomore girls as a part of home economics. Because of the large number of girls for the number of looms we have, the time was extended several weeks longer. Mrs. Duffield, in the branch shop in the Mountain View Hotel, wove more of her famous Afghans than ever before during the quiet winter months. Despite her eighty-one years, Aunt Lizzy Reagan still comes to the loom room to weave and tells all visitors, "You'uns must hurry back." Glenna Reagan has been added to the shop personnel for the summer season. Jennie Nichol Health Center Marjorie Chalmers, Nurse. The Health Center has carried on its work unchanged except that we no longer have the monthly visits of Dr. Mayberry, the dentist. He moved away some months ago, and no one has yet been found to take his place. Marjorie Chalmers, our nurse for the past three years, emphasizes her statements in her last re-port, that the modern trend here swings more and more toward preventive measures people learning to stay well rather than suffer illness that might be avoided with proper care. So, in making the school examinations, great emphasis is laid on the correction of defects. The best inducements we have ever had for the encouragement of these corrections is the "Blue Ribbon Contest." In March the County Board of Health awarded the silver cup once more to our school for showing the highest percentage of healthy children. The Settlement School had won four times, three in succession, which assured us of the permanent possession of the cup. This year, as usual, we received hospital sup-plies and aid. These included a generous check from Florida A, dressings from Washington Club and the Junior Alumnae of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, baby clothes from Indiana A, night-clothes from the Elgin Club, and diapers from Helen Bagley, Philadelphia. These have been given out when necessary, and sickroom supplies have been loaned. We rely on the nurse's list of needy families for the distribution of Christmas baskets which contain provisions and toys. A new bedroom was built onto the back of the hospital and two rooms were painted white. An-other improvement was cement bases under the log bridge in the hospital yard. The following statistics indicate, the activity of the health department. Class of Work 1938 39 1937 38 Field Visits 1720 1504 Office Calls 2840 3371 Surgical Dressings 2334 2679 Individual Pupil Inspections 2286 1128 Class Room Health Talks 120 128 Total Typhoid Shots 1004 819 Completed Typhoid Series 332 274 Diphtheria Immunization 60 89 Schick Tests 76 62 Smallpox Vaccinations 159 225 Blue Ribbon Awards 322 248 Dormitories Annette Morse, House Manager. Belle Lowe, Lura Hurst, Cooks. Mertie Ogle, Laundress. Arlie Watson, Superintendent Grounds. Our home life has been slightly different the past year because of the division of rooming quarters. With three of the women on the staff living at the Hospital, three with the girls in the dormitory and eight in the Teachers' Cottage, the group as a whole has not been together as much as formerly. However, this rooming plan was generally considered a more comfortable arrangement. Annette Morse, Illinois A, has fitted into the family in truly motherly fashion. Evening study hour has been supervised by staff members in turn. Our seven girls and eight dormitory boys have taken the lead in Baptist Young People's Union. The bathroom in the Teachers' Cottage was made into two. This was paid for out of the fund contributed by the Los Angeles Club for improvements in the Teachers' Cottage. At the time grading was done on the highway, we managed to have our telephone wire leading to the office put under ground. The business office with Frances Brown's second year as bookkeeper has been well managed, ac-counting for all departments promptly by the calendar. One day a month the office looks like a press room while the students are using the mimeograph and getting out the Arrow News. There were times when funds got low, but the guardian angel or the Pi Phi spirit appeared just in time by the route of the Settlement School Treasurer. We were very happy when informed 1.8 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW cii for its help at all times, and all Pi Phis for their faithful ,support through another year. Respectfully submitted, EUNICE S. WEAVER that Lillian Holton would continue as Chairman of the Settlement School Committee another year. I want to thank the Committee for its ever thoughtful attention to our needs, Grand Coun VOCATIONAL AG All Day Classes THIS year's enrollment in this group reached the number of thirty-seven high school boys. Two classes were taught to the boys in vocational agriculture. One of these classes consisted of twenty-one freshman boys and the other was made up of sixteen sophomore and junior boys. We had planned to teach three units in vocational agriculture, but due to the lack of students for this class, we had to combine the second and third year boys. It is expected that next year we will be able to offer a third class in vocational agriculture. This year we had twenty-seven of the thirty-seven be-ginning boys complete the entire school year. These twenty-seven boys are at present carrying on very complete supervised farming programs. Evening School Classes Two night schools were conducted in two rural communities for those men who are established in the business of farming. One of these evening schools was held in the Laurel Grove community, which is located seventeen miles from the Settlement School. The other evening school class was held at the Laurel Lick community school house, which is located eleven miles from here. I had one class meeting in each community every week. These meetings numbered fourteen in the Laurel Lick community and twelve in the Laurel Grove district. The night school classes were held in the late fall and winter months. This time was chosen because the farmers have more leisure time at that season than at any other time of year. The course of study used in each community was somewhat different because this was my second year of teaching evening school classes in the Laurel Grove community. The courses were based on soil conservation, feeding problems, and breeding of livestock. This part of my school work I consider very inter-. esting. In these groups lots of interest was shown and farmers are now using some of the improved practices they have learned of in our discussions. Each of these communities has expressed a desire to have these classes continued next winter. Day Unit Classes This year for the first time the State Department of Education has asked the agriculture teachers to work with the rural elementary school teachers in getting teaching material for the elementary student to study in order that he or she may deter-mine more easily what occupation to decide upon so that upon entering high school, subjects may be selected accordingly. This work I have done in the two rural communities. The teaching of agriculture to 'students in the elementary schools as a subject, has been practically eliminated by the State Department of Education. Part-Time Classes This year one class is being taught to such a group at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. One class is taught every Wednesday night. The course is based on vegetable gardening and poultry. The boys each have small gardens and as a group they have produced one hundred fifty-eight pullets and cockerels. The enrollment in this class has been from twenty-four to thirty boys who formerly lived on farms. These boys are mostly Sevier County boys. One of them was a student of mine who dropped out of our school a year ago. The F.F.A. Chapter The Future Farmer chapter has just completed what we think of as being a very successful year. The interest has been high in this organization and the boys have been able to do things through cooperation. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the school: 1. Showing dairy cattle at County Fair. 2. Exhibiting farm products, farm shop work, and poultry at the County Fair. 3. Sponsored F.F.A. and home economics socials. 4. Livestock and dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee. (Pi Phi placed fifth in livestock judging among sixty-eight chapters, and twentieth in dairy cattle judging.) 5. Sponsored Parent and Son banquet. 6. Public speaking contest at the university. 7. F.F.A. baseball and basketball teams. (Our Future Farmer basketball team won the Fifth district championship. Fifth district consist ing of eleven counties.) 8. Presentation of the F.F.T. cup to the best all-round high school girl. 9. Two new boys are making plans to enter hybrid seed corn production. 10. We have rented one acre of land in which we. are growing Irish potatoes. The work thus far is being done by the boys. 11. "The Endless Pig Chain," a method which we hope will improve the breeding stock of our surrounding communities. 12. Four high school boys and I attended the State Convention of Future Farmers of America of the Tennessee Association held at Nashville on April 28, 29, and 30. The School Farm This year we had eight boys in the dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took vocational agriculture. Those boys who selected agriculture as one of their courses were given work on the farm and the others were given the janitor work. The farm boys were given charge of the enterprise which they liked, such as dairy cattle, hogs or poultry. In this resoect the school farm is very valuable for teaching purposes. This seemed to work very successfully in that the boys like their jobs and, naturally, do better work. Last fall our ICULTU E TEACHE THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 19 Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products exhibiting at the Fair all placed well. We made $12.00 above expenses on our Jerseys and won Grand Champion-ship again with one of them. This year we have increased our laying flock and decreased our broilers. We have 120 layers and 800 broilers. Eggs were incubated to produce this year's pullets for replacements of culls in the laying flock next fall. Ten of our pigs were fed to market weight on corn, tankage, and pasture. Two of these hogs were slaughtered by classes, used as class demonstration and then sold to our kitchen. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following data: Date Sold to Kitchen Farm Expense Farm Receipts July $ 201.20 $ 347.37 $125.68 August 189.83 181.08 27.48 Sept 163.37 140.81 48.99 Oct 160.65 125.31 72.25 Nov 151.14 112.58 23.75 Dec 115.50 136.38 19.30 Jan 131.40 200.56 90.32 Feb 159.72 251.05 11.10 March 131.54 270.81 43.56 April 126.60 215.25 146.80 Totals .. $1,570.95 $1,981.20 $609.23 Sold to kitchen plus cash income: $2,180.18.

Naturally, my interest is in my department and I would like to see farm boys living in our dormitory. 2. It is an absolute necessity that we have a mowing machine and there is very definite need for a disc harrow. 3. There is a need for a cheap work shop for agriculture boys, to provide sufficient space. 4. I merely suggest that the barn and farm build ings be painted this year, if possible. WILLIAM COE P INCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO 1., T N THE entered opening the n building, looked last around fall onfe boy minute and exclaimed, "My, this place has certainly had its face lifted. You would have to be awfully dumb not to be able to learn here now." This seemed to be the general opinion of most of the students. The new wing connecting the high school building with the weaving building had just been completed. This, with the many other changes, made the place look entirely different. The new wing with its knotty white pine walls, white ceilings, and large windows, houses the home economics and laboratories. A general rearrangement of the whole building was made to use the space to better advantage. A portion of the large room now used as an agriculture class room was cut off to make two very badly needed storerooms. One of these is the science storeroom and the other for general storage. A new storeroom for the gymnasium solved the problem of storing the chairs and benches during basketball season. A new extension to the stage was built in the form of three tables which were bolted together. One partition was removed to make an office for Mr. Price and another to enlarge a classroom. Part of the open court between the gymnasium and the side wings was converted into toilets for the grade school. The entire interior of the high school was painted a light cream, which helped the lighting wonderfully. A great deal of new equipment was purchased, including one hundred metal auditorium chairs, sixty library and classroom chairs, ten combination science and classroom tables, eight library tables, and one teacher's desk. A class of graduate students at the University of Tennessee made a study of our home economics needs as a class project. They made out a detailed list of the needed equipment with the cost and where it could be obtained. This made the job of selecting and buying the new equipment a much easier task. Teaching Staff The high school teaching staff was composed of William King, principal, history and science; W. S. Coe, vocational agriculture; Rosalie Ellis, vocational home economics; Ben Fleming, science and mathematics; and Marian Ryan, English, history, and library. Miss Ryan was the only new member of the staff, and she proved to be one of the best first year teachers that we have ever had. She went about her work from the beginning like a veteran. Mr. Coe and Mr. Fleming both did fine work, although Mr. Fleming was handicapped by bad health this year. Miss Ellis seemed like a different person altogether this year. She seemed so proud of her new department, took so much more interest in her work, and showed a general all-round improvement. The group meetings of the vocational home economics teachers seemed to in-spire her to greater efforts. Curriculum Changes Vocational home economics was substituted for non-vocational home economics and French was dropped from the course of study this year. A third year course in agriculture was offered, but when only four third year boys elected to take it they were combined with the second year class. The freshman class had to be divided into sections because of its size. This added three classes to the schedule. Testing and Guidance A. standard testing program was started with the first year group this year. A standard intelligence test was given the first week of school, and this was followed by an achievement test. These tests were repeated near the end of school to check their accuracy and to measure the progress during the school year, and for comparison with other schools. It is hoped that as more elective subjects are put into the curriculum, a worthwhile guidance pro-gram can be set up. A follow-up program for the high school graduates is taking shape with the idea 20 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW of giving advice and encouragement to graduates. (Of the fourteen graduates last year, six entered college, three finished the first year, three were married, one entered nurses' training, two entered business schools, and three are employed in hotel work.) Extracurricular Activities Due to poor health Mr. Fleming was unable to coach basketball this year. From a standpoint of games won and lost the basketball season was not as successful as for the past few years, but nearly every boy in high school played on one of the three teams sponsored by the school. The Future Farmers team won the district basketball tournament. The F.F.A. and Home Economics Clubs were especially active this year. They gave numerous parties and chapel programs, and the F.F.A. gave a Father and Son banquet with about forty parents present. The junior class gave the play "Murdered Alive" last fall and the seniors gave the comedy "Crashing Society" in April. Miss Ryan coached both of these plays and showed much artistry in stage setting and decoration. The glee club held regular meetings and under the direction of Miss Ryan and Miss Pack furnished the music for the commencement programs. Commencement Rev. Charles Palmer, pastor of the Gatlinburg Methodist Church, preached the baccalaureate sermon, and Dr. A. M. Philips delivered the commencement address. Nine seniors received diplomas.

The new addition connects the high school with the weaving building and has been designed to fit in with the architecture of the other two buildings. The finishing of the interior was under the supervision of Miss Jessie Harris, Dean of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. Under her direction equipment was purchased which would be in keeping with the surroundings here in Gatlinburg. There is one large room which is used for clothing and recitation classes. Connecting this are five unit kitchens, each equipped with built-in cabinets, sink, work table, and stove. The walls are of knotty pine, and excellent lighting facility is afforded by large expanses of windows which begin at the ceiling and go to within a few feet of the floor. Arrow Craft did its part by contributing gaily-colored handwoven curtains, which were especially designed by Miss Redding and made by the sophomore home economics class. In these surroundings is it any wonder that our year has been a most happy and successful one? In the first year home economics class twenty-seven girls were enrolled. These girls were instructed in personal grooming, the fundamentals of clothing, planning and serving breakfast and lunch, child care, and selection and care of furnishing for -the home. The girls made smocks, pajamas, and simple cotton dresses in class. After they completed the study of breakfast and lunch, they served meals to members of the faculty. In the second year class there was an enrollment of eighteen girls. These girls spent the first two weeks in finishing the chairs for the new depart ment. This gave them practical experience and at the same time helped to complete decoration of the new department. These girls were instructed in food preservation, making of a wool and a silk dress ; planning, preparation, and serving dinners ; and budgets. Miss Redding gave the class a six weeks' course in weaving. She taught the girls how to set up a loom and the fundamentals of weaving. The home economics girls gave a Christmas dinner for all members of the staff. The sophomore class planned, prepared, and served the dinner, while the freshman girls made the decorations and provided the entertainment. This spring the girls prepared and served a banquet for the F.F.A. boys and their parents. This was given in the new science laboratory because of its convenience to the kitchen. Because of our new department and equipment we are now able to have vocational home economics. The girls have projects which are done in the home under the supervision of the teacher. The girls derive much practical experience from them. Keen interest was shown by the girls in all their project work. The Home Economics Club had fifty members. The club belongs to the State and National Home Economics Student Club Association. During the year it gave four parties for the F.F.A. boys. Two style shows were given by the girls in assembly. Besides the home economics class, I taught general science, one eight weeks' course of adult teaching, planned the school lunches, and supervised the girls with home projects. Respectfully submitted, ROSALIE ELLIS THE SEPTEMBER ARROW HOUSE MANAGE 21 SCHOOL started a little late this year, as the new building was not finished in time for the students, and I was still later, owing to a marriage in the family. I found things going very smoothly, thanks to Mrs. Weaver, with the able assistance of Bess Mc-Carter and Belle Lowe. Our cooks have changed several times during the year, Bess McCarter leaving for a better position, Mrs. Phillips taking her place until the first of April, when. Lura Hurst took Mrs. Phillips' place. We had eight boys and seven girls till the first of November, when another girl came to us, making sixteen students to care for. The boys and girls made good grades and on the whole have been very happy. As to my work I have given them three meals a day; some they have praised and some they have not approved of as to their variety. I have made sheets, pillow cases, aprons, dish towels, and curtains, and have mended endlessly those that were here. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE WEAVING DEPA i'' TMENT T HE weaving department has been running along on about the same schedule and general plan as in the past three years. It has proven to be, a satisfactory and workable system for the number of weavers we employ and amount of weaving they can do. The weavers have become so expert in the handling of their looms that rather than encourage them to rush their work, we now have to limit the time in which they can have warps to three weeks, as the minimum time for each one. In the past year we have added no new weavers, but two new necktie makers. The necktie business has grown to be one of our most important and one of our all year round items. Four weavers and seven sewers are kept busy nearly all the time on this one thing. Since this is not convention year, we have had a lessened weaving program for this spring. With the tourist competition provided by the World's Fairs, I have proceeded cautiously in weaving up a large supply for the summer trade. As is always true, from a production standpoint, it is almost impossible to predict just how much stock to make, which colors will be in demand six months after the articles are made, and how large the stock should be to provide adequately for a business that is approximately 50% consignment. From my observations over a period of years, it is necessary to weave at least 33% extra to carry on a consignment business than we would for an entirely cash business. The six weeks' course in weaving that was given to the sophomore girls as a part of their home economics class had its good and bad points. It gave us an opportunity to say, that we were teaching weaving in the high school. With a few ex ceptions the girls were interested in the work, but I felt that the lasting benefit they derived from it was practically nothing. The time was so short that by the time they made a warp and set up the looms they were able to weave only two small pieces. When we gave them an opportunity to come in and do more weaving, only a few of them came. Two girls failed to finish from lack of interest. From my own personal standpoint in relation to my Arrow Craft work, I found that it delayed my spring work of starting new projects. This was not such a serious set-back this particular year ,due to our reduced weaving program. In convention year it would work a real hardship on us. Because there were eighteen girls in the 'class, we divided them into groups of twos to set up the looms, then each group of nine had their weaving on the nine looms. This meant that instead of running the class six weeks, we had, it nine weeks., A larger class would make it run correspondingly longer, unless we have more looms. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDOING My recommendations for another year would be to have the weaving an elective subject in the junior and senior years with a minimum of half a school year required. If we have an arts and crafts set-up, either that instructor or the home economics teacher could take over the class. I would be willing to act in a supervisory capacity. I would also recommend that the ceilings of the weaving building be painted white and that the lights be increased and inverted. WINOGENE REDDING A OW C Is' AFT CRAFT SHOP has gone along with hardly a ripple the past year. There has been no change in personnel, only very minor repairs, and a goodly amount of business. Within the month, as the number of visitors warrant, one more girl will be put on for the summer. That will allow us to keep the main shop open in the evenings and give Miss Georgia some assistance in the Hotel Shop. One of this year's graduates has been chosen for that job, Glenna Reagan. She had the highest average in her class and wants to go on to school next year. Edna McCarter and Ava Clabo have been in-valuable during the past year. The public likes them and they were untiring all through shipping. The stone fence in front of Arrow Craft had to be taken down for the new highway. This high-way is on a lower level than the old so three stone steps make it easier for the approaching customer. The roof of the old part of the building was painted an unobtrusive gray to tone in better with the rest of the roof. Some removable cup-boards and shelves have taken the place of the rough open shelves in the basket room nearest the 22 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW aighway. That helps the looks of that room as well is being a better protection for the stock. Ihere are to be new price tags and stickers to go out with the Fail things. 'I hey are to cost less and will be an improvement I hope. Also there is to be a woven label to sew into the neckties. Figures are usually boresome but I think these are very interesting and should prove that Arrow Craft has not stood still but has forged ahead considerably in the past four years. My first report for 1934-35, which includes the first six months of my work with Arrow Craft, states that we did business with 97 clubs, 15 shops, and 2 active chapters. This year there were 121 clubs, 35 shops, and 13 active chapters. That year we made a profit of $2,992.04. The profit at the present date of the current year is $10,855.91, and with two more months yet to go in the fiscal year the figure should reach four times that of the 1934.-35 profit. The inventories have naturally crept up also but not in so large a ratio. The Hotel Shop was $597.07 in 1935 and $908.56 this April 30; the Weaving Supplies $2,928.53 and now $5,273.64; and Arrow Craft $13,536.76 against $6,874.06 in 1935, not quite double. The ratio of Club Sales to those from other sources still remains about half and half. But you will remember that it was 75% Club Sales in 1935. The most interesting cash sale of the year just past was for over $600 for curtains for the bedrooms of the Mountain View Hotel. The most outstanding Club Sale was by Mrs. Williams of Portland, Oregon. One hundred and ninety-two of our Whig Rose doilies are to be used in the nicest tea room in that city. The first year that Southern Highlanders, Inc., came into existence we sold them $724.58. So far this year it has amounted to $1,942.24. That same year, 1935-36, Allanstand bought $331.53. This year it is already $1,748.63. Since we have given them 25% discount the same as Southern Highlanders, Inc., they pay cash in ten days. Southern Highlanders does the same and no longer takes things on consignment. Spring vacationers were along as usual. There may not have been so many this year but they were very kind to us with their purchases. With two Fairs going on we can only hope that there will not be too great a difference in the amount of our summer sales. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL M. SNOW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL-REPO T ON AUDIT OF TREASURER'S ACCOUNTS YEA EN ED JUNE 30, 1939 August 30, 1939 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Office of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the treasurer of your committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the books kept for the school and its Arrow Craft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1939 and the in-come and expenses for the fiscal year, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from club and chapter contributions which are shown in de-tail in Schedule 3-a and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the treasurer. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verified by us. The endowment securities and cash were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustees' report was accepted without further verification except that we proved the accounting made of security changes and in-come from securities. COMMENTS Cash Balances $24,374.78 The cash balances at June 30, 1939 consisted of the following: Milwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's general checking ac count $ 6,713.83 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,019.67 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank General check ing account 18.55 Sevier County Bank House account 268.70 Gatlinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank General Check ing account 2,059.51 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 4,000.00 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 5,214.52 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 5,025.00 Petty Cash Funds Gatlinburg 55.00 Total $24,374.78 Accounts Receivable $5,377.45 The accounts receivable arising from Arrow Craft sales were listed in detail in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company; it appeared that they consisted principally of alumnae club balances and were considered by your employees to be generally collectible: Accounts of $516.04 were charged off as bad debts during the year under review. Inventories $21,939.95 The inventories at Gatlinburg, which we did THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 2 3 not verify, totaled $21,939.95 as compared to $22,602,83 at the close of the previous year. The 'inventory apparently consists to a great extent of finished stock, the supplies and materials amounting to $4,844.53. Fixed Assets During the year under review additions of $7,041.32 were made to the school and Arrow Craft plants. These additions are shown in Schedule 2, the largest item being the laboratory addition to the school house upon which $5,515.34 was expended bringing the total cost of the addition to $5,685.34. The special building fund created in 1938 for this purpose was used to pay for this construction. A stoker was purchased at a cost of $485.00 and, as shown in Exhibit "C," contributions of $314.00 were received toward this specific expenditure. The balance of equipment and remodeling expenditures were made from current income. Depreciation charged off on the books and included in expenses amounted to $2,746.45. Income and ExPenses Income of the Settlement School proper exceeded expenses for the year 1938-1939 by $1,503.53. The operating expenses included depreciation of $2,746.45 mentioned above but not expenditures for new equipment and building additions which were capitalized in the asset ac-counts. A considerable portion of the depreciation is attributable to the Arrow Craft plant. This net income of $1,503.53 was $4,135.73 less than the corresponding amount for 1937-1938 as shown in Exhibit "C" but this difference was attributable almost entirely to the special contributions such as the Beta Alumnx Fund, cook-book fund, and other bequests received in the prior year. The Arrow Craft Shop earned a net income of $8,879.45 for the year over all expenses, including losses on bank accounts and bad debts of $1,967.99, as shown in Exhibit "D." Before deduction of these special losses the net income of $10,847.44 showed a gain of $1,701.17 over the previous year. The combined net income of the School and Arrow Craft Shop amounted to $10,382.98 of which $1,578.64, representing three-fourths of active chapter contributions, was appropriated to the endowment fund leaving $8,804.34 added to general surplus. Endowment Funds The endowment fund was augmented by the appropriation decreased by a net loss on sale of bonds of $40.00 so that required endowment balance showed the net increase of $1,538.64 to a total of $42,771.25. This balance is represented by cash and securities of $37,174.39 plus a debt of $5,596.86 due from current onerating funds, This temporary debt to the endowment fund was reduced by $3,500.00 during the year 1938-1939. Transfers from current funds of this amount were made to the endowment trustees, $1,000.00 being remitted from the Treasurer's general funds and $2,500.00 from the Arrow Craft funds.

        14 THE SEPTEMBER ARRow department of the ARROW readable and interesting to all. Her three years' experience on the commit-tee made her advice on general matters most valuable. This is also true of Marie Bacon Hagee who has also served three years. She took over the publicity and club program part of the committee work and did it most efficiently. The Settlement School film was sent to many clubs. Great care was taken in working out a schedule so that the firm could make the rounds of the Canadian clubs after a great deal of investigation in regard to getting the film into Canada. Unfortunately there was a mistake made in carrying out the schedule prepared by Mrs. Hagee so some clubs did not get the film at the time set, and one club did not get it at all. The committee regrets this and wishes to point out to clubs that their cooperation is necessary at all times in getting the film on to the next club on schedule time. An additional 400 feet of colored film depicting the whole process of weaving is being added to the film already available. Mrs. Hagee has also handled pictures and material for club programs and newspaper publicity for club sales. The annual meeting of the committee was held at the school immediately following the Asheville Convention, with the four members above listed and me as chairman presiding. The minutes of that meeting with accompanying recommendations were sent to Grand Council and approved by them as well as by the committee. These included up-keep and improvement of buildings, approving plans for the elementary and high schools submitted by the principals, going over Arrow Craft business with the Director and Weaving Super-visor, reviewing and planning the health work with the nurse and making budgets for Arrow Craft and the school. The report of the Director covering all phases of the work and making recommendations for the year was the basis on which the committee worked. An addition to the social work in the community was suggested by Mr. Price and approved by the committee in the form of a summer recreation program for children. The cost was shared by the school and voluntary contributions of business men. A successful program was carried out last summer and is being continued this summer. As chairman of the committee, I made a mid-year trip to Gatlinburg to see that the plans and policies were being carried out, and to aid the Director in planning for things which had come up during the year. I wrote a full report of this visit with recommendations to the committee and council. I timed my visit so that I could attend the meeting of the Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville with several members of the staff. I found time to visit all departments of the school and many of the extracurricular activities. I spent considerable time going into the various phases of the Arrow Craft business. I attended a meeting of the Weavers' Guild and one of the Parent-Teacher Associations, thus meeting many women of the community. The hospital and the farm were not neglected. A week's time is barely enough for this visit, even if the days do begin at six A.M. During the rest of the year I kept in constant communication by letter with Mrs. Weaver and less frequently with other members of the staff. At least once a month and usually more often, I wrote to the committee after we received the monthly let-ter from Mrs. Weaver. Then each member of the committee wrote to me and voted on things which needed decision. Besides this, I have kept in touch with Miss Onken whose advice is valued greatly because of her knowledge of the school and her unbounded good judgment. There has also been much general correspondence and twice during the year I have edited and mailed the Settlement School News to all officers, clubs, and chapters. I attended the Delta Province Conference as an official representative of the Fraternity and spoke on the Settlement School. During the four years that I have served on the committee, three years of that time as chairman, I have seen the high school grow from a twoto a four-year standard course, the agriculture and home economics put on Smith-Hughes vocational basis, and a new wing added to the building to take care of the increased attendance and improved program. The elementary school has also been much improved by better lighting and equipment of the rooms and by the addition of, a grade school principal. Arrow Craft has grown from a barely paying business to one paying almost $10,000 yearly profit. The Health Center has increased in efficiency, and community work has been organized to fit into the growing community life. I feel satisfied with these accomplishments, but there are other things which should be stressed for development in the near future. The addition of a crafts teacher in the high school has been planned for next year. This should be the beginning of a larger plan for making our project at Gatlinburg a crafts center of national scope. A new Arrow Craft building, for which funds have accumulated, should become a reality in another year and a plan for future development decided upon. The grade and high schools are in excellent condition and most of the expense of teachers' salaries is being taken care of by the county, the health work seems adequate for the present and near future, so the expansion of the crafts work seems the logical way for our project to grow. I do not advocate great immediate changes, but a program of gradual expansion after an exhaustive study of future possibilities has been made. It is with this idea in mind that I have accepted the Chairmanship of the Settlement School Committee for another year and I hope that a report of progress and of future possibilities along this line may be made to Grand Council and the Fraternity at the 1940 Convention. Respectfully submitted, LILLIAN B. HOLTON DID You know that most all the leading women's fraternities now have magazine agencies? This is an easy way to make money for your fraternity. Send all your magazine orders to the Pi Beta Phi Magazine Agency, Marshall, Illinois. DI THE SEPTEMBER ARROW TO OF T E H PI ETA PHI 1'' \ SETTLEMENT SCHOOL, 1938.39 1.5 Community ATLINBURG presents a new picture in this, the summer of 1939. With its four-lane highway, bordered on either side with walks, the way is made safe for pedestrians for the first time. Especially do we at the school appreciate this because of the 418 children in attendance. The Garden Club has placed rustic benches along the highway, intended as resting places for tourists. Preparation is being made for the dedication of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on June 21, at New Found Gap, with President Roosevelt as the principal speaker.. Mrs. Roosevelt will accompany the president. This will make their second visit here. Old Timers' Day is set for Saturday, June 24. This annual event with its amusing contests of longest whiskers, homeliest man, best joke, hog-calling, and many other old-time features, is the favorite occasion of the mountain people. A Regional Planning Board was organized, representing six Tennessee counties, including Sevier County, which is nearest the National Park. Its object is to assist this community in protecting its natural heritage in beauty, while growing and building. It will act in a purely advisory capacity. Mr. Medlin was chosen from Gatlinburg as one of the Sevier County representatives. The Little Theater Guild has been organized by Mr. Charles Palmer, pastor of the Methodist Church. It meets and rehearses in the school gymnasium. The Gatlinburg Business Men's Club has elected Mr. King, high school principal, as its president. The Settlement School playgrounds offering recreation for all ages, is being supervised by Mr. Price, elementary school principal. After trying this out for a part of last summer, it was pronounced one of the best things the school has undertaken. After a storm a year ago, the flood from the mountain streams did great damage to a few homes on Roarin' Fork, leaving two families destitute. The Red Cross, through the school, provided these families with all necessary supplies for two weeks and replaced some of their kitchen furnishings. The School gave the usual Christmas entertainment with a Christmas play and a distribution of stockings filled with candy. If it were not for the school's party and the Christmas boxes from Pi Phis, many of our mountain children would not know Christmas. High School The Staff William King, Principal, History, Chemistry, Coach. Ben Fleming, Mathematics, General Science. Marian Ryan, English, History, Library. William Coe, Vocational Agriculture. Rosalie Ellis, Vocational Home Economics. After being advised by the State High School Supervisor that our laboratories were too small, we were faced with the necessity of building larger and better ones and, along with this, making some minor improvements. Part of the building was made possible by the sale of a piece of land along the Little Pigeon River, owned by the Settlement School, but not adjacent to the school grounds. A wing of stone construction was built connecting the high school building with the weaving building large enough for both general science and home economics laboratories. By making certain structural changes inside the high school building, we were able to provide two new toilet rooms, two small store rooms, one off the gymnasium and one belonging to the general science room. The coat closet serving the eighth grade room was divided and one-half made into an office for Mr. Price. Vocational agriculture was given a larger class room. Another large class room was converted into a study hall-library with new tables, chairs, and a few new shelves. The whole interior was made lighter by painting walls a cream color. One hundred steel folding chairs were bought for the gymnasium, also chairs and tables for the science laboratory. The home economics laboratory was equipped throughout by the Los Angeles Club. A new removable extension was built for the stage and a panel of wood placed above the stage, filling in the open space and giving a better appearance. A gift of $300 from Mr. L. E. Voorheis made possible the installation of a stoker for the big furnace in the school heating plant. The Little Pigeon Alumnie Club presented to the library a new set of encyclopedia. Other books were sent by Pi Phis and some were bought by the school. The name "Grace Coolidge Library" on copper plate has been placed on the door. The home economics room has been named "Burton-Thomas" and the name "Voorheis Building" placed above the door of the weaving building. The high school enrollment was 111, the average daily attendance 96.2. Students living in the vicinity of Pigeon Forge had transportation on the regular bus line into Gatlinburg for the same low rate the school charged them the preceding year when using the truck. Marian Ryan, New York r, the new English teacher, met with real success in teaching and with the supervision of plays and entertainment. With the assistance of Eleanor Pack, Tennessee A, and Marjorie Chalmers, a girls' glee club was organized. This filled a long felt want on the programs of our school entertainments. High school assembly meetings which included sixth, seventh, and eighth grades had True or False contests, spelling matches, and debates. At commencement time, May 12, James Waycaster was awarded the athletic cup. The Little Pigeon Alumnie cup for the outstanding senior boy was awarded to Wayne Cardwell. The F.F.A. cup was presented to Martha Butler for being the outstanding senior girl. Elementary School Pern Price, Principal, Seventh and Eighth grades. Eleanor Brabson, First grade. Ruth Parker, Second grade. 16 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Grace Kerley, Third grade. Ruth Rowe, Fourth grade. Pauline Sharp, Fifth grade. Eleanor Pack, Sixth grade. Enrollment for the elementary school was 307, the average daily attendance 245.27, showing that the seventh teacher, granted us by the County Board, was needed. Mr. Price has been striving to bring up the sanitary rating, and this year we stood within one of the top in the Sevier County contest. The new sanitary drinking fountain and the adjustable window shades were a help in this advancement. The silver cup awarded to the school by the County Board of Health is to be seen in a case above the fireplace in the school house. Grades six, seven, and eight occupied rooms in the high school building. The elementary school accomplished many worthwhile things such as the starting of a newspaper, which later became a joint project of both elementary and high school. They had a Fall Carnival, taking in $60.00 which was later used to buy books for their library. They bought playground equipment with the proceeds from their play. Another contribution by the eighth grade was an American flag, which has just been mounted on a thirty-foot iron pole. The P.T.A. organization has been stronger financially than ever before. Bulah Lowe took charge of cooking and serving the hot lunch in the children's lunch room. Ruth Rowe and Ruth Parker were councilors for the Girl Scouts. A play was given by them and a foimal tea at the Teachers' Cottage. They are trying to get enough money to fit up a room in the grade school basement as a place for Scout use. Mr. Price was Scout Master for the Boy Scouts. They will camp at Lake Norris the last week of June. Home Economics Rosalie Ellis, teacher. We were successful in having home economics made vocational the past year, and consequently we were granted state aid for 50 per cent of the teacher's salary. In moving the department into its new quarters, much of the old equipment had to be discarded. A few things were sold. Into the new attractive laboratory with native wood finish and excellent lighting were built kitchen cabinets in such a way as to form five small kitchenettes. Jessie Harris, of University of Tennessee Home Economics department, working with the architect, Charles Barber, made the plans and assigned to a class in the U.T. summer school, the project of planning our equipment. The five new tables and the twenty-four chairs to match were made by native craftsmen, the chairs finished by the students. The curtains were woven by native weavers. As a result, we have a laboratory which the State High School Supervisor, L. E. Derthick, the State Supervisor of Home Economics, Margaret Brouder, and the East Tennessee Supervisor of Home Economics, Miss Herne, are referring to as a model. One new electric sewing machine, one electric cookstove, and one new oil cookstove were added. Rosalie Ellis, Home Economics teacher, carried out her regular yearly program. The Settlement School Chairman and I enjoyed being entertained for luncheon one day in March by the freshmen. We members of the staff had an example of cooking at Christmas time when we were invited to a fine Christmas dinner. This was followed by a stunt program. Again they showed good training in serving dinner for the Father and Son Banquet for the Future Farmers. This occasion proved the convenience of having the science and home economics laboratories adjoining, so that both rooms can be thrown together for community affairs. At the University of Tennessee open house, one of our girls was asked to model a dress of her own making, at the style show. Twice at high school assembly the girls exhibited their dress-making. Agriculture William Coe, Teacher. Ambers Ogle, Farmer. Vocational agriculture has thrived and Mr. Coe has continued his work with great enthusiasm, though he was disappointed at the beginning of the year that there were not enough farm-minded juniors to institute a third-year class. However, there were twenty-two boys in the freshman class and sixteen made up the second year class. Every-thing possible is done to keep up a lively interest in farm work. First in importance of these are the evening classes held in the rural communities where the fathers and brothers of these students gather during the winter months to study farm problems. Dormitory students are given as nearly as possible the kind of farm work they like best to do. Their products were exhibited at the county fair and prizes won on poultry, hogs, Jersey cattle, garden products, and shop work. When the time came for "slaughtering" for the purpose of class demonstration, our entire family was interested. We enjoyed some very good meat as the result. Many snow white chickens adorned the hillside. There were 120 layers and 800 broilers. The F.F.A. organization is quite important to the farmer boys and our chapter has been very active the past year. Their activities included a special basketball team, which won the fifth district championship, a public speaking contest, an experiment with renting an extra acre of land for potatoes, hybrid seed corn production, parties including the home economics girls, and last, the Parent and Son Banquet which was an innovation for the F.F.A.'s. It proved to be such a pleasant occasion that it will be given annually hereafter. Although it was not absolutely required by the Vocational agriculture program, Mr. Coe went once a week to CCC Camp Morgan to teach a class of boys who formerly lived on farms Arrow Craft Ethel Snow, Manager. The Shops: Georgia Duffield, Ava Clabo, Edna McCarter. Weaving Building: Gene Redding, Lura Owen-by. Arrow Craft shows steady growth and Mrs. Ethel Snow calls attention to the fact that in the last five years the ninety-seven clubs, fifteen shops THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 17 and two active chapters which were purchasers have increased to 121 clubs, thirty-five shops, and thirteen active chapters. Business from these and the growing tourist trade have increased the profits by $7,863.64. Arrow Craft stood third highest among the Craft Centers in the amount of stock sold to Southern Highlanders, Inc. We think the Convention's visit to the school last summer stimulated an interest in Arrow Craft products among active chapters. The new wine and blue scarfs designed by a Chicago alumna, have been much admired by chapters. Because of the World's Fairs, Miss Redding has curtailed some-what her production for the coming season, feeling that we may have less tourist trade. Price tags and stickers of new design have been ordered for fall. The fall price list will mention among its new things carved animals. The Basket Room which is the front room of the Arrow Craft shop and used only in summer because of the difficulty in heating, has had some new cup-boards and shelves added this spring. The bright-colored woven paper curtains are a curiosity to the customers. The Weaver's Guild has been active. Their monthly meeting programs had a variety of subjects such as making their home surroundings at-tractive by planting flowers around the mail boxes and other conspicuous places. Mr. Coe lectured to them twice on poultry raising. They have started a new play. The annual picnic, held at the Chimneys Camp ground, and their Christmas celebration were their highlights of the season. They have had occasion to make use, many times, of the loan fund started three years ago, for having eyes examined and glasses fitted. Miss Redding, assisted by Lura Owenby, inaugurated a six weeks' course in weaving for the sophomore girls as a part of home economics. Because of the large number of girls for the number of looms we have, the time was extended several weeks longer. Mrs. Duffield, in the branch shop in the Mountain View Hotel, wove more of her famous Afghans than ever before during the quiet winter months. Despite her eighty-one years, Aunt Lizzy Reagan still comes to the loom room to weave and tells all visitors, "You'uns must hurry back." Glenna Reagan has been added to the shop personnel for the summer season. Jennie Nichol Health Center Marjorie Chalmers, Nurse. The Health Center has carried on its work unchanged except that we no longer have the monthly visits of Dr. Mayberry, the dentist. He moved away some months ago, and no one has yet been found to take his place. Marjorie Chalmers, our nurse for the past three years, emphasizes her statements in her last re-port, that the modern trend here swings more and more toward preventive measures people learning to stay well rather than suffer illness that might be avoided with proper care. So, in making the school examinations, great emphasis is laid on the correction of defects. The best inducements we have ever had for the encouragement of these corrections is the "Blue Ribbon Contest." In March the County Board of Health awarded the silver cup once more to our school for showing the highest percentage of healthy children. The Settlement School had won four times, three in succession, which assured us of the permanent possession of the cup. This year, as usual, we received hospital sup-plies and aid. These included a generous check from Florida A, dressings from Washington Club and the Junior Alumnae of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, baby clothes from Indiana A, night-clothes from the Elgin Club, and diapers from Helen Bagley, Philadelphia. These have been given out when necessary, and sickroom supplies have been loaned. We rely on the nurse's list of needy families for the distribution of Christmas baskets which contain provisions and toys. A new bedroom was built onto the back of the hospital and two rooms were painted white. An-other improvement was cement bases under the log bridge in the hospital yard. The following statistics indicate, the activity of the health department. Class of Work 1938 39 1937 38 Field Visits 1720 1504 Office Calls 2840 3371 Surgical Dressings 2334 2679 Individual Pupil Inspections 2286 1128 Class Room Health Talks 120 128 Total Typhoid Shots 1004 819 Completed Typhoid Series 332 274 Diphtheria Immunization 60 89 Schick Tests 76 62 Smallpox Vaccinations 159 225 Blue Ribbon Awards 322 248 Dormitories Annette Morse, House Manager. Belle Lowe, Lura Hurst, Cooks. Mertie Ogle, Laundress. Arlie Watson, Superintendent Grounds. Our home life has been slightly different the past year because of the division of rooming quarters. With three of the women on the staff living at the Hospital, three with the girls in the dormitory and eight in the Teachers' Cottage, the group as a whole has not been together as much as formerly. However, this rooming plan was generally considered a more comfortable arrangement. Annette Morse, Illinois A, has fitted into the family in truly motherly fashion. Evening study hour has been supervised by staff members in turn. Our seven girls and eight dormitory boys have taken the lead in Baptist Young People's Union. The bathroom in the Teachers' Cottage was made into two. This was paid for out of the fund contributed by the Los Angeles Club for improvements in the Teachers' Cottage. At the time grading was done on the highway, we managed to have our telephone wire leading to the office put under ground. The business office with Frances Brown's second year as bookkeeper has been well managed, ac-counting for all departments promptly by the calendar. One day a month the office looks like a press room while the students are using the mimeograph and getting out the Arrow News. There were times when funds got low, but the guardian angel or the Pi Phi spirit appeared just in time by the route of the Settlement School Treasurer. We were very happy when informed 1.8 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW cii for its help at all times, and all Pi Phis for their faithful ,support through another year. Respectfully submitted, EUNICE S. WEAVER that Lillian Holton would continue as Chairman of the Settlement School Committee another year. I want to thank the Committee for its ever thoughtful attention to our needs, Grand Coun VOCATIONAL AG All Day Classes THIS year's enrollment in this group reached the number of thirty-seven high school boys. Two classes were taught to the boys in vocational agriculture. One of these classes consisted of twenty-one freshman boys and the other was made up of sixteen sophomore and junior boys. We had planned to teach three units in vocational agriculture, but due to the lack of students for this class, we had to combine the second and third year boys. It is expected that next year we will be able to offer a third class in vocational agriculture. This year we had twenty-seven of the thirty-seven be-ginning boys complete the entire school year. These twenty-seven boys are at present carrying on very complete supervised farming programs. Evening School Classes Two night schools were conducted in two rural communities for those men who are established in the business of farming. One of these evening schools was held in the Laurel Grove community, which is located seventeen miles from the Settlement School. The other evening school class was held at the Laurel Lick community school house, which is located eleven miles from here. I had one class meeting in each community every week. These meetings numbered fourteen in the Laurel Lick community and twelve in the Laurel Grove district. The night school classes were held in the late fall and winter months. This time was chosen because the farmers have more leisure time at that season than at any other time of year. The course of study used in each community was somewhat different because this was my second year of teaching evening school classes in the Laurel Grove community. The courses were based on soil conservation, feeding problems, and breeding of livestock. This part of my school work I consider very inter-. esting. In these groups lots of interest was shown and farmers are now using some of the improved practices they have learned of in our discussions. Each of these communities has expressed a desire to have these classes continued next winter. Day Unit Classes This year for the first time the State Department of Education has asked the agriculture teachers to work with the rural elementary school teachers in getting teaching material for the elementary student to study in order that he or she may deter-mine more easily what occupation to decide upon so that upon entering high school, subjects may be selected accordingly. This work I have done in the two rural communities. The teaching of agriculture to 'students in the elementary schools as a subject, has been practically eliminated by the State Department of Education. Part-Time Classes This year one class is being taught to such a group at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. One class is taught every Wednesday night. The course is based on vegetable gardening and poultry. The boys each have small gardens and as a group they have produced one hundred fifty-eight pullets and cockerels. The enrollment in this class has been from twenty-four to thirty boys who formerly lived on farms. These boys are mostly Sevier County boys. One of them was a student of mine who dropped out of our school a year ago. The F.F.A. Chapter The Future Farmer chapter has just completed what we think of as being a very successful year. The interest has been high in this organization and the boys have been able to do things through cooperation. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the school: 1. Showing dairy cattle at County Fair. 2. Exhibiting farm products, farm shop work, and poultry at the County Fair. 3. Sponsored F.F.A. and home economics socials. 4. Livestock and dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee. (Pi Phi placed fifth in livestock judging among sixty-eight chapters, and twentieth in dairy cattle judging.) 5. Sponsored Parent and Son banquet. 6. Public speaking contest at the university. 7. F.F.A. baseball and basketball teams. (Our Future Farmer basketball team won the Fifth district championship. Fifth district consist ing of eleven counties.) 8. Presentation of the F.F.T. cup to the best all-round high school girl. 9. Two new boys are making plans to enter hybrid seed corn production. 10. We have rented one acre of land in which we. are growing Irish potatoes. The work thus far is being done by the boys. 11. "The Endless Pig Chain," a method which we hope will improve the breeding stock of our surrounding communities. 12. Four high school boys and I attended the State Convention of Future Farmers of America of the Tennessee Association held at Nashville on April 28, 29, and 30. The School Farm This year we had eight boys in the dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took vocational agriculture. Those boys who selected agriculture as one of their courses were given work on the farm and the others were given the janitor work. The farm boys were given charge of the enterprise which they liked, such as dairy cattle, hogs or poultry. In this resoect the school farm is very valuable for teaching purposes. This seemed to work very successfully in that the boys like their jobs and, naturally, do better work. Last fall our ICULTU E TEACHE THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 19 Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products exhibiting at the Fair all placed well. We made $12.00 above expenses on our Jerseys and won Grand Champion-ship again with one of them. This year we have increased our laying flock and decreased our broilers. We have 120 layers and 800 broilers. Eggs were incubated to produce this year's pullets for replacements of culls in the laying flock next fall. Ten of our pigs were fed to market weight on corn, tankage, and pasture. Two of these hogs were slaughtered by classes, used as class demonstration and then sold to our kitchen.

Naturally, my interest is in my department and I would like to see farm boys living in our dormitory. 2. It is an absolute necessity that we have a mowing machine and there is very definite need for a disc harrow. 3. There is a need for a cheap work shop for agriculture boys, to provide sufficient space. 4. I merely suggest that the barn and farm build ings be painted this year, if possible. WILLIAM COE P INCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO 1., T N THE entered opening the n building, looked last around fall onfe boy minute and exclaimed, "My, this place has certainly had its face lifted. You would have to be awfully dumb not to be able to learn here now." This seemed to be the general opinion of most of the students. The new wing connecting the high school building with the weaving building had just been completed. This, with the many other changes, made the place look entirely different. The new wing with its knotty white pine walls, white ceilings, and large windows, houses the home economics and laboratories. A general rearrangement of the whole building was made to use the space to better advantage. A portion of the large room now used as an agriculture class room was cut off to make two very badly needed storerooms. One of these is the science storeroom and the other for general storage. A new storeroom for the gymnasium solved the problem of storing the chairs and benches during basketball season. A new extension to the stage was built in the form of three tables which were bolted together. One partition was removed to make an office for Mr. Price and another to enlarge a classroom. Part of the open court between the gymnasium and the side wings was converted into toilets for the grade school. The entire interior of the high school was painted a light cream, which helped the lighting wonderfully. A great deal of new equipment was purchased, including one hundred metal auditorium chairs, sixty library and classroom chairs, ten combination science and classroom tables, eight library tables, and one teacher's desk. A class of graduate students at the University of Tennessee made a study of our home economics needs as a class project. They made out a detailed list of the needed equipment with the cost and where it could be obtained. This made the job of selecting and buying the new equipment a much easier task. Teaching Staff The high school teaching staff was composed of William King, principal, history and science; W. S. Coe, vocational agriculture; Rosalie Ellis, vocational home economics; Ben Fleming, science and mathematics; and Marian Ryan, English, history, and library. Miss Ryan was the only new member of the staff, and she proved to be one of the best first year teachers that we have ever had. She went about her work from the beginning like a veteran. Mr. Coe and Mr. Fleming both did fine work, although Mr. Fleming was handicapped by bad health this year. Miss Ellis seemed like a different person altogether this year. She seemed so proud of her new department, took so much more interest in her work, and showed a general all-round improvement. The group meetings of the vocational home economics teachers seemed to in-spire her to greater efforts. Curriculum Changes Vocational home economics was substituted for non-vocational home economics and French was dropped from the course of study this year. A third year course in agriculture was offered, but when only four third year boys elected to take it they were combined with the second year class. The freshman class had to be divided into sections because of its size. This added three classes to the schedule. Testing and Guidance A. standard testing program was started with the first year group this year. A standard intelligence test was given the first week of school, and this was followed by an achievement test. These tests were repeated near the end of school to check their accuracy and to measure the progress during the school year, and for comparison with other schools. It is hoped that as more elective subjects are put into the curriculum, a worthwhile guidance pro-gram can be set up. A follow-up program for the high school graduates is taking shape with the idea 20 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW of giving advice and encouragement to graduates. (Of the fourteen graduates last year, six entered college, three finished the first year, three were married, one entered nurses' training, two entered business schools, and three are employed in hotel work.) Extracurricular Activities Due to poor health Mr. Fleming was unable to coach basketball this year. From a standpoint of games won and lost the basketball season was not as successful as for the past few years, but nearly every boy in high school played on one of the three teams sponsored by the school. The Future Farmers team won the district basketball tournament. The F.F.A. and Home Economics Clubs were especially active this year. They gave numerous parties and chapel programs, and the F.F.A. gave a Father and Son banquet with about forty parents present. The junior class gave the play "Murdered Alive" last fall and the seniors gave the comedy "Crashing Society" in April. Miss Ryan coached both of these plays and showed much artistry in stage setting and decoration. The glee club held regular meetings and under the direction of Miss Ryan and Miss Pack furnished the music for the commencement programs. Commencement Rev. Charles Palmer, pastor of the Gatlinburg Methodist Church, preached the baccalaureate sermon, and Dr. A. M. Philips delivered the commencement address. Nine seniors received diplomas.

The new addition connects the high school with the weaving building and has been designed to fit in with the architecture of the other two buildings. The finishing of the interior was under the supervision of Miss Jessie Harris, Dean of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. Under her direction equipment was purchased which would be in keeping with the surroundings here in Gatlinburg. There is one large room which is used for clothing and recitation classes. Connecting this are five unit kitchens, each equipped with built-in cabinets, sink, work table, and stove. The walls are of knotty pine, and excellent lighting facility is afforded by large expanses of windows which begin at the ceiling and go to within a few feet of the floor. Arrow Craft did its part by contributing gaily-colored handwoven curtains, which were especially designed by Miss Redding and made by the sophomore home economics class. In these surroundings is it any wonder that our year has been a most happy and successful one? In the first year home economics class twenty-seven girls were enrolled. These girls were instructed in personal grooming, the fundamentals of clothing, planning and serving breakfast and lunch, child care, and selection and care of furnishing for -the home. The girls made smocks, pajamas, and simple cotton dresses in class. After they completed the study of breakfast and lunch, they served meals to members of the faculty. In the second year class there was an enrollment of eighteen girls. These girls spent the first two weeks in finishing the chairs for the new depart ment. This gave them practical experience and at the same time helped to complete decoration of the new department. These girls were instructed in food preservation, making of a wool and a silk dress ; planning, preparation, and serving dinners ; and budgets. Miss Redding gave the class a six weeks' course in weaving. She taught the girls how to set up a loom and the fundamentals of weaving. The home economics girls gave a Christmas dinner for all members of the staff. The sophomore class planned, prepared, and served the dinner, while the freshman girls made the decorations and provided the entertainment. This spring the girls prepared and served a banquet for the F.F.A. boys and their parents. This was given in the new science laboratory because of its convenience to the kitchen. Because of our new department and equipment we are now able to have vocational home economics. The girls have projects which are done in the home under the supervision of the teacher. The girls derive much practical experience from them. Keen interest was shown by the girls in all their project work. The Home Economics Club had fifty members. The club belongs to the State and National Home Economics Student Club Association. During the year it gave four parties for the F.F.A. boys. Two style shows were given by the girls in assembly. Besides the home economics class, I taught general science, one eight weeks' course of adult teaching, planned the school lunches, and supervised the girls with home projects. Respectfully submitted, ROSALIE ELLIS THE SEPTEMBER ARROW HOUSE MANAGE 21 SCHOOL started a little late this year, as the new building was not finished in time for the students, and I was still later, owing to a marriage in the family. I found things going very smoothly, thanks to Mrs. Weaver, with the able assistance of Bess Mc-Carter and Belle Lowe. Our cooks have changed several times during the year, Bess McCarter leaving for a better position, Mrs. Phillips taking her place until the first of April, when. Lura Hurst took Mrs. Phillips' place. We had eight boys and seven girls till the first of November, when another girl came to us, making sixteen students to care for. The boys and girls made good grades and on the whole have been very happy. As to my work I have given them three meals a day; some they have praised and some they have not approved of as to their variety. I have made sheets, pillow cases, aprons, dish towels, and curtains, and have mended endlessly those that were here. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE WEAVING DEPA i'' TMENT T HE weaving department has been running along on about the same schedule and general plan as in the past three years. It has proven to be, a satisfactory and workable system for the number of weavers we employ and amount of weaving they can do. The weavers have become so expert in the handling of their looms that rather than encourage them to rush their work, we now have to limit the time in which they can have warps to three weeks, as the minimum time for each one. In the past year we have added no new weavers, but two new necktie makers. The necktie business has grown to be one of our most important and one of our all year round items. Four weavers and seven sewers are kept busy nearly all the time on this one thing. Since this is not convention year, we have had a lessened weaving program for this spring. With the tourist competition provided by the World's Fairs, I have proceeded cautiously in weaving up a large supply for the summer trade. As is always true, from a production standpoint, it is almost impossible to predict just how much stock to make, which colors will be in demand six months after the articles are made, and how large the stock should be to provide adequately for a business that is approximately 50% consignment. From my observations over a period of years, it is necessary to weave at least 33% extra to carry on a consignment business than we would for an entirely cash business. The six weeks' course in weaving that was given to the sophomore girls as a part of their home economics class had its good and bad points. It gave us an opportunity to say, that we were teaching weaving in the high school. With a few ex ceptions the girls were interested in the work, but I felt that the lasting benefit they derived from it was practically nothing. The time was so short that by the time they made a warp and set up the looms they were able to weave only two small pieces. When we gave them an opportunity to come in and do more weaving, only a few of them came. Two girls failed to finish from lack of interest. From my own personal standpoint in relation to my Arrow Craft work, I found that it delayed my spring work of starting new projects. This was not such a serious set-back this particular year ,due to our reduced weaving program. In convention year it would work a real hardship on us. Because there were eighteen girls in the 'class, we divided them into groups of twos to set up the looms, then each group of nine had their weaving on the nine looms. This meant that instead of running the class six weeks, we had, it nine weeks., A larger class would make it run correspondingly longer, unless we have more looms. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDOING My recommendations for another year would be to have the weaving an elective subject in the junior and senior years with a minimum of half a school year required. If we have an arts and crafts set-up, either that instructor or the home economics teacher could take over the class. I would be willing to act in a supervisory capacity. I would also recommend that the ceilings of the weaving building be painted white and that the lights be increased and inverted. WINOGENE REDDING A OW C Is' AFT CRAFT SHOP has gone along with hardly a ripple the past year. There has been no change in personnel, only very minor repairs, and a goodly amount of business. Within the month, as the number of visitors warrant, one more girl will be put on for the summer. That will allow us to keep the main shop open in the evenings and give Miss Georgia some assistance in the Hotel Shop. One of this year's graduates has been chosen for that job, Glenna Reagan. She had the highest average in her class and wants to go on to school next year. Edna McCarter and Ava Clabo have been in-valuable during the past year. The public likes them and they were untiring all through shipping. The stone fence in front of Arrow Craft had to be taken down for the new highway. This high-way is on a lower level than the old so three stone steps make it easier for the approaching customer. The roof of the old part of the building was painted an unobtrusive gray to tone in better with the rest of the roof. Some removable cup-boards and shelves have taken the place of the rough open shelves in the basket room nearest the 22 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW aighway. That helps the looks of that room as well is being a better protection for the stock. Ihere are to be new price tags and stickers to go out with the Fail things. 'I hey are to cost less and will be an improvement I hope. Also there is to be a woven label to sew into the neckties. Figures are usually boresome but I think these are very interesting and should prove that Arrow Craft has not stood still but has forged ahead considerably in the past four years. My first report for 1934-35, which includes the first six months of my work with Arrow Craft, states that we did business with 97 clubs, 15 shops, and 2 active chapters. This year there were 121 clubs, 35 shops, and 13 active chapters. That year we made a profit of $2,992.04. The profit at the present date of the current year is $10,855.91, and with two more months yet to go in the fiscal year the figure should reach four times that of the 1934.-35 profit. The inventories have naturally crept up also but not in so large a ratio. The Hotel Shop was $597.07 in 1935 and $908.56 this April 30; the Weaving Supplies $2,928.53 and now $5,273.64; and Arrow Craft $13,536.76 against $6,874.06 in 1935, not quite double. The ratio of Club Sales to those from other sources still remains about half and half. But you will remember that it was 75% Club Sales in 1935. The most interesting cash sale of the year just past was for over $600 for curtains for the bedrooms of the Mountain View Hotel. The most outstanding Club Sale was by Mrs. Williams of Portland, Oregon. One hundred and ninety-two of our Whig Rose doilies are to be used in the nicest tea room in that city. The first year that Southern Highlanders, Inc., came into existence we sold them $724.58. So far this year it has amounted to $1,942.24. That same year, 1935-36, Allanstand bought $331.53. This year it is already $1,748.63. Since we have given them 25% discount the same as Southern Highlanders, Inc., they pay cash in ten days. Southern Highlanders does the same and no longer takes things on consignment. Spring vacationers were along as usual. There may not have been so many this year but they were very kind to us with their purchases. With two Fairs going on we can only hope that there will not be too great a difference in the amount of our summer sales. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL M. SNOW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL-REPO T ON AUDIT OF TREASURER'S ACCOUNTS YEA EN ED JUNE 30, 1939 August 30, 1939 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Office of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the treasurer of your committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the books kept for the school and its Arrow Craft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1939 and the in-come and expenses for the fiscal year, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from club and chapter contributions which are shown in de-tail in Schedule 3-a and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the treasurer. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verified by us. The endowment securities and cash were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustees' report was accepted without further verification except that we proved the accounting made of security changes and in-come from securities. COMMENTS Cash Balances $24,374.78 The cash balances at June 30, 1939 consisted of the following: Milwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's general checking ac count $ 6,713.83 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,019.67 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank General check ing account 18.55 Sevier County Bank House account 268.70 Gatlinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank General Check ing account 2,059.51 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 4,000.00 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 5,214.52 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 5,025.00 Petty Cash Funds Gatlinburg 55.00 Total $24,374.78 Accounts Receivable $5,377.45 The accounts receivable arising from Arrow Craft sales were listed in detail in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company; it appeared that they consisted principally of alumnae club balances and were considered by your employees to be generally collectible: Accounts of $516.04 were charged off as bad debts during the year under review. Inventories $21,939.95 The inventories at Gatlinburg, which we did THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 2 3 not verify, totaled $21,939.95 as compared to $22,602,83 at the close of the previous year. The 'inventory apparently consists to a great extent of finished stock, the supplies and materials amounting to $4,844.53. Fixed Assets During the year under review additions of $7,041.32 were made to the school and Arrow Craft plants. These additions are shown in Schedule 2, the largest item being the laboratory addition to the school house upon which $5,515.34 was expended bringing the total cost of the addition to $5,685.34. The special building fund created in 1938 for this purpose was used to pay for this construction. A stoker was purchased at a cost of $485.00 and, as shown in Exhibit "C," contributions of $314.00 were received toward this specific expenditure. The balance of equipment and remodeling expenditures were made from current income. Depreciation charged off on the books and included in expenses amounted to $2,746.45. Income and ExPenses Income of the Settlement School proper exceeded expenses for the year 1938-1939 by $1,503.53. The operating expenses included depreciation of $2,746.45 mentioned above but not expenditures for new equipment and building additions which were capitalized in the asset ac-counts. A considerable portion of the depreciation is attributable to the Arrow Craft plant. This net income of $1,503.53 was $4,135.73 less than the corresponding amount for 1937-1938 as shown in Exhibit "C" but this difference was attributable almost entirely to the special contributions such as the Beta Alumnx Fund, cook-book fund, and other bequests received in the prior year. The Arrow Craft Shop earned a net income of $8,879.45 for the year over all expenses, including losses on bank accounts and bad debts of $1,967.99, as shown in Exhibit "D." Before deduction of these special losses the net income of $10,847.44 showed a gain of $1,701.17 over the previous year. The combined net income of the School and Arrow Craft Shop amounted to $10,382.98 of which $1,578.64, representing three-fourths of active chapter contributions, was appropriated to the endowment fund leaving $8,804.34 added to general surplus. Endowment Funds The endowment fund was augmented by the appropriation decreased by a net loss on sale of bonds of $40.00 so that required endowment balance showed the net increase of $1,538.64 to a total of $42,771.25. This balance is represented by cash and securities of $37,174.39 plus a debt of $5,596.86 due from current onerating funds, This temporary debt to the endowment fund was reduced by $3,500.00 during the year 1938-1939. Transfers from current funds of this amount were made to the endowment trustees, $1,000.00 being remitted from the Treasurer's general funds and $2,500.00 from the Arrow Craft funds.

        16 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Grace Kerley, Third grade. Ruth Rowe, Fourth grade. Pauline Sharp, Fifth grade. Eleanor Pack, Sixth grade. Enrollment for the elementary school was 307, the average daily attendance 245.27, showing that the seventh teacher, granted us by the County Board, was needed. Mr. Price has been striving to bring up the sanitary rating, and this year we stood within one of the top in the Sevier County contest. The new sanitary drinking fountain and the adjustable window shades were a help in this advancement. The silver cup awarded to the school by the County Board of Health is to be seen in a case above the fireplace in the school house. Grades six, seven, and eight occupied rooms in the high school building. The elementary school accomplished many worthwhile things such as the starting of a newspaper, which later became a joint project of both elementary and high school. They had a Fall Carnival, taking in $60.00 which was later used to buy books for their library. They bought playground equipment with the proceeds from their play. Another contribution by the eighth grade was an American flag, which has just been mounted on a thirty-foot iron pole. The P.T.A. organization has been stronger financially than ever before. Bulah Lowe took charge of cooking and serving the hot lunch in the children's lunch room. Ruth Rowe and Ruth Parker were councilors for the Girl Scouts. A play was given by them and a foimal tea at the Teachers' Cottage. They are trying to get enough money to fit up a room in the grade school basement as a place for Scout use. Mr. Price was Scout Master for the Boy Scouts. They will camp at Lake Norris the last week of June. Home Economics Rosalie Ellis, teacher. We were successful in having home economics made vocational the past year, and consequently we were granted state aid for 50 per cent of the teacher's salary. In moving the department into its new quarters, much of the old equipment had to be discarded. A few things were sold. Into the new attractive laboratory with native wood finish and excellent lighting were built kitchen cabinets in such a way as to form five small kitchenettes. Jessie Harris, of University of Tennessee Home Economics department, working with the architect, Charles Barber, made the plans and assigned to a class in the U.T. summer school, the project of planning our equipment. The five new tables and the twenty-four chairs to match were made by native craftsmen, the chairs finished by the students. The curtains were woven by native weavers. As a result, we have a laboratory which the State High School Supervisor, L. E. Derthick, the State Supervisor of Home Economics, Margaret Brouder, and the East Tennessee Supervisor of Home Economics, Miss Herne, are referring to as a model. One new electric sewing machine, one electric cookstove, and one new oil cookstove were added. Rosalie Ellis, Home Economics teacher, carried out her regular yearly program. The Settlement School Chairman and I enjoyed being entertained for luncheon one day in March by the freshmen. We members of the staff had an example of cooking at Christmas time when we were invited to a fine Christmas dinner. This was followed by a stunt program. Again they showed good training in serving dinner for the Father and Son Banquet for the Future Farmers. This occasion proved the convenience of having the science and home economics laboratories adjoining, so that both rooms can be thrown together for community affairs. At the University of Tennessee open house, one of our girls was asked to model a dress of her own making, at the style show. Twice at high school assembly the girls exhibited their dress-making. Agriculture William Coe, Teacher. Ambers Ogle, Farmer. Vocational agriculture has thrived and Mr. Coe has continued his work with great enthusiasm, though he was disappointed at the beginning of the year that there were not enough farm-minded juniors to institute a third-year class. However, there were twenty-two boys in the freshman class and sixteen made up the second year class. Every-thing possible is done to keep up a lively interest in farm work. First in importance of these are the evening classes held in the rural communities where the fathers and brothers of these students gather during the winter months to study farm problems. Dormitory students are given as nearly as possible the kind of farm work they like best to do. Their products were exhibited at the county fair and prizes won on poultry, hogs, Jersey cattle, garden products, and shop work. When the time came for "slaughtering" for the purpose of class demonstration, our entire family was interested. We enjoyed some very good meat as the result. Many snow white chickens adorned the hillside. There were 120 layers and 800 broilers. The F.F.A. organization is quite important to the farmer boys and our chapter has been very active the past year. Their activities included a special basketball team, which won the fifth district championship, a public speaking contest, an experiment with renting an extra acre of land for potatoes, hybrid seed corn production, parties including the home economics girls, and last, the Parent and Son Banquet which was an innovation for the F.F.A.'s. It proved to be such a pleasant occasion that it will be given annually hereafter. Although it was not absolutely required by the Vocational agriculture program, Mr. Coe went once a week to CCC Camp Morgan to teach a class of boys who formerly lived on farms Arrow Craft Ethel Snow, Manager. The Shops: Georgia Duffield, Ava Clabo, Edna McCarter. Weaving Building: Gene Redding, Lura Owen-by. Arrow Craft shows steady growth and Mrs. Ethel Snow calls attention to the fact that in the last five years the ninety-seven clubs, fifteen shops THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 17 and two active chapters which were purchasers have increased to 121 clubs, thirty-five shops, and thirteen active chapters. Business from these and the growing tourist trade have increased the profits by $7,863.64. Arrow Craft stood third highest among the Craft Centers in the amount of stock sold to Southern Highlanders, Inc. We think the Convention's visit to the school last summer stimulated an interest in Arrow Craft products among active chapters. The new wine and blue scarfs designed by a Chicago alumna, have been much admired by chapters. Because of the World's Fairs, Miss Redding has curtailed some-what her production for the coming season, feeling that we may have less tourist trade. Price tags and stickers of new design have been ordered for fall. The fall price list will mention among its new things carved animals. The Basket Room which is the front room of the Arrow Craft shop and used only in summer because of the difficulty in heating, has had some new cup-boards and shelves added this spring. The bright-colored woven paper curtains are a curiosity to the customers. The Weaver's Guild has been active. Their monthly meeting programs had a variety of subjects such as making their home surroundings at-tractive by planting flowers around the mail boxes and other conspicuous places. Mr. Coe lectured to them twice on poultry raising. They have started a new play. The annual picnic, held at the Chimneys Camp ground, and their Christmas celebration were their highlights of the season. They have had occasion to make use, many times, of the loan fund started three years ago, for having eyes examined and glasses fitted. Miss Redding, assisted by Lura Owenby, inaugurated a six weeks' course in weaving for the sophomore girls as a part of home economics. Because of the large number of girls for the number of looms we have, the time was extended several weeks longer. Mrs. Duffield, in the branch shop in the Mountain View Hotel, wove more of her famous Afghans than ever before during the quiet winter months. Despite her eighty-one years, Aunt Lizzy Reagan still comes to the loom room to weave and tells all visitors, "You'uns must hurry back." Glenna Reagan has been added to the shop personnel for the summer season. Jennie Nichol Health Center Marjorie Chalmers, Nurse. The Health Center has carried on its work unchanged except that we no longer have the monthly visits of Dr. Mayberry, the dentist. He moved away some months ago, and no one has yet been found to take his place. Marjorie Chalmers, our nurse for the past three years, emphasizes her statements in her last re-port, that the modern trend here swings more and more toward preventive measures people learning to stay well rather than suffer illness that might be avoided with proper care. So, in making the school examinations, great emphasis is laid on the correction of defects. The best inducements we have ever had for the encouragement of these corrections is the "Blue Ribbon Contest." In March the County Board of Health awarded the silver cup once more to our school for showing the highest percentage of healthy children. The Settlement School had won four times, three in succession, which assured us of the permanent possession of the cup. This year, as usual, we received hospital sup-plies and aid. These included a generous check from Florida A, dressings from Washington Club and the Junior Alumnae of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, baby clothes from Indiana A, night-clothes from the Elgin Club, and diapers from Helen Bagley, Philadelphia. These have been given out when necessary, and sickroom supplies have been loaned. We rely on the nurse's list of needy families for the distribution of Christmas baskets which contain provisions and toys. A new bedroom was built onto the back of the hospital and two rooms were painted white. An-other improvement was cement bases under the log bridge in the hospital yard. The following statistics indicate, the activity of the health department.

Belle Lowe, Lura Hurst, Cooks. Mertie Ogle, Laundress. Arlie Watson, Superintendent Grounds. Our home life has been slightly different the past year because of the division of rooming quarters. With three of the women on the staff living at the Hospital, three with the girls in the dormitory and eight in the Teachers' Cottage, the group as a whole has not been together as much as formerly. However, this rooming plan was generally considered a more comfortable arrangement. Annette Morse, Illinois A, has fitted into the family in truly motherly fashion. Evening study hour has been supervised by staff members in turn. Our seven girls and eight dormitory boys have taken the lead in Baptist Young People's Union. The bathroom in the Teachers' Cottage was made into two. This was paid for out of the fund contributed by the Los Angeles Club for improvements in the Teachers' Cottage. At the time grading was done on the highway, we managed to have our telephone wire leading to the office put under ground. The business office with Frances Brown's second year as bookkeeper has been well managed, ac-counting for all departments promptly by the calendar. One day a month the office looks like a press room while the students are using the mimeograph and getting out the Arrow News. There were times when funds got low, but the guardian angel or the Pi Phi spirit appeared just in time by the route of the Settlement School Treasurer. We were very happy when informed 1.8 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW cii for its help at all times, and all Pi Phis for their faithful ,support through another year. Respectfully submitted, EUNICE S. WEAVER that Lillian Holton would continue as Chairman of the Settlement School Committee another year. I want to thank the Committee for its ever thoughtful attention to our needs, Grand Coun VOCATIONAL AG All Day Classes THIS year's enrollment in this group reached the number of thirty-seven high school boys. Two classes were taught to the boys in vocational agriculture. One of these classes consisted of twenty-one freshman boys and the other was made up of sixteen sophomore and junior boys. We had planned to teach three units in vocational agriculture, but due to the lack of students for this class, we had to combine the second and third year boys. It is expected that next year we will be able to offer a third class in vocational agriculture. This year we had twenty-seven of the thirty-seven be-ginning boys complete the entire school year. These twenty-seven boys are at present carrying on very complete supervised farming programs. Evening School Classes Two night schools were conducted in two rural communities for those men who are established in the business of farming. One of these evening schools was held in the Laurel Grove community, which is located seventeen miles from the Settlement School. The other evening school class was held at the Laurel Lick community school house, which is located eleven miles from here. I had one class meeting in each community every week. These meetings numbered fourteen in the Laurel Lick community and twelve in the Laurel Grove district. The night school classes were held in the late fall and winter months. This time was chosen because the farmers have more leisure time at that season than at any other time of year. The course of study used in each community was somewhat different because this was my second year of teaching evening school classes in the Laurel Grove community. The courses were based on soil conservation, feeding problems, and breeding of livestock. This part of my school work I consider very inter-. esting. In these groups lots of interest was shown and farmers are now using some of the improved practices they have learned of in our discussions. Each of these communities has expressed a desire to have these classes continued next winter. Day Unit Classes This year for the first time the State Department of Education has asked the agriculture teachers to work with the rural elementary school teachers in getting teaching material for the elementary student to study in order that he or she may deter-mine more easily what occupation to decide upon so that upon entering high school, subjects may be selected accordingly. This work I have done in the two rural communities. The teaching of agriculture to 'students in the elementary schools as a subject, has been practically eliminated by the State Department of Education. Part-Time Classes This year one class is being taught to such a group at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. One class is taught every Wednesday night. The course is based on vegetable gardening and poultry. The boys each have small gardens and as a group they have produced one hundred fifty-eight pullets and cockerels. The enrollment in this class has been from twenty-four to thirty boys who formerly lived on farms. These boys are mostly Sevier County boys. One of them was a student of mine who dropped out of our school a year ago. The F.F.A. Chapter The Future Farmer chapter has just completed what we think of as being a very successful year. The interest has been high in this organization and the boys have been able to do things through cooperation. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the school: 1. Showing dairy cattle at County Fair. 2. Exhibiting farm products, farm shop work, and poultry at the County Fair. 3. Sponsored F.F.A. and home economics socials. 4. Livestock and dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee. (Pi Phi placed fifth in livestock judging among sixty-eight chapters, and twentieth in dairy cattle judging.) 5. Sponsored Parent and Son banquet. 6. Public speaking contest at the university. 7. F.F.A. baseball and basketball teams. (Our Future Farmer basketball team won the Fifth district championship. Fifth district consist ing of eleven counties.) 8. Presentation of the F.F.T. cup to the best all-round high school girl. 9. Two new boys are making plans to enter hybrid seed corn production. 10. We have rented one acre of land in which we. are growing Irish potatoes. The work thus far is being done by the boys. 11. "The Endless Pig Chain," a method which we hope will improve the breeding stock of our surrounding communities. 12. Four high school boys and I attended the State Convention of Future Farmers of America of the Tennessee Association held at Nashville on April 28, 29, and 30. The School Farm This year we had eight boys in the dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took vocational agriculture. Those boys who selected agriculture as one of their courses were given work on the farm and the others were given the janitor work. The farm boys were given charge of the enterprise which they liked, such as dairy cattle, hogs or poultry. In this resoect the school farm is very valuable for teaching purposes. This seemed to work very successfully in that the boys like their jobs and, naturally, do better work. Last fall our ICULTU E TEACHE THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 19 Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products exhibiting at the Fair all placed well. We made $12.00 above expenses on our Jerseys and won Grand Champion-ship again with one of them. This year we have increased our laying flock and decreased our broilers. We have 120 layers and 800 broilers. Eggs were incubated to produce this year's pullets for replacements of culls in the laying flock next fall. Ten of our pigs were fed to market weight on corn, tankage, and pasture. Two of these hogs were slaughtered by classes, used as class demonstration and then sold to our kitchen. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following data: Date Sold to Kitchen Farm Expense Farm Receipts July $ 201.20 $ 347.37 $125.68 August 189.83 181.08 27.48 Sept 163.37 140.81 48.99 Oct 160.65 125.31 72.25 Nov 151.14 112.58 23.75 Dec 115.50 136.38 19.30 Jan 131.40 200.56 90.32 Feb 159.72 251.05 11.10 March 131.54 270.81 43.56 April 126.60 215.25 146.80 Totals .. $1,570.95 $1,981.20 $609.23 Sold to kitchen plus cash income: $2,180.18. Total income less the expense: $199.98. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM COE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR NEXT YEAR 1. Naturally, my interest is in my department and I would like to see farm boys living in our dormitory. 2. It is an absolute necessity that we have a mowing machine and there is very definite need for a disc harrow. 3. There is a need for a cheap work shop for agriculture boys, to provide sufficient space. 4. I merely suggest that the barn and farm build ings be painted this year, if possible. WILLIAM COE P INCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO 1., T N THE entered opening the n building, looked last around fall onfe boy minute and exclaimed, "My, this place has certainly had its face lifted. You would have to be awfully dumb not to be able to learn here now." This seemed to be the general opinion of most of the students. The new wing connecting the high school building with the weaving building had just been completed. This, with the many other changes, made the place look entirely different. The new wing with its knotty white pine walls, white ceilings, and large windows, houses the home economics and laboratories. A general rearrangement of the whole building was made to use the space to better advantage. A portion of the large room now used as an agriculture class room was cut off to make two very badly needed storerooms. One of these is the science storeroom and the other for general storage. A new storeroom for the gymnasium solved the problem of storing the chairs and benches during basketball season. A new extension to the stage was built in the form of three tables which were bolted together. One partition was removed to make an office for Mr. Price and another to enlarge a classroom. Part of the open court between the gymnasium and the side wings was converted into toilets for the grade school. The entire interior of the high school was painted a light cream, which helped the lighting wonderfully. A great deal of new equipment was purchased, including one hundred metal auditorium chairs, sixty library and classroom chairs, ten combination science and classroom tables, eight library tables, and one teacher's desk. A class of graduate students at the University of Tennessee made a study of our home economics needs as a class project. They made out a detailed list of the needed equipment with the cost and where it could be obtained. This made the job of selecting and buying the new equipment a much easier task. Teaching Staff The high school teaching staff was composed of William King, principal, history and science; W. S. Coe, vocational agriculture; Rosalie Ellis, vocational home economics; Ben Fleming, science and mathematics; and Marian Ryan, English, history, and library. Miss Ryan was the only new member of the staff, and she proved to be one of the best first year teachers that we have ever had. She went about her work from the beginning like a veteran. Mr. Coe and Mr. Fleming both did fine work, although Mr. Fleming was handicapped by bad health this year. Miss Ellis seemed like a different person altogether this year. She seemed so proud of her new department, took so much more interest in her work, and showed a general all-round improvement. The group meetings of the vocational home economics teachers seemed to in-spire her to greater efforts. Curriculum Changes Vocational home economics was substituted for non-vocational home economics and French was dropped from the course of study this year. A third year course in agriculture was offered, but when only four third year boys elected to take it they were combined with the second year class. The freshman class had to be divided into sections because of its size. This added three classes to the schedule. Testing and Guidance A. standard testing program was started with the first year group this year. A standard intelligence test was given the first week of school, and this was followed by an achievement test. These tests were repeated near the end of school to check their accuracy and to measure the progress during the school year, and for comparison with other schools. It is hoped that as more elective subjects are put into the curriculum, a worthwhile guidance pro-gram can be set up. A follow-up program for the high school graduates is taking shape with the idea 20 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW of giving advice and encouragement to graduates. (Of the fourteen graduates last year, six entered college, three finished the first year, three were married, one entered nurses' training, two entered business schools, and three are employed in hotel work.) Extracurricular Activities Due to poor health Mr. Fleming was unable to coach basketball this year. From a standpoint of games won and lost the basketball season was not as successful as for the past few years, but nearly every boy in high school played on one of the three teams sponsored by the school. The Future Farmers team won the district basketball tournament. The F.F.A. and Home Economics Clubs were especially active this year. They gave numerous parties and chapel programs, and the F.F.A. gave a Father and Son banquet with about forty parents present. The junior class gave the play "Murdered Alive" last fall and the seniors gave the comedy "Crashing Society" in April. Miss Ryan coached both of these plays and showed much artistry in stage setting and decoration. The glee club held regular meetings and under the direction of Miss Ryan and Miss Pack furnished the music for the commencement programs. Commencement Rev. Charles Palmer, pastor of the Gatlinburg Methodist Church, preached the baccalaureate sermon, and Dr. A. M. Philips delivered the commencement address. Nine seniors received diplomas.

The new addition connects the high school with the weaving building and has been designed to fit in with the architecture of the other two buildings. The finishing of the interior was under the supervision of Miss Jessie Harris, Dean of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. Under her direction equipment was purchased which would be in keeping with the surroundings here in Gatlinburg. There is one large room which is used for clothing and recitation classes. Connecting this are five unit kitchens, each equipped with built-in cabinets, sink, work table, and stove. The walls are of knotty pine, and excellent lighting facility is afforded by large expanses of windows which begin at the ceiling and go to within a few feet of the floor. Arrow Craft did its part by contributing gaily-colored handwoven curtains, which were especially designed by Miss Redding and made by the sophomore home economics class. In these surroundings is it any wonder that our year has been a most happy and successful one? In the first year home economics class twenty-seven girls were enrolled. These girls were instructed in personal grooming, the fundamentals of clothing, planning and serving breakfast and lunch, child care, and selection and care of furnishing for -the home. The girls made smocks, pajamas, and simple cotton dresses in class. After they completed the study of breakfast and lunch, they served meals to members of the faculty. In the second year class there was an enrollment of eighteen girls. These girls spent the first two weeks in finishing the chairs for the new depart ment. This gave them practical experience and at the same time helped to complete decoration of the new department. These girls were instructed in food preservation, making of a wool and a silk dress ; planning, preparation, and serving dinners ; and budgets. Miss Redding gave the class a six weeks' course in weaving. She taught the girls how to set up a loom and the fundamentals of weaving. The home economics girls gave a Christmas dinner for all members of the staff. The sophomore class planned, prepared, and served the dinner, while the freshman girls made the decorations and provided the entertainment. This spring the girls prepared and served a banquet for the F.F.A. boys and their parents. This was given in the new science laboratory because of its convenience to the kitchen. Because of our new department and equipment we are now able to have vocational home economics. The girls have projects which are done in the home under the supervision of the teacher. The girls derive much practical experience from them. Keen interest was shown by the girls in all their project work. The Home Economics Club had fifty members. The club belongs to the State and National Home Economics Student Club Association. During the year it gave four parties for the F.F.A. boys. Two style shows were given by the girls in assembly. Besides the home economics class, I taught general science, one eight weeks' course of adult teaching, planned the school lunches, and supervised the girls with home projects. Respectfully submitted, ROSALIE ELLIS THE SEPTEMBER ARROW HOUSE MANAGE 21 SCHOOL started a little late this year, as the new building was not finished in time for the students, and I was still later, owing to a marriage in the family. I found things going very smoothly, thanks to Mrs. Weaver, with the able assistance of Bess Mc-Carter and Belle Lowe. Our cooks have changed several times during the year, Bess McCarter leaving for a better position, Mrs. Phillips taking her place until the first of April, when. Lura Hurst took Mrs. Phillips' place. We had eight boys and seven girls till the first of November, when another girl came to us, making sixteen students to care for. The boys and girls made good grades and on the whole have been very happy. As to my work I have given them three meals a day; some they have praised and some they have not approved of as to their variety. I have made sheets, pillow cases, aprons, dish towels, and curtains, and have mended endlessly those that were here. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE WEAVING DEPA i'' TMENT T HE weaving department has been running along on about the same schedule and general plan as in the past three years. It has proven to be, a satisfactory and workable system for the number of weavers we employ and amount of weaving they can do. The weavers have become so expert in the handling of their looms that rather than encourage them to rush their work, we now have to limit the time in which they can have warps to three weeks, as the minimum time for each one. In the past year we have added no new weavers, but two new necktie makers. The necktie business has grown to be one of our most important and one of our all year round items. Four weavers and seven sewers are kept busy nearly all the time on this one thing. Since this is not convention year, we have had a lessened weaving program for this spring. With the tourist competition provided by the World's Fairs, I have proceeded cautiously in weaving up a large supply for the summer trade. As is always true, from a production standpoint, it is almost impossible to predict just how much stock to make, which colors will be in demand six months after the articles are made, and how large the stock should be to provide adequately for a business that is approximately 50% consignment. From my observations over a period of years, it is necessary to weave at least 33% extra to carry on a consignment business than we would for an entirely cash business. The six weeks' course in weaving that was given to the sophomore girls as a part of their home economics class had its good and bad points. It gave us an opportunity to say, that we were teaching weaving in the high school. With a few ex ceptions the girls were interested in the work, but I felt that the lasting benefit they derived from it was practically nothing. The time was so short that by the time they made a warp and set up the looms they were able to weave only two small pieces. When we gave them an opportunity to come in and do more weaving, only a few of them came. Two girls failed to finish from lack of interest. From my own personal standpoint in relation to my Arrow Craft work, I found that it delayed my spring work of starting new projects. This was not such a serious set-back this particular year ,due to our reduced weaving program. In convention year it would work a real hardship on us. Because there were eighteen girls in the 'class, we divided them into groups of twos to set up the looms, then each group of nine had their weaving on the nine looms. This meant that instead of running the class six weeks, we had, it nine weeks., A larger class would make it run correspondingly longer, unless we have more looms. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDOING My recommendations for another year would be to have the weaving an elective subject in the junior and senior years with a minimum of half a school year required. If we have an arts and crafts set-up, either that instructor or the home economics teacher could take over the class. I would be willing to act in a supervisory capacity. I would also recommend that the ceilings of the weaving building be painted white and that the lights be increased and inverted. WINOGENE REDDING A OW C Is' AFT CRAFT SHOP has gone along with hardly a ripple the past year. There has been no change in personnel, only very minor repairs, and a goodly amount of business. Within the month, as the number of visitors warrant, one more girl will be put on for the summer. That will allow us to keep the main shop open in the evenings and give Miss Georgia some assistance in the Hotel Shop. One of this year's graduates has been chosen for that job, Glenna Reagan. She had the highest average in her class and wants to go on to school next year. Edna McCarter and Ava Clabo have been in-valuable during the past year. The public likes them and they were untiring all through shipping. The stone fence in front of Arrow Craft had to be taken down for the new highway. This high-way is on a lower level than the old so three stone steps make it easier for the approaching customer. The roof of the old part of the building was painted an unobtrusive gray to tone in better with the rest of the roof. Some removable cup-boards and shelves have taken the place of the rough open shelves in the basket room nearest the 22 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW aighway. That helps the looks of that room as well is being a better protection for the stock. Ihere are to be new price tags and stickers to go out with the Fail things. 'I hey are to cost less and will be an improvement I hope. Also there is to be a woven label to sew into the neckties. Figures are usually boresome but I think these are very interesting and should prove that Arrow Craft has not stood still but has forged ahead considerably in the past four years. My first report for 1934-35, which includes the first six months of my work with Arrow Craft, states that we did business with 97 clubs, 15 shops, and 2 active chapters. This year there were 121 clubs, 35 shops, and 13 active chapters. That year we made a profit of $2,992.04. The profit at the present date of the current year is $10,855.91, and with two more months yet to go in the fiscal year the figure should reach four times that of the 1934.-35 profit. The inventories have naturally crept up also but not in so large a ratio. The Hotel Shop was $597.07 in 1935 and $908.56 this April 30; the Weaving Supplies $2,928.53 and now $5,273.64; and Arrow Craft $13,536.76 against $6,874.06 in 1935, not quite double. The ratio of Club Sales to those from other sources still remains about half and half. But you will remember that it was 75% Club Sales in 1935. The most interesting cash sale of the year just past was for over $600 for curtains for the bedrooms of the Mountain View Hotel. The most outstanding Club Sale was by Mrs. Williams of Portland, Oregon. One hundred and ninety-two of our Whig Rose doilies are to be used in the nicest tea room in that city. The first year that Southern Highlanders, Inc., came into existence we sold them $724.58. So far this year it has amounted to $1,942.24. That same year, 1935-36, Allanstand bought $331.53. This year it is already $1,748.63. Since we have given them 25% discount the same as Southern Highlanders, Inc., they pay cash in ten days. Southern Highlanders does the same and no longer takes things on consignment. Spring vacationers were along as usual. There may not have been so many this year but they were very kind to us with their purchases. With two Fairs going on we can only hope that there will not be too great a difference in the amount of our summer sales. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL M. SNOW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL-REPO T ON AUDIT OF TREASURER'S ACCOUNTS YEA EN ED JUNE 30, 1939 August 30, 1939 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Office of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the treasurer of your committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the books kept for the school and its Arrow Craft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1939 and the in-come and expenses for the fiscal year, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from club and chapter contributions which are shown in de-tail in Schedule 3-a and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the treasurer. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verified by us. The endowment securities and cash were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustees' report was accepted without further verification except that we proved the accounting made of security changes and in-come from securities. COMMENTS Cash Balances $24,374.78 The cash balances at June 30, 1939 consisted of the following: Milwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's general checking ac count $ 6,713.83 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,019.67 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank General check ing account 18.55 Sevier County Bank House account 268.70 Gatlinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank General Check ing account 2,059.51 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 4,000.00 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 5,214.52 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 5,025.00 Petty Cash Funds Gatlinburg 55.00 Total $24,374.78 Accounts Receivable $5,377.45 The accounts receivable arising from Arrow Craft sales were listed in detail in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company; it appeared that they consisted principally of alumnae club balances and were considered by your employees to be generally collectible: Accounts of $516.04 were charged off as bad debts during the year under review. Inventories $21,939.95 The inventories at Gatlinburg, which we did THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 2 3 not verify, totaled $21,939.95 as compared to $22,602,83 at the close of the previous year. The 'inventory apparently consists to a great extent of finished stock, the supplies and materials amounting to $4,844.53. Fixed Assets During the year under review additions of $7,041.32 were made to the school and Arrow Craft plants. These additions are shown in Schedule 2, the largest item being the laboratory addition to the school house upon which $5,515.34 was expended bringing the total cost of the addition to $5,685.34. The special building fund created in 1938 for this purpose was used to pay for this construction. A stoker was purchased at a cost of $485.00 and, as shown in Exhibit "C," contributions of $314.00 were received toward this specific expenditure. The balance of equipment and remodeling expenditures were made from current income. Depreciation charged off on the books and included in expenses amounted to $2,746.45. Income and ExPenses Income of the Settlement School proper exceeded expenses for the year 1938-1939 by $1,503.53. The operating expenses included depreciation of $2,746.45 mentioned above but not expenditures for new equipment and building additions which were capitalized in the asset ac-counts. A considerable portion of the depreciation is attributable to the Arrow Craft plant. This net income of $1,503.53 was $4,135.73 less than the corresponding amount for 1937-1938 as shown in Exhibit "C" but this difference was attributable almost entirely to the special contributions such as the Beta Alumnx Fund, cook-book fund, and other bequests received in the prior year. The Arrow Craft Shop earned a net income of $8,879.45 for the year over all expenses, including losses on bank accounts and bad debts of $1,967.99, as shown in Exhibit "D." Before deduction of these special losses the net income of $10,847.44 showed a gain of $1,701.17 over the previous year. The combined net income of the School and Arrow Craft Shop amounted to $10,382.98 of which $1,578.64, representing three-fourths of active chapter contributions, was appropriated to the endowment fund leaving $8,804.34 added to general surplus. Endowment Funds The endowment fund was augmented by the appropriation decreased by a net loss on sale of bonds of $40.00 so that required endowment balance showed the net increase of $1,538.64 to a total of $42,771.25. This balance is represented by cash and securities of $37,174.39 plus a debt of $5,596.86 due from current onerating funds, This temporary debt to the endowment fund was reduced by $3,500.00 during the year 1938-1939. Transfers from current funds of this amount were made to the endowment trustees, $1,000.00 being remitted from the Treasurer's general funds and $2,500.00 from the Arrow Craft funds.

        1.8 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW cii for its help at all times, and all Pi Phis for their faithful ,support through another year. Respectfully submitted, EUNICE S. WEAVER that Lillian Holton would continue as Chairman of the Settlement School Committee another year. I want to thank the Committee for its ever thoughtful attention to our needs, Grand Coun VOCATIONAL AG All Day Classes THIS year's enrollment in this group reached the number of thirty-seven high school boys. Two classes were taught to the boys in vocational agriculture. One of these classes consisted of twenty-one freshman boys and the other was made up of sixteen sophomore and junior boys. We had planned to teach three units in vocational agriculture, but due to the lack of students for this class, we had to combine the second and third year boys. It is expected that next year we will be able to offer a third class in vocational agriculture. This year we had twenty-seven of the thirty-seven be-ginning boys complete the entire school year. These twenty-seven boys are at present carrying on very complete supervised farming programs. Evening School Classes Two night schools were conducted in two rural communities for those men who are established in the business of farming. One of these evening schools was held in the Laurel Grove community, which is located seventeen miles from the Settlement School. The other evening school class was held at the Laurel Lick community school house, which is located eleven miles from here. I had one class meeting in each community every week. These meetings numbered fourteen in the Laurel Lick community and twelve in the Laurel Grove district. The night school classes were held in the late fall and winter months. This time was chosen because the farmers have more leisure time at that season than at any other time of year. The course of study used in each community was somewhat different because this was my second year of teaching evening school classes in the Laurel Grove community. The courses were based on soil conservation, feeding problems, and breeding of livestock. This part of my school work I consider very inter-. esting. In these groups lots of interest was shown and farmers are now using some of the improved practices they have learned of in our discussions. Each of these communities has expressed a desire to have these classes continued next winter. Day Unit Classes This year for the first time the State Department of Education has asked the agriculture teachers to work with the rural elementary school teachers in getting teaching material for the elementary student to study in order that he or she may deter-mine more easily what occupation to decide upon so that upon entering high school, subjects may be selected accordingly. This work I have done in the two rural communities. The teaching of agriculture to 'students in the elementary schools as a subject, has been practically eliminated by the State Department of Education. Part-Time Classes This year one class is being taught to such a group at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. One class is taught every Wednesday night. The course is based on vegetable gardening and poultry. The boys each have small gardens and as a group they have produced one hundred fifty-eight pullets and cockerels. The enrollment in this class has been from twenty-four to thirty boys who formerly lived on farms. These boys are mostly Sevier County boys. One of them was a student of mine who dropped out of our school a year ago. The F.F.A. Chapter The Future Farmer chapter has just completed what we think of as being a very successful year. The interest has been high in this organization and the boys have been able to do things through cooperation. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the school: 1. Showing dairy cattle at County Fair. 2. Exhibiting farm products, farm shop work, and poultry at the County Fair. 3. Sponsored F.F.A. and home economics socials. 4. Livestock and dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee. (Pi Phi placed fifth in livestock judging among sixty-eight chapters, and twentieth in dairy cattle judging.) 5. Sponsored Parent and Son banquet. 6. Public speaking contest at the university. 7. F.F.A. baseball and basketball teams. (Our Future Farmer basketball team won the Fifth district championship. Fifth district consist ing of eleven counties.) 8. Presentation of the F.F.T. cup to the best all-round high school girl. 9. Two new boys are making plans to enter hybrid seed corn production. 10. We have rented one acre of land in which we. are growing Irish potatoes. The work thus far is being done by the boys. 11. "The Endless Pig Chain," a method which we hope will improve the breeding stock of our surrounding communities. 12. Four high school boys and I attended the State Convention of Future Farmers of America of the Tennessee Association held at Nashville on April 28, 29, and 30. The School Farm This year we had eight boys in the dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took vocational agriculture. Those boys who selected agriculture as one of their courses were given work on the farm and the others were given the janitor work. The farm boys were given charge of the enterprise which they liked, such as dairy cattle, hogs or poultry. In this resoect the school farm is very valuable for teaching purposes. This seemed to work very successfully in that the boys like their jobs and, naturally, do better work. Last fall our ICULTU E TEACHE THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 19 Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products exhibiting at the Fair all placed well. We made $12.00 above expenses on our Jerseys and won Grand Champion-ship again with one of them. This year we have increased our laying flock and decreased our broilers. We have 120 layers and 800 broilers. Eggs were incubated to produce this year's pullets for replacements of culls in the laying flock next fall. Ten of our pigs were fed to market weight on corn, tankage, and pasture. Two of these hogs were slaughtered by classes, used as class demonstration and then sold to our kitchen. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following data: Date Sold to Kitchen Farm Expense Farm Receipts July $ 201.20 $ 347.37 $125.68 August 189.83 181.08 27.48 Sept 163.37 140.81 48.99 Oct 160.65 125.31 72.25 Nov 151.14 112.58 23.75 Dec 115.50 136.38 19.30 Jan 131.40 200.56 90.32 Feb 159.72 251.05 11.10 March 131.54 270.81 43.56 April 126.60 215.25 146.80 Totals .. $1,570.95 $1,981.20 $609.23 Sold to kitchen plus cash income: $2,180.18. Total income less the expense: $199.98. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM COE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR NEXT YEAR 1. Naturally, my interest is in my department and I would like to see farm boys living in our dormitory. 2. It is an absolute necessity that we have a mowing machine and there is very definite need for a disc harrow. 3. There is a need for a cheap work shop for agriculture boys, to provide sufficient space. 4. I merely suggest that the barn and farm build ings be painted this year, if possible. WILLIAM COE P INCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO 1., T N THE entered opening the n building, looked last around fall onfe boy minute and exclaimed, "My, this place has certainly had its face lifted. You would have to be awfully dumb not to be able to learn here now." This seemed to be the general opinion of most of the students. The new wing connecting the high school building with the weaving building had just been completed. This, with the many other changes, made the place look entirely different. The new wing with its knotty white pine walls, white ceilings, and large windows, houses the home economics and laboratories. A general rearrangement of the whole building was made to use the space to better advantage. A portion of the large room now used as an agriculture class room was cut off to make two very badly needed storerooms. One of these is the science storeroom and the other for general storage. A new storeroom for the gymnasium solved the problem of storing the chairs and benches during basketball season. A new extension to the stage was built in the form of three tables which were bolted together. One partition was removed to make an office for Mr. Price and another to enlarge a classroom. Part of the open court between the gymnasium and the side wings was converted into toilets for the grade school. The entire interior of the high school was painted a light cream, which helped the lighting wonderfully. A great deal of new equipment was purchased, including one hundred metal auditorium chairs, sixty library and classroom chairs, ten combination science and classroom tables, eight library tables, and one teacher's desk. A class of graduate students at the University of Tennessee made a study of our home economics needs as a class project. They made out a detailed list of the needed equipment with the cost and where it could be obtained. This made the job of selecting and buying the new equipment a much easier task. Teaching Staff The high school teaching staff was composed of William King, principal, history and science; W. S. Coe, vocational agriculture; Rosalie Ellis, vocational home economics; Ben Fleming, science and mathematics; and Marian Ryan, English, history, and library. Miss Ryan was the only new member of the staff, and she proved to be one of the best first year teachers that we have ever had. She went about her work from the beginning like a veteran. Mr. Coe and Mr. Fleming both did fine work, although Mr. Fleming was handicapped by bad health this year. Miss Ellis seemed like a different person altogether this year. She seemed so proud of her new department, took so much more interest in her work, and showed a general all-round improvement. The group meetings of the vocational home economics teachers seemed to in-spire her to greater efforts. Curriculum Changes Vocational home economics was substituted for non-vocational home economics and French was dropped from the course of study this year. A third year course in agriculture was offered, but when only four third year boys elected to take it they were combined with the second year class. The freshman class had to be divided into sections because of its size. This added three classes to the schedule. Testing and Guidance A. standard testing program was started with the first year group this year. A standard intelligence test was given the first week of school, and this was followed by an achievement test. These tests were repeated near the end of school to check their accuracy and to measure the progress during the school year, and for comparison with other schools. It is hoped that as more elective subjects are put into the curriculum, a worthwhile guidance pro-gram can be set up. A follow-up program for the high school graduates is taking shape with the idea 20 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW of giving advice and encouragement to graduates. (Of the fourteen graduates last year, six entered college, three finished the first year, three were married, one entered nurses' training, two entered business schools, and three are employed in hotel work.) Extracurricular Activities Due to poor health Mr. Fleming was unable to coach basketball this year. From a standpoint of games won and lost the basketball season was not as successful as for the past few years, but nearly every boy in high school played on one of the three teams sponsored by the school. The Future Farmers team won the district basketball tournament. The F.F.A. and Home Economics Clubs were especially active this year. They gave numerous parties and chapel programs, and the F.F.A. gave a Father and Son banquet with about forty parents present. The junior class gave the play "Murdered Alive" last fall and the seniors gave the comedy "Crashing Society" in April. Miss Ryan coached both of these plays and showed much artistry in stage setting and decoration. The glee club held regular meetings and under the direction of Miss Ryan and Miss Pack furnished the music for the commencement programs. Commencement Rev. Charles Palmer, pastor of the Gatlinburg Methodist Church, preached the baccalaureate sermon, and Dr. A. M. Philips delivered the commencement address. Nine seniors received diplomas.

The new addition connects the high school with the weaving building and has been designed to fit in with the architecture of the other two buildings. The finishing of the interior was under the supervision of Miss Jessie Harris, Dean of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. Under her direction equipment was purchased which would be in keeping with the surroundings here in Gatlinburg. There is one large room which is used for clothing and recitation classes. Connecting this are five unit kitchens, each equipped with built-in cabinets, sink, work table, and stove. The walls are of knotty pine, and excellent lighting facility is afforded by large expanses of windows which begin at the ceiling and go to within a few feet of the floor. Arrow Craft did its part by contributing gaily-colored handwoven curtains, which were especially designed by Miss Redding and made by the sophomore home economics class. In these surroundings is it any wonder that our year has been a most happy and successful one? In the first year home economics class twenty-seven girls were enrolled. These girls were instructed in personal grooming, the fundamentals of clothing, planning and serving breakfast and lunch, child care, and selection and care of furnishing for -the home. The girls made smocks, pajamas, and simple cotton dresses in class. After they completed the study of breakfast and lunch, they served meals to members of the faculty. In the second year class there was an enrollment of eighteen girls. These girls spent the first two weeks in finishing the chairs for the new depart ment. This gave them practical experience and at the same time helped to complete decoration of the new department. These girls were instructed in food preservation, making of a wool and a silk dress ; planning, preparation, and serving dinners ; and budgets. Miss Redding gave the class a six weeks' course in weaving. She taught the girls how to set up a loom and the fundamentals of weaving. The home economics girls gave a Christmas dinner for all members of the staff. The sophomore class planned, prepared, and served the dinner, while the freshman girls made the decorations and provided the entertainment. This spring the girls prepared and served a banquet for the F.F.A. boys and their parents. This was given in the new science laboratory because of its convenience to the kitchen. Because of our new department and equipment we are now able to have vocational home economics. The girls have projects which are done in the home under the supervision of the teacher. The girls derive much practical experience from them. Keen interest was shown by the girls in all their project work. The Home Economics Club had fifty members. The club belongs to the State and National Home Economics Student Club Association. During the year it gave four parties for the F.F.A. boys. Two style shows were given by the girls in assembly. Besides the home economics class, I taught general science, one eight weeks' course of adult teaching, planned the school lunches, and supervised the girls with home projects. Respectfully submitted, ROSALIE ELLIS THE SEPTEMBER ARROW HOUSE MANAGE 21 SCHOOL started a little late this year, as the new building was not finished in time for the students, and I was still later, owing to a marriage in the family. I found things going very smoothly, thanks to Mrs. Weaver, with the able assistance of Bess Mc-Carter and Belle Lowe. Our cooks have changed several times during the year, Bess McCarter leaving for a better position, Mrs. Phillips taking her place until the first of April, when. Lura Hurst took Mrs. Phillips' place. We had eight boys and seven girls till the first of November, when another girl came to us, making sixteen students to care for. The boys and girls made good grades and on the whole have been very happy. As to my work I have given them three meals a day; some they have praised and some they have not approved of as to their variety. I have made sheets, pillow cases, aprons, dish towels, and curtains, and have mended endlessly those that were here. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE WEAVING DEPA i'' TMENT T HE weaving department has been running along on about the same schedule and general plan as in the past three years. It has proven to be, a satisfactory and workable system for the number of weavers we employ and amount of weaving they can do. The weavers have become so expert in the handling of their looms that rather than encourage them to rush their work, we now have to limit the time in which they can have warps to three weeks, as the minimum time for each one. In the past year we have added no new weavers, but two new necktie makers. The necktie business has grown to be one of our most important and one of our all year round items. Four weavers and seven sewers are kept busy nearly all the time on this one thing. Since this is not convention year, we have had a lessened weaving program for this spring. With the tourist competition provided by the World's Fairs, I have proceeded cautiously in weaving up a large supply for the summer trade. As is always true, from a production standpoint, it is almost impossible to predict just how much stock to make, which colors will be in demand six months after the articles are made, and how large the stock should be to provide adequately for a business that is approximately 50% consignment. From my observations over a period of years, it is necessary to weave at least 33% extra to carry on a consignment business than we would for an entirely cash business. The six weeks' course in weaving that was given to the sophomore girls as a part of their home economics class had its good and bad points. It gave us an opportunity to say, that we were teaching weaving in the high school. With a few ex ceptions the girls were interested in the work, but I felt that the lasting benefit they derived from it was practically nothing. The time was so short that by the time they made a warp and set up the looms they were able to weave only two small pieces. When we gave them an opportunity to come in and do more weaving, only a few of them came. Two girls failed to finish from lack of interest. From my own personal standpoint in relation to my Arrow Craft work, I found that it delayed my spring work of starting new projects. This was not such a serious set-back this particular year ,due to our reduced weaving program. In convention year it would work a real hardship on us. Because there were eighteen girls in the 'class, we divided them into groups of twos to set up the looms, then each group of nine had their weaving on the nine looms. This meant that instead of running the class six weeks, we had, it nine weeks., A larger class would make it run correspondingly longer, unless we have more looms. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDOING My recommendations for another year would be to have the weaving an elective subject in the junior and senior years with a minimum of half a school year required. If we have an arts and crafts set-up, either that instructor or the home economics teacher could take over the class. I would be willing to act in a supervisory capacity. I would also recommend that the ceilings of the weaving building be painted white and that the lights be increased and inverted. WINOGENE REDDING A OW C Is' AFT CRAFT SHOP has gone along with hardly a ripple the past year. There has been no change in personnel, only very minor repairs, and a goodly amount of business. Within the month, as the number of visitors warrant, one more girl will be put on for the summer. That will allow us to keep the main shop open in the evenings and give Miss Georgia some assistance in the Hotel Shop. One of this year's graduates has been chosen for that job, Glenna Reagan. She had the highest average in her class and wants to go on to school next year. Edna McCarter and Ava Clabo have been in-valuable during the past year. The public likes them and they were untiring all through shipping. The stone fence in front of Arrow Craft had to be taken down for the new highway. This high-way is on a lower level than the old so three stone steps make it easier for the approaching customer. The roof of the old part of the building was painted an unobtrusive gray to tone in better with the rest of the roof. Some removable cup-boards and shelves have taken the place of the rough open shelves in the basket room nearest the 22 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW aighway. That helps the looks of that room as well is being a better protection for the stock. Ihere are to be new price tags and stickers to go out with the Fail things. 'I hey are to cost less and will be an improvement I hope. Also there is to be a woven label to sew into the neckties. Figures are usually boresome but I think these are very interesting and should prove that Arrow Craft has not stood still but has forged ahead considerably in the past four years. My first report for 1934-35, which includes the first six months of my work with Arrow Craft, states that we did business with 97 clubs, 15 shops, and 2 active chapters. This year there were 121 clubs, 35 shops, and 13 active chapters. That year we made a profit of $2,992.04. The profit at the present date of the current year is $10,855.91, and with two more months yet to go in the fiscal year the figure should reach four times that of the 1934.-35 profit. The inventories have naturally crept up also but not in so large a ratio. The Hotel Shop was $597.07 in 1935 and $908.56 this April 30; the Weaving Supplies $2,928.53 and now $5,273.64; and Arrow Craft $13,536.76 against $6,874.06 in 1935, not quite double. The ratio of Club Sales to those from other sources still remains about half and half. But you will remember that it was 75% Club Sales in 1935. The most interesting cash sale of the year just past was for over $600 for curtains for the bedrooms of the Mountain View Hotel. The most outstanding Club Sale was by Mrs. Williams of Portland, Oregon. One hundred and ninety-two of our Whig Rose doilies are to be used in the nicest tea room in that city. The first year that Southern Highlanders, Inc., came into existence we sold them $724.58. So far this year it has amounted to $1,942.24. That same year, 1935-36, Allanstand bought $331.53. This year it is already $1,748.63. Since we have given them 25% discount the same as Southern Highlanders, Inc., they pay cash in ten days. Southern Highlanders does the same and no longer takes things on consignment. Spring vacationers were along as usual. There may not have been so many this year but they were very kind to us with their purchases. With two Fairs going on we can only hope that there will not be too great a difference in the amount of our summer sales. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL M. SNOW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL-REPO T ON AUDIT OF TREASURER'S ACCOUNTS YEA EN ED JUNE 30, 1939 August 30, 1939 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Office of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the treasurer of your committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the books kept for the school and its Arrow Craft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1939 and the in-come and expenses for the fiscal year, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from club and chapter contributions which are shown in de-tail in Schedule 3-a and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the treasurer. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verified by us. The endowment securities and cash were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustees' report was accepted without further verification except that we proved the accounting made of security changes and in-come from securities. COMMENTS Cash Balances $24,374.78 The cash balances at June 30, 1939 consisted of the following: Milwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's general checking ac count $ 6,713.83 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,019.67 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank General check ing account 18.55 Sevier County Bank House account 268.70 Gatlinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank General Check ing account 2,059.51 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 4,000.00 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 5,214.52 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 5,025.00 Petty Cash Funds Gatlinburg 55.00 Total $24,374.78 Accounts Receivable $5,377.45 The accounts receivable arising from Arrow Craft sales were listed in detail in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company; it appeared that they consisted principally of alumnae club balances and were considered by your employees to be generally collectible: Accounts of $516.04 were charged off as bad debts during the year under review. Inventories $21,939.95 The inventories at Gatlinburg, which we did THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 2 3 not verify, totaled $21,939.95 as compared to $22,602,83 at the close of the previous year. The 'inventory apparently consists to a great extent of finished stock, the supplies and materials amounting to $4,844.53. Fixed Assets During the year under review additions of $7,041.32 were made to the school and Arrow Craft plants. These additions are shown in Schedule 2, the largest item being the laboratory addition to the school house upon which $5,515.34 was expended bringing the total cost of the addition to $5,685.34. The special building fund created in 1938 for this purpose was used to pay for this construction. A stoker was purchased at a cost of $485.00 and, as shown in Exhibit "C," contributions of $314.00 were received toward this specific expenditure. The balance of equipment and remodeling expenditures were made from current income. Depreciation charged off on the books and included in expenses amounted to $2,746.45. Income and ExPenses Income of the Settlement School proper exceeded expenses for the year 1938-1939 by $1,503.53. The operating expenses included depreciation of $2,746.45 mentioned above but not expenditures for new equipment and building additions which were capitalized in the asset ac-counts. A considerable portion of the depreciation is attributable to the Arrow Craft plant. This net income of $1,503.53 was $4,135.73 less than the corresponding amount for 1937-1938 as shown in Exhibit "C" but this difference was attributable almost entirely to the special contributions such as the Beta Alumnx Fund, cook-book fund, and other bequests received in the prior year. The Arrow Craft Shop earned a net income of $8,879.45 for the year over all expenses, including losses on bank accounts and bad debts of $1,967.99, as shown in Exhibit "D." Before deduction of these special losses the net income of $10,847.44 showed a gain of $1,701.17 over the previous year. The combined net income of the School and Arrow Craft Shop amounted to $10,382.98 of which $1,578.64, representing three-fourths of active chapter contributions, was appropriated to the endowment fund leaving $8,804.34 added to general surplus. Endowment Funds The endowment fund was augmented by the appropriation decreased by a net loss on sale of bonds of $40.00 so that required endowment balance showed the net increase of $1,538.64 to a total of $42,771.25. This balance is represented by cash and securities of $37,174.39 plus a debt of $5,596.86 due from current onerating funds, This temporary debt to the endowment fund was reduced by $3,500.00 during the year 1938-1939. Transfers from current funds of this amount were made to the endowment trustees, $1,000.00 being remitted from the Treasurer's general funds and $2,500.00 from the Arrow Craft funds.

        20 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW of giving advice and encouragement to graduates. (Of the fourteen graduates last year, six entered college, three finished the first year, three were married, one entered nurses' training, two entered business schools, and three are employed in hotel work.) Extracurricular Activities Due to poor health Mr. Fleming was unable to coach basketball this year. From a standpoint of games won and lost the basketball season was not as successful as for the past few years, but nearly every boy in high school played on one of the three teams sponsored by the school. The Future Farmers team won the district basketball tournament. The F.F.A. and Home Economics Clubs were especially active this year. They gave numerous parties and chapel programs, and the F.F.A. gave a Father and Son banquet with about forty parents present. The junior class gave the play "Murdered Alive" last fall and the seniors gave the comedy "Crashing Society" in April. Miss Ryan coached both of these plays and showed much artistry in stage setting and decoration. The glee club held regular meetings and under the direction of Miss Ryan and Miss Pack furnished the music for the commencement programs. Commencement Rev. Charles Palmer, pastor of the Gatlinburg Methodist Church, preached the baccalaureate sermon, and Dr. A. M. Philips delivered the commencement address. Nine seniors received diplomas.

The new addition connects the high school with the weaving building and has been designed to fit in with the architecture of the other two buildings. The finishing of the interior was under the supervision of Miss Jessie Harris, Dean of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. Under her direction equipment was purchased which would be in keeping with the surroundings here in Gatlinburg. There is one large room which is used for clothing and recitation classes. Connecting this are five unit kitchens, each equipped with built-in cabinets, sink, work table, and stove. The walls are of knotty pine, and excellent lighting facility is afforded by large expanses of windows which begin at the ceiling and go to within a few feet of the floor. Arrow Craft did its part by contributing gaily-colored handwoven curtains, which were especially designed by Miss Redding and made by the sophomore home economics class. In these surroundings is it any wonder that our year has been a most happy and successful one? In the first year home economics class twenty-seven girls were enrolled. These girls were instructed in personal grooming, the fundamentals of clothing, planning and serving breakfast and lunch, child care, and selection and care of furnishing for -the home. The girls made smocks, pajamas, and simple cotton dresses in class. After they completed the study of breakfast and lunch, they served meals to members of the faculty. In the second year class there was an enrollment of eighteen girls. These girls spent the first two weeks in finishing the chairs for the new depart ment. This gave them practical experience and at the same time helped to complete decoration of the new department. These girls were instructed in food preservation, making of a wool and a silk dress ; planning, preparation, and serving dinners ; and budgets. Miss Redding gave the class a six weeks' course in weaving. She taught the girls how to set up a loom and the fundamentals of weaving. The home economics girls gave a Christmas dinner for all members of the staff. The sophomore class planned, prepared, and served the dinner, while the freshman girls made the decorations and provided the entertainment. This spring the girls prepared and served a banquet for the F.F.A. boys and their parents. This was given in the new science laboratory because of its convenience to the kitchen. Because of our new department and equipment we are now able to have vocational home economics. The girls have projects which are done in the home under the supervision of the teacher. The girls derive much practical experience from them. Keen interest was shown by the girls in all their project work. The Home Economics Club had fifty members. The club belongs to the State and National Home Economics Student Club Association. During the year it gave four parties for the F.F.A. boys. Two style shows were given by the girls in assembly. Besides the home economics class, I taught general science, one eight weeks' course of adult teaching, planned the school lunches, and supervised the girls with home projects. Respectfully submitted, ROSALIE ELLIS THE SEPTEMBER ARROW HOUSE MANAGE 21 SCHOOL started a little late this year, as the new building was not finished in time for the students, and I was still later, owing to a marriage in the family. I found things going very smoothly, thanks to Mrs. Weaver, with the able assistance of Bess Mc-Carter and Belle Lowe. Our cooks have changed several times during the year, Bess McCarter leaving for a better position, Mrs. Phillips taking her place until the first of April, when. Lura Hurst took Mrs. Phillips' place. We had eight boys and seven girls till the first of November, when another girl came to us, making sixteen students to care for. The boys and girls made good grades and on the whole have been very happy. As to my work I have given them three meals a day; some they have praised and some they have not approved of as to their variety. I have made sheets, pillow cases, aprons, dish towels, and curtains, and have mended endlessly those that were here. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE WEAVING DEPA i'' TMENT T HE weaving department has been running along on about the same schedule and general plan as in the past three years. It has proven to be, a satisfactory and workable system for the number of weavers we employ and amount of weaving they can do. The weavers have become so expert in the handling of their looms that rather than encourage them to rush their work, we now have to limit the time in which they can have warps to three weeks, as the minimum time for each one. In the past year we have added no new weavers, but two new necktie makers. The necktie business has grown to be one of our most important and one of our all year round items. Four weavers and seven sewers are kept busy nearly all the time on this one thing. Since this is not convention year, we have had a lessened weaving program for this spring. With the tourist competition provided by the World's Fairs, I have proceeded cautiously in weaving up a large supply for the summer trade. As is always true, from a production standpoint, it is almost impossible to predict just how much stock to make, which colors will be in demand six months after the articles are made, and how large the stock should be to provide adequately for a business that is approximately 50% consignment. From my observations over a period of years, it is necessary to weave at least 33% extra to carry on a consignment business than we would for an entirely cash business. The six weeks' course in weaving that was given to the sophomore girls as a part of their home economics class had its good and bad points. It gave us an opportunity to say, that we were teaching weaving in the high school. With a few ex ceptions the girls were interested in the work, but I felt that the lasting benefit they derived from it was practically nothing. The time was so short that by the time they made a warp and set up the looms they were able to weave only two small pieces. When we gave them an opportunity to come in and do more weaving, only a few of them came. Two girls failed to finish from lack of interest. From my own personal standpoint in relation to my Arrow Craft work, I found that it delayed my spring work of starting new projects. This was not such a serious set-back this particular year ,due to our reduced weaving program. In convention year it would work a real hardship on us. Because there were eighteen girls in the 'class, we divided them into groups of twos to set up the looms, then each group of nine had their weaving on the nine looms. This meant that instead of running the class six weeks, we had, it nine weeks., A larger class would make it run correspondingly longer, unless we have more looms. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDOING My recommendations for another year would be to have the weaving an elective subject in the junior and senior years with a minimum of half a school year required. If we have an arts and crafts set-up, either that instructor or the home economics teacher could take over the class. I would be willing to act in a supervisory capacity. I would also recommend that the ceilings of the weaving building be painted white and that the lights be increased and inverted. WINOGENE REDDING A OW C Is' AFT CRAFT SHOP has gone along with hardly a ripple the past year. There has been no change in personnel, only very minor repairs, and a goodly amount of business. Within the month, as the number of visitors warrant, one more girl will be put on for the summer. That will allow us to keep the main shop open in the evenings and give Miss Georgia some assistance in the Hotel Shop. One of this year's graduates has been chosen for that job, Glenna Reagan. She had the highest average in her class and wants to go on to school next year. Edna McCarter and Ava Clabo have been in-valuable during the past year. The public likes them and they were untiring all through shipping. The stone fence in front of Arrow Craft had to be taken down for the new highway. This high-way is on a lower level than the old so three stone steps make it easier for the approaching customer. The roof of the old part of the building was painted an unobtrusive gray to tone in better with the rest of the roof. Some removable cup-boards and shelves have taken the place of the rough open shelves in the basket room nearest the 22 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW aighway. That helps the looks of that room as well is being a better protection for the stock. Ihere are to be new price tags and stickers to go out with the Fail things. 'I hey are to cost less and will be an improvement I hope. Also there is to be a woven label to sew into the neckties. Figures are usually boresome but I think these are very interesting and should prove that Arrow Craft has not stood still but has forged ahead considerably in the past four years. My first report for 1934-35, which includes the first six months of my work with Arrow Craft, states that we did business with 97 clubs, 15 shops, and 2 active chapters. This year there were 121 clubs, 35 shops, and 13 active chapters. That year we made a profit of $2,992.04. The profit at the present date of the current year is $10,855.91, and with two more months yet to go in the fiscal year the figure should reach four times that of the 1934.-35 profit. The inventories have naturally crept up also but not in so large a ratio. The Hotel Shop was $597.07 in 1935 and $908.56 this April 30; the Weaving Supplies $2,928.53 and now $5,273.64; and Arrow Craft $13,536.76 against $6,874.06 in 1935, not quite double. The ratio of Club Sales to those from other sources still remains about half and half. But you will remember that it was 75% Club Sales in 1935. The most interesting cash sale of the year just past was for over $600 for curtains for the bedrooms of the Mountain View Hotel. The most outstanding Club Sale was by Mrs. Williams of Portland, Oregon. One hundred and ninety-two of our Whig Rose doilies are to be used in the nicest tea room in that city. The first year that Southern Highlanders, Inc., came into existence we sold them $724.58. So far this year it has amounted to $1,942.24. That same year, 1935-36, Allanstand bought $331.53. This year it is already $1,748.63. Since we have given them 25% discount the same as Southern Highlanders, Inc., they pay cash in ten days. Southern Highlanders does the same and no longer takes things on consignment. Spring vacationers were along as usual. There may not have been so many this year but they were very kind to us with their purchases. With two Fairs going on we can only hope that there will not be too great a difference in the amount of our summer sales. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL M. SNOW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL-REPO T ON AUDIT OF TREASURER'S ACCOUNTS YEA EN ED JUNE 30, 1939 August 30, 1939 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Office of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the treasurer of your committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the books kept for the school and its Arrow Craft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1939 and the in-come and expenses for the fiscal year, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from club and chapter contributions which are shown in de-tail in Schedule 3-a and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the treasurer. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verified by us. The endowment securities and cash were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustees' report was accepted without further verification except that we proved the accounting made of security changes and in-come from securities. COMMENTS Cash Balances $24,374.78 The cash balances at June 30, 1939 consisted of the following: Milwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's general checking ac count $ 6,713.83 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,019.67 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank General check ing account 18.55 Sevier County Bank House account 268.70 Gatlinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank General Check ing account 2,059.51 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 4,000.00 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 5,214.52 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 5,025.00 Petty Cash Funds Gatlinburg 55.00 Total $24,374.78 Accounts Receivable $5,377.45 The accounts receivable arising from Arrow Craft sales were listed in detail in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company; it appeared that they consisted principally of alumnae club balances and were considered by your employees to be generally collectible: Accounts of $516.04 were charged off as bad debts during the year under review. Inventories $21,939.95 The inventories at Gatlinburg, which we did THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 2 3 not verify, totaled $21,939.95 as compared to $22,602,83 at the close of the previous year. The 'inventory apparently consists to a great extent of finished stock, the supplies and materials amounting to $4,844.53. Fixed Assets During the year under review additions of $7,041.32 were made to the school and Arrow Craft plants. These additions are shown in Schedule 2, the largest item being the laboratory addition to the school house upon which $5,515.34 was expended bringing the total cost of the addition to $5,685.34. The special building fund created in 1938 for this purpose was used to pay for this construction. A stoker was purchased at a cost of $485.00 and, as shown in Exhibit "C," contributions of $314.00 were received toward this specific expenditure. The balance of equipment and remodeling expenditures were made from current income. Depreciation charged off on the books and included in expenses amounted to $2,746.45. Income and ExPenses Income of the Settlement School proper exceeded expenses for the year 1938-1939 by $1,503.53. The operating expenses included depreciation of $2,746.45 mentioned above but not expenditures for new equipment and building additions which were capitalized in the asset ac-counts. A considerable portion of the depreciation is attributable to the Arrow Craft plant. This net income of $1,503.53 was $4,135.73 less than the corresponding amount for 1937-1938 as shown in Exhibit "C" but this difference was attributable almost entirely to the special contributions such as the Beta Alumnx Fund, cook-book fund, and other bequests received in the prior year. The Arrow Craft Shop earned a net income of $8,879.45 for the year over all expenses, including losses on bank accounts and bad debts of $1,967.99, as shown in Exhibit "D." Before deduction of these special losses the net income of $10,847.44 showed a gain of $1,701.17 over the previous year. The combined net income of the School and Arrow Craft Shop amounted to $10,382.98 of which $1,578.64, representing three-fourths of active chapter contributions, was appropriated to the endowment fund leaving $8,804.34 added to general surplus. Endowment Funds The endowment fund was augmented by the appropriation decreased by a net loss on sale of bonds of $40.00 so that required endowment balance showed the net increase of $1,538.64 to a total of $42,771.25. This balance is represented by cash and securities of $37,174.39 plus a debt of $5,596.86 due from current onerating funds, This temporary debt to the endowment fund was reduced by $3,500.00 during the year 1938-1939. Transfers from current funds of this amount were made to the endowment trustees, $1,000.00 being remitted from the Treasurer's general funds and $2,500.00 from the Arrow Craft funds.

        22 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW aighway. That helps the looks of that room as well is being a better protection for the stock. Ihere are to be new price tags and stickers to go out with the Fail things. 'I hey are to cost less and will be an improvement I hope. Also there is to be a woven label to sew into the neckties. Figures are usually boresome but I think these are very interesting and should prove that Arrow Craft has not stood still but has forged ahead considerably in the past four years. My first report for 1934-35, which includes the first six months of my work with Arrow Craft, states that we did business with 97 clubs, 15 shops, and 2 active chapters. This year there were 121 clubs, 35 shops, and 13 active chapters. That year we made a profit of $2,992.04. The profit at the present date of the current year is $10,855.91, and with two more months yet to go in the fiscal year the figure should reach four times that of the 1934.-35 profit. The inventories have naturally crept up also but not in so large a ratio. The Hotel Shop was $597.07 in 1935 and $908.56 this April 30; the Weaving Supplies $2,928.53 and now $5,273.64; and Arrow Craft $13,536.76 against $6,874.06 in 1935, not quite double. The ratio of Club Sales to those from other sources still remains about half and half. But you will remember that it was 75% Club Sales in 1935. The most interesting cash sale of the year just past was for over $600 for curtains for the bedrooms of the Mountain View Hotel. The most outstanding Club Sale was by Mrs. Williams of Portland, Oregon. One hundred and ninety-two of our Whig Rose doilies are to be used in the nicest tea room in that city. The first year that Southern Highlanders, Inc., came into existence we sold them $724.58. So far this year it has amounted to $1,942.24. That same year, 1935-36, Allanstand bought $331.53. This year it is already $1,748.63. Since we have given them 25% discount the same as Southern Highlanders, Inc., they pay cash in ten days. Southern Highlanders does the same and no longer takes things on consignment. Spring vacationers were along as usual. There may not have been so many this year but they were very kind to us with their purchases. With two Fairs going on we can only hope that there will not be too great a difference in the amount of our summer sales. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL M. SNOW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL-REPO T ON AUDIT OF TREASURER'S ACCOUNTS YEA EN ED JUNE 30, 1939 August 30, 1939 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Office of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the treasurer of your committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the books kept for the school and its Arrow Craft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1939 and the in-come and expenses for the fiscal year, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from club and chapter contributions which are shown in de-tail in Schedule 3-a and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the treasurer. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verified by us. The endowment securities and cash were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustees' report was accepted without further verification except that we proved the accounting made of security changes and in-come from securities. COMMENTS Cash Balances $24,374.78 The cash balances at June 30, 1939 consisted of the following: Milwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's general checking ac count $ 6,713.83 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,019.67 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank General check ing account 18.55 Sevier County Bank House account 268.70 Gatlinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank General Check ing account 2,059.51 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 4,000.00 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 5,214.52 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 5,025.00 Petty Cash Funds Gatlinburg 55.00 Total $24,374.78 Accounts Receivable $5,377.45 The accounts receivable arising from Arrow Craft sales were listed in detail in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company; it appeared that they consisted principally of alumnae club balances and were considered by your employees to be generally collectible: Accounts of $516.04 were charged off as bad debts during the year under review. Inventories $21,939.95 The inventories at Gatlinburg, which we did THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 2 3 not verify, totaled $21,939.95 as compared to $22,602,83 at the close of the previous year. The 'inventory apparently consists to a great extent of finished stock, the supplies and materials amounting to $4,844.53. Fixed Assets During the year under review additions of $7,041.32 were made to the school and Arrow Craft plants. These additions are shown in Schedule 2, the largest item being the laboratory addition to the school house upon which $5,515.34 was expended bringing the total cost of the addition to $5,685.34. The special building fund created in 1938 for this purpose was used to pay for this construction. A stoker was purchased at a cost of $485.00 and, as shown in Exhibit "C," contributions of $314.00 were received toward this specific expenditure. The balance of equipment and remodeling expenditures were made from current income. Depreciation charged off on the books and included in expenses amounted to $2,746.45. Income and ExPenses Income of the Settlement School proper exceeded expenses for the year 1938-1939 by $1,503.53. The operating expenses included depreciation of $2,746.45 mentioned above but not expenditures for new equipment and building additions which were capitalized in the asset ac-counts. A considerable portion of the depreciation is attributable to the Arrow Craft plant. This net income of $1,503.53 was $4,135.73 less than the corresponding amount for 1937-1938 as shown in Exhibit "C" but this difference was attributable almost entirely to the special contributions such as the Beta Alumnx Fund, cook-book fund, and other bequests received in the prior year. The Arrow Craft Shop earned a net income of $8,879.45 for the year over all expenses, including losses on bank accounts and bad debts of $1,967.99, as shown in Exhibit "D." Before deduction of these special losses the net income of $10,847.44 showed a gain of $1,701.17 over the previous year. The combined net income of the School and Arrow Craft Shop amounted to $10,382.98 of which $1,578.64, representing three-fourths of active chapter contributions, was appropriated to the endowment fund leaving $8,804.34 added to general surplus. Endowment Funds The endowment fund was augmented by the appropriation decreased by a net loss on sale of bonds of $40.00 so that required endowment balance showed the net increase of $1,538.64 to a total of $42,771.25. This balance is represented by cash and securities of $37,174.39 plus a debt of $5,596.86 due from current onerating funds, This temporary debt to the endowment fund was reduced by $3,500.00 during the year 1938-1939. Transfers from current funds of this amount were made to the endowment trustees, $1,000.00 being remitted from the Treasurer's general funds and $2,500.00 from the Arrow Craft funds.

Last year I made an exhaustive report to Convention of the past, present, and future work of the School which, together with surveys by Edwin L. Holton and H. Lutcher Stark, was published in the 1938 Information ARROW. I shall not repeat, except for emphasis, information contained in that report which was accepted by Convention. After the approval of that report, the Committee . has gone ahead with plans suggested in it and I am now reporting the progress made along these lines in the year ending June 30, 1939. The greatest change has been in the high school, brought about by the addition of a wing to the high school building. This wing contains the beautiful new home economics laboratory and a science laboratory. The latter is a light, airy room well equipped for work in chemistry and general science. Five hundred dollars of the cook book profits were used for the equipment of the home economics laboratory. The walls of knotty pine, the hand woven draperies, the cherry drop leaf tables and ladder back chairs are all appropriate to the mountain village as well as being most attractive. Sewing machines and unit kitchens with wood, oil, and electric stoves make sewing and cooking a pleasure for the girls. As a luncheon guest, I par-took of an excellent, well-served meal and found the girls delightful hostesses. This new laboratory gave opportunity for expanding the home economics course into one which was approved by the state board of vocational education for Smith-Hughes aid and supervision. Rosalie Ellis, Kansas B, began her second year as home economics teacher in the new laboratory and has been most successful in carrying on the vocational course. Marion Ryan, New York r, took charge of the high school library, now housed in a larger room, in addition to teaching the English courses and coaching the plays. Her work has been most satisfactory is every way and we are glad that she is to return. Three men, William King, principal and science teacher, Ben Fleming, history, and William Coe, agriculture, made up the rest of the high school faculty and all will return next year. The older part of the high school building was improved by the addition of store rooms, toilets, and inside painting. The sixth, seventh, and eighth grades occupied two large rooms with a connecting office for Mr. Price, our fine elementary principal. This left only five grades in the five-room elementary building so that it was not overcrowded as it has been the last few years. An excellent staff including Ruth Rowe, Nevada A, Ruth Parker, Pennsylvania B, and Eleanor Pack, Tennessee A, has done fine work in the classroom and have entered into community activities. The two Ruths have taken charge of the Girl Scout troup and Eleanor has organized and led the girls' glee club and a rhythm band, and had charge of the music for chapel and for all school activities. It is with regret that we accept the resignations of Eleanor Pack and Ruth Rowe for next year. Two Pi Phis will take their places, Mary Rupard, Missouri I', and Pauline Morris, New York r, both of whom come with the best of recommendations and with great interest in teaching at the Settlement School. Eleanor Brabson of Sevierville, Tennessee, who has taught ten years, has resigned to become post-mistress of Gatlinburg. We regret losing her as a teacher but know that she will continue to help with all community activities. Mattie Huff Law-son, Iowa r, who taught for us some years ago, will again teach in the elementary school. Pauline Sharp and Grace Kerley, county girls, will continue next year. Both are good teachers and community workers. With another teacher added to the staff, it was necessary to add a bedroom to the hospital building, that being deemed the most convenient and the least expensive place to build. The room was built at a cost of less than $200.00 and is a very attractive and comfortable place for two teachers to live. Marjorie Chalmers has her combination bed and living room there. The rest of the staff were housed as before, Mr. King and Mr. Coe in the boys' dormitory, Miss Morse, house manager, and two teachers in the girls' dormitory, and the rest of the staff in Teachers' Cottage which was made more convenient by increasing the bathroom facilities. Annette Morse, Illinois A, took up her work as house manager last fall and has been competent, and a helpful adviser to the boys and girls in the dormitories. It is the first time that there has been a Pi Phi in this position. With the six Pi Phi teachers, Mrs. Snow, Mrs. Weaver, and Frances Brown, all Pi Phis, there are now ten Pi Phis on the staff, the greatest number that there has been since I became a member of the committee and, I feel sure, that there has ever been at the same time. Marjorie Chalmers has carried on the health work in the same efficient, cheerful, and loving way that has endeared her to the whole community in the four years she has been with the school. She seems to do a little more than is humanly possible and she does it with a smile. With all her other work, she finds time to sing at church affairs and funerals, and if the high school glee club needs another alto she helps there too. This year the grade school brought home the Blue Rib-bon health cup in the county contest for the third time, thus making it a permanent possession. Marjorie dreams of the time when some interested Pi Phi or other friend of the school may give a modern building for the health work, and if ear-nest endeavor and faithfulness to one's work could bring that reward, Marjorie's dream would come true. That the work of the staff and weavers of Arrow THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Craft has been excellent is attested by the many satisfied customers. In my own alumni club in a town of 12,000, we have in the last four years sold in round numbers, $225, $275, $400, and $300, making a total of $1,200 worth of Arrow Craft products. This could not be done if customers were not pleased and if there were not variety in the stock, new things each year, and above all, high level of material and workmanship. A great number of alumnae clubs report a similar continued high amount of sales from year to year. Some clubs wish to stress the sale of products only every other year, or to leave out a year occasionally. This is left to the discretion of the clubs, but we want all clubs to know that we appreciate greatly the effort that goes into these sales. If all Pi Phis could attend, as I have, the Weavers' Guild, when nearly a hundred of our women weavers meet, and see and hear what this work means to them, there would be no need to urge clubs to sell their work. Our shops in Gatlinburg have had a good year, but we must still depend upon our clubs for the larger part of our business. The Arrow Craft staff is the same as last year with Mrs. Ethel Snow, as director. Mrs. Snow is well and favorably known to those club members who have had charge of Arrow Craft sales. Even if she has to reprimand a chairman for not keeping to the rules, which by the way, are most necessary, she does it in such a way that there is no lasting hurt. When one realizes that she must deal by correspondence with over one hundred club chairmen, buy all the stock except the weaving, manage the packing and shipping, run a shop, and wait on customers, one knows that she is a busy and efficient woman. Her helpers, Edna McCarter and Ava Clabo, two of our Gatlinburg girls, are efficient in every line of the work, and customers find them attractive, quick, and reliable. Mrs. Georgia Duffield is still to be found in the Mountain View Hotel where the guests spend much time, and money, in our Arrow Craft shop which she manages so well. Miss Georgie, as she is affectionately known, plays the piano for Sun-day school, church, Young People's meetings, and Missionary Society and is always ready to help in trouble or illness. Her friends include those from the rich and prominent who come to the hotel to the lowliest in the burg. In the weaving building, in some mountain home, or working with the garden club on a community project, one finds Gene'Redding, our weaving supervisor. She does the designing and super-vises the weaving for Arrow Craft. Her artistic ability along with good business sense is unusual and her management of the weavers combines teaching them to make products of high standard and making their lives happier and more comfortable. Lura Owenby is still her capable assistant. Frances Brown, Missouri I', is starting her third year as bookkeeper for Arrow Craft and the school. This is no small job with a business the size of Arrow Craft, and the school books besides, but Frances, in her quiet efficient way, does the work well and fills an important place in the community. These women have taken care of the increase in the Arrow Craft business with very little extra overhead. We pay our weavers more than any other shop in Gatlinburg and so can demand the best of workmanship and loyalty to Arrow Craft. Due to our teaching ,of weaving over a long perick there are many more weavers in and around Gat linburg than we can take care of, so many shop have been opened for the tourist trade, and "wean ing for sale" is seen on many cabins along th mountain roads. Our shop sets a high standarc something for others to work toward, but whicl as yet, no other shop has attained. The profit of Arrow Craft will be shown in th report of our treasurer. It has increased steadil for the past five years. Now the committee, wit] the approval of Grand Council, feels justified i using a part of Arrow Craft profit each year, b( ginning with the 1939-40 school year, to add crafts teacher to the high school staff, thus givin, our boys and girls training which will give then an outlet for creative work and an economic ir come in their home environment. This will event. ally add variety and attractiveness to Arrow Crai stock and thus bring monetary value back in prc portion to that expended. Several applications haN been received for this position and great care wi. be used in the selection. Miss Jessie Harris, Dire for of Home Economics of the University of Ter nessee, our Asheville Convention initiate, is a: sisting the committee in getting this crafts wor started. It is hoped that a new Arrow Craft built ing can be built within the next year, and then tit Voorheis building can be used for a crafts labor: tory. Coordinating and supervising the work of tr schools, the health center, and Arrow Craft is Mr Eunice Weaver, our director. Good judgment i making decisions and firmness in carrying them ou combined with a pleasing personality and a kind: disposition, make her respected and loved by al I have tried to give a brief review of the wol at Gatlinburg and the staff who are carrying it of This is all made possible by the contributions ( clubs and chapters, and by the magazine agency used by these clubs and chapters. For these contl butions, made possible by work and sacrifice ( club members, we are grateful. If our work to continue as needed and planned, we must d pend upon your continued support. The Magazit Agency has increased each year and this last ye was placed in the Central Office where, undo Mrs. Purdunn's management, it has had its be year. Its possibilities are almost unlimited an clubs should make the most of this means of hel ing the school. The Settlement School Committee began ti year with two new members. Irene Eldridge, Wi consin B, took the place of Josephine McClever whose term expired. Although a busy teacher . the Milwaukee High School, Irene has given ti necessary time to keep the books and to check tl accounts kept by the bookkeeper at the school at Arrow Craft. This is no small task and in additic Irene has kept up her part of the general comm. tee work, sending each member monthly repoi of the school finances, and helping to decide matters brought to the committee. Ethel Hog Copp, California I', the second new member, h came secretary of the committee and did her wo most acceptably. Her enthusiasm and good jud ment have made her an excellent member of t: committee. Jeffries Green Pace took over the editorship "News from Little Pigeon" and has made ff. 14 THE SEPTEMBER ARRow department of the ARROW readable and interesting to all. Her three years' experience on the commit-tee made her advice on general matters most valuable. This is also true of Marie Bacon Hagee who has also served three years. She took over the publicity and club program part of the committee work and did it most efficiently. The Settlement School film was sent to many clubs. Great care was taken in working out a schedule so that the firm could make the rounds of the Canadian clubs after a great deal of investigation in regard to getting the film into Canada. Unfortunately there was a mistake made in carrying out the schedule prepared by Mrs. Hagee so some clubs did not get the film at the time set, and one club did not get it at all. The committee regrets this and wishes to point out to clubs that their cooperation is necessary at all times in getting the film on to the next club on schedule time. An additional 400 feet of colored film depicting the whole process of weaving is being added to the film already available. Mrs. Hagee has also handled pictures and material for club programs and newspaper publicity for club sales. The annual meeting of the committee was held at the school immediately following the Asheville Convention, with the four members above listed and me as chairman presiding. The minutes of that meeting with accompanying recommendations were sent to Grand Council and approved by them as well as by the committee. These included up-keep and improvement of buildings, approving plans for the elementary and high schools submitted by the principals, going over Arrow Craft business with the Director and Weaving Super-visor, reviewing and planning the health work with the nurse and making budgets for Arrow Craft and the school. The report of the Director covering all phases of the work and making recommendations for the year was the basis on which the committee worked. An addition to the social work in the community was suggested by Mr. Price and approved by the committee in the form of a summer recreation program for children. The cost was shared by the school and voluntary contributions of business men. A successful program was carried out last summer and is being continued this summer. As chairman of the committee, I made a mid-year trip to Gatlinburg to see that the plans and policies were being carried out, and to aid the Director in planning for things which had come up during the year. I wrote a full report of this visit with recommendations to the committee and council. I timed my visit so that I could attend the meeting of the Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville with several members of the staff. I found time to visit all departments of the school and many of the extracurricular activities. I spent considerable time going into the various phases of the Arrow Craft business. I attended a meeting of the Weavers' Guild and one of the Parent-Teacher Associations, thus meeting many women of the community. The hospital and the farm were not neglected. A week's time is barely enough for this visit, even if the days do begin at six A.M. During the rest of the year I kept in constant communication by letter with Mrs. Weaver and less frequently with other members of the staff. At least once a month and usually more often, I wrote to the committee after we received the monthly let-ter from Mrs. Weaver. Then each member of the committee wrote to me and voted on things which needed decision. Besides this, I have kept in touch with Miss Onken whose advice is valued greatly because of her knowledge of the school and her unbounded good judgment. There has also been much general correspondence and twice during the year I have edited and mailed the Settlement School News to all officers, clubs, and chapters. I attended the Delta Province Conference as an official representative of the Fraternity and spoke on the Settlement School. During the four years that I have served on the committee, three years of that time as chairman, I have seen the high school grow from a twoto a four-year standard course, the agriculture and home economics put on Smith-Hughes vocational basis, and a new wing added to the building to take care of the increased attendance and improved program. The elementary school has also been much improved by better lighting and equipment of the rooms and by the addition of, a grade school principal. Arrow Craft has grown from a barely paying business to one paying almost $10,000 yearly profit. The Health Center has increased in efficiency, and community work has been organized to fit into the growing community life. I feel satisfied with these accomplishments, but there are other things which should be stressed for development in the near future. The addition of a crafts teacher in the high school has been planned for next year. This should be the beginning of a larger plan for making our project at Gatlinburg a crafts center of national scope. A new Arrow Craft building, for which funds have accumulated, should become a reality in another year and a plan for future development decided upon. The grade and high schools are in excellent condition and most of the expense of teachers' salaries is being taken care of by the county, the health work seems adequate for the present and near future, so the expansion of the crafts work seems the logical way for our project to grow. I do not advocate great immediate changes, but a program of gradual expansion after an exhaustive study of future possibilities has been made. It is with this idea in mind that I have accepted the Chairmanship of the Settlement School Committee for another year and I hope that a report of progress and of future possibilities along this line may be made to Grand Council and the Fraternity at the 1940 Convention. Respectfully submitted, LILLIAN B. HOLTON DID You know that most all the leading women's fraternities now have magazine agencies? This is an easy way to make money for your fraternity. Send all your magazine orders to the Pi Beta Phi Magazine Agency, Marshall, Illinois. DI THE SEPTEMBER ARROW TO OF T E H PI ETA PHI 1'' \ SETTLEMENT SCHOOL, 1938.39 1.5 Community ATLINBURG presents a new picture in this, the summer of 1939. With its four-lane highway, bordered on either side with walks, the way is made safe for pedestrians for the first time. Especially do we at the school appreciate this because of the 418 children in attendance. The Garden Club has placed rustic benches along the highway, intended as resting places for tourists. Preparation is being made for the dedication of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on June 21, at New Found Gap, with President Roosevelt as the principal speaker.. Mrs. Roosevelt will accompany the president. This will make their second visit here. Old Timers' Day is set for Saturday, June 24. This annual event with its amusing contests of longest whiskers, homeliest man, best joke, hog-calling, and many other old-time features, is the favorite occasion of the mountain people. A Regional Planning Board was organized, representing six Tennessee counties, including Sevier County, which is nearest the National Park. Its object is to assist this community in protecting its natural heritage in beauty, while growing and building. It will act in a purely advisory capacity. Mr. Medlin was chosen from Gatlinburg as one of the Sevier County representatives. The Little Theater Guild has been organized by Mr. Charles Palmer, pastor of the Methodist Church. It meets and rehearses in the school gymnasium. The Gatlinburg Business Men's Club has elected Mr. King, high school principal, as its president. The Settlement School playgrounds offering recreation for all ages, is being supervised by Mr. Price, elementary school principal. After trying this out for a part of last summer, it was pronounced one of the best things the school has undertaken. After a storm a year ago, the flood from the mountain streams did great damage to a few homes on Roarin' Fork, leaving two families destitute. The Red Cross, through the school, provided these families with all necessary supplies for two weeks and replaced some of their kitchen furnishings. The School gave the usual Christmas entertainment with a Christmas play and a distribution of stockings filled with candy. If it were not for the school's party and the Christmas boxes from Pi Phis, many of our mountain children would not know Christmas. High School The Staff William King, Principal, History, Chemistry, Coach. Ben Fleming, Mathematics, General Science. Marian Ryan, English, History, Library. William Coe, Vocational Agriculture. Rosalie Ellis, Vocational Home Economics. After being advised by the State High School Supervisor that our laboratories were too small, we were faced with the necessity of building larger and better ones and, along with this, making some minor improvements. Part of the building was made possible by the sale of a piece of land along the Little Pigeon River, owned by the Settlement School, but not adjacent to the school grounds. A wing of stone construction was built connecting the high school building with the weaving building large enough for both general science and home economics laboratories. By making certain structural changes inside the high school building, we were able to provide two new toilet rooms, two small store rooms, one off the gymnasium and one belonging to the general science room. The coat closet serving the eighth grade room was divided and one-half made into an office for Mr. Price. Vocational agriculture was given a larger class room. Another large class room was converted into a study hall-library with new tables, chairs, and a few new shelves. The whole interior was made lighter by painting walls a cream color. One hundred steel folding chairs were bought for the gymnasium, also chairs and tables for the science laboratory. The home economics laboratory was equipped throughout by the Los Angeles Club. A new removable extension was built for the stage and a panel of wood placed above the stage, filling in the open space and giving a better appearance. A gift of $300 from Mr. L. E. Voorheis made possible the installation of a stoker for the big furnace in the school heating plant. The Little Pigeon Alumnie Club presented to the library a new set of encyclopedia. Other books were sent by Pi Phis and some were bought by the school. The name "Grace Coolidge Library" on copper plate has been placed on the door. The home economics room has been named "Burton-Thomas" and the name "Voorheis Building" placed above the door of the weaving building. The high school enrollment was 111, the average daily attendance 96.2. Students living in the vicinity of Pigeon Forge had transportation on the regular bus line into Gatlinburg for the same low rate the school charged them the preceding year when using the truck. Marian Ryan, New York r, the new English teacher, met with real success in teaching and with the supervision of plays and entertainment. With the assistance of Eleanor Pack, Tennessee A, and Marjorie Chalmers, a girls' glee club was organized. This filled a long felt want on the programs of our school entertainments. High school assembly meetings which included sixth, seventh, and eighth grades had True or False contests, spelling matches, and debates. At commencement time, May 12, James Waycaster was awarded the athletic cup. The Little Pigeon Alumnie cup for the outstanding senior boy was awarded to Wayne Cardwell. The F.F.A. cup was presented to Martha Butler for being the outstanding senior girl. Elementary School Pern Price, Principal, Seventh and Eighth grades. Eleanor Brabson, First grade. Ruth Parker, Second grade. 16 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Grace Kerley, Third grade. Ruth Rowe, Fourth grade. Pauline Sharp, Fifth grade. Eleanor Pack, Sixth grade. Enrollment for the elementary school was 307, the average daily attendance 245.27, showing that the seventh teacher, granted us by the County Board, was needed. Mr. Price has been striving to bring up the sanitary rating, and this year we stood within one of the top in the Sevier County contest. The new sanitary drinking fountain and the adjustable window shades were a help in this advancement. The silver cup awarded to the school by the County Board of Health is to be seen in a case above the fireplace in the school house. Grades six, seven, and eight occupied rooms in the high school building. The elementary school accomplished many worthwhile things such as the starting of a newspaper, which later became a joint project of both elementary and high school. They had a Fall Carnival, taking in $60.00 which was later used to buy books for their library. They bought playground equipment with the proceeds from their play. Another contribution by the eighth grade was an American flag, which has just been mounted on a thirty-foot iron pole. The P.T.A. organization has been stronger financially than ever before. Bulah Lowe took charge of cooking and serving the hot lunch in the children's lunch room. Ruth Rowe and Ruth Parker were councilors for the Girl Scouts. A play was given by them and a foimal tea at the Teachers' Cottage. They are trying to get enough money to fit up a room in the grade school basement as a place for Scout use. Mr. Price was Scout Master for the Boy Scouts. They will camp at Lake Norris the last week of June. Home Economics Rosalie Ellis, teacher. We were successful in having home economics made vocational the past year, and consequently we were granted state aid for 50 per cent of the teacher's salary. In moving the department into its new quarters, much of the old equipment had to be discarded. A few things were sold. Into the new attractive laboratory with native wood finish and excellent lighting were built kitchen cabinets in such a way as to form five small kitchenettes. Jessie Harris, of University of Tennessee Home Economics department, working with the architect, Charles Barber, made the plans and assigned to a class in the U.T. summer school, the project of planning our equipment. The five new tables and the twenty-four chairs to match were made by native craftsmen, the chairs finished by the students. The curtains were woven by native weavers. As a result, we have a laboratory which the State High School Supervisor, L. E. Derthick, the State Supervisor of Home Economics, Margaret Brouder, and the East Tennessee Supervisor of Home Economics, Miss Herne, are referring to as a model. One new electric sewing machine, one electric cookstove, and one new oil cookstove were added. Rosalie Ellis, Home Economics teacher, carried out her regular yearly program. The Settlement School Chairman and I enjoyed being entertained for luncheon one day in March by the freshmen. We members of the staff had an example of cooking at Christmas time when we were invited to a fine Christmas dinner. This was followed by a stunt program. Again they showed good training in serving dinner for the Father and Son Banquet for the Future Farmers. This occasion proved the convenience of having the science and home economics laboratories adjoining, so that both rooms can be thrown together for community affairs. At the University of Tennessee open house, one of our girls was asked to model a dress of her own making, at the style show. Twice at high school assembly the girls exhibited their dress-making. Agriculture William Coe, Teacher. Ambers Ogle, Farmer. Vocational agriculture has thrived and Mr. Coe has continued his work with great enthusiasm, though he was disappointed at the beginning of the year that there were not enough farm-minded juniors to institute a third-year class. However, there were twenty-two boys in the freshman class and sixteen made up the second year class. Every-thing possible is done to keep up a lively interest in farm work. First in importance of these are the evening classes held in the rural communities where the fathers and brothers of these students gather during the winter months to study farm problems. Dormitory students are given as nearly as possible the kind of farm work they like best to do. Their products were exhibited at the county fair and prizes won on poultry, hogs, Jersey cattle, garden products, and shop work. When the time came for "slaughtering" for the purpose of class demonstration, our entire family was interested. We enjoyed some very good meat as the result. Many snow white chickens adorned the hillside. There were 120 layers and 800 broilers. The F.F.A. organization is quite important to the farmer boys and our chapter has been very active the past year. Their activities included a special basketball team, which won the fifth district championship, a public speaking contest, an experiment with renting an extra acre of land for potatoes, hybrid seed corn production, parties including the home economics girls, and last, the Parent and Son Banquet which was an innovation for the F.F.A.'s. It proved to be such a pleasant occasion that it will be given annually hereafter. Although it was not absolutely required by the Vocational agriculture program, Mr. Coe went once a week to CCC Camp Morgan to teach a class of boys who formerly lived on farms Arrow Craft Ethel Snow, Manager. The Shops: Georgia Duffield, Ava Clabo, Edna McCarter. Weaving Building: Gene Redding, Lura Owen-by. Arrow Craft shows steady growth and Mrs. Ethel Snow calls attention to the fact that in the last five years the ninety-seven clubs, fifteen shops THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 17 and two active chapters which were purchasers have increased to 121 clubs, thirty-five shops, and thirteen active chapters. Business from these and the growing tourist trade have increased the profits by $7,863.64. Arrow Craft stood third highest among the Craft Centers in the amount of stock sold to Southern Highlanders, Inc. We think the Convention's visit to the school last summer stimulated an interest in Arrow Craft products among active chapters. The new wine and blue scarfs designed by a Chicago alumna, have been much admired by chapters. Because of the World's Fairs, Miss Redding has curtailed some-what her production for the coming season, feeling that we may have less tourist trade. Price tags and stickers of new design have been ordered for fall. The fall price list will mention among its new things carved animals. The Basket Room which is the front room of the Arrow Craft shop and used only in summer because of the difficulty in heating, has had some new cup-boards and shelves added this spring. The bright-colored woven paper curtains are a curiosity to the customers. The Weaver's Guild has been active. Their monthly meeting programs had a variety of subjects such as making their home surroundings at-tractive by planting flowers around the mail boxes and other conspicuous places. Mr. Coe lectured to them twice on poultry raising. They have started a new play. The annual picnic, held at the Chimneys Camp ground, and their Christmas celebration were their highlights of the season. They have had occasion to make use, many times, of the loan fund started three years ago, for having eyes examined and glasses fitted. Miss Redding, assisted by Lura Owenby, inaugurated a six weeks' course in weaving for the sophomore girls as a part of home economics. Because of the large number of girls for the number of looms we have, the time was extended several weeks longer. Mrs. Duffield, in the branch shop in the Mountain View Hotel, wove more of her famous Afghans than ever before during the quiet winter months. Despite her eighty-one years, Aunt Lizzy Reagan still comes to the loom room to weave and tells all visitors, "You'uns must hurry back." Glenna Reagan has been added to the shop personnel for the summer season. Jennie Nichol Health Center Marjorie Chalmers, Nurse. The Health Center has carried on its work unchanged except that we no longer have the monthly visits of Dr. Mayberry, the dentist. He moved away some months ago, and no one has yet been found to take his place. Marjorie Chalmers, our nurse for the past three years, emphasizes her statements in her last re-port, that the modern trend here swings more and more toward preventive measures people learning to stay well rather than suffer illness that might be avoided with proper care. So, in making the school examinations, great emphasis is laid on the correction of defects. The best inducements we have ever had for the encouragement of these corrections is the "Blue Ribbon Contest." In March the County Board of Health awarded the silver cup once more to our school for showing the highest percentage of healthy children. The Settlement School had won four times, three in succession, which assured us of the permanent possession of the cup. This year, as usual, we received hospital sup-plies and aid. These included a generous check from Florida A, dressings from Washington Club and the Junior Alumnae of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, baby clothes from Indiana A, night-clothes from the Elgin Club, and diapers from Helen Bagley, Philadelphia. These have been given out when necessary, and sickroom supplies have been loaned. We rely on the nurse's list of needy families for the distribution of Christmas baskets which contain provisions and toys. A new bedroom was built onto the back of the hospital and two rooms were painted white. An-other improvement was cement bases under the log bridge in the hospital yard. The following statistics indicate, the activity of the health department.

Belle Lowe, Lura Hurst, Cooks. Mertie Ogle, Laundress. Arlie Watson, Superintendent Grounds. Our home life has been slightly different the past year because of the division of rooming quarters. With three of the women on the staff living at the Hospital, three with the girls in the dormitory and eight in the Teachers' Cottage, the group as a whole has not been together as much as formerly. However, this rooming plan was generally considered a more comfortable arrangement. Annette Morse, Illinois A, has fitted into the family in truly motherly fashion. Evening study hour has been supervised by staff members in turn. Our seven girls and eight dormitory boys have taken the lead in Baptist Young People's Union. The bathroom in the Teachers' Cottage was made into two. This was paid for out of the fund contributed by the Los Angeles Club for improvements in the Teachers' Cottage. At the time grading was done on the highway, we managed to have our telephone wire leading to the office put under ground. The business office with Frances Brown's second year as bookkeeper has been well managed, ac-counting for all departments promptly by the calendar. One day a month the office looks like a press room while the students are using the mimeograph and getting out the Arrow News. There were times when funds got low, but the guardian angel or the Pi Phi spirit appeared just in time by the route of the Settlement School Treasurer. We were very happy when informed 1.8 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW cii for its help at all times, and all Pi Phis for their faithful ,support through another year. Respectfully submitted, EUNICE S. WEAVER that Lillian Holton would continue as Chairman of the Settlement School Committee another year. I want to thank the Committee for its ever thoughtful attention to our needs, Grand Coun VOCATIONAL AG All Day Classes THIS year's enrollment in this group reached the number of thirty-seven high school boys. Two classes were taught to the boys in vocational agriculture. One of these classes consisted of twenty-one freshman boys and the other was made up of sixteen sophomore and junior boys. We had planned to teach three units in vocational agriculture, but due to the lack of students for this class, we had to combine the second and third year boys. It is expected that next year we will be able to offer a third class in vocational agriculture. This year we had twenty-seven of the thirty-seven be-ginning boys complete the entire school year. These twenty-seven boys are at present carrying on very complete supervised farming programs. Evening School Classes Two night schools were conducted in two rural communities for those men who are established in the business of farming. One of these evening schools was held in the Laurel Grove community, which is located seventeen miles from the Settlement School. The other evening school class was held at the Laurel Lick community school house, which is located eleven miles from here. I had one class meeting in each community every week. These meetings numbered fourteen in the Laurel Lick community and twelve in the Laurel Grove district. The night school classes were held in the late fall and winter months. This time was chosen because the farmers have more leisure time at that season than at any other time of year. The course of study used in each community was somewhat different because this was my second year of teaching evening school classes in the Laurel Grove community. The courses were based on soil conservation, feeding problems, and breeding of livestock. This part of my school work I consider very inter-. esting. In these groups lots of interest was shown and farmers are now using some of the improved practices they have learned of in our discussions. Each of these communities has expressed a desire to have these classes continued next winter. Day Unit Classes This year for the first time the State Department of Education has asked the agriculture teachers to work with the rural elementary school teachers in getting teaching material for the elementary student to study in order that he or she may deter-mine more easily what occupation to decide upon so that upon entering high school, subjects may be selected accordingly. This work I have done in the two rural communities. The teaching of agriculture to 'students in the elementary schools as a subject, has been practically eliminated by the State Department of Education. Part-Time Classes This year one class is being taught to such a group at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. One class is taught every Wednesday night. The course is based on vegetable gardening and poultry. The boys each have small gardens and as a group they have produced one hundred fifty-eight pullets and cockerels. The enrollment in this class has been from twenty-four to thirty boys who formerly lived on farms. These boys are mostly Sevier County boys. One of them was a student of mine who dropped out of our school a year ago. The F.F.A. Chapter The Future Farmer chapter has just completed what we think of as being a very successful year. The interest has been high in this organization and the boys have been able to do things through cooperation. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the school: 1. Showing dairy cattle at County Fair. 2. Exhibiting farm products, farm shop work, and poultry at the County Fair. 3. Sponsored F.F.A. and home economics socials. 4. Livestock and dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee. (Pi Phi placed fifth in livestock judging among sixty-eight chapters, and twentieth in dairy cattle judging.) 5. Sponsored Parent and Son banquet. 6. Public speaking contest at the university. 7. F.F.A. baseball and basketball teams. (Our Future Farmer basketball team won the Fifth district championship. Fifth district consist ing of eleven counties.) 8. Presentation of the F.F.T. cup to the best all-round high school girl. 9. Two new boys are making plans to enter hybrid seed corn production. 10. We have rented one acre of land in which we. are growing Irish potatoes. The work thus far is being done by the boys. 11. "The Endless Pig Chain," a method which we hope will improve the breeding stock of our surrounding communities. 12. Four high school boys and I attended the State Convention of Future Farmers of America of the Tennessee Association held at Nashville on April 28, 29, and 30. The School Farm This year we had eight boys in the dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took vocational agriculture. Those boys who selected agriculture as one of their courses were given work on the farm and the others were given the janitor work. The farm boys were given charge of the enterprise which they liked, such as dairy cattle, hogs or poultry. In this resoect the school farm is very valuable for teaching purposes. This seemed to work very successfully in that the boys like their jobs and, naturally, do better work. Last fall our ICULTU E TEACHE THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 19 Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products exhibiting at the Fair all placed well. We made $12.00 above expenses on our Jerseys and won Grand Champion-ship again with one of them. This year we have increased our laying flock and decreased our broilers. We have 120 layers and 800 broilers. Eggs were incubated to produce this year's pullets for replacements of culls in the laying flock next fall. Ten of our pigs were fed to market weight on corn, tankage, and pasture. Two of these hogs were slaughtered by classes, used as class demonstration and then sold to our kitchen. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following data: Date Sold to Kitchen Farm Expense Farm Receipts July $ 201.20 $ 347.37 $125.68 August 189.83 181.08 27.48 Sept 163.37 140.81 48.99 Oct 160.65 125.31 72.25 Nov 151.14 112.58 23.75 Dec 115.50 136.38 19.30 Jan 131.40 200.56 90.32 Feb 159.72 251.05 11.10 March 131.54 270.81 43.56 April 126.60 215.25 146.80 Totals .. $1,570.95 $1,981.20 $609.23 Sold to kitchen plus cash income: $2,180.18. Total income less the expense: $199.98. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM COE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR NEXT YEAR 1. Naturally, my interest is in my department and I would like to see farm boys living in our dormitory. 2. It is an absolute necessity that we have a mowing machine and there is very definite need for a disc harrow. 3. There is a need for a cheap work shop for agriculture boys, to provide sufficient space. 4. I merely suggest that the barn and farm build ings be painted this year, if possible. WILLIAM COE P INCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO 1., T N THE entered opening the n building, looked last around fall onfe boy minute and exclaimed, "My, this place has certainly had its face lifted. You would have to be awfully dumb not to be able to learn here now." This seemed to be the general opinion of most of the students. The new wing connecting the high school building with the weaving building had just been completed. This, with the many other changes, made the place look entirely different. The new wing with its knotty white pine walls, white ceilings, and large windows, houses the home economics and laboratories. A general rearrangement of the whole building was made to use the space to better advantage. A portion of the large room now used as an agriculture class room was cut off to make two very badly needed storerooms. One of these is the science storeroom and the other for general storage. A new storeroom for the gymnasium solved the problem of storing the chairs and benches during basketball season. A new extension to the stage was built in the form of three tables which were bolted together. One partition was removed to make an office for Mr. Price and another to enlarge a classroom. Part of the open court between the gymnasium and the side wings was converted into toilets for the grade school. The entire interior of the high school was painted a light cream, which helped the lighting wonderfully. A great deal of new equipment was purchased, including one hundred metal auditorium chairs, sixty library and classroom chairs, ten combination science and classroom tables, eight library tables, and one teacher's desk. A class of graduate students at the University of Tennessee made a study of our home economics needs as a class project. They made out a detailed list of the needed equipment with the cost and where it could be obtained. This made the job of selecting and buying the new equipment a much easier task. Teaching Staff The high school teaching staff was composed of William King, principal, history and science; W. S. Coe, vocational agriculture; Rosalie Ellis, vocational home economics; Ben Fleming, science and mathematics; and Marian Ryan, English, history, and library. Miss Ryan was the only new member of the staff, and she proved to be one of the best first year teachers that we have ever had. She went about her work from the beginning like a veteran. Mr. Coe and Mr. Fleming both did fine work, although Mr. Fleming was handicapped by bad health this year. Miss Ellis seemed like a different person altogether this year. She seemed so proud of her new department, took so much more interest in her work, and showed a general all-round improvement. The group meetings of the vocational home economics teachers seemed to in-spire her to greater efforts. Curriculum Changes Vocational home economics was substituted for non-vocational home economics and French was dropped from the course of study this year. A third year course in agriculture was offered, but when only four third year boys elected to take it they were combined with the second year class. The freshman class had to be divided into sections because of its size. This added three classes to the schedule. Testing and Guidance A. standard testing program was started with the first year group this year. A standard intelligence test was given the first week of school, and this was followed by an achievement test. These tests were repeated near the end of school to check their accuracy and to measure the progress during the school year, and for comparison with other schools. It is hoped that as more elective subjects are put into the curriculum, a worthwhile guidance pro-gram can be set up. A follow-up program for the high school graduates is taking shape with the idea 20 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW of giving advice and encouragement to graduates. (Of the fourteen graduates last year, six entered college, three finished the first year, three were married, one entered nurses' training, two entered business schools, and three are employed in hotel work.) Extracurricular Activities Due to poor health Mr. Fleming was unable to coach basketball this year. From a standpoint of games won and lost the basketball season was not as successful as for the past few years, but nearly every boy in high school played on one of the three teams sponsored by the school. The Future Farmers team won the district basketball tournament. The F.F.A. and Home Economics Clubs were especially active this year. They gave numerous parties and chapel programs, and the F.F.A. gave a Father and Son banquet with about forty parents present. The junior class gave the play "Murdered Alive" last fall and the seniors gave the comedy "Crashing Society" in April. Miss Ryan coached both of these plays and showed much artistry in stage setting and decoration. The glee club held regular meetings and under the direction of Miss Ryan and Miss Pack furnished the music for the commencement programs. Commencement Rev. Charles Palmer, pastor of the Gatlinburg Methodist Church, preached the baccalaureate sermon, and Dr. A. M. Philips delivered the commencement address. Nine seniors received diplomas.

The new addition connects the high school with the weaving building and has been designed to fit in with the architecture of the other two buildings. The finishing of the interior was under the supervision of Miss Jessie Harris, Dean of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. Under her direction equipment was purchased which would be in keeping with the surroundings here in Gatlinburg. There is one large room which is used for clothing and recitation classes. Connecting this are five unit kitchens, each equipped with built-in cabinets, sink, work table, and stove. The walls are of knotty pine, and excellent lighting facility is afforded by large expanses of windows which begin at the ceiling and go to within a few feet of the floor. Arrow Craft did its part by contributing gaily-colored handwoven curtains, which were especially designed by Miss Redding and made by the sophomore home economics class. In these surroundings is it any wonder that our year has been a most happy and successful one? In the first year home economics class twenty-seven girls were enrolled. These girls were instructed in personal grooming, the fundamentals of clothing, planning and serving breakfast and lunch, child care, and selection and care of furnishing for -the home. The girls made smocks, pajamas, and simple cotton dresses in class. After they completed the study of breakfast and lunch, they served meals to members of the faculty. In the second year class there was an enrollment of eighteen girls. These girls spent the first two weeks in finishing the chairs for the new depart ment. This gave them practical experience and at the same time helped to complete decoration of the new department. These girls were instructed in food preservation, making of a wool and a silk dress ; planning, preparation, and serving dinners ; and budgets. Miss Redding gave the class a six weeks' course in weaving. She taught the girls how to set up a loom and the fundamentals of weaving. The home economics girls gave a Christmas dinner for all members of the staff. The sophomore class planned, prepared, and served the dinner, while the freshman girls made the decorations and provided the entertainment. This spring the girls prepared and served a banquet for the F.F.A. boys and their parents. This was given in the new science laboratory because of its convenience to the kitchen. Because of our new department and equipment we are now able to have vocational home economics. The girls have projects which are done in the home under the supervision of the teacher. The girls derive much practical experience from them. Keen interest was shown by the girls in all their project work. The Home Economics Club had fifty members. The club belongs to the State and National Home Economics Student Club Association. During the year it gave four parties for the F.F.A. boys. Two style shows were given by the girls in assembly. Besides the home economics class, I taught general science, one eight weeks' course of adult teaching, planned the school lunches, and supervised the girls with home projects. Respectfully submitted, ROSALIE ELLIS THE SEPTEMBER ARROW HOUSE MANAGE 21 SCHOOL started a little late this year, as the new building was not finished in time for the students, and I was still later, owing to a marriage in the family. I found things going very smoothly, thanks to Mrs. Weaver, with the able assistance of Bess Mc-Carter and Belle Lowe. Our cooks have changed several times during the year, Bess McCarter leaving for a better position, Mrs. Phillips taking her place until the first of April, when. Lura Hurst took Mrs. Phillips' place. We had eight boys and seven girls till the first of November, when another girl came to us, making sixteen students to care for. The boys and girls made good grades and on the whole have been very happy. As to my work I have given them three meals a day; some they have praised and some they have not approved of as to their variety. I have made sheets, pillow cases, aprons, dish towels, and curtains, and have mended endlessly those that were here. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE WEAVING DEPA i'' TMENT T HE weaving department has been running along on about the same schedule and general plan as in the past three years. It has proven to be, a satisfactory and workable system for the number of weavers we employ and amount of weaving they can do. The weavers have become so expert in the handling of their looms that rather than encourage them to rush their work, we now have to limit the time in which they can have warps to three weeks, as the minimum time for each one. In the past year we have added no new weavers, but two new necktie makers. The necktie business has grown to be one of our most important and one of our all year round items. Four weavers and seven sewers are kept busy nearly all the time on this one thing. Since this is not convention year, we have had a lessened weaving program for this spring. With the tourist competition provided by the World's Fairs, I have proceeded cautiously in weaving up a large supply for the summer trade. As is always true, from a production standpoint, it is almost impossible to predict just how much stock to make, which colors will be in demand six months after the articles are made, and how large the stock should be to provide adequately for a business that is approximately 50% consignment. From my observations over a period of years, it is necessary to weave at least 33% extra to carry on a consignment business than we would for an entirely cash business. The six weeks' course in weaving that was given to the sophomore girls as a part of their home economics class had its good and bad points. It gave us an opportunity to say, that we were teaching weaving in the high school. With a few ex ceptions the girls were interested in the work, but I felt that the lasting benefit they derived from it was practically nothing. The time was so short that by the time they made a warp and set up the looms they were able to weave only two small pieces. When we gave them an opportunity to come in and do more weaving, only a few of them came. Two girls failed to finish from lack of interest. From my own personal standpoint in relation to my Arrow Craft work, I found that it delayed my spring work of starting new projects. This was not such a serious set-back this particular year ,due to our reduced weaving program. In convention year it would work a real hardship on us. Because there were eighteen girls in the 'class, we divided them into groups of twos to set up the looms, then each group of nine had their weaving on the nine looms. This meant that instead of running the class six weeks, we had, it nine weeks., A larger class would make it run correspondingly longer, unless we have more looms. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDOING My recommendations for another year would be to have the weaving an elective subject in the junior and senior years with a minimum of half a school year required. If we have an arts and crafts set-up, either that instructor or the home economics teacher could take over the class. I would be willing to act in a supervisory capacity. I would also recommend that the ceilings of the weaving building be painted white and that the lights be increased and inverted. WINOGENE REDDING A OW C Is' AFT CRAFT SHOP has gone along with hardly a ripple the past year. There has been no change in personnel, only very minor repairs, and a goodly amount of business. Within the month, as the number of visitors warrant, one more girl will be put on for the summer. That will allow us to keep the main shop open in the evenings and give Miss Georgia some assistance in the Hotel Shop. One of this year's graduates has been chosen for that job, Glenna Reagan. She had the highest average in her class and wants to go on to school next year. Edna McCarter and Ava Clabo have been in-valuable during the past year. The public likes them and they were untiring all through shipping. The stone fence in front of Arrow Craft had to be taken down for the new highway. This high-way is on a lower level than the old so three stone steps make it easier for the approaching customer. The roof of the old part of the building was painted an unobtrusive gray to tone in better with the rest of the roof. Some removable cup-boards and shelves have taken the place of the rough open shelves in the basket room nearest the 22 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW aighway. That helps the looks of that room as well is being a better protection for the stock. Ihere are to be new price tags and stickers to go out with the Fail things. 'I hey are to cost less and will be an improvement I hope. Also there is to be a woven label to sew into the neckties. Figures are usually boresome but I think these are very interesting and should prove that Arrow Craft has not stood still but has forged ahead considerably in the past four years. My first report for 1934-35, which includes the first six months of my work with Arrow Craft, states that we did business with 97 clubs, 15 shops, and 2 active chapters. This year there were 121 clubs, 35 shops, and 13 active chapters. That year we made a profit of $2,992.04. The profit at the present date of the current year is $10,855.91, and with two more months yet to go in the fiscal year the figure should reach four times that of the 1934.-35 profit. The inventories have naturally crept up also but not in so large a ratio. The Hotel Shop was $597.07 in 1935 and $908.56 this April 30; the Weaving Supplies $2,928.53 and now $5,273.64; and Arrow Craft $13,536.76 against $6,874.06 in 1935, not quite double. The ratio of Club Sales to those from other sources still remains about half and half. But you will remember that it was 75% Club Sales in 1935. The most interesting cash sale of the year just past was for over $600 for curtains for the bedrooms of the Mountain View Hotel. The most outstanding Club Sale was by Mrs. Williams of Portland, Oregon. One hundred and ninety-two of our Whig Rose doilies are to be used in the nicest tea room in that city. The first year that Southern Highlanders, Inc., came into existence we sold them $724.58. So far this year it has amounted to $1,942.24. That same year, 1935-36, Allanstand bought $331.53. This year it is already $1,748.63. Since we have given them 25% discount the same as Southern Highlanders, Inc., they pay cash in ten days. Southern Highlanders does the same and no longer takes things on consignment. Spring vacationers were along as usual. There may not have been so many this year but they were very kind to us with their purchases. With two Fairs going on we can only hope that there will not be too great a difference in the amount of our summer sales. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL M. SNOW PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL-REPO T ON AUDIT OF TREASURER'S ACCOUNTS YEA EN ED JUNE 30, 1939 August 30, 1939 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Office of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the treasurer of your committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, public accountants, from the books kept for the school and its Arrow Craft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1939 and the in-come and expenses for the fiscal year, subject to the extent of our own verification, which as indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from club and chapter contributions which are shown in de-tail in Schedule 3-a and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the treasurer. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verified by us. The endowment securities and cash were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustees' report was accepted without further verification except that we proved the accounting made of security changes and in-come from securities. COMMENTS Cash Balances $24,374.78 The cash balances at June 30, 1939 consisted of the following: Milwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's general checking ac count $ 6,713.83 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,019.67 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank General check ing account 18.55 Sevier County Bank House account 268.70 Gatlinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank General Check ing account 2,059.51 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 4,000.00 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 5,214.52 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 5,025.00 Petty Cash Funds Gatlinburg 55.00 Total $24,374.78 Accounts Receivable $5,377.45 The accounts receivable arising from Arrow Craft sales were listed in detail in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company; it appeared that they consisted principally of alumnae club balances and were considered by your employees to be generally collectible: Accounts of $516.04 were charged off as bad debts during the year under review. Inventories $21,939.95 The inventories at Gatlinburg, which we did THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 2 3 not verify, totaled $21,939.95 as compared to $22,602,83 at the close of the previous year. The 'inventory apparently consists to a great extent of finished stock, the supplies and materials amounting to $4,844.53. Fixed Assets During the year under review additions of $7,041.32 were made to the school and Arrow Craft plants. These additions are shown in Schedule 2, the largest item being the laboratory addition to the school house upon which $5,515.34 was expended bringing the total cost of the addition to $5,685.34. The special building fund created in 1938 for this purpose was used to pay for this construction. A stoker was purchased at a cost of $485.00 and, as shown in Exhibit "C," contributions of $314.00 were received toward this specific expenditure. The balance of equipment and remodeling expenditures were made from current income. Depreciation charged off on the books and included in expenses amounted to $2,746.45. Income and ExPenses Income of the Settlement School proper exceeded expenses for the year 1938-1939 by $1,503.53. The operating expenses included depreciation of $2,746.45 mentioned above but not expenditures for new equipment and building additions which were capitalized in the asset ac-counts. A considerable portion of the depreciation is attributable to the Arrow Craft plant. This net income of $1,503.53 was $4,135.73 less than the corresponding amount for 1937-1938 as shown in Exhibit "C" but this difference was attributable almost entirely to the special contributions such as the Beta Alumnx Fund, cook-book fund, and other bequests received in the prior year. The Arrow Craft Shop earned a net income of $8,879.45 for the year over all expenses, including losses on bank accounts and bad debts of $1,967.99, as shown in Exhibit "D." Before deduction of these special losses the net income of $10,847.44 showed a gain of $1,701.17 over the previous year. The combined net income of the School and Arrow Craft Shop amounted to $10,382.98 of which $1,578.64, representing three-fourths of active chapter contributions, was appropriated to the endowment fund leaving $8,804.34 added to general surplus. Endowment Funds The endowment fund was augmented by the appropriation decreased by a net loss on sale of bonds of $40.00 so that required endowment balance showed the net increase of $1,538.64 to a total of $42,771.25. This balance is represented by cash and securities of $37,174.39 plus a debt of $5,596.86 due from current onerating funds, This temporary debt to the endowment fund was reduced by $3,500.00 during the year 1938-1939. Transfers from current funds of this amount were made to the endowment trustees, $1,000.00 being remitted from the Treasurer's general funds and $2,500.00 from the Arrow Craft funds.
