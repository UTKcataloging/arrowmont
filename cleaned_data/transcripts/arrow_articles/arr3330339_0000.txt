He had been there since July, 1915, and is now a junior in high school. He made a visit to Tennessee in August. He is nineteen years old "and we think a great deal of him." (Elder Monroe Ogle.)

"I would be glad to have my change of address noted in THE ARROW with the statement that I would be so glad to have any Pi THE NEWEST CRUSADE 339 Phis going to or from the Settlement School stop with us. I believe they all have to go through Knoxville to reach it. I am hoping to visit Gatlinburg soon and see the new house. Mrs. Dissosway is located at 1933 West Cumberland Avenue, Knoxville, Tenn. Mrs. Helmick would like to hear from all Pi Phis who wish to offer their services to the Settlement School during the coming year. All pledges to the Settlement School for 1917 will be due on March 31, to Mrs. E. A. Helmick, Fort Sam Houston, Texas.
