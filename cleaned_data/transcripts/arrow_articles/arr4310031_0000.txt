        30 ARRow ov PI BETA Pu t its personnel is : Blanche Charlton Curtis, past Kappa Province Vice President, chairman ; Olive Keller Laurence, retiring Grand Vice President ; Kathleen Little, past Theta Province Vice President and representative of the New York Alumnae Club, and Genevieve Herrick Smith, Eta Province Vice President. The Grand Council formulated a recommendation for this committee, carrying out a suggestion made by the present Alumna? Editor : That it consider the advisability, following the emning Convention, of making the Alumme Editor a member of the ARROW Staff only, rather than a national officer, and of making the Assistant to the Grand Vice President a member of Convention and secretary to the alumme sessions. A motion carried that a committee composed of the Grand President, the Grand Vice President and the Assistant to the Grand Vice President work out the constitutional changes concerning the Alurnnm Department which were authorized by the 1925 Convention. The Grand Council also voted that this committee be instructed to formulate constitutional changes which would allow the election of one member of the Settlement School Committee at each Convention by the Alumme Department. Business relative to the next Convention was given general consideration and as many tentative plans were made for its con-duct as was possible. While no location was definitely decided upon as a meeting place, Yellowstone Park was believed to be the most acceptable one, and in all probability, providing further investigation proves favorable, the 1927 meeting of the fraternity will convene there. A motion carried to the effect that, in order to conserve time for legislative matters, the time limit, with one or two exceptions, upon the reports read at Convention, shall be placed at five minutes. At the close of the Grand Council Meeting, the Grand President formally installed Emilie Margaret White, Columbia A, as Grand Vice President. It was voted that the appointment of the new Assistant to the Grand Vice President be left with the Grand Vie President. At the conclusion of general planning for the constructive work and the chapter visits of Grand Officers for 1926-1927, the annual meeting of the Grand Council adjourned. FRANCESE EVANS IVES, Grand Secretary. SETTLEMENT .SCHOOL REPORTS 31 THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE At the close of this my third year as chairman of the Settlement School Committee of Pi Beta Phi, I am happy to express again to you my appreciation for the privilege of serving on the committee of an altruistic work second to none maintained by a National Panhellenic fraternity. Each year's service upon the committee has greatly strengthened the feeling that it' each individual member of Pi Beta Phi would avail herself of the opportunity of visiting the School she could not resist the temptation to become a 'more active worker for such a wonderful undertaking. My sole desire, as chairman of this work, has been the furtherance of the interest of the School, taking into consideration the necessities of the communities involved and the benefit to both the fraternity and the people with whom we come in contact. It has never been my desire to spend money foolishly in the advancement of new ideas, but to secure the best results with the least expenditure possible, considering the School, the demands upon it and the advancement of our ideals. The committee fully appreciates the amount of work that the different clubs and chapters necessarily must have done in order to raise their annual donations and for that reason, if for none other, 'we have tried to the best of our ability to expend the funds wisely. As an ex-ample of our economical handling of funds let me cite the fact that while the donations this year have been considerably less than those of last year, and, while having to subtract from this year's balance the sum pledged to the building fund last year, together with this year's pledge, our total with which to start the work next year is greater than that of last year. In other words, last year's balance should have shown $2,000 less, and our balance of this year would have read $2,000 more. I feel that this year has been most successful, financially and in every other way, with all our bills paid and those practically when due. With the consent of Grand Council our committee met this year while School was in session. We fee] most grateful for the privilege granted to us of seeing the organization in action. The information that each committee member obtained was invaluable and will bear marked results in the future. The organization for next year is about complete. There are some few changes but on the whole everything remains the same, Last year the School opened at its usual time, but owing to the fact that the summer hotels run prosperously through September, our attendance is not what we wish it to be, so that we do not deem it advisable to open school this year in August. 32 THE ARROW 05 Pi BETA PHI. Too much praise cannot be given to the staff, as each in her way was a valuable aid to the School and the cooperation, no matter how strenuous the effort may have been at times, was most praiseworthy. We are happy to announce that Miss Bishop will continue as Head Resident. Among her assets is her most unusual personality and her ability to mix and mingle with the p;'ople of every locality. This alone, if she did nothing else, would make her invaluable to the School. How-ever, the committee feels that she serves capably and well, and their personal contact with her has given them full confidence in her ability and good sense to handle any task. I shall again incorporate her re-port, as she can give you the details in a more concise form than I can. It is my earnest desire that you read her report in full, so that you may become better acquainted with the inner workings of the School. REPORT OF 'BEAD RESIDENT FOR THE YEAR 1925-1926 In making a report for the past year 1 wish to preface it by saying that in many ways it has been a most successful year, each one has been anxious to make improvements over the year previous. But I want to add a regret, too, that because of the circumstances in connection with the annual meeting of last year, some of the large things we had planned are impossible of accomplishment. The work from day to .day went on in a most satisfactory manner, school spirit was excellent, community cooperation better than ever be-fore and a splendid staff to carry on. Only we who were looking further than this year or next felt anxious to be taking up the larger progress we had in mind. However, the enforced wait may find us more ready for it this year. The staff has been as follows: Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident Phyllis Higinbotham, Nurse Harmo Taylor, Asst. to the nurse Margaret White, Departmental work, 7th-Sth and high school. Marion Folsom, Departmental work, 7th-Sth and high school Lois Rogers, 5th and 6th grades Elmer Watson, 3d and 4th grades athletic coach Helen Barrett, Primer, 1st and 2d grades Jean Steele, Domestic Science O. J. Mattil, Agriculture and community work Winogene Redding, Weaving school and community Helen Chew, Sugarlands School adult work Mrs. Dora Chapin, House mother girls' dormitory Lizzie Reagan, Cook and helper, teachers' cottage Mrs. Ownby, Cook, girls' dormitory Mrs. McCarter, Cook, boys' dormitory Leander McCarter, Firing furnaces, farm and general work SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS a Owing to the kind of work Miss Chew was doing it seemed wis for her to take her vacation in January and February instead of dui ing the summer as she was away nearly three months. Helen Barrett was compelled to go home the last month of schoc because of sickness. Her place was taken by Ann Clabo, one of our lc cal girls. Mrs. Dowell did not take any time off during the summer, so a Christmas went home for a month. Several clubs asked to have he stop over on her way back and it seemed worth while to accept thei invitations. She spoke to five clubs and chapters as well as some othe clubs. Jean Steele left us at Christmas time to enter college again an Barbara Dewell left college at that time to come back here, a Kapp arrangement for both girls and one that has not handicapped the Schoc any. Mrs. Chapin came back this year with the understanding that sli might have to leave before Christmas. MY mother was glad to finis the school year. While she has done much for the girls they have don worlds for her that she and I will never forget. The state is always most willing to give us any aid possible an has sent a number of advisors and visitors to the different department of the school. With the country opening up so much for tourists have a great many callers and people who are anxious to see the weary ing and baskets and the School. Last summer we felt sure that never would be wise again to open school as early as August 1. The oh er pupils were working at the hotels so were compelled to enter school month late, but the greatest reason for making the change was the we were deluged with visitors in the School. Of course it will be problem to keep the boys and girls in school longer in the spring, 131 we feel there is no doubt but that we must make this change. SCHOOL : The feeling among those who have been here the lunge is that the School has shown more growth and improvement this yei than in any other year of its history. There is no question about the growth in numbers. We have 11 an enrollment of 152 this year against 129 last year. This increase wl due in a large measure to many pupils coming from Cartertown, whe one of the county schools was a help. Running the truck a mile and half night and morning gave the little folks from Cartertown a chan to be in school every day and they surely took advantage of it. Whi the county did not give us any aid for transportation they did increa our monthly allowance $45.00 per month, which more than paid t] expenses of running the truck for those pupils. Another great improv meat in school has been the regular attendance. With so few chang in the teaching staff the year opened more easily and it was possit to do more constructive work. The question of discipline is never very hard one so there was little trouble in that line. The county ga eight months of free school this year, which was a great help in keepi: 34 THE ARROW Or PT BETA Pin the boys and girls during the spring term as well as helping us tinancially. The 7th, Sth and high school had nine months of school. Increase in enrollment next year is going to depend much on whether or not we have room to accommodate more. With any out-side school coming in the lower grades will be affected and they are now the over-crowded ones. Forty-five in the primary room has been almost impossible this. year and we can now count twenty little folks coming into that room another year with only ten going out. If no other school came in those grades might be carried by one teacher and a local girl as assistant, but I would not advise it. At any rate there would have to be a place to put them. Helen Barrett had splendid success with the little ones and even though she was compelled to go home at the beginning of the last month I feel that her pupils had the equivalent of a full year. The last month Ann Claho taught those grades and with very good results. Emily Burton writes that she is ready to come back again next year if we still want her and I am sure there is no doubt of that. Helen Barrett is very much interested in the Laurel Lick school, but. that is all so uncertain now we have no idea what may open up. The domestic science, agriculture and weaving departments have been carried on very successfully this year. The great gain that I feel has been made in the school is -due to a great extent to the cooperation among the teachers. While each room or each department is separate, to quite an extent, there is a sympathetic understanding among the teachers that does make for a good school and real development. The teachers are doing good, conscientious work and deserve a great deal of commendation for what they have accomplished. HIGH ScHou: The third year was added to the high school course this year. We have not been able to get an inspector out this year so are not yet on the accredited list. The County Superintendent feels there is no doubt about our grade of work. The state has added to the number of high schools in the state and to the requirements of teachers, etc., so the inspectors have been busy the entire year looking after the four year high schools. One promises to visit us ..before school closes this spring. The law required at least seven in each high school class so from that standpoint we are going to have hard work to qualify as a Grade A two-year high school. Three will complete third year this spring. We take a chance of someone dropping. On the other hand someone may come in in the fall. Our science work will be weak if we have fourth year, especially if we have no more room than we have now. There is not the incentive for hard work in small classes that there is where there is competition. Again, the roads are good enough and taxies running at reg ular hours so anyone wanting to go to Sevierville for high school work can make the trip night and morning. Against this we have the question of the morale of our own school. If we take out the older boys SETTLEM1 NT Sciroor, RIO.'ORTS 35 and girls we do weaken our school to quite an extent, especially in athletics. I feel sure we should not even consider adding the fourth year of high school until there are more class. 'rooms. The class entering high school next year will be small, one of the weakest classes we have had for some time, but the class following will more than make up for it. It seems to me it is hardly possible to make definite recommendations for next year without knowing what the decision will be in regard to building. This past year the third year work was done without ,adding an extra teacher so I feel sure we did well to add the work, but I am not sure how much more work we should add. In writing this report you will see that many times I have stressed the development of school. work because of experienced teachers having it in charge. This brings us to the question of staff' for another year. We start the new teachers at $GO.O( per month, home and travel. At the end of two, four, even eight years of work here the salary re-mains the same. This hardly seems fair yet our budget swells each year and an increase in salary seems almost impossible. Where we can cut down on expenses I do not know, nor do I see how we can increase our monthly expenses much, but I do feel there should be some way whereby we compensate the teachers for theirexperience and feel it shou'ld have consideration now. AGRICULTURE: Each morning is given over entirely to school work of this school. The classes are in agriculture and in farm shop. Instead of the. usual manual training these boys do more along the lino of farm carpentry work. They are urged to bring to the class things from home that need repairing and they are asked to make a list of things they want to make for their farms. With the text book work in agriculture, fruit growing, animal husbandry, etc., there are field trips and much practical work put in.. The afternoons are reserved for community -work and for classes in some of the other schools. One afternoon each week Mr. Mattil goes to the Sugarlands, another to Laurel Lick. Laurel hick is a new field and one taken over at the request of the teacher of the school. The people are really needy and are anxious to make the most of help that comes to them so it has been a very satisfactory field to work in. The other afternoons are given over to community work. This includes seeing sick animals, looking over poultry flocks, giving advice about pruning, spraying, etc. Because of the interest aroused in a poultry class last year some of the men have been marketing their poultry products this year with a view to taking up the business in a larger way soon. This spring a large incubator house was built and a large incubator gotten. This, of course, called for an enlargement to the broader house. The idea is to do most of the community hatching hero, the people to pay for the chicks. 36 THE ARROW of Pf BETA PHI The farm has been improved Quite a little and the stock quite care-fully taken care of. In the fall, Mr. Mattil had meetings in nearly every little school-house. He took a generator, Ford and moving pictures and many people saw movies for the first time. They were both entertaining and instructive, so, we felt did a good deal of good. The Gatlinburg Community Fair is a big event each year and one that Mr. Mattil shobld receive a great deal of credit for. Each year the school exhibits, the agricultural and home science exhibits are so much better than the year before. More people from up in the creeks come and bring something. Following this fair Mr. Mattil did the greater part of the work of putting a county exhibit up at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. It won third prize, which gave a good little sum to start our fair on next year. This whole department is doing a splendid work and filling a real need in the community and the school. Mr. Mattil will attend Cornell University this summer. DOMESTIC SCIENCE: This is another department that continues through the entire twelve months instead of the school year only. At the close of the school year Jean Steele started classes in Cartertown and Gatlinburg and continued the Sugarlands work for both girls and women. Much time was spent in visiting and trying to interest the women. It had ,been very hard twpersuade any women in the Burg to come to afternoon classes, but Jean helped several start their sewing and as some others wanted to can before Fair time she worked up a very good class. With the opening of school on August 1, the Cartertown class was discontinued, but the others went on in exactly the same way. The high school girls had classes in the morning so Jean could have the entire afternoon free for community work. This was all right for that department, but it made it extremely difficult to arrange a scedule in the school and necessitated having some high school classes at 7:30 in the morning. So much practical work the year before and not enough text book courses made it necessary to divide the high school domestic science classes so they would do extra work and bring the year's work up to standard. In the report of last year I explained the arrangements for teachers, Jean Steele to finish the spring term and continue the summer classes. Then carry the school work again until Christmas when she would go back to college and Barbara Dewell return. Even at the risk of losing state aid for this department if we discontinued some of the adult classes, we rearranged the schedule after Christmas so Barbara Dewell could take three grade classes and could put some of her high school work in the afternoon. This has relieved both teachers and pupils. The weather was too rough during January and February to have had classes in Sugarlands, but with the close of school this spring, those will be taken up again as well as work in one or two communities. SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 37 The State paid five-eighths of the salary of the domestic science teacher and no doubt will do so through the summer. Although we really are not qualifying for ,it now I believe we will be allowed it just the same. In the winter the state supervisor said that she would approve whoever we had to take the work after Miss Steele left, so l expect Barbara Dewell will continue through July. No great expense has been put into the domestic science room nor into equipment but paint, some changes in furnishings, two more windows and a lot of work have made it look fresher and brighter. A new ceiling has made the room more quiet. Investigation was made regarding steam heat for the room, but that did not prove to be possible so the range has answered all purposes and has been fairly satisfactory. The room has also been used for three grade classes. With more community work for the women and high school classes so well organized I feel this department has accomplished a great deal the past year. WEAVING: This year we have had a full time weaving teacher as recommended last spring. Winogene Redding came at the beginning of the second month of school. The looms took another move last fall, being put into the room that had been finished off for a store room under the porch of the Stuart Cottage. This was a great improvement over the log cabin, not only because of giving more light and room, but also bringing them a little nearer the school. All the looms needed overhauling and repairing so it was some little time before work could really begin. Another discouraging thing was that the eighth grade (which is the only one having weaving) is by far the weakest in the school. The girls are slow and not keen for the work. Finally, Miss Redding decided that some in the seventh grade who were older and were anxious to learn weaving should have the opportunity and since they have joined the class the work has taken on more life. Part of the morning is taken up answering calls at the house. All the afternoons are spent in, the various homes. Gene walks miles and miles and during the cold winter months has found it impossible even to be fairly comfortable when she is in the homes as they have been so very cold. The women have been very much interested and would do even more weaving than they do were we in position to keep buying their products in such large quantities. There has been a perfect craze for weaving and the children and the men are nearly as clever at it as the women. Of course, with the spring and summer farm work be-ginning, they will not have so much time for weaving. New patterns, new materials and a variety of things are being made. This time of year. we buy much more than we sell, but it is necessary in order to be ready for the fall. Miss Redding's report shows beyond question how important a full time weaving teacher is and if she returns another year that department will show still more improvement. 38 THE ARROW ov PI BETA PHI We still are handicapped because of lack of room .and until it can be provided we cannot purchase a larger loom or any other equipment. INDUSTRIAL: industrial business has grown to such an extent it really takes more time and work than any other one department, believe. This year we have bought and sold chairs, stools, weaving and baskets. As the Auditor's report will show: Total. purchases $7,552.1 0 Total sales 7,299.57 Net Loss $ 252.59 An inventory of our stock o hand shows that we have $2,360.7'1 Subtracting the total loss 2'''2.59 We have a gain of $2,10512 These figures give some idea of the immense amount of time that must be used in buying the timings from the people, packing and ship-ping them. The correspondence takes the treater part of the orrice time and even then flinch is not kept up as it should be. With the end of the school year we will practically stop buying weaving; baskets and .chairs come in more or less all summer. It is necessary to buy heavily in the spring, when the people have more time to work on baskets and weaving, in order to be ready for the fall sales. Last fall we were ,completely sold out several times and had the people working as fast as they possibly could to till the Christmas orders. The profit on the business is small and were we to consider our time spent in carrying it on we would find it was being run at a loss. I'lowever, there is another side. Many families are self-supporting because of this. Then by selling from here at a small profit the clubs can afford to handle the products and what money they make usually comes back into the school treasury. GIFT Snow : The Gift Shop has proven a success in its first month of operation. The sales amounted to practically $1,000 for the month of May, against $350 for the same month last year. BOYS DORMITORY : Leander and Mrs. McCarter lived on the hill again this year, Mrs. McCarter doing the cooking and housekeeping in return for board for her husband, daughter and part of the time for her son.. They are thoroughly good people and made a good home for the A:Joys. However, the house really needs a teacher or someone who has had more advantages and experience. The study hour needs supervision, the personal appearance. of the boys needs care, the house could be more home like. With the next year we hope for a central dining, room and that will no doubt be of great help. Twelve boys have lived in the dormitory, eight being about the average number. All the boys have been SETTLEmr.IN"l' SCHOOL REPoRTS required to work and the latter part of the year were given at. least si: hours of work during the 'week and five on Saturday in case the; stayed over the week-end. No work can be so very satisfactory withou regular supervision, but, on the whole the boys tried to do and thei failure was not so much from lack of willingness as from the right kim of daily supervision. The boys staying in the dormitory are the olds. boys of the school. It is always rather of a task to hold their interest If anything comes up to upset them much their first thought is to sto' school. The care and advice of someoneJ realizing their problems wont be of great help to the ;boys and the School. CONSOLIDATION: Talking has done little from year to year towar, bringing consolidation, but good roads are doing much. Last year th Cartertown School was discontinued and the pupils had to go to th Glades or here. Nearly all chose this School. There was no chanc of getting a wagon on the road in the fall, so we ran our truck a mil and a half each night and morning to help the children. This made th trip so much. easier that even the little ones came very regularly the fins five months of school. After Christmas the roads were to() bad for u to continue and due to one member of the School Board, no wage could be put en that road to bring the children. Some continued t walk, but many had to .stop, There is every indication of two sma schools coming in here in the fall. Of course they may not come. 1 any school does come in the rooms affected will be the primary o.ne With 47 children now in the primary room and no definite action take regard to building, I do not feel we can urge consolidation for th fall-surely not until we have dedided on our program. Another roux and another teacher are necessary. GIRLS' DORMITORY : The entire year has been very satisfactory in th girls' dormitory. Mrs. Chapin returned at the opening of the scho year. As she had been here before she knew right where to take u the work and things went on with very little difficulty. During the summer several girls worked in homes and after scho( opened continued to stay, receiving their board for work done. This, i addition to the number of families moving into the Burg accounts fc the smaller number in the cottage. Only six girls stayed in the do: mitory. They all lived in the Pollard Cottage. Four of the teaches rooming in the Stuart Cottage took their meals in the Pollard Cottage, It was impossible for the high school girls to continue preparing ti, noon meal at the school for the teachers and dormitory girls, as the did last year. It took all the class time from anything but the pray teal part of the course. Because of this and to relieve the teachers ( all house responsibility we have had a cook in the girls' dormitory ti entire year. The first of November Mrs. Chapin had to leave. We saw at one it would never do to finish the year with no head to the house so mot] er came for two weeks. After Christmas she returned and finished tl year. 40 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI' Surely there can be no complaint in regard to the care of the teachers this year. They have had comfortable rooms and enough to eat and no care whatever of the meals or dormitory girls. If there has been any discontent among them I do not know of it. CENTRAL DINING HALL : On the recommendation of Mrs. Stark and Mrs. Freeman last October, as well as the judgment of all, we have been planning for a central dining ball. Mrs. Stark has suggested the new school building possibly providing a place. In looking over the cottages I have felt we could arrange for the meals withopt going to the school building for them. Were all to take meals in the Teachers Cottage we would need to make changes that would have to be more or less permanent and hard to undo in case they were not satisfactory. If we use the Pollard Cottage next year we could make few changes and none that would necessitate rebuilding. By using the dining room and the downstairs teacher's room as dining rooms there would be sufficient room to take care of all the family we have. Some changes would need to be made in furnishings, but I do not think very expensive ones. This plan would mean boys, girls and teachers having meals together. Some feel this is not a wise plan, but I believe it will work out here and at least we can try it for one year. HEALTH DEPARTMENT : This department continues to be an out standing one and there never is any question of the tremendous amount accomplished for the schools and for the community. Yet, I do some-times think we take much of it for granted just because it is managed so very well. The report of Phyllis Higinbotham gives the details of the work. Dental clinics that used to be once in a while, if at all, are now regular things. The dentist ,comes once a month and always has patients waiting for him. The office is used more and more, people coming for supplies, to see a doctor, for medicines, or to have babies weighed and measured. Dr. Ogle continues to come in once a week or oftener and his services mean much to us. More school work has been done than ever before. A class in hygiene once a week at Sugarlands, pupils weighed and measured in all the nearby schools, some work clone at Laurel Lick make a pretty full school program. With this there was, of course, the smallpox and typhoid vaccinations. There was every indication of a bad typhoid epidemic in the county and I feel but for the hundreds who took the se-rum we might have had a hard time. While this district is very free from it, cases are brought in from nearby places. A college girl to assist in the office and with the school work continues to be most satisfactory, much more so than another nurse would be. The records have been put into good condition, office calls answered, correspondence attended to and many more things done to relieve the nurse. While Harmo Taylor was away in the winter a local girl took SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 41 her place and this spring will assist again as both Harm() and Lois Rogers will be in the Gift Shop. The next point is one I dread even to mention. Phyllis felt last year that she should resign because of her home people. She finally decided to come back for another year, but comes again to the same place she was last summer. In handing in her resignation I felt she should ask only for six months' leave, then i f she found she could come back the place would be here for her. In the meantime we should try to find someone for the temporary place who would probably stay on in case Phyllis .could not return. It is hard to imagine either that department or the school without Phyllis, and I feel we will suffer a great loss. I strongly recommend that Phyllis be granted a six months' leave with the understanding she return at the end of that time if possible. HEALTH UNIT : The past year we have again cooperated with the county in maintaining a county health unit. This does not in any way hamper our work and does make a good many things available, free vaccine for small pox and typhoid inoculations, clinics with county health doctor in ,charge, state specialists and visitors coming to give assistance and advice. Beside these we receive from the state about $500.00 more than we put in. This furnishes a means of getting filing cabinet, auto mileage, some travel allowances and we hope this year will all or partly furnish a typewriter for the office. To the surprise of the people of the county the court has for two years voted the health unit and we are hoping that again in October they will make a sufficient appropriation to make it possible. OFFICE: This year has showed beyond a doubt that the office work must be reorganized if it is to bekept up in anything like an efficient way. The office in the Teachers' Cottage has to be a general office. It is the only place anyone has to do office work, whether of school or industrial. It is the only place anyone has to talk business. This year extra congestion has been caused by having to do all of the work of the Gatlinburg News in the office. With the duties of house mother, pur chasing agent and the planning of meals combined there will be no time for the person having those things in charge to do any office work. Also with the constantly increasing amount of correspondence and desk work there is need of an assistant being in the office all the time. The past year there has not been time from routine office work for me scarcely to know what was going on around the place. FARM : In making a report on the farm I feel I should preface it by saying that the farm and the Smith-Hughes Agriculture in the School and the community are two separate things. In spite of the very dry weather the farm produced more than the year previous. We raised enough potatoes to carry us through the year, garden produce helped greatly on the living, we had at least fifty gallons of strawberries, fruit trees bore some, cows furnished all the milk we had and part of the 42 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI year all the butter. Beside this we had eggs, chickens, pork and beef from the farm. All the fields that were cultivated were put into hay and other fodder, saving quite a little on our hay bill. We have on the farm two horses of our own and one owned by Mr. Mattil, but kept by us as we use it nearly all the time, 3 cows, 3 calves, one bull, one goat, 1 boar, 1 brood sow and some small pigs, about 100 chickens. We fat few hogs as it pays better to sell the yotng pigs and also puts good stock into the community. This year the boys have clone the milking, cared for the horses, pigs, and chickens. They have clone fairly well with the work, but it has meant waste of feed and time. Mr. Mattil has supervised all he could and Leander McCarter has tried to, too, but it is a steady job and one that needs a person with it all the time. This coming year we should employ a man as farmer and supervisor of student labor, both for the good of the farm and for the good of the boys. I doubt if it would mean the cash outlay it appears for there would be saving in other ways. Were there a farmer here all the time much of the outside labor could be turned over to the boys or done away with entirely. Also with better roads and the nurse making more trips in a car an extra horse can be used nmeh of the time on the farm, saving the team hire we now have. COMMUNITY: As more people come into the Valley and the roads improve so our people get in and out more the community activities seem to grow less. Whether we really do less or merely feel that way is a question. At any rate it is harder to get the local people together. The teachers take an active part in Sunday School and B. Y. P. U. Helen Barrett had a Junior meeting Sunday afternoons for the tots from six to eleven years. Basketball games, either of theschool or community team, have taken at least one evening a week during the winter. Movies began in April and continued through September. They were well patronized and the report shows that even with paying for some furnishings, we came out about even. In the fall pictures were shown in practically every little school around here. This was primarily to stimulate Fair interest, but as the pictures were along the line of farming, domestic science and health they were decidedly educational. 'he great ,community event of the year is the Gatlinburg Fair and this year it certainly did credit to the school, the community and the county. The exhibits were line and were brought from more homes than ever before. Several of the little schools made fine showings, even though they had little school material to work with. After this fair was over Mr. Mattil did the greater part in putting on a county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. The nurse also put on a tine health exhibit. The school exhibit received first prize of $15.00 and the county exhibit second prize, which gave us a neat sum to start next year's Fair on. Another year there will be a county Fair in Sevierville and 1 feel S.ECTTLEMr,NT SCHOOL 43 that with what we do here and what we should do to 'boost the ,county Fair it would be best not to make any effort to exhibit in Knoxville. The Christmas entertainment, Valentine parties, picnics, and socials during warm weather, keeping open house at `Tea(Thers' Cottage Friday and Saturday nights comprise the social side of the school, life. The crying need of the community is supervised play and recreation Saturday and Sunday afternoons the year round. Yet with every teacher working full time, some of them six (lays of the week, and then teaching Sunday School on Sunday, how can they give the one after-noon they have for their rest and recreation? We have talked and talked of finding some young man who would do that kind of work during the summer, but have never come to the point of really trying to locate one. Neither do I know whether it would be possible to find one to come for expenses only. Sugarlands needs work of this kind, too. When you see a crowd of boys going up and down and up and down the road all Sunday afternoon just looking for something to do you wonder they escape as much trouble as they do. And what saves even our dormitory boys over the week-end is more than I can tell. The barn is open for basketball some Sunday afternoons and ;base-ball is played more or less during the summer, but there should be someone in charge. Also a clubroom of some kind should be, kept open those afternoons. None of us are satisfied with the amount of community work we do, but with every hour full we seem unable to take over any more. Each summer more people come into the Burg, there are more at-tractions away from the simple pleasures the people have been used to and I feel that right now we should nmke a great effort to hold the young people to their church, their homes and their community life. I still feel that one of the best things we are doing and one most appreciated is sending out the Gatlinburg News each month. Five hundred copies are printed and 25O go up and down these creeks and are really read. It is one of the pieces of real work that we feel well re-paid for doing. EXTENSION: Each year the question of extension comes up and each time under different circumstances. The Sugarlancls work is well enough established so we do not need to question continuing so much as the best methods to pursue. With the county furnishing eight months of free school we have not had to supplement any salaries in Sugarlands for grade work. Our help was with cooking, sewing, agriculture and adult work. The work in Laurel Lick has been along this line only. Several times Dr. Ogle and the County Superintendent have asked us why we did not investigate Laurel Lick field with a view toe helping there. Our answer has been that we had now about all we could manage. This year Miss Barrett has been very much interested and would like to take the primary room there next year. The county would pay sufficient salary to be equiv.-. alent to what she received here last year. The problem would be the 44 THE ARROW OE' PI BETA PHI living. She could not live alone, neither is there a suitable place for her to board. She has thought that possibly some girl working for her Master s Degree might be interested in spending a year there, coming for expenses only and possibly being willing even to pay those herself. This would furnish someone to help with community work. Helen and I figured that if we did anything toward making a cab-in habitable and getting any supplies whatever it would mean putting about $500.00 into the venture. She said she was willing to try to raise enough to finance the project, but I discouraged that thinking it Would keep funds out of the budget. Through the hair, meetings in different schools, visits of the nurse to weigh and measure children, agriculture classes in Sugarlands and Laurel Lick and some work done in other schools, we have been able to do a good deal for these other schools and with good results. SUGARLANDS : Sugarlands created a good deal of worry and trouble in the late summer. This was due first of all to an uncertainty in regard to Miss Chew being able to return to her work there, then to carelessness on my part in applying to one of the school ;board who thought I should ask him for the school. Cora McCarter had the same grades again, but the ones Miss Chew had were given to the board member's son-in-law. At first this made a good deal of trouble as the people wanted Miss Chew and we felt we had not had a square deal. Before many weeks we saw that it had been a fortunate move, rather than otherwise, for it gave Miss Chew the opportunity to try out adult school work there. Her work consisted in much visiting and answering calls at her house. 'Classes were held three afternoons in the school house after the regular school was dismissed. Thirteel boys were enrolled. One walked from the lumber camps across the mountain once a week. These boys were from fifteen to twenty years of age and doing work from first or second grade to a possible fourth or fifth. The older people were taught in their homes and several men and women over sixty years of age learned to. read and write. One was delighted that she could go to the mail box and tell to whom the letters were addressed. With the coming of bad weather it seemed best to discontinue these classes so Miss Chew took her vacation in January and February and will carry classes through the spring and summer. The State allowed us $212.50 on Miss Chew's salary for the fall term and says it will continue to help us this spring. Mrs. Stark called a meeting when she was here so that the county board and Sugarlands people could come to some agreement and also that she could have some idea of how each group stood. The people later signed a paper stating that they were willing to call this year one of the four required ones to give a clear title to the land and the county board gave a written statement showing their willingness to co-operate hereafter. Nothing has discouraged the people in Sugarlands so much as not having a teachers' cottage started yet. They feel they have been prom SETTLEMriNT SCHOOL R-C,PORTS 45 ised it and that were it there they would be assured the Pi Phis were there to stay. Then several men hoped for work on the building. The county school term has been eight months, which has meant the county has financed the teaching of the school. The board has again promised a new school building to be completed by opening of next term. Our allowance of $1,600 for Sugarlands has not been used this year, therefore, I would recommend the balance left be used in helping build a teachers' cottage, it being added to the Hazel Todd Meaden Fund, if that is released. I would. recommend also that the adult work be continued another year if possible. Miss Chew's report gives the list of community activities. IMPROVEMENTS MADE DURING THE YEAR: Rock walks laid around the cottages. New flue built for Pollard Cottage. Incubator house built-one half to be used for root store house. Full time weaving teacher engaged. Third year added to high school. Engine and wood house rebuilt, making new store. Redressing school desks. Guttering and draining around schoolhouse. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR: Farmer and supervisor of boys' work engaged. Gift shop plans adopted for the summer. Central dining hall. Purchasing agent to plan meals and manage girls' dormitory, living in the dormitory. Office helper and sufficient office equipment, including typewriter, adding machine and desk. Scale of salary increase for teaching experience in the school. Teacher in boys' dormitory. Community worker for Saturdays and Sundays during the summer. Teachers' cottage in Sugarlands. Schoolhouse started or room added to present building. In closing my report I again want to express my appreciation of the entire staff and the committee. Again, I say that but for the sympathy and help each has so willingly given the other the year's program never could have been carried on so successfully. These are the things that give joy to the work here and .make us all loath to give up our connection with the School and Pi Phi work. EVELYN BISHOP, Head Resident. 46 T r. ARRow ov PI BETA PHI DIGEST ()F MINUTES Settlement School Conanittee Meeting, March 5, 1926 A full membership was present. The membership, with permission of Grand Council, met (luring tlni School session, which proved a great success, as this gave the committee a better working knowledge of conditions at the School, and a more sympathetic understanding of the staff. Hereafter, all weaving work will have the trademark of the Settlement School, which is in the form of a, blue paper sticker with red design. A branding iron carrying the trademark will be used on bas kets and furniture. The Committee decided to build the industrial unit to the new school building with the funds now available. Several gifts from individuals, and one bequest, together with certain sums voted from interests and current expenses, have helped increase this fund to such an amount as to encourage our undertaking this enterprise. The need of such is most apparent. This building will probably be a memorial building. The School plant is in very good condition. No excessive expense is necessary for the repairs as it has been our policy to keep the buildings in as good condition as possible. There may be some necessary painting work to be done. As usual, the School, its staff and problems took considerable time. Evelyn Bishop was re-elected as Head Resident. Margaret White is to be Principal of the higher grades. Emily Burton is to return after a leave of absence for one year. Marian Folsom and Elmer Watson were re-elected. Lois Rogers resigned to be office assistant to the Head Resident. Mrs. E. A. Bishop was elected to become Matron of the Girls' Dormitory, purchasing agent, and supervisor of the central dining room. Mrs. Dowell is to have charge of noon lunches for all school pupils, and Matron of the Boys' Dormitory. Jean Steele and O. J. Mattil were re-elected to carry on the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science and Agricultural work, respectively. Winogene Redding will be the teacher and super-visor of the weaving department. Too much praise cannot be given to her success along these lines. Some changes have been made in the running of the School. There are to be two principals, one for lower grade work, one for high school work. There are to be two primary teachers, as this class has grown so, owing to the consolidation of several schools. There are to be noon lunches for all pupils. This is to be self-supporting if possible. The basement of the School will be converted in classrooms for primary grades. An extra office in the Teftchers' Cottage will be in the room now used as a downstairs bedroom. All books in the Library are to be catalogued or repaired. A fifth and sixth grade teacher has to be elected, also principal of lower grades. A teacher's salary is to be fifty dollars per month for the first year, fifty-five dollars for the third year, SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 47 and sixty for the fourth year and sixty-five for the fifth year. The price of all orders for industrial work, other than from alumnae clubs, shall be increased 25%. Color cards and samples of weaving are to be sent upon request.. Alumnae Clubs are offered 1% discount for cash within 30 days from date of invoice. Board paid by new teachers is to be increased to $20.00 per month. Miss Higinbotham was granted six month's leave. Another nurse is to take her place. Requests for a typewriter and a ear discussed. An assistant to the nurse was authorized again, and Lizzie Reagan was elected as Harmo Taylor resigned. The Hazel Todd Meaden Memorial House is to be.. built at the Emma Harper Turner Center. Helen Chew was elected as head of the work, and she, with the assistance of head Resident, secured another 1)i Phi teacher, and will dictate the policy at this center. Smith-Hughes adult Education Fund again solicited. The County is building a very nice new school building at the Emma Harper Turner Center. It is with deep regret that we announce the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham. She is to become State Supervisor of Public Health Nursing of Tennessee. I could write a' lengthy eulogy on Miss Higinbotham. I could tell you of the hours of pure drudgery that she has gone through. I could tell you of thousands and thousands of such things and still would not have half begun. All who have known her and have seen .her know that contact with her has made them a better person to live in this world. Guests who desire to stay more than week ends in the school are to be charged at the rate of $1.00 a day. The fiscal year of the school has been changed to close on June 30. A reorganization of the industrial department and work is to be made. It is probable that a definite wholesale price schedule will be adopted, slightly higher than in the past to provide for increased cost of maintenance of the department and of materials, with standard discounts for quantity buying.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon." If you have not read these articles it has been your loss, as they have been full of human interest. She is certainly a most ardent worker of our School and her ability and personality make a happy combination. Dorothy Smallwood Geare has done a splendid work in sending out information to those members not belonging to any alumnae club. We feel that these members should be a part of this great work and it has been our plan to get them interested in this way in the School. Gertrude Brown Freeman has successfully followed Mrs. Curtis as the Ways and Means member of the committee. I have found her ad-vice on the committee matters instructive and enlightening and feel that she has been a decided asset. Owing to illness, Ethel Curryer could not start her work until November. When you read her report you will see that she has carried her part through in a manner that would do credit to a most experienced bookkeeper. Our work has increased to such a degree that she, at times, has had to do the work of three people rather than one. She has been patient and efficient and we are indeed fortunate in having such a treasurer for the Settlement School. Each of the committee, as well as I, feel that we are fortunate in being able to serve you in this undertaking a work that has been hard that has not been altogether happy at times--that has been exacting and time claiming when we could have been enjoying ourselves at Convention. But, being a work of such high ideals, we feel that no matter what effort it cost us it was worth it all. And, again, let us express to you our sincere appreciation of the opportunity for being a part of the greatest altruistic work any fraternity in America has ever undertaken. Remember, this School is yours. How successful its future is depends upon you. Do you want it to stand still? I think not. Do you want it to become better in every way? Your answer to this is in increased donations. NITA HILL STARK, Chairman. 50 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI REPORT OF THE TREASURER OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records a'nd accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., for the period 1925--1926 ending April 30, 1926. The books were audited and records checked for the period covering your term as treasurer and we have made a combined report for the entire year using a part of the previous Auditor's statements for the first few months of the 1925 term and wish to state that while we assume no responsibility for his figures we test checked and verified same whenever it seemed expedient to do so. We have verified the Bank Balance and all deposits and securities. All postings in the General Ledger were checked with the Journal and Check Register and all totals in all of the books were verified. All receipts were checked and verified with the checks issued in payment of same and all Invoices and Credit Memos were thoroughly examined, being checked against both the Journal and Check Register.

She therefore reports under these two heads: I. CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files.

        32 THE ARROW 05 Pi BETA PHI. Too much praise cannot be given to the staff, as each in her way was a valuable aid to the School and the cooperation, no matter how strenuous the effort may have been at times, was most praiseworthy. We are happy to announce that Miss Bishop will continue as Head Resident. Among her assets is her most unusual personality and her ability to mix and mingle with the p;'ople of every locality. This alone, if she did nothing else, would make her invaluable to the School. How-ever, the committee feels that she serves capably and well, and their personal contact with her has given them full confidence in her ability and good sense to handle any task. I shall again incorporate her re-port, as she can give you the details in a more concise form than I can. It is my earnest desire that you read her report in full, so that you may become better acquainted with the inner workings of the School. REPORT OF 'BEAD RESIDENT FOR THE YEAR 1925-1926 In making a report for the past year 1 wish to preface it by saying that in many ways it has been a most successful year, each one has been anxious to make improvements over the year previous. But I want to add a regret, too, that because of the circumstances in connection with the annual meeting of last year, some of the large things we had planned are impossible of accomplishment. The work from day to .day went on in a most satisfactory manner, school spirit was excellent, community cooperation better than ever be-fore and a splendid staff to carry on. Only we who were looking further than this year or next felt anxious to be taking up the larger progress we had in mind. However, the enforced wait may find us more ready for it this year. The staff has been as follows: Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident Phyllis Higinbotham, Nurse Harmo Taylor, Asst. to the nurse Margaret White, Departmental work, 7th-Sth and high school. Marion Folsom, Departmental work, 7th-Sth and high school Lois Rogers, 5th and 6th grades Elmer Watson, 3d and 4th grades athletic coach Helen Barrett, Primer, 1st and 2d grades Jean Steele, Domestic Science O. J. Mattil, Agriculture and community work Winogene Redding, Weaving school and community Helen Chew, Sugarlands School adult work Mrs. Dora Chapin, House mother girls' dormitory Lizzie Reagan, Cook and helper, teachers' cottage Mrs. Ownby, Cook, girls' dormitory Mrs. McCarter, Cook, boys' dormitory Leander McCarter, Firing furnaces, farm and general work SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS a Owing to the kind of work Miss Chew was doing it seemed wis for her to take her vacation in January and February instead of dui ing the summer as she was away nearly three months. Helen Barrett was compelled to go home the last month of schoc because of sickness. Her place was taken by Ann Clabo, one of our lc cal girls. Mrs. Dowell did not take any time off during the summer, so a Christmas went home for a month. Several clubs asked to have he stop over on her way back and it seemed worth while to accept thei invitations. She spoke to five clubs and chapters as well as some othe clubs. Jean Steele left us at Christmas time to enter college again an Barbara Dewell left college at that time to come back here, a Kapp arrangement for both girls and one that has not handicapped the Schoc any. Mrs. Chapin came back this year with the understanding that sli might have to leave before Christmas. MY mother was glad to finis the school year. While she has done much for the girls they have don worlds for her that she and I will never forget. The state is always most willing to give us any aid possible an has sent a number of advisors and visitors to the different department of the school. With the country opening up so much for tourists have a great many callers and people who are anxious to see the weary ing and baskets and the School. Last summer we felt sure that never would be wise again to open school as early as August 1. The oh er pupils were working at the hotels so were compelled to enter school month late, but the greatest reason for making the change was the we were deluged with visitors in the School. Of course it will be problem to keep the boys and girls in school longer in the spring, 131 we feel there is no doubt but that we must make this change. SCHOOL : The feeling among those who have been here the lunge is that the School has shown more growth and improvement this yei than in any other year of its history. There is no question about the growth in numbers. We have 11 an enrollment of 152 this year against 129 last year. This increase wl due in a large measure to many pupils coming from Cartertown, whe one of the county schools was a help. Running the truck a mile and half night and morning gave the little folks from Cartertown a chan to be in school every day and they surely took advantage of it. Whi the county did not give us any aid for transportation they did increa our monthly allowance $45.00 per month, which more than paid t] expenses of running the truck for those pupils. Another great improv meat in school has been the regular attendance. With so few chang in the teaching staff the year opened more easily and it was possit to do more constructive work. The question of discipline is never very hard one so there was little trouble in that line. The county ga eight months of free school this year, which was a great help in keepi: 34 THE ARROW Or PT BETA Pin the boys and girls during the spring term as well as helping us tinancially. The 7th, Sth and high school had nine months of school. Increase in enrollment next year is going to depend much on whether or not we have room to accommodate more. With any out-side school coming in the lower grades will be affected and they are now the over-crowded ones. Forty-five in the primary room has been almost impossible this. year and we can now count twenty little folks coming into that room another year with only ten going out. If no other school came in those grades might be carried by one teacher and a local girl as assistant, but I would not advise it. At any rate there would have to be a place to put them. Helen Barrett had splendid success with the little ones and even though she was compelled to go home at the beginning of the last month I feel that her pupils had the equivalent of a full year. The last month Ann Claho taught those grades and with very good results. Emily Burton writes that she is ready to come back again next year if we still want her and I am sure there is no doubt of that. Helen Barrett is very much interested in the Laurel Lick school, but. that is all so uncertain now we have no idea what may open up. The domestic science, agriculture and weaving departments have been carried on very successfully this year. The great gain that I feel has been made in the school is -due to a great extent to the cooperation among the teachers. While each room or each department is separate, to quite an extent, there is a sympathetic understanding among the teachers that does make for a good school and real development. The teachers are doing good, conscientious work and deserve a great deal of commendation for what they have accomplished. HIGH ScHou: The third year was added to the high school course this year. We have not been able to get an inspector out this year so are not yet on the accredited list. The County Superintendent feels there is no doubt about our grade of work. The state has added to the number of high schools in the state and to the requirements of teachers, etc., so the inspectors have been busy the entire year looking after the four year high schools. One promises to visit us ..before school closes this spring. The law required at least seven in each high school class so from that standpoint we are going to have hard work to qualify as a Grade A two-year high school. Three will complete third year this spring. We take a chance of someone dropping. On the other hand someone may come in in the fall. Our science work will be weak if we have fourth year, especially if we have no more room than we have now. There is not the incentive for hard work in small classes that there is where there is competition. Again, the roads are good enough and taxies running at reg ular hours so anyone wanting to go to Sevierville for high school work can make the trip night and morning. Against this we have the question of the morale of our own school. If we take out the older boys SETTLEM1 NT Sciroor, RIO.'ORTS 35 and girls we do weaken our school to quite an extent, especially in athletics. I feel sure we should not even consider adding the fourth year of high school until there are more class. 'rooms. The class entering high school next year will be small, one of the weakest classes we have had for some time, but the class following will more than make up for it. It seems to me it is hardly possible to make definite recommendations for next year without knowing what the decision will be in regard to building. This past year the third year work was done without ,adding an extra teacher so I feel sure we did well to add the work, but I am not sure how much more work we should add. In writing this report you will see that many times I have stressed the development of school. work because of experienced teachers having it in charge. This brings us to the question of staff' for another year. We start the new teachers at $GO.O( per month, home and travel. At the end of two, four, even eight years of work here the salary re-mains the same. This hardly seems fair yet our budget swells each year and an increase in salary seems almost impossible. Where we can cut down on expenses I do not know, nor do I see how we can increase our monthly expenses much, but I do feel there should be some way whereby we compensate the teachers for theirexperience and feel it shou'ld have consideration now. AGRICULTURE: Each morning is given over entirely to school work of this school. The classes are in agriculture and in farm shop. Instead of the. usual manual training these boys do more along the lino of farm carpentry work. They are urged to bring to the class things from home that need repairing and they are asked to make a list of things they want to make for their farms. With the text book work in agriculture, fruit growing, animal husbandry, etc., there are field trips and much practical work put in.. The afternoons are reserved for community -work and for classes in some of the other schools. One afternoon each week Mr. Mattil goes to the Sugarlands, another to Laurel Lick. Laurel hick is a new field and one taken over at the request of the teacher of the school. The people are really needy and are anxious to make the most of help that comes to them so it has been a very satisfactory field to work in. The other afternoons are given over to community work. This includes seeing sick animals, looking over poultry flocks, giving advice about pruning, spraying, etc. Because of the interest aroused in a poultry class last year some of the men have been marketing their poultry products this year with a view to taking up the business in a larger way soon. This spring a large incubator house was built and a large incubator gotten. This, of course, called for an enlargement to the broader house. The idea is to do most of the community hatching hero, the people to pay for the chicks. 36 THE ARROW of Pf BETA PHI The farm has been improved Quite a little and the stock quite care-fully taken care of. In the fall, Mr. Mattil had meetings in nearly every little school-house. He took a generator, Ford and moving pictures and many people saw movies for the first time. They were both entertaining and instructive, so, we felt did a good deal of good. The Gatlinburg Community Fair is a big event each year and one that Mr. Mattil shobld receive a great deal of credit for. Each year the school exhibits, the agricultural and home science exhibits are so much better than the year before. More people from up in the creeks come and bring something. Following this fair Mr. Mattil did the greater part of the work of putting a county exhibit up at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. It won third prize, which gave a good little sum to start our fair on next year. This whole department is doing a splendid work and filling a real need in the community and the school. Mr. Mattil will attend Cornell University this summer. DOMESTIC SCIENCE: This is another department that continues through the entire twelve months instead of the school year only. At the close of the school year Jean Steele started classes in Cartertown and Gatlinburg and continued the Sugarlands work for both girls and women. Much time was spent in visiting and trying to interest the women. It had ,been very hard twpersuade any women in the Burg to come to afternoon classes, but Jean helped several start their sewing and as some others wanted to can before Fair time she worked up a very good class. With the opening of school on August 1, the Cartertown class was discontinued, but the others went on in exactly the same way. The high school girls had classes in the morning so Jean could have the entire afternoon free for community work. This was all right for that department, but it made it extremely difficult to arrange a scedule in the school and necessitated having some high school classes at 7:30 in the morning. So much practical work the year before and not enough text book courses made it necessary to divide the high school domestic science classes so they would do extra work and bring the year's work up to standard. In the report of last year I explained the arrangements for teachers, Jean Steele to finish the spring term and continue the summer classes. Then carry the school work again until Christmas when she would go back to college and Barbara Dewell return. Even at the risk of losing state aid for this department if we discontinued some of the adult classes, we rearranged the schedule after Christmas so Barbara Dewell could take three grade classes and could put some of her high school work in the afternoon. This has relieved both teachers and pupils. The weather was too rough during January and February to have had classes in Sugarlands, but with the close of school this spring, those will be taken up again as well as work in one or two communities. SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 37 The State paid five-eighths of the salary of the domestic science teacher and no doubt will do so through the summer. Although we really are not qualifying for ,it now I believe we will be allowed it just the same. In the winter the state supervisor said that she would approve whoever we had to take the work after Miss Steele left, so l expect Barbara Dewell will continue through July. No great expense has been put into the domestic science room nor into equipment but paint, some changes in furnishings, two more windows and a lot of work have made it look fresher and brighter. A new ceiling has made the room more quiet. Investigation was made regarding steam heat for the room, but that did not prove to be possible so the range has answered all purposes and has been fairly satisfactory. The room has also been used for three grade classes. With more community work for the women and high school classes so well organized I feel this department has accomplished a great deal the past year. WEAVING: This year we have had a full time weaving teacher as recommended last spring. Winogene Redding came at the beginning of the second month of school. The looms took another move last fall, being put into the room that had been finished off for a store room under the porch of the Stuart Cottage. This was a great improvement over the log cabin, not only because of giving more light and room, but also bringing them a little nearer the school. All the looms needed overhauling and repairing so it was some little time before work could really begin. Another discouraging thing was that the eighth grade (which is the only one having weaving) is by far the weakest in the school. The girls are slow and not keen for the work. Finally, Miss Redding decided that some in the seventh grade who were older and were anxious to learn weaving should have the opportunity and since they have joined the class the work has taken on more life. Part of the morning is taken up answering calls at the house. All the afternoons are spent in, the various homes. Gene walks miles and miles and during the cold winter months has found it impossible even to be fairly comfortable when she is in the homes as they have been so very cold. The women have been very much interested and would do even more weaving than they do were we in position to keep buying their products in such large quantities. There has been a perfect craze for weaving and the children and the men are nearly as clever at it as the women. Of course, with the spring and summer farm work be-ginning, they will not have so much time for weaving. New patterns, new materials and a variety of things are being made. This time of year. we buy much more than we sell, but it is necessary in order to be ready for the fall. Miss Redding's report shows beyond question how important a full time weaving teacher is and if she returns another year that department will show still more improvement. 38 THE ARROW ov PI BETA PHI We still are handicapped because of lack of room .and until it can be provided we cannot purchase a larger loom or any other equipment. INDUSTRIAL: industrial business has grown to such an extent it really takes more time and work than any other one department, believe. This year we have bought and sold chairs, stools, weaving and baskets. As the Auditor's report will show: Total. purchases $7,552.1 0 Total sales 7,299.57 Net Loss $ 252.59 An inventory of our stock o hand shows that we have $2,360.7'1 Subtracting the total loss 2'''2.59 We have a gain of $2,10512 These figures give some idea of the immense amount of time that must be used in buying the timings from the people, packing and ship-ping them. The correspondence takes the treater part of the orrice time and even then flinch is not kept up as it should be. With the end of the school year we will practically stop buying weaving; baskets and .chairs come in more or less all summer. It is necessary to buy heavily in the spring, when the people have more time to work on baskets and weaving, in order to be ready for the fall sales. Last fall we were ,completely sold out several times and had the people working as fast as they possibly could to till the Christmas orders. The profit on the business is small and were we to consider our time spent in carrying it on we would find it was being run at a loss. I'lowever, there is another side. Many families are self-supporting because of this. Then by selling from here at a small profit the clubs can afford to handle the products and what money they make usually comes back into the school treasury. GIFT Snow : The Gift Shop has proven a success in its first month of operation. The sales amounted to practically $1,000 for the month of May, against $350 for the same month last year. BOYS DORMITORY : Leander and Mrs. McCarter lived on the hill again this year, Mrs. McCarter doing the cooking and housekeeping in return for board for her husband, daughter and part of the time for her son.. They are thoroughly good people and made a good home for the A:Joys. However, the house really needs a teacher or someone who has had more advantages and experience. The study hour needs supervision, the personal appearance. of the boys needs care, the house could be more home like. With the next year we hope for a central dining, room and that will no doubt be of great help. Twelve boys have lived in the dormitory, eight being about the average number. All the boys have been SETTLEmr.IN"l' SCHOOL REPoRTS required to work and the latter part of the year were given at. least si: hours of work during the 'week and five on Saturday in case the; stayed over the week-end. No work can be so very satisfactory withou regular supervision, but, on the whole the boys tried to do and thei failure was not so much from lack of willingness as from the right kim of daily supervision. The boys staying in the dormitory are the olds. boys of the school. It is always rather of a task to hold their interest If anything comes up to upset them much their first thought is to sto' school. The care and advice of someoneJ realizing their problems wont be of great help to the ;boys and the School. CONSOLIDATION: Talking has done little from year to year towar, bringing consolidation, but good roads are doing much. Last year th Cartertown School was discontinued and the pupils had to go to th Glades or here. Nearly all chose this School. There was no chanc of getting a wagon on the road in the fall, so we ran our truck a mil and a half each night and morning to help the children. This made th trip so much. easier that even the little ones came very regularly the fins five months of school. After Christmas the roads were to() bad for u to continue and due to one member of the School Board, no wage could be put en that road to bring the children. Some continued t walk, but many had to .stop, There is every indication of two sma schools coming in here in the fall. Of course they may not come. 1 any school does come in the rooms affected will be the primary o.ne With 47 children now in the primary room and no definite action take regard to building, I do not feel we can urge consolidation for th fall-surely not until we have dedided on our program. Another roux and another teacher are necessary. GIRLS' DORMITORY : The entire year has been very satisfactory in th girls' dormitory. Mrs. Chapin returned at the opening of the scho year. As she had been here before she knew right where to take u the work and things went on with very little difficulty. During the summer several girls worked in homes and after scho( opened continued to stay, receiving their board for work done. This, i addition to the number of families moving into the Burg accounts fc the smaller number in the cottage. Only six girls stayed in the do: mitory. They all lived in the Pollard Cottage. Four of the teaches rooming in the Stuart Cottage took their meals in the Pollard Cottage, It was impossible for the high school girls to continue preparing ti, noon meal at the school for the teachers and dormitory girls, as the did last year. It took all the class time from anything but the pray teal part of the course. Because of this and to relieve the teachers ( all house responsibility we have had a cook in the girls' dormitory ti entire year. The first of November Mrs. Chapin had to leave. We saw at one it would never do to finish the year with no head to the house so mot] er came for two weeks. After Christmas she returned and finished tl year. 40 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI' Surely there can be no complaint in regard to the care of the teachers this year. They have had comfortable rooms and enough to eat and no care whatever of the meals or dormitory girls. If there has been any discontent among them I do not know of it. CENTRAL DINING HALL : On the recommendation of Mrs. Stark and Mrs. Freeman last October, as well as the judgment of all, we have been planning for a central dining ball. Mrs. Stark has suggested the new school building possibly providing a place. In looking over the cottages I have felt we could arrange for the meals withopt going to the school building for them. Were all to take meals in the Teachers Cottage we would need to make changes that would have to be more or less permanent and hard to undo in case they were not satisfactory. If we use the Pollard Cottage next year we could make few changes and none that would necessitate rebuilding. By using the dining room and the downstairs teacher's room as dining rooms there would be sufficient room to take care of all the family we have. Some changes would need to be made in furnishings, but I do not think very expensive ones. This plan would mean boys, girls and teachers having meals together. Some feel this is not a wise plan, but I believe it will work out here and at least we can try it for one year. HEALTH DEPARTMENT : This department continues to be an out standing one and there never is any question of the tremendous amount accomplished for the schools and for the community. Yet, I do some-times think we take much of it for granted just because it is managed so very well. The report of Phyllis Higinbotham gives the details of the work. Dental clinics that used to be once in a while, if at all, are now regular things. The dentist ,comes once a month and always has patients waiting for him. The office is used more and more, people coming for supplies, to see a doctor, for medicines, or to have babies weighed and measured. Dr. Ogle continues to come in once a week or oftener and his services mean much to us. More school work has been done than ever before. A class in hygiene once a week at Sugarlands, pupils weighed and measured in all the nearby schools, some work clone at Laurel Lick make a pretty full school program. With this there was, of course, the smallpox and typhoid vaccinations. There was every indication of a bad typhoid epidemic in the county and I feel but for the hundreds who took the se-rum we might have had a hard time. While this district is very free from it, cases are brought in from nearby places. A college girl to assist in the office and with the school work continues to be most satisfactory, much more so than another nurse would be. The records have been put into good condition, office calls answered, correspondence attended to and many more things done to relieve the nurse. While Harmo Taylor was away in the winter a local girl took SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 41 her place and this spring will assist again as both Harm() and Lois Rogers will be in the Gift Shop. The next point is one I dread even to mention. Phyllis felt last year that she should resign because of her home people. She finally decided to come back for another year, but comes again to the same place she was last summer. In handing in her resignation I felt she should ask only for six months' leave, then i f she found she could come back the place would be here for her. In the meantime we should try to find someone for the temporary place who would probably stay on in case Phyllis .could not return. It is hard to imagine either that department or the school without Phyllis, and I feel we will suffer a great loss. I strongly recommend that Phyllis be granted a six months' leave with the understanding she return at the end of that time if possible. HEALTH UNIT : The past year we have again cooperated with the county in maintaining a county health unit. This does not in any way hamper our work and does make a good many things available, free vaccine for small pox and typhoid inoculations, clinics with county health doctor in ,charge, state specialists and visitors coming to give assistance and advice. Beside these we receive from the state about $500.00 more than we put in. This furnishes a means of getting filing cabinet, auto mileage, some travel allowances and we hope this year will all or partly furnish a typewriter for the office. To the surprise of the people of the county the court has for two years voted the health unit and we are hoping that again in October they will make a sufficient appropriation to make it possible. OFFICE: This year has showed beyond a doubt that the office work must be reorganized if it is to bekept up in anything like an efficient way. The office in the Teachers' Cottage has to be a general office. It is the only place anyone has to do office work, whether of school or industrial. It is the only place anyone has to talk business. This year extra congestion has been caused by having to do all of the work of the Gatlinburg News in the office. With the duties of house mother, pur chasing agent and the planning of meals combined there will be no time for the person having those things in charge to do any office work. Also with the constantly increasing amount of correspondence and desk work there is need of an assistant being in the office all the time. The past year there has not been time from routine office work for me scarcely to know what was going on around the place. FARM : In making a report on the farm I feel I should preface it by saying that the farm and the Smith-Hughes Agriculture in the School and the community are two separate things. In spite of the very dry weather the farm produced more than the year previous. We raised enough potatoes to carry us through the year, garden produce helped greatly on the living, we had at least fifty gallons of strawberries, fruit trees bore some, cows furnished all the milk we had and part of the 42 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI year all the butter. Beside this we had eggs, chickens, pork and beef from the farm. All the fields that were cultivated were put into hay and other fodder, saving quite a little on our hay bill. We have on the farm two horses of our own and one owned by Mr. Mattil, but kept by us as we use it nearly all the time, 3 cows, 3 calves, one bull, one goat, 1 boar, 1 brood sow and some small pigs, about 100 chickens. We fat few hogs as it pays better to sell the yotng pigs and also puts good stock into the community. This year the boys have clone the milking, cared for the horses, pigs, and chickens. They have clone fairly well with the work, but it has meant waste of feed and time. Mr. Mattil has supervised all he could and Leander McCarter has tried to, too, but it is a steady job and one that needs a person with it all the time. This coming year we should employ a man as farmer and supervisor of student labor, both for the good of the farm and for the good of the boys. I doubt if it would mean the cash outlay it appears for there would be saving in other ways. Were there a farmer here all the time much of the outside labor could be turned over to the boys or done away with entirely. Also with better roads and the nurse making more trips in a car an extra horse can be used nmeh of the time on the farm, saving the team hire we now have. COMMUNITY: As more people come into the Valley and the roads improve so our people get in and out more the community activities seem to grow less. Whether we really do less or merely feel that way is a question. At any rate it is harder to get the local people together. The teachers take an active part in Sunday School and B. Y. P. U. Helen Barrett had a Junior meeting Sunday afternoons for the tots from six to eleven years. Basketball games, either of theschool or community team, have taken at least one evening a week during the winter. Movies began in April and continued through September. They were well patronized and the report shows that even with paying for some furnishings, we came out about even. In the fall pictures were shown in practically every little school around here. This was primarily to stimulate Fair interest, but as the pictures were along the line of farming, domestic science and health they were decidedly educational. 'he great ,community event of the year is the Gatlinburg Fair and this year it certainly did credit to the school, the community and the county. The exhibits were line and were brought from more homes than ever before. Several of the little schools made fine showings, even though they had little school material to work with. After this fair was over Mr. Mattil did the greater part in putting on a county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. The nurse also put on a tine health exhibit. The school exhibit received first prize of $15.00 and the county exhibit second prize, which gave us a neat sum to start next year's Fair on. Another year there will be a county Fair in Sevierville and 1 feel S.ECTTLEMr,NT SCHOOL 43 that with what we do here and what we should do to 'boost the ,county Fair it would be best not to make any effort to exhibit in Knoxville. The Christmas entertainment, Valentine parties, picnics, and socials during warm weather, keeping open house at `Tea(Thers' Cottage Friday and Saturday nights comprise the social side of the school, life. The crying need of the community is supervised play and recreation Saturday and Sunday afternoons the year round. Yet with every teacher working full time, some of them six (lays of the week, and then teaching Sunday School on Sunday, how can they give the one after-noon they have for their rest and recreation? We have talked and talked of finding some young man who would do that kind of work during the summer, but have never come to the point of really trying to locate one. Neither do I know whether it would be possible to find one to come for expenses only. Sugarlands needs work of this kind, too. When you see a crowd of boys going up and down and up and down the road all Sunday afternoon just looking for something to do you wonder they escape as much trouble as they do. And what saves even our dormitory boys over the week-end is more than I can tell. The barn is open for basketball some Sunday afternoons and ;base-ball is played more or less during the summer, but there should be someone in charge. Also a clubroom of some kind should be, kept open those afternoons. None of us are satisfied with the amount of community work we do, but with every hour full we seem unable to take over any more. Each summer more people come into the Burg, there are more at-tractions away from the simple pleasures the people have been used to and I feel that right now we should nmke a great effort to hold the young people to their church, their homes and their community life. I still feel that one of the best things we are doing and one most appreciated is sending out the Gatlinburg News each month. Five hundred copies are printed and 25O go up and down these creeks and are really read. It is one of the pieces of real work that we feel well re-paid for doing. EXTENSION: Each year the question of extension comes up and each time under different circumstances. The Sugarlancls work is well enough established so we do not need to question continuing so much as the best methods to pursue. With the county furnishing eight months of free school we have not had to supplement any salaries in Sugarlands for grade work. Our help was with cooking, sewing, agriculture and adult work. The work in Laurel Lick has been along this line only. Several times Dr. Ogle and the County Superintendent have asked us why we did not investigate Laurel Lick field with a view toe helping there. Our answer has been that we had now about all we could manage. This year Miss Barrett has been very much interested and would like to take the primary room there next year. The county would pay sufficient salary to be equiv.-. alent to what she received here last year. The problem would be the 44 THE ARROW OE' PI BETA PHI living. She could not live alone, neither is there a suitable place for her to board. She has thought that possibly some girl working for her Master s Degree might be interested in spending a year there, coming for expenses only and possibly being willing even to pay those herself. This would furnish someone to help with community work. Helen and I figured that if we did anything toward making a cab-in habitable and getting any supplies whatever it would mean putting about $500.00 into the venture. She said she was willing to try to raise enough to finance the project, but I discouraged that thinking it Would keep funds out of the budget. Through the hair, meetings in different schools, visits of the nurse to weigh and measure children, agriculture classes in Sugarlands and Laurel Lick and some work done in other schools, we have been able to do a good deal for these other schools and with good results. SUGARLANDS : Sugarlands created a good deal of worry and trouble in the late summer. This was due first of all to an uncertainty in regard to Miss Chew being able to return to her work there, then to carelessness on my part in applying to one of the school ;board who thought I should ask him for the school. Cora McCarter had the same grades again, but the ones Miss Chew had were given to the board member's son-in-law. At first this made a good deal of trouble as the people wanted Miss Chew and we felt we had not had a square deal. Before many weeks we saw that it had been a fortunate move, rather than otherwise, for it gave Miss Chew the opportunity to try out adult school work there. Her work consisted in much visiting and answering calls at her house. 'Classes were held three afternoons in the school house after the regular school was dismissed. Thirteel boys were enrolled. One walked from the lumber camps across the mountain once a week. These boys were from fifteen to twenty years of age and doing work from first or second grade to a possible fourth or fifth. The older people were taught in their homes and several men and women over sixty years of age learned to. read and write. One was delighted that she could go to the mail box and tell to whom the letters were addressed. With the coming of bad weather it seemed best to discontinue these classes so Miss Chew took her vacation in January and February and will carry classes through the spring and summer. The State allowed us $212.50 on Miss Chew's salary for the fall term and says it will continue to help us this spring. Mrs. Stark called a meeting when she was here so that the county board and Sugarlands people could come to some agreement and also that she could have some idea of how each group stood. The people later signed a paper stating that they were willing to call this year one of the four required ones to give a clear title to the land and the county board gave a written statement showing their willingness to co-operate hereafter. Nothing has discouraged the people in Sugarlands so much as not having a teachers' cottage started yet. They feel they have been prom SETTLEMriNT SCHOOL R-C,PORTS 45 ised it and that were it there they would be assured the Pi Phis were there to stay. Then several men hoped for work on the building. The county school term has been eight months, which has meant the county has financed the teaching of the school. The board has again promised a new school building to be completed by opening of next term. Our allowance of $1,600 for Sugarlands has not been used this year, therefore, I would recommend the balance left be used in helping build a teachers' cottage, it being added to the Hazel Todd Meaden Fund, if that is released. I would. recommend also that the adult work be continued another year if possible. Miss Chew's report gives the list of community activities. IMPROVEMENTS MADE DURING THE YEAR: Rock walks laid around the cottages. New flue built for Pollard Cottage. Incubator house built-one half to be used for root store house. Full time weaving teacher engaged. Third year added to high school. Engine and wood house rebuilt, making new store. Redressing school desks. Guttering and draining around schoolhouse. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR: Farmer and supervisor of boys' work engaged. Gift shop plans adopted for the summer. Central dining hall. Purchasing agent to plan meals and manage girls' dormitory, living in the dormitory. Office helper and sufficient office equipment, including typewriter, adding machine and desk. Scale of salary increase for teaching experience in the school. Teacher in boys' dormitory. Community worker for Saturdays and Sundays during the summer. Teachers' cottage in Sugarlands. Schoolhouse started or room added to present building. In closing my report I again want to express my appreciation of the entire staff and the committee. Again, I say that but for the sympathy and help each has so willingly given the other the year's program never could have been carried on so successfully. These are the things that give joy to the work here and .make us all loath to give up our connection with the School and Pi Phi work. EVELYN BISHOP, Head Resident. 46 T r. ARRow ov PI BETA PHI DIGEST ()F MINUTES Settlement School Conanittee Meeting, March 5, 1926 A full membership was present. The membership, with permission of Grand Council, met (luring tlni School session, which proved a great success, as this gave the committee a better working knowledge of conditions at the School, and a more sympathetic understanding of the staff. Hereafter, all weaving work will have the trademark of the Settlement School, which is in the form of a, blue paper sticker with red design. A branding iron carrying the trademark will be used on bas kets and furniture. The Committee decided to build the industrial unit to the new school building with the funds now available. Several gifts from individuals, and one bequest, together with certain sums voted from interests and current expenses, have helped increase this fund to such an amount as to encourage our undertaking this enterprise. The need of such is most apparent. This building will probably be a memorial building. The School plant is in very good condition. No excessive expense is necessary for the repairs as it has been our policy to keep the buildings in as good condition as possible. There may be some necessary painting work to be done. As usual, the School, its staff and problems took considerable time. Evelyn Bishop was re-elected as Head Resident. Margaret White is to be Principal of the higher grades. Emily Burton is to return after a leave of absence for one year. Marian Folsom and Elmer Watson were re-elected. Lois Rogers resigned to be office assistant to the Head Resident. Mrs. E. A. Bishop was elected to become Matron of the Girls' Dormitory, purchasing agent, and supervisor of the central dining room. Mrs. Dowell is to have charge of noon lunches for all school pupils, and Matron of the Boys' Dormitory. Jean Steele and O. J. Mattil were re-elected to carry on the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science and Agricultural work, respectively. Winogene Redding will be the teacher and super-visor of the weaving department. Too much praise cannot be given to her success along these lines. Some changes have been made in the running of the School. There are to be two principals, one for lower grade work, one for high school work. There are to be two primary teachers, as this class has grown so, owing to the consolidation of several schools. There are to be noon lunches for all pupils. This is to be self-supporting if possible. The basement of the School will be converted in classrooms for primary grades. An extra office in the Teftchers' Cottage will be in the room now used as a downstairs bedroom. All books in the Library are to be catalogued or repaired. A fifth and sixth grade teacher has to be elected, also principal of lower grades. A teacher's salary is to be fifty dollars per month for the first year, fifty-five dollars for the third year, SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 47 and sixty for the fourth year and sixty-five for the fifth year. The price of all orders for industrial work, other than from alumnae clubs, shall be increased 25%. Color cards and samples of weaving are to be sent upon request.. Alumnae Clubs are offered 1% discount for cash within 30 days from date of invoice. Board paid by new teachers is to be increased to $20.00 per month. Miss Higinbotham was granted six month's leave. Another nurse is to take her place. Requests for a typewriter and a ear discussed. An assistant to the nurse was authorized again, and Lizzie Reagan was elected as Harmo Taylor resigned. The Hazel Todd Meaden Memorial House is to be.. built at the Emma Harper Turner Center. Helen Chew was elected as head of the work, and she, with the assistance of head Resident, secured another 1)i Phi teacher, and will dictate the policy at this center. Smith-Hughes adult Education Fund again solicited. The County is building a very nice new school building at the Emma Harper Turner Center. It is with deep regret that we announce the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham. She is to become State Supervisor of Public Health Nursing of Tennessee. I could write a' lengthy eulogy on Miss Higinbotham. I could tell you of the hours of pure drudgery that she has gone through. I could tell you of thousands and thousands of such things and still would not have half begun. All who have known her and have seen .her know that contact with her has made them a better person to live in this world. Guests who desire to stay more than week ends in the school are to be charged at the rate of $1.00 a day. The fiscal year of the school has been changed to close on June 30. A reorganization of the industrial department and work is to be made. It is probable that a definite wholesale price schedule will be adopted, slightly higher than in the past to provide for increased cost of maintenance of the department and of materials, with standard discounts for quantity buying.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon." If you have not read these articles it has been your loss, as they have been full of human interest. She is certainly a most ardent worker of our School and her ability and personality make a happy combination. Dorothy Smallwood Geare has done a splendid work in sending out information to those members not belonging to any alumnae club. We feel that these members should be a part of this great work and it has been our plan to get them interested in this way in the School. Gertrude Brown Freeman has successfully followed Mrs. Curtis as the Ways and Means member of the committee. I have found her ad-vice on the committee matters instructive and enlightening and feel that she has been a decided asset. Owing to illness, Ethel Curryer could not start her work until November. When you read her report you will see that she has carried her part through in a manner that would do credit to a most experienced bookkeeper. Our work has increased to such a degree that she, at times, has had to do the work of three people rather than one. She has been patient and efficient and we are indeed fortunate in having such a treasurer for the Settlement School. Each of the committee, as well as I, feel that we are fortunate in being able to serve you in this undertaking a work that has been hard that has not been altogether happy at times--that has been exacting and time claiming when we could have been enjoying ourselves at Convention. But, being a work of such high ideals, we feel that no matter what effort it cost us it was worth it all. And, again, let us express to you our sincere appreciation of the opportunity for being a part of the greatest altruistic work any fraternity in America has ever undertaken. Remember, this School is yours. How successful its future is depends upon you. Do you want it to stand still? I think not. Do you want it to become better in every way? Your answer to this is in increased donations. NITA HILL STARK, Chairman. 50 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI REPORT OF THE TREASURER OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records a'nd accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., for the period 1925--1926 ending April 30, 1926. The books were audited and records checked for the period covering your term as treasurer and we have made a combined report for the entire year using a part of the previous Auditor's statements for the first few months of the 1925 term and wish to state that while we assume no responsibility for his figures we test checked and verified same whenever it seemed expedient to do so. We have verified the Bank Balance and all deposits and securities. All postings in the General Ledger were checked with the Journal and Check Register and all totals in all of the books were verified. All receipts were checked and verified with the checks issued in payment of same and all Invoices and Credit Memos were thoroughly examined, being checked against both the Journal and Check Register.

She therefore reports under these two heads: I. CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files.

        34 THE ARROW Or PT BETA Pin the boys and girls during the spring term as well as helping us tinancially. The 7th, Sth and high school had nine months of school. Increase in enrollment next year is going to depend much on whether or not we have room to accommodate more. With any out-side school coming in the lower grades will be affected and they are now the over-crowded ones. Forty-five in the primary room has been almost impossible this. year and we can now count twenty little folks coming into that room another year with only ten going out. If no other school came in those grades might be carried by one teacher and a local girl as assistant, but I would not advise it. At any rate there would have to be a place to put them. Helen Barrett had splendid success with the little ones and even though she was compelled to go home at the beginning of the last month I feel that her pupils had the equivalent of a full year. The last month Ann Claho taught those grades and with very good results. Emily Burton writes that she is ready to come back again next year if we still want her and I am sure there is no doubt of that. Helen Barrett is very much interested in the Laurel Lick school, but. that is all so uncertain now we have no idea what may open up. The domestic science, agriculture and weaving departments have been carried on very successfully this year. The great gain that I feel has been made in the school is -due to a great extent to the cooperation among the teachers. While each room or each department is separate, to quite an extent, there is a sympathetic understanding among the teachers that does make for a good school and real development. The teachers are doing good, conscientious work and deserve a great deal of commendation for what they have accomplished. HIGH ScHou: The third year was added to the high school course this year. We have not been able to get an inspector out this year so are not yet on the accredited list. The County Superintendent feels there is no doubt about our grade of work. The state has added to the number of high schools in the state and to the requirements of teachers, etc., so the inspectors have been busy the entire year looking after the four year high schools. One promises to visit us ..before school closes this spring. The law required at least seven in each high school class so from that standpoint we are going to have hard work to qualify as a Grade A two-year high school. Three will complete third year this spring. We take a chance of someone dropping. On the other hand someone may come in in the fall. Our science work will be weak if we have fourth year, especially if we have no more room than we have now. There is not the incentive for hard work in small classes that there is where there is competition. Again, the roads are good enough and taxies running at reg ular hours so anyone wanting to go to Sevierville for high school work can make the trip night and morning. Against this we have the question of the morale of our own school. If we take out the older boys SETTLEM1 NT Sciroor, RIO.'ORTS 35 and girls we do weaken our school to quite an extent, especially in athletics. I feel sure we should not even consider adding the fourth year of high school until there are more class. 'rooms. The class entering high school next year will be small, one of the weakest classes we have had for some time, but the class following will more than make up for it. It seems to me it is hardly possible to make definite recommendations for next year without knowing what the decision will be in regard to building. This past year the third year work was done without ,adding an extra teacher so I feel sure we did well to add the work, but I am not sure how much more work we should add. In writing this report you will see that many times I have stressed the development of school. work because of experienced teachers having it in charge. This brings us to the question of staff' for another year. We start the new teachers at $GO.O( per month, home and travel. At the end of two, four, even eight years of work here the salary re-mains the same. This hardly seems fair yet our budget swells each year and an increase in salary seems almost impossible. Where we can cut down on expenses I do not know, nor do I see how we can increase our monthly expenses much, but I do feel there should be some way whereby we compensate the teachers for theirexperience and feel it shou'ld have consideration now. AGRICULTURE: Each morning is given over entirely to school work of this school. The classes are in agriculture and in farm shop. Instead of the. usual manual training these boys do more along the lino of farm carpentry work. They are urged to bring to the class things from home that need repairing and they are asked to make a list of things they want to make for their farms. With the text book work in agriculture, fruit growing, animal husbandry, etc., there are field trips and much practical work put in.. The afternoons are reserved for community -work and for classes in some of the other schools. One afternoon each week Mr. Mattil goes to the Sugarlands, another to Laurel Lick. Laurel hick is a new field and one taken over at the request of the teacher of the school. The people are really needy and are anxious to make the most of help that comes to them so it has been a very satisfactory field to work in. The other afternoons are given over to community work. This includes seeing sick animals, looking over poultry flocks, giving advice about pruning, spraying, etc. Because of the interest aroused in a poultry class last year some of the men have been marketing their poultry products this year with a view to taking up the business in a larger way soon. This spring a large incubator house was built and a large incubator gotten. This, of course, called for an enlargement to the broader house. The idea is to do most of the community hatching hero, the people to pay for the chicks. 36 THE ARROW of Pf BETA PHI The farm has been improved Quite a little and the stock quite care-fully taken care of. In the fall, Mr. Mattil had meetings in nearly every little school-house. He took a generator, Ford and moving pictures and many people saw movies for the first time. They were both entertaining and instructive, so, we felt did a good deal of good. The Gatlinburg Community Fair is a big event each year and one that Mr. Mattil shobld receive a great deal of credit for. Each year the school exhibits, the agricultural and home science exhibits are so much better than the year before. More people from up in the creeks come and bring something. Following this fair Mr. Mattil did the greater part of the work of putting a county exhibit up at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. It won third prize, which gave a good little sum to start our fair on next year. This whole department is doing a splendid work and filling a real need in the community and the school. Mr. Mattil will attend Cornell University this summer. DOMESTIC SCIENCE: This is another department that continues through the entire twelve months instead of the school year only. At the close of the school year Jean Steele started classes in Cartertown and Gatlinburg and continued the Sugarlands work for both girls and women. Much time was spent in visiting and trying to interest the women. It had ,been very hard twpersuade any women in the Burg to come to afternoon classes, but Jean helped several start their sewing and as some others wanted to can before Fair time she worked up a very good class. With the opening of school on August 1, the Cartertown class was discontinued, but the others went on in exactly the same way. The high school girls had classes in the morning so Jean could have the entire afternoon free for community work. This was all right for that department, but it made it extremely difficult to arrange a scedule in the school and necessitated having some high school classes at 7:30 in the morning. So much practical work the year before and not enough text book courses made it necessary to divide the high school domestic science classes so they would do extra work and bring the year's work up to standard. In the report of last year I explained the arrangements for teachers, Jean Steele to finish the spring term and continue the summer classes. Then carry the school work again until Christmas when she would go back to college and Barbara Dewell return. Even at the risk of losing state aid for this department if we discontinued some of the adult classes, we rearranged the schedule after Christmas so Barbara Dewell could take three grade classes and could put some of her high school work in the afternoon. This has relieved both teachers and pupils. The weather was too rough during January and February to have had classes in Sugarlands, but with the close of school this spring, those will be taken up again as well as work in one or two communities. SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 37 The State paid five-eighths of the salary of the domestic science teacher and no doubt will do so through the summer. Although we really are not qualifying for ,it now I believe we will be allowed it just the same. In the winter the state supervisor said that she would approve whoever we had to take the work after Miss Steele left, so l expect Barbara Dewell will continue through July. No great expense has been put into the domestic science room nor into equipment but paint, some changes in furnishings, two more windows and a lot of work have made it look fresher and brighter. A new ceiling has made the room more quiet. Investigation was made regarding steam heat for the room, but that did not prove to be possible so the range has answered all purposes and has been fairly satisfactory. The room has also been used for three grade classes. With more community work for the women and high school classes so well organized I feel this department has accomplished a great deal the past year. WEAVING: This year we have had a full time weaving teacher as recommended last spring. Winogene Redding came at the beginning of the second month of school. The looms took another move last fall, being put into the room that had been finished off for a store room under the porch of the Stuart Cottage. This was a great improvement over the log cabin, not only because of giving more light and room, but also bringing them a little nearer the school. All the looms needed overhauling and repairing so it was some little time before work could really begin. Another discouraging thing was that the eighth grade (which is the only one having weaving) is by far the weakest in the school. The girls are slow and not keen for the work. Finally, Miss Redding decided that some in the seventh grade who were older and were anxious to learn weaving should have the opportunity and since they have joined the class the work has taken on more life. Part of the morning is taken up answering calls at the house. All the afternoons are spent in, the various homes. Gene walks miles and miles and during the cold winter months has found it impossible even to be fairly comfortable when she is in the homes as they have been so very cold. The women have been very much interested and would do even more weaving than they do were we in position to keep buying their products in such large quantities. There has been a perfect craze for weaving and the children and the men are nearly as clever at it as the women. Of course, with the spring and summer farm work be-ginning, they will not have so much time for weaving. New patterns, new materials and a variety of things are being made. This time of year. we buy much more than we sell, but it is necessary in order to be ready for the fall. Miss Redding's report shows beyond question how important a full time weaving teacher is and if she returns another year that department will show still more improvement. 38 THE ARROW ov PI BETA PHI We still are handicapped because of lack of room .and until it can be provided we cannot purchase a larger loom or any other equipment. INDUSTRIAL: industrial business has grown to such an extent it really takes more time and work than any other one department, believe. This year we have bought and sold chairs, stools, weaving and baskets. As the Auditor's report will show: Total. purchases $7,552.1 0 Total sales 7,299.57 Net Loss $ 252.59 An inventory of our stock o hand shows that we have $2,360.7'1 Subtracting the total loss 2'''2.59 We have a gain of $2,10512 These figures give some idea of the immense amount of time that must be used in buying the timings from the people, packing and ship-ping them. The correspondence takes the treater part of the orrice time and even then flinch is not kept up as it should be. With the end of the school year we will practically stop buying weaving; baskets and .chairs come in more or less all summer. It is necessary to buy heavily in the spring, when the people have more time to work on baskets and weaving, in order to be ready for the fall sales. Last fall we were ,completely sold out several times and had the people working as fast as they possibly could to till the Christmas orders. The profit on the business is small and were we to consider our time spent in carrying it on we would find it was being run at a loss. I'lowever, there is another side. Many families are self-supporting because of this. Then by selling from here at a small profit the clubs can afford to handle the products and what money they make usually comes back into the school treasury. GIFT Snow : The Gift Shop has proven a success in its first month of operation. The sales amounted to practically $1,000 for the month of May, against $350 for the same month last year. BOYS DORMITORY : Leander and Mrs. McCarter lived on the hill again this year, Mrs. McCarter doing the cooking and housekeeping in return for board for her husband, daughter and part of the time for her son.. They are thoroughly good people and made a good home for the A:Joys. However, the house really needs a teacher or someone who has had more advantages and experience. The study hour needs supervision, the personal appearance. of the boys needs care, the house could be more home like. With the next year we hope for a central dining, room and that will no doubt be of great help. Twelve boys have lived in the dormitory, eight being about the average number. All the boys have been SETTLEmr.IN"l' SCHOOL REPoRTS required to work and the latter part of the year were given at. least si: hours of work during the 'week and five on Saturday in case the; stayed over the week-end. No work can be so very satisfactory withou regular supervision, but, on the whole the boys tried to do and thei failure was not so much from lack of willingness as from the right kim of daily supervision. The boys staying in the dormitory are the olds. boys of the school. It is always rather of a task to hold their interest If anything comes up to upset them much their first thought is to sto' school. The care and advice of someoneJ realizing their problems wont be of great help to the ;boys and the School. CONSOLIDATION: Talking has done little from year to year towar, bringing consolidation, but good roads are doing much. Last year th Cartertown School was discontinued and the pupils had to go to th Glades or here. Nearly all chose this School. There was no chanc of getting a wagon on the road in the fall, so we ran our truck a mil and a half each night and morning to help the children. This made th trip so much. easier that even the little ones came very regularly the fins five months of school. After Christmas the roads were to() bad for u to continue and due to one member of the School Board, no wage could be put en that road to bring the children. Some continued t walk, but many had to .stop, There is every indication of two sma schools coming in here in the fall. Of course they may not come. 1 any school does come in the rooms affected will be the primary o.ne With 47 children now in the primary room and no definite action take regard to building, I do not feel we can urge consolidation for th fall-surely not until we have dedided on our program. Another roux and another teacher are necessary. GIRLS' DORMITORY : The entire year has been very satisfactory in th girls' dormitory. Mrs. Chapin returned at the opening of the scho year. As she had been here before she knew right where to take u the work and things went on with very little difficulty. During the summer several girls worked in homes and after scho( opened continued to stay, receiving their board for work done. This, i addition to the number of families moving into the Burg accounts fc the smaller number in the cottage. Only six girls stayed in the do: mitory. They all lived in the Pollard Cottage. Four of the teaches rooming in the Stuart Cottage took their meals in the Pollard Cottage, It was impossible for the high school girls to continue preparing ti, noon meal at the school for the teachers and dormitory girls, as the did last year. It took all the class time from anything but the pray teal part of the course. Because of this and to relieve the teachers ( all house responsibility we have had a cook in the girls' dormitory ti entire year. The first of November Mrs. Chapin had to leave. We saw at one it would never do to finish the year with no head to the house so mot] er came for two weeks. After Christmas she returned and finished tl year. 40 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI' Surely there can be no complaint in regard to the care of the teachers this year. They have had comfortable rooms and enough to eat and no care whatever of the meals or dormitory girls. If there has been any discontent among them I do not know of it. CENTRAL DINING HALL : On the recommendation of Mrs. Stark and Mrs. Freeman last October, as well as the judgment of all, we have been planning for a central dining ball. Mrs. Stark has suggested the new school building possibly providing a place. In looking over the cottages I have felt we could arrange for the meals withopt going to the school building for them. Were all to take meals in the Teachers Cottage we would need to make changes that would have to be more or less permanent and hard to undo in case they were not satisfactory. If we use the Pollard Cottage next year we could make few changes and none that would necessitate rebuilding. By using the dining room and the downstairs teacher's room as dining rooms there would be sufficient room to take care of all the family we have. Some changes would need to be made in furnishings, but I do not think very expensive ones. This plan would mean boys, girls and teachers having meals together. Some feel this is not a wise plan, but I believe it will work out here and at least we can try it for one year. HEALTH DEPARTMENT : This department continues to be an out standing one and there never is any question of the tremendous amount accomplished for the schools and for the community. Yet, I do some-times think we take much of it for granted just because it is managed so very well. The report of Phyllis Higinbotham gives the details of the work. Dental clinics that used to be once in a while, if at all, are now regular things. The dentist ,comes once a month and always has patients waiting for him. The office is used more and more, people coming for supplies, to see a doctor, for medicines, or to have babies weighed and measured. Dr. Ogle continues to come in once a week or oftener and his services mean much to us. More school work has been done than ever before. A class in hygiene once a week at Sugarlands, pupils weighed and measured in all the nearby schools, some work clone at Laurel Lick make a pretty full school program. With this there was, of course, the smallpox and typhoid vaccinations. There was every indication of a bad typhoid epidemic in the county and I feel but for the hundreds who took the se-rum we might have had a hard time. While this district is very free from it, cases are brought in from nearby places. A college girl to assist in the office and with the school work continues to be most satisfactory, much more so than another nurse would be. The records have been put into good condition, office calls answered, correspondence attended to and many more things done to relieve the nurse. While Harmo Taylor was away in the winter a local girl took SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 41 her place and this spring will assist again as both Harm() and Lois Rogers will be in the Gift Shop. The next point is one I dread even to mention. Phyllis felt last year that she should resign because of her home people. She finally decided to come back for another year, but comes again to the same place she was last summer. In handing in her resignation I felt she should ask only for six months' leave, then i f she found she could come back the place would be here for her. In the meantime we should try to find someone for the temporary place who would probably stay on in case Phyllis .could not return. It is hard to imagine either that department or the school without Phyllis, and I feel we will suffer a great loss. I strongly recommend that Phyllis be granted a six months' leave with the understanding she return at the end of that time if possible. HEALTH UNIT : The past year we have again cooperated with the county in maintaining a county health unit. This does not in any way hamper our work and does make a good many things available, free vaccine for small pox and typhoid inoculations, clinics with county health doctor in ,charge, state specialists and visitors coming to give assistance and advice. Beside these we receive from the state about $500.00 more than we put in. This furnishes a means of getting filing cabinet, auto mileage, some travel allowances and we hope this year will all or partly furnish a typewriter for the office. To the surprise of the people of the county the court has for two years voted the health unit and we are hoping that again in October they will make a sufficient appropriation to make it possible. OFFICE: This year has showed beyond a doubt that the office work must be reorganized if it is to bekept up in anything like an efficient way. The office in the Teachers' Cottage has to be a general office. It is the only place anyone has to do office work, whether of school or industrial. It is the only place anyone has to talk business. This year extra congestion has been caused by having to do all of the work of the Gatlinburg News in the office. With the duties of house mother, pur chasing agent and the planning of meals combined there will be no time for the person having those things in charge to do any office work. Also with the constantly increasing amount of correspondence and desk work there is need of an assistant being in the office all the time. The past year there has not been time from routine office work for me scarcely to know what was going on around the place. FARM : In making a report on the farm I feel I should preface it by saying that the farm and the Smith-Hughes Agriculture in the School and the community are two separate things. In spite of the very dry weather the farm produced more than the year previous. We raised enough potatoes to carry us through the year, garden produce helped greatly on the living, we had at least fifty gallons of strawberries, fruit trees bore some, cows furnished all the milk we had and part of the 42 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI year all the butter. Beside this we had eggs, chickens, pork and beef from the farm. All the fields that were cultivated were put into hay and other fodder, saving quite a little on our hay bill. We have on the farm two horses of our own and one owned by Mr. Mattil, but kept by us as we use it nearly all the time, 3 cows, 3 calves, one bull, one goat, 1 boar, 1 brood sow and some small pigs, about 100 chickens. We fat few hogs as it pays better to sell the yotng pigs and also puts good stock into the community. This year the boys have clone the milking, cared for the horses, pigs, and chickens. They have clone fairly well with the work, but it has meant waste of feed and time. Mr. Mattil has supervised all he could and Leander McCarter has tried to, too, but it is a steady job and one that needs a person with it all the time. This coming year we should employ a man as farmer and supervisor of student labor, both for the good of the farm and for the good of the boys. I doubt if it would mean the cash outlay it appears for there would be saving in other ways. Were there a farmer here all the time much of the outside labor could be turned over to the boys or done away with entirely. Also with better roads and the nurse making more trips in a car an extra horse can be used nmeh of the time on the farm, saving the team hire we now have. COMMUNITY: As more people come into the Valley and the roads improve so our people get in and out more the community activities seem to grow less. Whether we really do less or merely feel that way is a question. At any rate it is harder to get the local people together. The teachers take an active part in Sunday School and B. Y. P. U. Helen Barrett had a Junior meeting Sunday afternoons for the tots from six to eleven years. Basketball games, either of theschool or community team, have taken at least one evening a week during the winter. Movies began in April and continued through September. They were well patronized and the report shows that even with paying for some furnishings, we came out about even. In the fall pictures were shown in practically every little school around here. This was primarily to stimulate Fair interest, but as the pictures were along the line of farming, domestic science and health they were decidedly educational. 'he great ,community event of the year is the Gatlinburg Fair and this year it certainly did credit to the school, the community and the county. The exhibits were line and were brought from more homes than ever before. Several of the little schools made fine showings, even though they had little school material to work with. After this fair was over Mr. Mattil did the greater part in putting on a county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. The nurse also put on a tine health exhibit. The school exhibit received first prize of $15.00 and the county exhibit second prize, which gave us a neat sum to start next year's Fair on. Another year there will be a county Fair in Sevierville and 1 feel S.ECTTLEMr,NT SCHOOL 43 that with what we do here and what we should do to 'boost the ,county Fair it would be best not to make any effort to exhibit in Knoxville. The Christmas entertainment, Valentine parties, picnics, and socials during warm weather, keeping open house at `Tea(Thers' Cottage Friday and Saturday nights comprise the social side of the school, life. The crying need of the community is supervised play and recreation Saturday and Sunday afternoons the year round. Yet with every teacher working full time, some of them six (lays of the week, and then teaching Sunday School on Sunday, how can they give the one after-noon they have for their rest and recreation? We have talked and talked of finding some young man who would do that kind of work during the summer, but have never come to the point of really trying to locate one. Neither do I know whether it would be possible to find one to come for expenses only. Sugarlands needs work of this kind, too. When you see a crowd of boys going up and down and up and down the road all Sunday afternoon just looking for something to do you wonder they escape as much trouble as they do. And what saves even our dormitory boys over the week-end is more than I can tell. The barn is open for basketball some Sunday afternoons and ;base-ball is played more or less during the summer, but there should be someone in charge. Also a clubroom of some kind should be, kept open those afternoons. None of us are satisfied with the amount of community work we do, but with every hour full we seem unable to take over any more. Each summer more people come into the Burg, there are more at-tractions away from the simple pleasures the people have been used to and I feel that right now we should nmke a great effort to hold the young people to their church, their homes and their community life. I still feel that one of the best things we are doing and one most appreciated is sending out the Gatlinburg News each month. Five hundred copies are printed and 25O go up and down these creeks and are really read. It is one of the pieces of real work that we feel well re-paid for doing. EXTENSION: Each year the question of extension comes up and each time under different circumstances. The Sugarlancls work is well enough established so we do not need to question continuing so much as the best methods to pursue. With the county furnishing eight months of free school we have not had to supplement any salaries in Sugarlands for grade work. Our help was with cooking, sewing, agriculture and adult work. The work in Laurel Lick has been along this line only. Several times Dr. Ogle and the County Superintendent have asked us why we did not investigate Laurel Lick field with a view toe helping there. Our answer has been that we had now about all we could manage. This year Miss Barrett has been very much interested and would like to take the primary room there next year. The county would pay sufficient salary to be equiv.-. alent to what she received here last year. The problem would be the 44 THE ARROW OE' PI BETA PHI living. She could not live alone, neither is there a suitable place for her to board. She has thought that possibly some girl working for her Master s Degree might be interested in spending a year there, coming for expenses only and possibly being willing even to pay those herself. This would furnish someone to help with community work. Helen and I figured that if we did anything toward making a cab-in habitable and getting any supplies whatever it would mean putting about $500.00 into the venture. She said she was willing to try to raise enough to finance the project, but I discouraged that thinking it Would keep funds out of the budget. Through the hair, meetings in different schools, visits of the nurse to weigh and measure children, agriculture classes in Sugarlands and Laurel Lick and some work done in other schools, we have been able to do a good deal for these other schools and with good results. SUGARLANDS : Sugarlands created a good deal of worry and trouble in the late summer. This was due first of all to an uncertainty in regard to Miss Chew being able to return to her work there, then to carelessness on my part in applying to one of the school ;board who thought I should ask him for the school. Cora McCarter had the same grades again, but the ones Miss Chew had were given to the board member's son-in-law. At first this made a good deal of trouble as the people wanted Miss Chew and we felt we had not had a square deal. Before many weeks we saw that it had been a fortunate move, rather than otherwise, for it gave Miss Chew the opportunity to try out adult school work there. Her work consisted in much visiting and answering calls at her house. 'Classes were held three afternoons in the school house after the regular school was dismissed. Thirteel boys were enrolled. One walked from the lumber camps across the mountain once a week. These boys were from fifteen to twenty years of age and doing work from first or second grade to a possible fourth or fifth. The older people were taught in their homes and several men and women over sixty years of age learned to. read and write. One was delighted that she could go to the mail box and tell to whom the letters were addressed. With the coming of bad weather it seemed best to discontinue these classes so Miss Chew took her vacation in January and February and will carry classes through the spring and summer. The State allowed us $212.50 on Miss Chew's salary for the fall term and says it will continue to help us this spring. Mrs. Stark called a meeting when she was here so that the county board and Sugarlands people could come to some agreement and also that she could have some idea of how each group stood. The people later signed a paper stating that they were willing to call this year one of the four required ones to give a clear title to the land and the county board gave a written statement showing their willingness to co-operate hereafter. Nothing has discouraged the people in Sugarlands so much as not having a teachers' cottage started yet. They feel they have been prom SETTLEMriNT SCHOOL R-C,PORTS 45 ised it and that were it there they would be assured the Pi Phis were there to stay. Then several men hoped for work on the building. The county school term has been eight months, which has meant the county has financed the teaching of the school. The board has again promised a new school building to be completed by opening of next term. Our allowance of $1,600 for Sugarlands has not been used this year, therefore, I would recommend the balance left be used in helping build a teachers' cottage, it being added to the Hazel Todd Meaden Fund, if that is released. I would. recommend also that the adult work be continued another year if possible. Miss Chew's report gives the list of community activities. IMPROVEMENTS MADE DURING THE YEAR: Rock walks laid around the cottages. New flue built for Pollard Cottage. Incubator house built-one half to be used for root store house. Full time weaving teacher engaged. Third year added to high school. Engine and wood house rebuilt, making new store. Redressing school desks. Guttering and draining around schoolhouse. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR: Farmer and supervisor of boys' work engaged. Gift shop plans adopted for the summer. Central dining hall. Purchasing agent to plan meals and manage girls' dormitory, living in the dormitory. Office helper and sufficient office equipment, including typewriter, adding machine and desk. Scale of salary increase for teaching experience in the school. Teacher in boys' dormitory. Community worker for Saturdays and Sundays during the summer. Teachers' cottage in Sugarlands. Schoolhouse started or room added to present building. In closing my report I again want to express my appreciation of the entire staff and the committee. Again, I say that but for the sympathy and help each has so willingly given the other the year's program never could have been carried on so successfully. These are the things that give joy to the work here and .make us all loath to give up our connection with the School and Pi Phi work. EVELYN BISHOP, Head Resident. 46 T r. ARRow ov PI BETA PHI DIGEST ()F MINUTES Settlement School Conanittee Meeting, March 5, 1926 A full membership was present. The membership, with permission of Grand Council, met (luring tlni School session, which proved a great success, as this gave the committee a better working knowledge of conditions at the School, and a more sympathetic understanding of the staff. Hereafter, all weaving work will have the trademark of the Settlement School, which is in the form of a, blue paper sticker with red design. A branding iron carrying the trademark will be used on bas kets and furniture. The Committee decided to build the industrial unit to the new school building with the funds now available. Several gifts from individuals, and one bequest, together with certain sums voted from interests and current expenses, have helped increase this fund to such an amount as to encourage our undertaking this enterprise. The need of such is most apparent. This building will probably be a memorial building. The School plant is in very good condition. No excessive expense is necessary for the repairs as it has been our policy to keep the buildings in as good condition as possible. There may be some necessary painting work to be done. As usual, the School, its staff and problems took considerable time. Evelyn Bishop was re-elected as Head Resident. Margaret White is to be Principal of the higher grades. Emily Burton is to return after a leave of absence for one year. Marian Folsom and Elmer Watson were re-elected. Lois Rogers resigned to be office assistant to the Head Resident. Mrs. E. A. Bishop was elected to become Matron of the Girls' Dormitory, purchasing agent, and supervisor of the central dining room. Mrs. Dowell is to have charge of noon lunches for all school pupils, and Matron of the Boys' Dormitory. Jean Steele and O. J. Mattil were re-elected to carry on the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science and Agricultural work, respectively. Winogene Redding will be the teacher and super-visor of the weaving department. Too much praise cannot be given to her success along these lines. Some changes have been made in the running of the School. There are to be two principals, one for lower grade work, one for high school work. There are to be two primary teachers, as this class has grown so, owing to the consolidation of several schools. There are to be noon lunches for all pupils. This is to be self-supporting if possible. The basement of the School will be converted in classrooms for primary grades. An extra office in the Teftchers' Cottage will be in the room now used as a downstairs bedroom. All books in the Library are to be catalogued or repaired. A fifth and sixth grade teacher has to be elected, also principal of lower grades. A teacher's salary is to be fifty dollars per month for the first year, fifty-five dollars for the third year, SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 47 and sixty for the fourth year and sixty-five for the fifth year. The price of all orders for industrial work, other than from alumnae clubs, shall be increased 25%. Color cards and samples of weaving are to be sent upon request.. Alumnae Clubs are offered 1% discount for cash within 30 days from date of invoice. Board paid by new teachers is to be increased to $20.00 per month. Miss Higinbotham was granted six month's leave. Another nurse is to take her place. Requests for a typewriter and a ear discussed. An assistant to the nurse was authorized again, and Lizzie Reagan was elected as Harmo Taylor resigned. The Hazel Todd Meaden Memorial House is to be.. built at the Emma Harper Turner Center. Helen Chew was elected as head of the work, and she, with the assistance of head Resident, secured another 1)i Phi teacher, and will dictate the policy at this center. Smith-Hughes adult Education Fund again solicited. The County is building a very nice new school building at the Emma Harper Turner Center. It is with deep regret that we announce the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham. She is to become State Supervisor of Public Health Nursing of Tennessee. I could write a' lengthy eulogy on Miss Higinbotham. I could tell you of the hours of pure drudgery that she has gone through. I could tell you of thousands and thousands of such things and still would not have half begun. All who have known her and have seen .her know that contact with her has made them a better person to live in this world. Guests who desire to stay more than week ends in the school are to be charged at the rate of $1.00 a day. The fiscal year of the school has been changed to close on June 30. A reorganization of the industrial department and work is to be made. It is probable that a definite wholesale price schedule will be adopted, slightly higher than in the past to provide for increased cost of maintenance of the department and of materials, with standard discounts for quantity buying.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon." If you have not read these articles it has been your loss, as they have been full of human interest. She is certainly a most ardent worker of our School and her ability and personality make a happy combination. Dorothy Smallwood Geare has done a splendid work in sending out information to those members not belonging to any alumnae club. We feel that these members should be a part of this great work and it has been our plan to get them interested in this way in the School. Gertrude Brown Freeman has successfully followed Mrs. Curtis as the Ways and Means member of the committee. I have found her ad-vice on the committee matters instructive and enlightening and feel that she has been a decided asset. Owing to illness, Ethel Curryer could not start her work until November. When you read her report you will see that she has carried her part through in a manner that would do credit to a most experienced bookkeeper. Our work has increased to such a degree that she, at times, has had to do the work of three people rather than one. She has been patient and efficient and we are indeed fortunate in having such a treasurer for the Settlement School. Each of the committee, as well as I, feel that we are fortunate in being able to serve you in this undertaking a work that has been hard that has not been altogether happy at times--that has been exacting and time claiming when we could have been enjoying ourselves at Convention. But, being a work of such high ideals, we feel that no matter what effort it cost us it was worth it all. And, again, let us express to you our sincere appreciation of the opportunity for being a part of the greatest altruistic work any fraternity in America has ever undertaken. Remember, this School is yours. How successful its future is depends upon you. Do you want it to stand still? I think not. Do you want it to become better in every way? Your answer to this is in increased donations. NITA HILL STARK, Chairman. 50 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI REPORT OF THE TREASURER OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records a'nd accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., for the period 1925--1926 ending April 30, 1926. The books were audited and records checked for the period covering your term as treasurer and we have made a combined report for the entire year using a part of the previous Auditor's statements for the first few months of the 1925 term and wish to state that while we assume no responsibility for his figures we test checked and verified same whenever it seemed expedient to do so. We have verified the Bank Balance and all deposits and securities.

Sterrett 5.00 REPORT OF THE CATALOGUER The work of the Cataloguer for 1925-26 has consisted of two distinct parts, regular Catalogue work, and the opening of the new Central Record and Supply Office. She therefore reports under these two heads: I. CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files.

        36 THE ARROW of Pf BETA PHI The farm has been improved Quite a little and the stock quite care-fully taken care of. In the fall, Mr. Mattil had meetings in nearly every little school-house. He took a generator, Ford and moving pictures and many people saw movies for the first time. They were both entertaining and instructive, so, we felt did a good deal of good. The Gatlinburg Community Fair is a big event each year and one that Mr. Mattil shobld receive a great deal of credit for. Each year the school exhibits, the agricultural and home science exhibits are so much better than the year before. More people from up in the creeks come and bring something. Following this fair Mr. Mattil did the greater part of the work of putting a county exhibit up at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. It won third prize, which gave a good little sum to start our fair on next year. This whole department is doing a splendid work and filling a real need in the community and the school. Mr. Mattil will attend Cornell University this summer. DOMESTIC SCIENCE: This is another department that continues through the entire twelve months instead of the school year only. At the close of the school year Jean Steele started classes in Cartertown and Gatlinburg and continued the Sugarlands work for both girls and women. Much time was spent in visiting and trying to interest the women. It had ,been very hard twpersuade any women in the Burg to come to afternoon classes, but Jean helped several start their sewing and as some others wanted to can before Fair time she worked up a very good class. With the opening of school on August 1, the Cartertown class was discontinued, but the others went on in exactly the same way. The high school girls had classes in the morning so Jean could have the entire afternoon free for community work. This was all right for that department, but it made it extremely difficult to arrange a scedule in the school and necessitated having some high school classes at 7:30 in the morning. So much practical work the year before and not enough text book courses made it necessary to divide the high school domestic science classes so they would do extra work and bring the year's work up to standard. In the report of last year I explained the arrangements for teachers, Jean Steele to finish the spring term and continue the summer classes. Then carry the school work again until Christmas when she would go back to college and Barbara Dewell return. Even at the risk of losing state aid for this department if we discontinued some of the adult classes, we rearranged the schedule after Christmas so Barbara Dewell could take three grade classes and could put some of her high school work in the afternoon. This has relieved both teachers and pupils. The weather was too rough during January and February to have had classes in Sugarlands, but with the close of school this spring, those will be taken up again as well as work in one or two communities. SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 37 The State paid five-eighths of the salary of the domestic science teacher and no doubt will do so through the summer. Although we really are not qualifying for ,it now I believe we will be allowed it just the same. In the winter the state supervisor said that she would approve whoever we had to take the work after Miss Steele left, so l expect Barbara Dewell will continue through July. No great expense has been put into the domestic science room nor into equipment but paint, some changes in furnishings, two more windows and a lot of work have made it look fresher and brighter. A new ceiling has made the room more quiet. Investigation was made regarding steam heat for the room, but that did not prove to be possible so the range has answered all purposes and has been fairly satisfactory. The room has also been used for three grade classes. With more community work for the women and high school classes so well organized I feel this department has accomplished a great deal the past year. WEAVING: This year we have had a full time weaving teacher as recommended last spring. Winogene Redding came at the beginning of the second month of school. The looms took another move last fall, being put into the room that had been finished off for a store room under the porch of the Stuart Cottage. This was a great improvement over the log cabin, not only because of giving more light and room, but also bringing them a little nearer the school. All the looms needed overhauling and repairing so it was some little time before work could really begin. Another discouraging thing was that the eighth grade (which is the only one having weaving) is by far the weakest in the school. The girls are slow and not keen for the work. Finally, Miss Redding decided that some in the seventh grade who were older and were anxious to learn weaving should have the opportunity and since they have joined the class the work has taken on more life. Part of the morning is taken up answering calls at the house. All the afternoons are spent in, the various homes. Gene walks miles and miles and during the cold winter months has found it impossible even to be fairly comfortable when she is in the homes as they have been so very cold. The women have been very much interested and would do even more weaving than they do were we in position to keep buying their products in such large quantities. There has been a perfect craze for weaving and the children and the men are nearly as clever at it as the women. Of course, with the spring and summer farm work be-ginning, they will not have so much time for weaving. New patterns, new materials and a variety of things are being made. This time of year. we buy much more than we sell, but it is necessary in order to be ready for the fall. Miss Redding's report shows beyond question how important a full time weaving teacher is and if she returns another year that department will show still more improvement. 38 THE ARROW ov PI BETA PHI We still are handicapped because of lack of room .and until it can be provided we cannot purchase a larger loom or any other equipment. INDUSTRIAL: industrial business has grown to such an extent it really takes more time and work than any other one department, believe. This year we have bought and sold chairs, stools, weaving and baskets. As the Auditor's report will show: Total. purchases $7,552.1 0 Total sales 7,299.57 Net Loss $ 252.59 An inventory of our stock o hand shows that we have $2,360.7'1 Subtracting the total loss 2'''2.59 We have a gain of $2,10512 These figures give some idea of the immense amount of time that must be used in buying the timings from the people, packing and ship-ping them. The correspondence takes the treater part of the orrice time and even then flinch is not kept up as it should be. With the end of the school year we will practically stop buying weaving; baskets and .chairs come in more or less all summer. It is necessary to buy heavily in the spring, when the people have more time to work on baskets and weaving, in order to be ready for the fall sales. Last fall we were ,completely sold out several times and had the people working as fast as they possibly could to till the Christmas orders. The profit on the business is small and were we to consider our time spent in carrying it on we would find it was being run at a loss. I'lowever, there is another side. Many families are self-supporting because of this. Then by selling from here at a small profit the clubs can afford to handle the products and what money they make usually comes back into the school treasury. GIFT Snow : The Gift Shop has proven a success in its first month of operation. The sales amounted to practically $1,000 for the month of May, against $350 for the same month last year. BOYS DORMITORY : Leander and Mrs. McCarter lived on the hill again this year, Mrs. McCarter doing the cooking and housekeeping in return for board for her husband, daughter and part of the time for her son.. They are thoroughly good people and made a good home for the A:Joys. However, the house really needs a teacher or someone who has had more advantages and experience. The study hour needs supervision, the personal appearance. of the boys needs care, the house could be more home like. With the next year we hope for a central dining, room and that will no doubt be of great help. Twelve boys have lived in the dormitory, eight being about the average number. All the boys have been SETTLEmr.IN"l' SCHOOL REPoRTS required to work and the latter part of the year were given at. least si: hours of work during the 'week and five on Saturday in case the; stayed over the week-end. No work can be so very satisfactory withou regular supervision, but, on the whole the boys tried to do and thei failure was not so much from lack of willingness as from the right kim of daily supervision. The boys staying in the dormitory are the olds. boys of the school. It is always rather of a task to hold their interest If anything comes up to upset them much their first thought is to sto' school. The care and advice of someoneJ realizing their problems wont be of great help to the ;boys and the School. CONSOLIDATION: Talking has done little from year to year towar, bringing consolidation, but good roads are doing much. Last year th Cartertown School was discontinued and the pupils had to go to th Glades or here. Nearly all chose this School. There was no chanc of getting a wagon on the road in the fall, so we ran our truck a mil and a half each night and morning to help the children. This made th trip so much. easier that even the little ones came very regularly the fins five months of school. After Christmas the roads were to() bad for u to continue and due to one member of the School Board, no wage could be put en that road to bring the children. Some continued t walk, but many had to .stop, There is every indication of two sma schools coming in here in the fall. Of course they may not come. 1 any school does come in the rooms affected will be the primary o.ne With 47 children now in the primary room and no definite action take regard to building, I do not feel we can urge consolidation for th fall-surely not until we have dedided on our program. Another roux and another teacher are necessary. GIRLS' DORMITORY : The entire year has been very satisfactory in th girls' dormitory. Mrs. Chapin returned at the opening of the scho year. As she had been here before she knew right where to take u the work and things went on with very little difficulty. During the summer several girls worked in homes and after scho( opened continued to stay, receiving their board for work done. This, i addition to the number of families moving into the Burg accounts fc the smaller number in the cottage. Only six girls stayed in the do: mitory. They all lived in the Pollard Cottage. Four of the teaches rooming in the Stuart Cottage took their meals in the Pollard Cottage, It was impossible for the high school girls to continue preparing ti, noon meal at the school for the teachers and dormitory girls, as the did last year. It took all the class time from anything but the pray teal part of the course. Because of this and to relieve the teachers ( all house responsibility we have had a cook in the girls' dormitory ti entire year. The first of November Mrs. Chapin had to leave. We saw at one it would never do to finish the year with no head to the house so mot] er came for two weeks. After Christmas she returned and finished tl year. 40 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI' Surely there can be no complaint in regard to the care of the teachers this year. They have had comfortable rooms and enough to eat and no care whatever of the meals or dormitory girls. If there has been any discontent among them I do not know of it. CENTRAL DINING HALL : On the recommendation of Mrs. Stark and Mrs. Freeman last October, as well as the judgment of all, we have been planning for a central dining ball. Mrs. Stark has suggested the new school building possibly providing a place. In looking over the cottages I have felt we could arrange for the meals withopt going to the school building for them. Were all to take meals in the Teachers Cottage we would need to make changes that would have to be more or less permanent and hard to undo in case they were not satisfactory. If we use the Pollard Cottage next year we could make few changes and none that would necessitate rebuilding. By using the dining room and the downstairs teacher's room as dining rooms there would be sufficient room to take care of all the family we have. Some changes would need to be made in furnishings, but I do not think very expensive ones. This plan would mean boys, girls and teachers having meals together. Some feel this is not a wise plan, but I believe it will work out here and at least we can try it for one year. HEALTH DEPARTMENT : This department continues to be an out standing one and there never is any question of the tremendous amount accomplished for the schools and for the community. Yet, I do some-times think we take much of it for granted just because it is managed so very well. The report of Phyllis Higinbotham gives the details of the work. Dental clinics that used to be once in a while, if at all, are now regular things. The dentist ,comes once a month and always has patients waiting for him. The office is used more and more, people coming for supplies, to see a doctor, for medicines, or to have babies weighed and measured. Dr. Ogle continues to come in once a week or oftener and his services mean much to us. More school work has been done than ever before. A class in hygiene once a week at Sugarlands, pupils weighed and measured in all the nearby schools, some work clone at Laurel Lick make a pretty full school program. With this there was, of course, the smallpox and typhoid vaccinations. There was every indication of a bad typhoid epidemic in the county and I feel but for the hundreds who took the se-rum we might have had a hard time. While this district is very free from it, cases are brought in from nearby places. A college girl to assist in the office and with the school work continues to be most satisfactory, much more so than another nurse would be. The records have been put into good condition, office calls answered, correspondence attended to and many more things done to relieve the nurse. While Harmo Taylor was away in the winter a local girl took SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 41 her place and this spring will assist again as both Harm() and Lois Rogers will be in the Gift Shop. The next point is one I dread even to mention. Phyllis felt last year that she should resign because of her home people. She finally decided to come back for another year, but comes again to the same place she was last summer. In handing in her resignation I felt she should ask only for six months' leave, then i f she found she could come back the place would be here for her. In the meantime we should try to find someone for the temporary place who would probably stay on in case Phyllis .could not return. It is hard to imagine either that department or the school without Phyllis, and I feel we will suffer a great loss. I strongly recommend that Phyllis be granted a six months' leave with the understanding she return at the end of that time if possible. HEALTH UNIT : The past year we have again cooperated with the county in maintaining a county health unit. This does not in any way hamper our work and does make a good many things available, free vaccine for small pox and typhoid inoculations, clinics with county health doctor in ,charge, state specialists and visitors coming to give assistance and advice. Beside these we receive from the state about $500.00 more than we put in. This furnishes a means of getting filing cabinet, auto mileage, some travel allowances and we hope this year will all or partly furnish a typewriter for the office. To the surprise of the people of the county the court has for two years voted the health unit and we are hoping that again in October they will make a sufficient appropriation to make it possible. OFFICE: This year has showed beyond a doubt that the office work must be reorganized if it is to bekept up in anything like an efficient way. The office in the Teachers' Cottage has to be a general office. It is the only place anyone has to do office work, whether of school or industrial. It is the only place anyone has to talk business. This year extra congestion has been caused by having to do all of the work of the Gatlinburg News in the office. With the duties of house mother, pur chasing agent and the planning of meals combined there will be no time for the person having those things in charge to do any office work. Also with the constantly increasing amount of correspondence and desk work there is need of an assistant being in the office all the time. The past year there has not been time from routine office work for me scarcely to know what was going on around the place. FARM : In making a report on the farm I feel I should preface it by saying that the farm and the Smith-Hughes Agriculture in the School and the community are two separate things. In spite of the very dry weather the farm produced more than the year previous. We raised enough potatoes to carry us through the year, garden produce helped greatly on the living, we had at least fifty gallons of strawberries, fruit trees bore some, cows furnished all the milk we had and part of the 42 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI year all the butter. Beside this we had eggs, chickens, pork and beef from the farm. All the fields that were cultivated were put into hay and other fodder, saving quite a little on our hay bill. We have on the farm two horses of our own and one owned by Mr. Mattil, but kept by us as we use it nearly all the time, 3 cows, 3 calves, one bull, one goat, 1 boar, 1 brood sow and some small pigs, about 100 chickens. We fat few hogs as it pays better to sell the yotng pigs and also puts good stock into the community. This year the boys have clone the milking, cared for the horses, pigs, and chickens. They have clone fairly well with the work, but it has meant waste of feed and time. Mr. Mattil has supervised all he could and Leander McCarter has tried to, too, but it is a steady job and one that needs a person with it all the time. This coming year we should employ a man as farmer and supervisor of student labor, both for the good of the farm and for the good of the boys. I doubt if it would mean the cash outlay it appears for there would be saving in other ways. Were there a farmer here all the time much of the outside labor could be turned over to the boys or done away with entirely. Also with better roads and the nurse making more trips in a car an extra horse can be used nmeh of the time on the farm, saving the team hire we now have. COMMUNITY: As more people come into the Valley and the roads improve so our people get in and out more the community activities seem to grow less. Whether we really do less or merely feel that way is a question. At any rate it is harder to get the local people together. The teachers take an active part in Sunday School and B. Y. P. U. Helen Barrett had a Junior meeting Sunday afternoons for the tots from six to eleven years. Basketball games, either of theschool or community team, have taken at least one evening a week during the winter. Movies began in April and continued through September. They were well patronized and the report shows that even with paying for some furnishings, we came out about even. In the fall pictures were shown in practically every little school around here. This was primarily to stimulate Fair interest, but as the pictures were along the line of farming, domestic science and health they were decidedly educational. 'he great ,community event of the year is the Gatlinburg Fair and this year it certainly did credit to the school, the community and the county. The exhibits were line and were brought from more homes than ever before. Several of the little schools made fine showings, even though they had little school material to work with. After this fair was over Mr. Mattil did the greater part in putting on a county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. The nurse also put on a tine health exhibit. The school exhibit received first prize of $15.00 and the county exhibit second prize, which gave us a neat sum to start next year's Fair on. Another year there will be a county Fair in Sevierville and 1 feel S.ECTTLEMr,NT SCHOOL 43 that with what we do here and what we should do to 'boost the ,county Fair it would be best not to make any effort to exhibit in Knoxville. The Christmas entertainment, Valentine parties, picnics, and socials during warm weather, keeping open house at `Tea(Thers' Cottage Friday and Saturday nights comprise the social side of the school, life. The crying need of the community is supervised play and recreation Saturday and Sunday afternoons the year round. Yet with every teacher working full time, some of them six (lays of the week, and then teaching Sunday School on Sunday, how can they give the one after-noon they have for their rest and recreation? We have talked and talked of finding some young man who would do that kind of work during the summer, but have never come to the point of really trying to locate one. Neither do I know whether it would be possible to find one to come for expenses only. Sugarlands needs work of this kind, too. When you see a crowd of boys going up and down and up and down the road all Sunday afternoon just looking for something to do you wonder they escape as much trouble as they do. And what saves even our dormitory boys over the week-end is more than I can tell. The barn is open for basketball some Sunday afternoons and ;base-ball is played more or less during the summer, but there should be someone in charge. Also a clubroom of some kind should be, kept open those afternoons. None of us are satisfied with the amount of community work we do, but with every hour full we seem unable to take over any more. Each summer more people come into the Burg, there are more at-tractions away from the simple pleasures the people have been used to and I feel that right now we should nmke a great effort to hold the young people to their church, their homes and their community life. I still feel that one of the best things we are doing and one most appreciated is sending out the Gatlinburg News each month. Five hundred copies are printed and 25O go up and down these creeks and are really read. It is one of the pieces of real work that we feel well re-paid for doing. EXTENSION: Each year the question of extension comes up and each time under different circumstances. The Sugarlancls work is well enough established so we do not need to question continuing so much as the best methods to pursue. With the county furnishing eight months of free school we have not had to supplement any salaries in Sugarlands for grade work. Our help was with cooking, sewing, agriculture and adult work. The work in Laurel Lick has been along this line only. Several times Dr. Ogle and the County Superintendent have asked us why we did not investigate Laurel Lick field with a view toe helping there. Our answer has been that we had now about all we could manage. This year Miss Barrett has been very much interested and would like to take the primary room there next year. The county would pay sufficient salary to be equiv.-. alent to what she received here last year. The problem would be the 44 THE ARROW OE' PI BETA PHI living. She could not live alone, neither is there a suitable place for her to board. She has thought that possibly some girl working for her Master s Degree might be interested in spending a year there, coming for expenses only and possibly being willing even to pay those herself. This would furnish someone to help with community work. Helen and I figured that if we did anything toward making a cab-in habitable and getting any supplies whatever it would mean putting about $500.00 into the venture. She said she was willing to try to raise enough to finance the project, but I discouraged that thinking it Would keep funds out of the budget. Through the hair, meetings in different schools, visits of the nurse to weigh and measure children, agriculture classes in Sugarlands and Laurel Lick and some work done in other schools, we have been able to do a good deal for these other schools and with good results. SUGARLANDS : Sugarlands created a good deal of worry and trouble in the late summer. This was due first of all to an uncertainty in regard to Miss Chew being able to return to her work there, then to carelessness on my part in applying to one of the school ;board who thought I should ask him for the school. Cora McCarter had the same grades again, but the ones Miss Chew had were given to the board member's son-in-law. At first this made a good deal of trouble as the people wanted Miss Chew and we felt we had not had a square deal. Before many weeks we saw that it had been a fortunate move, rather than otherwise, for it gave Miss Chew the opportunity to try out adult school work there. Her work consisted in much visiting and answering calls at her house. 'Classes were held three afternoons in the school house after the regular school was dismissed. Thirteel boys were enrolled. One walked from the lumber camps across the mountain once a week. These boys were from fifteen to twenty years of age and doing work from first or second grade to a possible fourth or fifth. The older people were taught in their homes and several men and women over sixty years of age learned to. read and write. One was delighted that she could go to the mail box and tell to whom the letters were addressed. With the coming of bad weather it seemed best to discontinue these classes so Miss Chew took her vacation in January and February and will carry classes through the spring and summer. The State allowed us $212.50 on Miss Chew's salary for the fall term and says it will continue to help us this spring. Mrs. Stark called a meeting when she was here so that the county board and Sugarlands people could come to some agreement and also that she could have some idea of how each group stood. The people later signed a paper stating that they were willing to call this year one of the four required ones to give a clear title to the land and the county board gave a written statement showing their willingness to co-operate hereafter. Nothing has discouraged the people in Sugarlands so much as not having a teachers' cottage started yet. They feel they have been prom SETTLEMriNT SCHOOL R-C,PORTS 45 ised it and that were it there they would be assured the Pi Phis were there to stay. Then several men hoped for work on the building. The county school term has been eight months, which has meant the county has financed the teaching of the school. The board has again promised a new school building to be completed by opening of next term. Our allowance of $1,600 for Sugarlands has not been used this year, therefore, I would recommend the balance left be used in helping build a teachers' cottage, it being added to the Hazel Todd Meaden Fund, if that is released. I would. recommend also that the adult work be continued another year if possible. Miss Chew's report gives the list of community activities. IMPROVEMENTS MADE DURING THE YEAR: Rock walks laid around the cottages. New flue built for Pollard Cottage. Incubator house built-one half to be used for root store house. Full time weaving teacher engaged. Third year added to high school. Engine and wood house rebuilt, making new store. Redressing school desks. Guttering and draining around schoolhouse. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR: Farmer and supervisor of boys' work engaged. Gift shop plans adopted for the summer. Central dining hall. Purchasing agent to plan meals and manage girls' dormitory, living in the dormitory. Office helper and sufficient office equipment, including typewriter, adding machine and desk. Scale of salary increase for teaching experience in the school. Teacher in boys' dormitory. Community worker for Saturdays and Sundays during the summer. Teachers' cottage in Sugarlands. Schoolhouse started or room added to present building. In closing my report I again want to express my appreciation of the entire staff and the committee. Again, I say that but for the sympathy and help each has so willingly given the other the year's program never could have been carried on so successfully. These are the things that give joy to the work here and .make us all loath to give up our connection with the School and Pi Phi work. EVELYN BISHOP, Head Resident. 46 T r. ARRow ov PI BETA PHI DIGEST ()F MINUTES Settlement School Conanittee Meeting, March 5, 1926 A full membership was present. The membership, with permission of Grand Council, met (luring tlni School session, which proved a great success, as this gave the committee a better working knowledge of conditions at the School, and a more sympathetic understanding of the staff. Hereafter, all weaving work will have the trademark of the Settlement School, which is in the form of a, blue paper sticker with red design. A branding iron carrying the trademark will be used on bas kets and furniture. The Committee decided to build the industrial unit to the new school building with the funds now available. Several gifts from individuals, and one bequest, together with certain sums voted from interests and current expenses, have helped increase this fund to such an amount as to encourage our undertaking this enterprise. The need of such is most apparent. This building will probably be a memorial building. The School plant is in very good condition. No excessive expense is necessary for the repairs as it has been our policy to keep the buildings in as good condition as possible. There may be some necessary painting work to be done. As usual, the School, its staff and problems took considerable time. Evelyn Bishop was re-elected as Head Resident. Margaret White is to be Principal of the higher grades. Emily Burton is to return after a leave of absence for one year. Marian Folsom and Elmer Watson were re-elected. Lois Rogers resigned to be office assistant to the Head Resident. Mrs. E. A. Bishop was elected to become Matron of the Girls' Dormitory, purchasing agent, and supervisor of the central dining room. Mrs. Dowell is to have charge of noon lunches for all school pupils, and Matron of the Boys' Dormitory. Jean Steele and O. J. Mattil were re-elected to carry on the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science and Agricultural work, respectively. Winogene Redding will be the teacher and super-visor of the weaving department. Too much praise cannot be given to her success along these lines. Some changes have been made in the running of the School. There are to be two principals, one for lower grade work, one for high school work. There are to be two primary teachers, as this class has grown so, owing to the consolidation of several schools. There are to be noon lunches for all pupils. This is to be self-supporting if possible. The basement of the School will be converted in classrooms for primary grades. An extra office in the Teftchers' Cottage will be in the room now used as a downstairs bedroom. All books in the Library are to be catalogued or repaired. A fifth and sixth grade teacher has to be elected, also principal of lower grades. A teacher's salary is to be fifty dollars per month for the first year, fifty-five dollars for the third year, SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 47 and sixty for the fourth year and sixty-five for the fifth year. The price of all orders for industrial work, other than from alumnae clubs, shall be increased 25%. Color cards and samples of weaving are to be sent upon request.. Alumnae Clubs are offered 1% discount for cash within 30 days from date of invoice. Board paid by new teachers is to be increased to $20.00 per month. Miss Higinbotham was granted six month's leave. Another nurse is to take her place. Requests for a typewriter and a ear discussed. An assistant to the nurse was authorized again, and Lizzie Reagan was elected as Harmo Taylor resigned. The Hazel Todd Meaden Memorial House is to be.. built at the Emma Harper Turner Center. Helen Chew was elected as head of the work, and she, with the assistance of head Resident, secured another 1)i Phi teacher, and will dictate the policy at this center. Smith-Hughes adult Education Fund again solicited. The County is building a very nice new school building at the Emma Harper Turner Center. It is with deep regret that we announce the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham. She is to become State Supervisor of Public Health Nursing of Tennessee. I could write a' lengthy eulogy on Miss Higinbotham. I could tell you of the hours of pure drudgery that she has gone through. I could tell you of thousands and thousands of such things and still would not have half begun. All who have known her and have seen .her know that contact with her has made them a better person to live in this world. Guests who desire to stay more than week ends in the school are to be charged at the rate of $1.00 a day. The fiscal year of the school has been changed to close on June 30. A reorganization of the industrial department and work is to be made. It is probable that a definite wholesale price schedule will be adopted, slightly higher than in the past to provide for increased cost of maintenance of the department and of materials, with standard discounts for quantity buying.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon." If you have not read these articles it has been your loss, as they have been full of human interest. She is certainly a most ardent worker of our School and her ability and personality make a happy combination. Dorothy Smallwood Geare has done a splendid work in sending out information to those members not belonging to any alumnae club. We feel that these members should be a part of this great work and it has been our plan to get them interested in this way in the School. Gertrude Brown Freeman has successfully followed Mrs. Curtis as the Ways and Means member of the committee. I have found her ad-vice on the committee matters instructive and enlightening and feel that she has been a decided asset. Owing to illness, Ethel Curryer could not start her work until November. When you read her report you will see that she has carried her part through in a manner that would do credit to a most experienced bookkeeper. Our work has increased to such a degree that she, at times, has had to do the work of three people rather than one. She has been patient and efficient and we are indeed fortunate in having such a treasurer for the Settlement School. Each of the committee, as well as I, feel that we are fortunate in being able to serve you in this undertaking a work that has been hard that has not been altogether happy at times--that has been exacting and time claiming when we could have been enjoying ourselves at Convention. But, being a work of such high ideals, we feel that no matter what effort it cost us it was worth it all. And, again, let us express to you our sincere appreciation of the opportunity for being a part of the greatest altruistic work any fraternity in America has ever undertaken. Remember, this School is yours. How successful its future is depends upon you. Do you want it to stand still? I think not. Do you want it to become better in every way? Your answer to this is in increased donations. NITA HILL STARK, Chairman. 50 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI REPORT OF THE TREASURER OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records a'nd accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., for the period 1925--1926 ending April 30, 1926. The books were audited and records checked for the period covering your term as treasurer and we have made a combined report for the entire year using a part of the previous Auditor's statements for the first few months of the 1925 term and wish to state that while we assume no responsibility for his figures we test checked and verified same whenever it seemed expedient to do so. We have verified the Bank Balance and all deposits and securities. All postings in the General Ledger were checked with the Journal and Check Register and all totals in all of the books were verified. All receipts were checked and verified with the checks issued in payment of same and all Invoices and Credit Memos were thoroughly examined, being checked against both the Journal and Check Register.

She therefore reports under these two heads: I. CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership.

        38 THE ARROW ov PI BETA PHI We still are handicapped because of lack of room .and until it can be provided we cannot purchase a larger loom or any other equipment. INDUSTRIAL: industrial business has grown to such an extent it really takes more time and work than any other one department, believe. This year we have bought and sold chairs, stools, weaving and baskets. As the Auditor's report will show: Total. purchases $7,552.1 0 Total sales 7,299.57 Net Loss $ 252.59 An inventory of our stock o hand shows that we have $2,360.7'1 Subtracting the total loss 2'''2.59 We have a gain of $2,10512 These figures give some idea of the immense amount of time that must be used in buying the timings from the people, packing and ship-ping them. The correspondence takes the treater part of the orrice time and even then flinch is not kept up as it should be. With the end of the school year we will practically stop buying weaving; baskets and .chairs come in more or less all summer. It is necessary to buy heavily in the spring, when the people have more time to work on baskets and weaving, in order to be ready for the fall sales. Last fall we were ,completely sold out several times and had the people working as fast as they possibly could to till the Christmas orders. The profit on the business is small and were we to consider our time spent in carrying it on we would find it was being run at a loss. I'lowever, there is another side. Many families are self-supporting because of this. Then by selling from here at a small profit the clubs can afford to handle the products and what money they make usually comes back into the school treasury. GIFT Snow : The Gift Shop has proven a success in its first month of operation. The sales amounted to practically $1,000 for the month of May, against $350 for the same month last year. BOYS DORMITORY : Leander and Mrs. McCarter lived on the hill again this year, Mrs. McCarter doing the cooking and housekeeping in return for board for her husband, daughter and part of the time for her son.. They are thoroughly good people and made a good home for the A:Joys. However, the house really needs a teacher or someone who has had more advantages and experience. The study hour needs supervision, the personal appearance. of the boys needs care, the house could be more home like. With the next year we hope for a central dining, room and that will no doubt be of great help. Twelve boys have lived in the dormitory, eight being about the average number. All the boys have been SETTLEmr.IN"l' SCHOOL REPoRTS required to work and the latter part of the year were given at. least si: hours of work during the 'week and five on Saturday in case the; stayed over the week-end. No work can be so very satisfactory withou regular supervision, but, on the whole the boys tried to do and thei failure was not so much from lack of willingness as from the right kim of daily supervision. The boys staying in the dormitory are the olds. boys of the school. It is always rather of a task to hold their interest If anything comes up to upset them much their first thought is to sto' school. The care and advice of someoneJ realizing their problems wont be of great help to the ;boys and the School. CONSOLIDATION: Talking has done little from year to year towar, bringing consolidation, but good roads are doing much. Last year th Cartertown School was discontinued and the pupils had to go to th Glades or here. Nearly all chose this School. There was no chanc of getting a wagon on the road in the fall, so we ran our truck a mil and a half each night and morning to help the children. This made th trip so much. easier that even the little ones came very regularly the fins five months of school. After Christmas the roads were to() bad for u to continue and due to one member of the School Board, no wage could be put en that road to bring the children. Some continued t walk, but many had to .stop, There is every indication of two sma schools coming in here in the fall. Of course they may not come. 1 any school does come in the rooms affected will be the primary o.ne With 47 children now in the primary room and no definite action take regard to building, I do not feel we can urge consolidation for th fall-surely not until we have dedided on our program. Another roux and another teacher are necessary. GIRLS' DORMITORY : The entire year has been very satisfactory in th girls' dormitory. Mrs. Chapin returned at the opening of the scho year. As she had been here before she knew right where to take u the work and things went on with very little difficulty. During the summer several girls worked in homes and after scho( opened continued to stay, receiving their board for work done. This, i addition to the number of families moving into the Burg accounts fc the smaller number in the cottage. Only six girls stayed in the do: mitory. They all lived in the Pollard Cottage. Four of the teaches rooming in the Stuart Cottage took their meals in the Pollard Cottage, It was impossible for the high school girls to continue preparing ti, noon meal at the school for the teachers and dormitory girls, as the did last year. It took all the class time from anything but the pray teal part of the course. Because of this and to relieve the teachers ( all house responsibility we have had a cook in the girls' dormitory ti entire year. The first of November Mrs. Chapin had to leave. We saw at one it would never do to finish the year with no head to the house so mot] er came for two weeks. After Christmas she returned and finished tl year. 40 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI' Surely there can be no complaint in regard to the care of the teachers this year. They have had comfortable rooms and enough to eat and no care whatever of the meals or dormitory girls. If there has been any discontent among them I do not know of it. CENTRAL DINING HALL : On the recommendation of Mrs. Stark and Mrs. Freeman last October, as well as the judgment of all, we have been planning for a central dining ball. Mrs. Stark has suggested the new school building possibly providing a place. In looking over the cottages I have felt we could arrange for the meals withopt going to the school building for them. Were all to take meals in the Teachers Cottage we would need to make changes that would have to be more or less permanent and hard to undo in case they were not satisfactory. If we use the Pollard Cottage next year we could make few changes and none that would necessitate rebuilding. By using the dining room and the downstairs teacher's room as dining rooms there would be sufficient room to take care of all the family we have. Some changes would need to be made in furnishings, but I do not think very expensive ones. This plan would mean boys, girls and teachers having meals together. Some feel this is not a wise plan, but I believe it will work out here and at least we can try it for one year. HEALTH DEPARTMENT : This department continues to be an out standing one and there never is any question of the tremendous amount accomplished for the schools and for the community. Yet, I do some-times think we take much of it for granted just because it is managed so very well. The report of Phyllis Higinbotham gives the details of the work. Dental clinics that used to be once in a while, if at all, are now regular things. The dentist ,comes once a month and always has patients waiting for him. The office is used more and more, people coming for supplies, to see a doctor, for medicines, or to have babies weighed and measured. Dr. Ogle continues to come in once a week or oftener and his services mean much to us. More school work has been done than ever before. A class in hygiene once a week at Sugarlands, pupils weighed and measured in all the nearby schools, some work clone at Laurel Lick make a pretty full school program. With this there was, of course, the smallpox and typhoid vaccinations. There was every indication of a bad typhoid epidemic in the county and I feel but for the hundreds who took the se-rum we might have had a hard time. While this district is very free from it, cases are brought in from nearby places. A college girl to assist in the office and with the school work continues to be most satisfactory, much more so than another nurse would be. The records have been put into good condition, office calls answered, correspondence attended to and many more things done to relieve the nurse. While Harmo Taylor was away in the winter a local girl took SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 41 her place and this spring will assist again as both Harm() and Lois Rogers will be in the Gift Shop. The next point is one I dread even to mention. Phyllis felt last year that she should resign because of her home people. She finally decided to come back for another year, but comes again to the same place she was last summer. In handing in her resignation I felt she should ask only for six months' leave, then i f she found she could come back the place would be here for her. In the meantime we should try to find someone for the temporary place who would probably stay on in case Phyllis .could not return. It is hard to imagine either that department or the school without Phyllis, and I feel we will suffer a great loss. I strongly recommend that Phyllis be granted a six months' leave with the understanding she return at the end of that time if possible. HEALTH UNIT : The past year we have again cooperated with the county in maintaining a county health unit. This does not in any way hamper our work and does make a good many things available, free vaccine for small pox and typhoid inoculations, clinics with county health doctor in ,charge, state specialists and visitors coming to give assistance and advice. Beside these we receive from the state about $500.00 more than we put in. This furnishes a means of getting filing cabinet, auto mileage, some travel allowances and we hope this year will all or partly furnish a typewriter for the office. To the surprise of the people of the county the court has for two years voted the health unit and we are hoping that again in October they will make a sufficient appropriation to make it possible. OFFICE: This year has showed beyond a doubt that the office work must be reorganized if it is to bekept up in anything like an efficient way. The office in the Teachers' Cottage has to be a general office. It is the only place anyone has to do office work, whether of school or industrial. It is the only place anyone has to talk business. This year extra congestion has been caused by having to do all of the work of the Gatlinburg News in the office. With the duties of house mother, pur chasing agent and the planning of meals combined there will be no time for the person having those things in charge to do any office work. Also with the constantly increasing amount of correspondence and desk work there is need of an assistant being in the office all the time. The past year there has not been time from routine office work for me scarcely to know what was going on around the place. FARM : In making a report on the farm I feel I should preface it by saying that the farm and the Smith-Hughes Agriculture in the School and the community are two separate things. In spite of the very dry weather the farm produced more than the year previous. We raised enough potatoes to carry us through the year, garden produce helped greatly on the living, we had at least fifty gallons of strawberries, fruit trees bore some, cows furnished all the milk we had and part of the 42 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI year all the butter. Beside this we had eggs, chickens, pork and beef from the farm. All the fields that were cultivated were put into hay and other fodder, saving quite a little on our hay bill. We have on the farm two horses of our own and one owned by Mr. Mattil, but kept by us as we use it nearly all the time, 3 cows, 3 calves, one bull, one goat, 1 boar, 1 brood sow and some small pigs, about 100 chickens. We fat few hogs as it pays better to sell the yotng pigs and also puts good stock into the community. This year the boys have clone the milking, cared for the horses, pigs, and chickens. They have clone fairly well with the work, but it has meant waste of feed and time. Mr. Mattil has supervised all he could and Leander McCarter has tried to, too, but it is a steady job and one that needs a person with it all the time. This coming year we should employ a man as farmer and supervisor of student labor, both for the good of the farm and for the good of the boys. I doubt if it would mean the cash outlay it appears for there would be saving in other ways. Were there a farmer here all the time much of the outside labor could be turned over to the boys or done away with entirely. Also with better roads and the nurse making more trips in a car an extra horse can be used nmeh of the time on the farm, saving the team hire we now have. COMMUNITY: As more people come into the Valley and the roads improve so our people get in and out more the community activities seem to grow less. Whether we really do less or merely feel that way is a question. At any rate it is harder to get the local people together. The teachers take an active part in Sunday School and B. Y. P. U. Helen Barrett had a Junior meeting Sunday afternoons for the tots from six to eleven years. Basketball games, either of theschool or community team, have taken at least one evening a week during the winter. Movies began in April and continued through September. They were well patronized and the report shows that even with paying for some furnishings, we came out about even. In the fall pictures were shown in practically every little school around here. This was primarily to stimulate Fair interest, but as the pictures were along the line of farming, domestic science and health they were decidedly educational. 'he great ,community event of the year is the Gatlinburg Fair and this year it certainly did credit to the school, the community and the county. The exhibits were line and were brought from more homes than ever before. Several of the little schools made fine showings, even though they had little school material to work with. After this fair was over Mr. Mattil did the greater part in putting on a county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. The nurse also put on a tine health exhibit. The school exhibit received first prize of $15.00 and the county exhibit second prize, which gave us a neat sum to start next year's Fair on. Another year there will be a county Fair in Sevierville and 1 feel S.ECTTLEMr,NT SCHOOL 43 that with what we do here and what we should do to 'boost the ,county Fair it would be best not to make any effort to exhibit in Knoxville. The Christmas entertainment, Valentine parties, picnics, and socials during warm weather, keeping open house at `Tea(Thers' Cottage Friday and Saturday nights comprise the social side of the school, life. The crying need of the community is supervised play and recreation Saturday and Sunday afternoons the year round. Yet with every teacher working full time, some of them six (lays of the week, and then teaching Sunday School on Sunday, how can they give the one after-noon they have for their rest and recreation? We have talked and talked of finding some young man who would do that kind of work during the summer, but have never come to the point of really trying to locate one. Neither do I know whether it would be possible to find one to come for expenses only. Sugarlands needs work of this kind, too. When you see a crowd of boys going up and down and up and down the road all Sunday afternoon just looking for something to do you wonder they escape as much trouble as they do. And what saves even our dormitory boys over the week-end is more than I can tell. The barn is open for basketball some Sunday afternoons and ;base-ball is played more or less during the summer, but there should be someone in charge. Also a clubroom of some kind should be, kept open those afternoons. None of us are satisfied with the amount of community work we do, but with every hour full we seem unable to take over any more. Each summer more people come into the Burg, there are more at-tractions away from the simple pleasures the people have been used to and I feel that right now we should nmke a great effort to hold the young people to their church, their homes and their community life. I still feel that one of the best things we are doing and one most appreciated is sending out the Gatlinburg News each month. Five hundred copies are printed and 25O go up and down these creeks and are really read. It is one of the pieces of real work that we feel well re-paid for doing. EXTENSION: Each year the question of extension comes up and each time under different circumstances. The Sugarlancls work is well enough established so we do not need to question continuing so much as the best methods to pursue. With the county furnishing eight months of free school we have not had to supplement any salaries in Sugarlands for grade work. Our help was with cooking, sewing, agriculture and adult work. The work in Laurel Lick has been along this line only. Several times Dr. Ogle and the County Superintendent have asked us why we did not investigate Laurel Lick field with a view toe helping there. Our answer has been that we had now about all we could manage. This year Miss Barrett has been very much interested and would like to take the primary room there next year. The county would pay sufficient salary to be equiv.-. alent to what she received here last year. The problem would be the 44 THE ARROW OE' PI BETA PHI living. She could not live alone, neither is there a suitable place for her to board. She has thought that possibly some girl working for her Master s Degree might be interested in spending a year there, coming for expenses only and possibly being willing even to pay those herself. This would furnish someone to help with community work. Helen and I figured that if we did anything toward making a cab-in habitable and getting any supplies whatever it would mean putting about $500.00 into the venture. She said she was willing to try to raise enough to finance the project, but I discouraged that thinking it Would keep funds out of the budget. Through the hair, meetings in different schools, visits of the nurse to weigh and measure children, agriculture classes in Sugarlands and Laurel Lick and some work done in other schools, we have been able to do a good deal for these other schools and with good results. SUGARLANDS : Sugarlands created a good deal of worry and trouble in the late summer. This was due first of all to an uncertainty in regard to Miss Chew being able to return to her work there, then to carelessness on my part in applying to one of the school ;board who thought I should ask him for the school. Cora McCarter had the same grades again, but the ones Miss Chew had were given to the board member's son-in-law. At first this made a good deal of trouble as the people wanted Miss Chew and we felt we had not had a square deal. Before many weeks we saw that it had been a fortunate move, rather than otherwise, for it gave Miss Chew the opportunity to try out adult school work there. Her work consisted in much visiting and answering calls at her house. 'Classes were held three afternoons in the school house after the regular school was dismissed. Thirteel boys were enrolled. One walked from the lumber camps across the mountain once a week. These boys were from fifteen to twenty years of age and doing work from first or second grade to a possible fourth or fifth. The older people were taught in their homes and several men and women over sixty years of age learned to. read and write. One was delighted that she could go to the mail box and tell to whom the letters were addressed. With the coming of bad weather it seemed best to discontinue these classes so Miss Chew took her vacation in January and February and will carry classes through the spring and summer. The State allowed us $212.50 on Miss Chew's salary for the fall term and says it will continue to help us this spring. Mrs. Stark called a meeting when she was here so that the county board and Sugarlands people could come to some agreement and also that she could have some idea of how each group stood. The people later signed a paper stating that they were willing to call this year one of the four required ones to give a clear title to the land and the county board gave a written statement showing their willingness to co-operate hereafter. Nothing has discouraged the people in Sugarlands so much as not having a teachers' cottage started yet. They feel they have been prom SETTLEMriNT SCHOOL R-C,PORTS 45 ised it and that were it there they would be assured the Pi Phis were there to stay. Then several men hoped for work on the building. The county school term has been eight months, which has meant the county has financed the teaching of the school. The board has again promised a new school building to be completed by opening of next term. Our allowance of $1,600 for Sugarlands has not been used this year, therefore, I would recommend the balance left be used in helping build a teachers' cottage, it being added to the Hazel Todd Meaden Fund, if that is released. I would. recommend also that the adult work be continued another year if possible. Miss Chew's report gives the list of community activities. IMPROVEMENTS MADE DURING THE YEAR: Rock walks laid around the cottages. New flue built for Pollard Cottage. Incubator house built-one half to be used for root store house. Full time weaving teacher engaged. Third year added to high school. Engine and wood house rebuilt, making new store. Redressing school desks. Guttering and draining around schoolhouse. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR: Farmer and supervisor of boys' work engaged. Gift shop plans adopted for the summer. Central dining hall. Purchasing agent to plan meals and manage girls' dormitory, living in the dormitory. Office helper and sufficient office equipment, including typewriter, adding machine and desk. Scale of salary increase for teaching experience in the school. Teacher in boys' dormitory. Community worker for Saturdays and Sundays during the summer. Teachers' cottage in Sugarlands. Schoolhouse started or room added to present building. In closing my report I again want to express my appreciation of the entire staff and the committee. Again, I say that but for the sympathy and help each has so willingly given the other the year's program never could have been carried on so successfully. These are the things that give joy to the work here and .make us all loath to give up our connection with the School and Pi Phi work. EVELYN BISHOP, Head Resident. 46 T r. ARRow ov PI BETA PHI DIGEST ()F MINUTES Settlement School Conanittee Meeting, March 5, 1926 A full membership was present. The membership, with permission of Grand Council, met (luring tlni School session, which proved a great success, as this gave the committee a better working knowledge of conditions at the School, and a more sympathetic understanding of the staff. Hereafter, all weaving work will have the trademark of the Settlement School, which is in the form of a, blue paper sticker with red design. A branding iron carrying the trademark will be used on bas kets and furniture. The Committee decided to build the industrial unit to the new school building with the funds now available. Several gifts from individuals, and one bequest, together with certain sums voted from interests and current expenses, have helped increase this fund to such an amount as to encourage our undertaking this enterprise. The need of such is most apparent. This building will probably be a memorial building. The School plant is in very good condition. No excessive expense is necessary for the repairs as it has been our policy to keep the buildings in as good condition as possible. There may be some necessary painting work to be done. As usual, the School, its staff and problems took considerable time. Evelyn Bishop was re-elected as Head Resident. Margaret White is to be Principal of the higher grades. Emily Burton is to return after a leave of absence for one year. Marian Folsom and Elmer Watson were re-elected. Lois Rogers resigned to be office assistant to the Head Resident. Mrs. E. A. Bishop was elected to become Matron of the Girls' Dormitory, purchasing agent, and supervisor of the central dining room. Mrs. Dowell is to have charge of noon lunches for all school pupils, and Matron of the Boys' Dormitory. Jean Steele and O. J. Mattil were re-elected to carry on the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science and Agricultural work, respectively. Winogene Redding will be the teacher and super-visor of the weaving department. Too much praise cannot be given to her success along these lines. Some changes have been made in the running of the School. There are to be two principals, one for lower grade work, one for high school work. There are to be two primary teachers, as this class has grown so, owing to the consolidation of several schools. There are to be noon lunches for all pupils. This is to be self-supporting if possible. The basement of the School will be converted in classrooms for primary grades. An extra office in the Teftchers' Cottage will be in the room now used as a downstairs bedroom. All books in the Library are to be catalogued or repaired. A fifth and sixth grade teacher has to be elected, also principal of lower grades. A teacher's salary is to be fifty dollars per month for the first year, fifty-five dollars for the third year, SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 47 and sixty for the fourth year and sixty-five for the fifth year. The price of all orders for industrial work, other than from alumnae clubs, shall be increased 25%. Color cards and samples of weaving are to be sent upon request.. Alumnae Clubs are offered 1% discount for cash within 30 days from date of invoice. Board paid by new teachers is to be increased to $20.00 per month. Miss Higinbotham was granted six month's leave. Another nurse is to take her place. Requests for a typewriter and a ear discussed. An assistant to the nurse was authorized again, and Lizzie Reagan was elected as Harmo Taylor resigned. The Hazel Todd Meaden Memorial House is to be.. built at the Emma Harper Turner Center. Helen Chew was elected as head of the work, and she, with the assistance of head Resident, secured another 1)i Phi teacher, and will dictate the policy at this center. Smith-Hughes adult Education Fund again solicited. The County is building a very nice new school building at the Emma Harper Turner Center. It is with deep regret that we announce the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham. She is to become State Supervisor of Public Health Nursing of Tennessee. I could write a' lengthy eulogy on Miss Higinbotham. I could tell you of the hours of pure drudgery that she has gone through. I could tell you of thousands and thousands of such things and still would not have half begun. All who have known her and have seen .her know that contact with her has made them a better person to live in this world. Guests who desire to stay more than week ends in the school are to be charged at the rate of $1.00 a day. The fiscal year of the school has been changed to close on June 30. A reorganization of the industrial department and work is to be made. It is probable that a definite wholesale price schedule will be adopted, slightly higher than in the past to provide for increased cost of maintenance of the department and of materials, with standard discounts for quantity buying.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon." If you have not read these articles it has been your loss, as they have been full of human interest. She is certainly a most ardent worker of our School and her ability and personality make a happy combination. Dorothy Smallwood Geare has done a splendid work in sending out information to those members not belonging to any alumnae club. We feel that these members should be a part of this great work and it has been our plan to get them interested in this way in the School. Gertrude Brown Freeman has successfully followed Mrs. Curtis as the Ways and Means member of the committee. I have found her ad-vice on the committee matters instructive and enlightening and feel that she has been a decided asset. Owing to illness, Ethel Curryer could not start her work until November. When you read her report you will see that she has carried her part through in a manner that would do credit to a most experienced bookkeeper. Our work has increased to such a degree that she, at times, has had to do the work of three people rather than one. She has been patient and efficient and we are indeed fortunate in having such a treasurer for the Settlement School. Each of the committee, as well as I, feel that we are fortunate in being able to serve you in this undertaking a work that has been hard that has not been altogether happy at times--that has been exacting and time claiming when we could have been enjoying ourselves at Convention. But, being a work of such high ideals, we feel that no matter what effort it cost us it was worth it all. And, again, let us express to you our sincere appreciation of the opportunity for being a part of the greatest altruistic work any fraternity in America has ever undertaken. Remember, this School is yours. How successful its future is depends upon you. Do you want it to stand still? I think not. Do you want it to become better in every way? Your answer to this is in increased donations. NITA HILL STARK, Chairman. 50 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI REPORT OF THE TREASURER OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records a'nd accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., for the period 1925--1926 ending April 30, 1926. The books were audited and records checked for the period covering your term as treasurer and we have made a combined report for the entire year using a part of the previous Auditor's statements for the first few months of the 1925 term and wish to state that while we assume no responsibility for his figures we test checked and verified same whenever it seemed expedient to do so. We have verified the Bank Balance and all deposits and securities. All postings in the General Ledger were checked with the Journal and Check Register and all totals in all of the books were verified. All receipts were checked and verified with the checks issued in payment of same and all Invoices and Credit Memos were thoroughly examined, being checked against both the Journal and Check Register.

She therefore reports under these two heads: I. CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files.

        40 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI' Surely there can be no complaint in regard to the care of the teachers this year. They have had comfortable rooms and enough to eat and no care whatever of the meals or dormitory girls. If there has been any discontent among them I do not know of it. CENTRAL DINING HALL : On the recommendation of Mrs. Stark and Mrs. Freeman last October, as well as the judgment of all, we have been planning for a central dining ball. Mrs. Stark has suggested the new school building possibly providing a place. In looking over the cottages I have felt we could arrange for the meals withopt going to the school building for them. Were all to take meals in the Teachers Cottage we would need to make changes that would have to be more or less permanent and hard to undo in case they were not satisfactory. If we use the Pollard Cottage next year we could make few changes and none that would necessitate rebuilding. By using the dining room and the downstairs teacher's room as dining rooms there would be sufficient room to take care of all the family we have. Some changes would need to be made in furnishings, but I do not think very expensive ones. This plan would mean boys, girls and teachers having meals together. Some feel this is not a wise plan, but I believe it will work out here and at least we can try it for one year. HEALTH DEPARTMENT : This department continues to be an out standing one and there never is any question of the tremendous amount accomplished for the schools and for the community. Yet, I do some-times think we take much of it for granted just because it is managed so very well. The report of Phyllis Higinbotham gives the details of the work. Dental clinics that used to be once in a while, if at all, are now regular things. The dentist ,comes once a month and always has patients waiting for him. The office is used more and more, people coming for supplies, to see a doctor, for medicines, or to have babies weighed and measured. Dr. Ogle continues to come in once a week or oftener and his services mean much to us. More school work has been done than ever before. A class in hygiene once a week at Sugarlands, pupils weighed and measured in all the nearby schools, some work clone at Laurel Lick make a pretty full school program. With this there was, of course, the smallpox and typhoid vaccinations. There was every indication of a bad typhoid epidemic in the county and I feel but for the hundreds who took the se-rum we might have had a hard time. While this district is very free from it, cases are brought in from nearby places. A college girl to assist in the office and with the school work continues to be most satisfactory, much more so than another nurse would be. The records have been put into good condition, office calls answered, correspondence attended to and many more things done to relieve the nurse. While Harmo Taylor was away in the winter a local girl took SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 41 her place and this spring will assist again as both Harm() and Lois Rogers will be in the Gift Shop. The next point is one I dread even to mention. Phyllis felt last year that she should resign because of her home people. She finally decided to come back for another year, but comes again to the same place she was last summer. In handing in her resignation I felt she should ask only for six months' leave, then i f she found she could come back the place would be here for her. In the meantime we should try to find someone for the temporary place who would probably stay on in case Phyllis .could not return. It is hard to imagine either that department or the school without Phyllis, and I feel we will suffer a great loss. I strongly recommend that Phyllis be granted a six months' leave with the understanding she return at the end of that time if possible. HEALTH UNIT : The past year we have again cooperated with the county in maintaining a county health unit. This does not in any way hamper our work and does make a good many things available, free vaccine for small pox and typhoid inoculations, clinics with county health doctor in ,charge, state specialists and visitors coming to give assistance and advice. Beside these we receive from the state about $500.00 more than we put in. This furnishes a means of getting filing cabinet, auto mileage, some travel allowances and we hope this year will all or partly furnish a typewriter for the office. To the surprise of the people of the county the court has for two years voted the health unit and we are hoping that again in October they will make a sufficient appropriation to make it possible. OFFICE: This year has showed beyond a doubt that the office work must be reorganized if it is to bekept up in anything like an efficient way. The office in the Teachers' Cottage has to be a general office. It is the only place anyone has to do office work, whether of school or industrial. It is the only place anyone has to talk business. This year extra congestion has been caused by having to do all of the work of the Gatlinburg News in the office. With the duties of house mother, pur chasing agent and the planning of meals combined there will be no time for the person having those things in charge to do any office work. Also with the constantly increasing amount of correspondence and desk work there is need of an assistant being in the office all the time. The past year there has not been time from routine office work for me scarcely to know what was going on around the place. FARM : In making a report on the farm I feel I should preface it by saying that the farm and the Smith-Hughes Agriculture in the School and the community are two separate things. In spite of the very dry weather the farm produced more than the year previous. We raised enough potatoes to carry us through the year, garden produce helped greatly on the living, we had at least fifty gallons of strawberries, fruit trees bore some, cows furnished all the milk we had and part of the 42 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI year all the butter. Beside this we had eggs, chickens, pork and beef from the farm. All the fields that were cultivated were put into hay and other fodder, saving quite a little on our hay bill. We have on the farm two horses of our own and one owned by Mr. Mattil, but kept by us as we use it nearly all the time, 3 cows, 3 calves, one bull, one goat, 1 boar, 1 brood sow and some small pigs, about 100 chickens. We fat few hogs as it pays better to sell the yotng pigs and also puts good stock into the community. This year the boys have clone the milking, cared for the horses, pigs, and chickens. They have clone fairly well with the work, but it has meant waste of feed and time. Mr. Mattil has supervised all he could and Leander McCarter has tried to, too, but it is a steady job and one that needs a person with it all the time. This coming year we should employ a man as farmer and supervisor of student labor, both for the good of the farm and for the good of the boys. I doubt if it would mean the cash outlay it appears for there would be saving in other ways. Were there a farmer here all the time much of the outside labor could be turned over to the boys or done away with entirely. Also with better roads and the nurse making more trips in a car an extra horse can be used nmeh of the time on the farm, saving the team hire we now have. COMMUNITY: As more people come into the Valley and the roads improve so our people get in and out more the community activities seem to grow less. Whether we really do less or merely feel that way is a question. At any rate it is harder to get the local people together. The teachers take an active part in Sunday School and B. Y. P. U. Helen Barrett had a Junior meeting Sunday afternoons for the tots from six to eleven years. Basketball games, either of theschool or community team, have taken at least one evening a week during the winter. Movies began in April and continued through September. They were well patronized and the report shows that even with paying for some furnishings, we came out about even. In the fall pictures were shown in practically every little school around here. This was primarily to stimulate Fair interest, but as the pictures were along the line of farming, domestic science and health they were decidedly educational. 'he great ,community event of the year is the Gatlinburg Fair and this year it certainly did credit to the school, the community and the county. The exhibits were line and were brought from more homes than ever before. Several of the little schools made fine showings, even though they had little school material to work with. After this fair was over Mr. Mattil did the greater part in putting on a county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. The nurse also put on a tine health exhibit. The school exhibit received first prize of $15.00 and the county exhibit second prize, which gave us a neat sum to start next year's Fair on. Another year there will be a county Fair in Sevierville and 1 feel S.ECTTLEMr,NT SCHOOL 43 that with what we do here and what we should do to 'boost the ,county Fair it would be best not to make any effort to exhibit in Knoxville. The Christmas entertainment, Valentine parties, picnics, and socials during warm weather, keeping open house at `Tea(Thers' Cottage Friday and Saturday nights comprise the social side of the school, life. The crying need of the community is supervised play and recreation Saturday and Sunday afternoons the year round. Yet with every teacher working full time, some of them six (lays of the week, and then teaching Sunday School on Sunday, how can they give the one after-noon they have for their rest and recreation? We have talked and talked of finding some young man who would do that kind of work during the summer, but have never come to the point of really trying to locate one. Neither do I know whether it would be possible to find one to come for expenses only. Sugarlands needs work of this kind, too. When you see a crowd of boys going up and down and up and down the road all Sunday afternoon just looking for something to do you wonder they escape as much trouble as they do. And what saves even our dormitory boys over the week-end is more than I can tell. The barn is open for basketball some Sunday afternoons and ;base-ball is played more or less during the summer, but there should be someone in charge. Also a clubroom of some kind should be, kept open those afternoons. None of us are satisfied with the amount of community work we do, but with every hour full we seem unable to take over any more. Each summer more people come into the Burg, there are more at-tractions away from the simple pleasures the people have been used to and I feel that right now we should nmke a great effort to hold the young people to their church, their homes and their community life. I still feel that one of the best things we are doing and one most appreciated is sending out the Gatlinburg News each month. Five hundred copies are printed and 25O go up and down these creeks and are really read. It is one of the pieces of real work that we feel well re-paid for doing. EXTENSION: Each year the question of extension comes up and each time under different circumstances. The Sugarlancls work is well enough established so we do not need to question continuing so much as the best methods to pursue. With the county furnishing eight months of free school we have not had to supplement any salaries in Sugarlands for grade work. Our help was with cooking, sewing, agriculture and adult work. The work in Laurel Lick has been along this line only. Several times Dr. Ogle and the County Superintendent have asked us why we did not investigate Laurel Lick field with a view toe helping there. Our answer has been that we had now about all we could manage. This year Miss Barrett has been very much interested and would like to take the primary room there next year. The county would pay sufficient salary to be equiv.-. alent to what she received here last year. The problem would be the 44 THE ARROW OE' PI BETA PHI living. She could not live alone, neither is there a suitable place for her to board. She has thought that possibly some girl working for her Master s Degree might be interested in spending a year there, coming for expenses only and possibly being willing even to pay those herself. This would furnish someone to help with community work. Helen and I figured that if we did anything toward making a cab-in habitable and getting any supplies whatever it would mean putting about $500.00 into the venture. She said she was willing to try to raise enough to finance the project, but I discouraged that thinking it Would keep funds out of the budget. Through the hair, meetings in different schools, visits of the nurse to weigh and measure children, agriculture classes in Sugarlands and Laurel Lick and some work done in other schools, we have been able to do a good deal for these other schools and with good results. SUGARLANDS : Sugarlands created a good deal of worry and trouble in the late summer. This was due first of all to an uncertainty in regard to Miss Chew being able to return to her work there, then to carelessness on my part in applying to one of the school ;board who thought I should ask him for the school. Cora McCarter had the same grades again, but the ones Miss Chew had were given to the board member's son-in-law. At first this made a good deal of trouble as the people wanted Miss Chew and we felt we had not had a square deal. Before many weeks we saw that it had been a fortunate move, rather than otherwise, for it gave Miss Chew the opportunity to try out adult school work there. Her work consisted in much visiting and answering calls at her house. 'Classes were held three afternoons in the school house after the regular school was dismissed. Thirteel boys were enrolled. One walked from the lumber camps across the mountain once a week. These boys were from fifteen to twenty years of age and doing work from first or second grade to a possible fourth or fifth. The older people were taught in their homes and several men and women over sixty years of age learned to. read and write. One was delighted that she could go to the mail box and tell to whom the letters were addressed. With the coming of bad weather it seemed best to discontinue these classes so Miss Chew took her vacation in January and February and will carry classes through the spring and summer. The State allowed us $212.50 on Miss Chew's salary for the fall term and says it will continue to help us this spring. Mrs. Stark called a meeting when she was here so that the county board and Sugarlands people could come to some agreement and also that she could have some idea of how each group stood. The people later signed a paper stating that they were willing to call this year one of the four required ones to give a clear title to the land and the county board gave a written statement showing their willingness to co-operate hereafter. Nothing has discouraged the people in Sugarlands so much as not having a teachers' cottage started yet. They feel they have been prom SETTLEMriNT SCHOOL R-C,PORTS 45 ised it and that were it there they would be assured the Pi Phis were there to stay. Then several men hoped for work on the building. The county school term has been eight months, which has meant the county has financed the teaching of the school. The board has again promised a new school building to be completed by opening of next term. Our allowance of $1,600 for Sugarlands has not been used this year, therefore, I would recommend the balance left be used in helping build a teachers' cottage, it being added to the Hazel Todd Meaden Fund, if that is released. I would. recommend also that the adult work be continued another year if possible. Miss Chew's report gives the list of community activities. IMPROVEMENTS MADE DURING THE YEAR: Rock walks laid around the cottages. New flue built for Pollard Cottage. Incubator house built-one half to be used for root store house. Full time weaving teacher engaged. Third year added to high school. Engine and wood house rebuilt, making new store. Redressing school desks. Guttering and draining around schoolhouse. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR: Farmer and supervisor of boys' work engaged. Gift shop plans adopted for the summer. Central dining hall. Purchasing agent to plan meals and manage girls' dormitory, living in the dormitory. Office helper and sufficient office equipment, including typewriter, adding machine and desk. Scale of salary increase for teaching experience in the school. Teacher in boys' dormitory. Community worker for Saturdays and Sundays during the summer. Teachers' cottage in Sugarlands. Schoolhouse started or room added to present building. In closing my report I again want to express my appreciation of the entire staff and the committee. Again, I say that but for the sympathy and help each has so willingly given the other the year's program never could have been carried on so successfully. These are the things that give joy to the work here and .make us all loath to give up our connection with the School and Pi Phi work. EVELYN BISHOP, Head Resident. 46 T r. ARRow ov PI BETA PHI DIGEST ()F MINUTES Settlement School Conanittee Meeting, March 5, 1926 A full membership was present. The membership, with permission of Grand Council, met (luring tlni School session, which proved a great success, as this gave the committee a better working knowledge of conditions at the School, and a more sympathetic understanding of the staff. Hereafter, all weaving work will have the trademark of the Settlement School, which is in the form of a, blue paper sticker with red design. A branding iron carrying the trademark will be used on bas kets and furniture. The Committee decided to build the industrial unit to the new school building with the funds now available. Several gifts from individuals, and one bequest, together with certain sums voted from interests and current expenses, have helped increase this fund to such an amount as to encourage our undertaking this enterprise. The need of such is most apparent. This building will probably be a memorial building. The School plant is in very good condition. No excessive expense is necessary for the repairs as it has been our policy to keep the buildings in as good condition as possible. There may be some necessary painting work to be done. As usual, the School, its staff and problems took considerable time. Evelyn Bishop was re-elected as Head Resident. Margaret White is to be Principal of the higher grades. Emily Burton is to return after a leave of absence for one year. Marian Folsom and Elmer Watson were re-elected. Lois Rogers resigned to be office assistant to the Head Resident. Mrs. E. A. Bishop was elected to become Matron of the Girls' Dormitory, purchasing agent, and supervisor of the central dining room. Mrs. Dowell is to have charge of noon lunches for all school pupils, and Matron of the Boys' Dormitory. Jean Steele and O. J. Mattil were re-elected to carry on the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science and Agricultural work, respectively. Winogene Redding will be the teacher and super-visor of the weaving department. Too much praise cannot be given to her success along these lines. Some changes have been made in the running of the School. There are to be two principals, one for lower grade work, one for high school work. There are to be two primary teachers, as this class has grown so, owing to the consolidation of several schools. There are to be noon lunches for all pupils. This is to be self-supporting if possible. The basement of the School will be converted in classrooms for primary grades. An extra office in the Teftchers' Cottage will be in the room now used as a downstairs bedroom. All books in the Library are to be catalogued or repaired. A fifth and sixth grade teacher has to be elected, also principal of lower grades. A teacher's salary is to be fifty dollars per month for the first year, fifty-five dollars for the third year, SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 47 and sixty for the fourth year and sixty-five for the fifth year. The price of all orders for industrial work, other than from alumnae clubs, shall be increased 25%. Color cards and samples of weaving are to be sent upon request.. Alumnae Clubs are offered 1% discount for cash within 30 days from date of invoice. Board paid by new teachers is to be increased to $20.00 per month. Miss Higinbotham was granted six month's leave. Another nurse is to take her place. Requests for a typewriter and a ear discussed. An assistant to the nurse was authorized again, and Lizzie Reagan was elected as Harmo Taylor resigned. The Hazel Todd Meaden Memorial House is to be.. built at the Emma Harper Turner Center. Helen Chew was elected as head of the work, and she, with the assistance of head Resident, secured another 1)i Phi teacher, and will dictate the policy at this center. Smith-Hughes adult Education Fund again solicited. The County is building a very nice new school building at the Emma Harper Turner Center. It is with deep regret that we announce the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham. She is to become State Supervisor of Public Health Nursing of Tennessee. I could write a' lengthy eulogy on Miss Higinbotham. I could tell you of the hours of pure drudgery that she has gone through. I could tell you of thousands and thousands of such things and still would not have half begun. All who have known her and have seen .her know that contact with her has made them a better person to live in this world. Guests who desire to stay more than week ends in the school are to be charged at the rate of $1.00 a day. The fiscal year of the school has been changed to close on June 30. A reorganization of the industrial department and work is to be made. It is probable that a definite wholesale price schedule will be adopted, slightly higher than in the past to provide for increased cost of maintenance of the department and of materials, with standard discounts for quantity buying.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon." If you have not read these articles it has been your loss, as they have been full of human interest. She is certainly a most ardent worker of our School and her ability and personality make a happy combination. Dorothy Smallwood Geare has done a splendid work in sending out information to those members not belonging to any alumnae club. We feel that these members should be a part of this great work and it has been our plan to get them interested in this way in the School. Gertrude Brown Freeman has successfully followed Mrs. Curtis as the Ways and Means member of the committee. I have found her ad-vice on the committee matters instructive and enlightening and feel that she has been a decided asset. Owing to illness, Ethel Curryer could not start her work until November. When you read her report you will see that she has carried her part through in a manner that would do credit to a most experienced bookkeeper. Our work has increased to such a degree that she, at times, has had to do the work of three people rather than one. She has been patient and efficient and we are indeed fortunate in having such a treasurer for the Settlement School. Each of the committee, as well as I, feel that we are fortunate in being able to serve you in this undertaking a work that has been hard that has not been altogether happy at times--that has been exacting and time claiming when we could have been enjoying ourselves at Convention. But, being a work of such high ideals, we feel that no matter what effort it cost us it was worth it all. And, again, let us express to you our sincere appreciation of the opportunity for being a part of the greatest altruistic work any fraternity in America has ever undertaken. Remember, this School is yours. How successful its future is depends upon you. Do you want it to stand still? I think not. Do you want it to become better in every way? Your answer to this is in increased donations. NITA HILL STARK, Chairman. 50 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI REPORT OF THE TREASURER OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records a'nd accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., for the period 1925--1926 ending April 30, 1926. The books were audited and records checked for the period covering your term as treasurer and we have made a combined report for the entire year using a part of the previous Auditor's statements for the first few months of the 1925 term and wish to state that while we assume no responsibility for his figures we test checked and verified same whenever it seemed expedient to do so. We have verified the Bank Balance and all deposits and securities. All postings in the General Ledger were checked with the Journal and Check Register and all totals in all of the books were verified. All receipts were checked and verified with the checks issued in payment of same and all Invoices and Credit Memos were thoroughly examined, being checked against both the Journal and Check Register.

Sterrett 5.00 REPORT OF THE CATALOGUER The work of the Cataloguer for 1925-26 has consisted of two distinct parts, regular Catalogue work, and the opening of the new Central Record and Supply Office. She therefore reports under these two heads: I. CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files.

        42 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI year all the butter. Beside this we had eggs, chickens, pork and beef from the farm. All the fields that were cultivated were put into hay and other fodder, saving quite a little on our hay bill. We have on the farm two horses of our own and one owned by Mr. Mattil, but kept by us as we use it nearly all the time, 3 cows, 3 calves, one bull, one goat, 1 boar, 1 brood sow and some small pigs, about 100 chickens. We fat few hogs as it pays better to sell the yotng pigs and also puts good stock into the community. This year the boys have clone the milking, cared for the horses, pigs, and chickens. They have clone fairly well with the work, but it has meant waste of feed and time. Mr. Mattil has supervised all he could and Leander McCarter has tried to, too, but it is a steady job and one that needs a person with it all the time. This coming year we should employ a man as farmer and supervisor of student labor, both for the good of the farm and for the good of the boys. I doubt if it would mean the cash outlay it appears for there would be saving in other ways. Were there a farmer here all the time much of the outside labor could be turned over to the boys or done away with entirely. Also with better roads and the nurse making more trips in a car an extra horse can be used nmeh of the time on the farm, saving the team hire we now have. COMMUNITY: As more people come into the Valley and the roads improve so our people get in and out more the community activities seem to grow less. Whether we really do less or merely feel that way is a question. At any rate it is harder to get the local people together. The teachers take an active part in Sunday School and B. Y. P. U. Helen Barrett had a Junior meeting Sunday afternoons for the tots from six to eleven years. Basketball games, either of theschool or community team, have taken at least one evening a week during the winter. Movies began in April and continued through September. They were well patronized and the report shows that even with paying for some furnishings, we came out about even. In the fall pictures were shown in practically every little school around here. This was primarily to stimulate Fair interest, but as the pictures were along the line of farming, domestic science and health they were decidedly educational. 'he great ,community event of the year is the Gatlinburg Fair and this year it certainly did credit to the school, the community and the county. The exhibits were line and were brought from more homes than ever before. Several of the little schools made fine showings, even though they had little school material to work with. After this fair was over Mr. Mattil did the greater part in putting on a county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. The nurse also put on a tine health exhibit. The school exhibit received first prize of $15.00 and the county exhibit second prize, which gave us a neat sum to start next year's Fair on. Another year there will be a county Fair in Sevierville and 1 feel S.ECTTLEMr,NT SCHOOL 43 that with what we do here and what we should do to 'boost the ,county Fair it would be best not to make any effort to exhibit in Knoxville. The Christmas entertainment, Valentine parties, picnics, and socials during warm weather, keeping open house at `Tea(Thers' Cottage Friday and Saturday nights comprise the social side of the school, life. The crying need of the community is supervised play and recreation Saturday and Sunday afternoons the year round. Yet with every teacher working full time, some of them six (lays of the week, and then teaching Sunday School on Sunday, how can they give the one after-noon they have for their rest and recreation? We have talked and talked of finding some young man who would do that kind of work during the summer, but have never come to the point of really trying to locate one. Neither do I know whether it would be possible to find one to come for expenses only. Sugarlands needs work of this kind, too. When you see a crowd of boys going up and down and up and down the road all Sunday afternoon just looking for something to do you wonder they escape as much trouble as they do. And what saves even our dormitory boys over the week-end is more than I can tell. The barn is open for basketball some Sunday afternoons and ;base-ball is played more or less during the summer, but there should be someone in charge. Also a clubroom of some kind should be, kept open those afternoons. None of us are satisfied with the amount of community work we do, but with every hour full we seem unable to take over any more. Each summer more people come into the Burg, there are more at-tractions away from the simple pleasures the people have been used to and I feel that right now we should nmke a great effort to hold the young people to their church, their homes and their community life. I still feel that one of the best things we are doing and one most appreciated is sending out the Gatlinburg News each month. Five hundred copies are printed and 25O go up and down these creeks and are really read. It is one of the pieces of real work that we feel well re-paid for doing. EXTENSION: Each year the question of extension comes up and each time under different circumstances. The Sugarlancls work is well enough established so we do not need to question continuing so much as the best methods to pursue. With the county furnishing eight months of free school we have not had to supplement any salaries in Sugarlands for grade work. Our help was with cooking, sewing, agriculture and adult work. The work in Laurel Lick has been along this line only. Several times Dr. Ogle and the County Superintendent have asked us why we did not investigate Laurel Lick field with a view toe helping there. Our answer has been that we had now about all we could manage. This year Miss Barrett has been very much interested and would like to take the primary room there next year. The county would pay sufficient salary to be equiv.-. alent to what she received here last year. The problem would be the 44 THE ARROW OE' PI BETA PHI living. She could not live alone, neither is there a suitable place for her to board. She has thought that possibly some girl working for her Master s Degree might be interested in spending a year there, coming for expenses only and possibly being willing even to pay those herself. This would furnish someone to help with community work. Helen and I figured that if we did anything toward making a cab-in habitable and getting any supplies whatever it would mean putting about $500.00 into the venture. She said she was willing to try to raise enough to finance the project, but I discouraged that thinking it Would keep funds out of the budget. Through the hair, meetings in different schools, visits of the nurse to weigh and measure children, agriculture classes in Sugarlands and Laurel Lick and some work done in other schools, we have been able to do a good deal for these other schools and with good results. SUGARLANDS : Sugarlands created a good deal of worry and trouble in the late summer. This was due first of all to an uncertainty in regard to Miss Chew being able to return to her work there, then to carelessness on my part in applying to one of the school ;board who thought I should ask him for the school. Cora McCarter had the same grades again, but the ones Miss Chew had were given to the board member's son-in-law. At first this made a good deal of trouble as the people wanted Miss Chew and we felt we had not had a square deal. Before many weeks we saw that it had been a fortunate move, rather than otherwise, for it gave Miss Chew the opportunity to try out adult school work there. Her work consisted in much visiting and answering calls at her house. 'Classes were held three afternoons in the school house after the regular school was dismissed. Thirteel boys were enrolled. One walked from the lumber camps across the mountain once a week. These boys were from fifteen to twenty years of age and doing work from first or second grade to a possible fourth or fifth. The older people were taught in their homes and several men and women over sixty years of age learned to. read and write. One was delighted that she could go to the mail box and tell to whom the letters were addressed. With the coming of bad weather it seemed best to discontinue these classes so Miss Chew took her vacation in January and February and will carry classes through the spring and summer. The State allowed us $212.50 on Miss Chew's salary for the fall term and says it will continue to help us this spring. Mrs. Stark called a meeting when she was here so that the county board and Sugarlands people could come to some agreement and also that she could have some idea of how each group stood. The people later signed a paper stating that they were willing to call this year one of the four required ones to give a clear title to the land and the county board gave a written statement showing their willingness to co-operate hereafter. Nothing has discouraged the people in Sugarlands so much as not having a teachers' cottage started yet. They feel they have been prom SETTLEMriNT SCHOOL R-C,PORTS 45 ised it and that were it there they would be assured the Pi Phis were there to stay. Then several men hoped for work on the building. The county school term has been eight months, which has meant the county has financed the teaching of the school. The board has again promised a new school building to be completed by opening of next term. Our allowance of $1,600 for Sugarlands has not been used this year, therefore, I would recommend the balance left be used in helping build a teachers' cottage, it being added to the Hazel Todd Meaden Fund, if that is released. I would. recommend also that the adult work be continued another year if possible. Miss Chew's report gives the list of community activities. IMPROVEMENTS MADE DURING THE YEAR: Rock walks laid around the cottages. New flue built for Pollard Cottage. Incubator house built-one half to be used for root store house. Full time weaving teacher engaged. Third year added to high school. Engine and wood house rebuilt, making new store. Redressing school desks. Guttering and draining around schoolhouse. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR: Farmer and supervisor of boys' work engaged. Gift shop plans adopted for the summer. Central dining hall. Purchasing agent to plan meals and manage girls' dormitory, living in the dormitory. Office helper and sufficient office equipment, including typewriter, adding machine and desk. Scale of salary increase for teaching experience in the school. Teacher in boys' dormitory. Community worker for Saturdays and Sundays during the summer. Teachers' cottage in Sugarlands. Schoolhouse started or room added to present building. In closing my report I again want to express my appreciation of the entire staff and the committee. Again, I say that but for the sympathy and help each has so willingly given the other the year's program never could have been carried on so successfully. These are the things that give joy to the work here and .make us all loath to give up our connection with the School and Pi Phi work. EVELYN BISHOP, Head Resident. 46 T r. ARRow ov PI BETA PHI DIGEST ()F MINUTES Settlement School Conanittee Meeting, March 5, 1926 A full membership was present. The membership, with permission of Grand Council, met (luring tlni School session, which proved a great success, as this gave the committee a better working knowledge of conditions at the School, and a more sympathetic understanding of the staff. Hereafter, all weaving work will have the trademark of the Settlement School, which is in the form of a, blue paper sticker with red design. A branding iron carrying the trademark will be used on bas kets and furniture. The Committee decided to build the industrial unit to the new school building with the funds now available. Several gifts from individuals, and one bequest, together with certain sums voted from interests and current expenses, have helped increase this fund to such an amount as to encourage our undertaking this enterprise. The need of such is most apparent. This building will probably be a memorial building. The School plant is in very good condition. No excessive expense is necessary for the repairs as it has been our policy to keep the buildings in as good condition as possible. There may be some necessary painting work to be done. As usual, the School, its staff and problems took considerable time. Evelyn Bishop was re-elected as Head Resident. Margaret White is to be Principal of the higher grades. Emily Burton is to return after a leave of absence for one year. Marian Folsom and Elmer Watson were re-elected. Lois Rogers resigned to be office assistant to the Head Resident. Mrs. E. A. Bishop was elected to become Matron of the Girls' Dormitory, purchasing agent, and supervisor of the central dining room. Mrs. Dowell is to have charge of noon lunches for all school pupils, and Matron of the Boys' Dormitory. Jean Steele and O. J. Mattil were re-elected to carry on the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science and Agricultural work, respectively. Winogene Redding will be the teacher and super-visor of the weaving department. Too much praise cannot be given to her success along these lines. Some changes have been made in the running of the School. There are to be two principals, one for lower grade work, one for high school work. There are to be two primary teachers, as this class has grown so, owing to the consolidation of several schools. There are to be noon lunches for all pupils. This is to be self-supporting if possible. The basement of the School will be converted in classrooms for primary grades. An extra office in the Teftchers' Cottage will be in the room now used as a downstairs bedroom. All books in the Library are to be catalogued or repaired. A fifth and sixth grade teacher has to be elected, also principal of lower grades. A teacher's salary is to be fifty dollars per month for the first year, fifty-five dollars for the third year, SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 47 and sixty for the fourth year and sixty-five for the fifth year. The price of all orders for industrial work, other than from alumnae clubs, shall be increased 25%. Color cards and samples of weaving are to be sent upon request.. Alumnae Clubs are offered 1% discount for cash within 30 days from date of invoice. Board paid by new teachers is to be increased to $20.00 per month. Miss Higinbotham was granted six month's leave. Another nurse is to take her place. Requests for a typewriter and a ear discussed. An assistant to the nurse was authorized again, and Lizzie Reagan was elected as Harmo Taylor resigned. The Hazel Todd Meaden Memorial House is to be.. built at the Emma Harper Turner Center. Helen Chew was elected as head of the work, and she, with the assistance of head Resident, secured another 1)i Phi teacher, and will dictate the policy at this center. Smith-Hughes adult Education Fund again solicited. The County is building a very nice new school building at the Emma Harper Turner Center. It is with deep regret that we announce the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham. She is to become State Supervisor of Public Health Nursing of Tennessee. I could write a' lengthy eulogy on Miss Higinbotham. I could tell you of the hours of pure drudgery that she has gone through. I could tell you of thousands and thousands of such things and still would not have half begun. All who have known her and have seen .her know that contact with her has made them a better person to live in this world. Guests who desire to stay more than week ends in the school are to be charged at the rate of $1.00 a day. The fiscal year of the school has been changed to close on June 30. A reorganization of the industrial department and work is to be made. It is probable that a definite wholesale price schedule will be adopted, slightly higher than in the past to provide for increased cost of maintenance of the department and of materials, with standard discounts for quantity buying.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon." If you have not read these articles it has been your loss, as they have been full of human interest. She is certainly a most ardent worker of our School and her ability and personality make a happy combination. Dorothy Smallwood Geare has done a splendid work in sending out information to those members not belonging to any alumnae club. We feel that these members should be a part of this great work and it has been our plan to get them interested in this way in the School. Gertrude Brown Freeman has successfully followed Mrs. Curtis as the Ways and Means member of the committee. I have found her ad-vice on the committee matters instructive and enlightening and feel that she has been a decided asset. Owing to illness, Ethel Curryer could not start her work until November. When you read her report you will see that she has carried her part through in a manner that would do credit to a most experienced bookkeeper. Our work has increased to such a degree that she, at times, has had to do the work of three people rather than one. She has been patient and efficient and we are indeed fortunate in having such a treasurer for the Settlement School. Each of the committee, as well as I, feel that we are fortunate in being able to serve you in this undertaking a work that has been hard that has not been altogether happy at times--that has been exacting and time claiming when we could have been enjoying ourselves at Convention. But, being a work of such high ideals, we feel that no matter what effort it cost us it was worth it all. And, again, let us express to you our sincere appreciation of the opportunity for being a part of the greatest altruistic work any fraternity in America has ever undertaken. Remember, this School is yours. How successful its future is depends upon you. Do you want it to stand still? I think not. Do you want it to become better in every way? Your answer to this is in increased donations. NITA HILL STARK, Chairman. 50 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI REPORT OF THE TREASURER OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records a'nd accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., for the period 1925--1926 ending April 30, 1926. The books were audited and records checked for the period covering your term as treasurer and we have made a combined report for the entire year using a part of the previous Auditor's statements for the first few months of the 1925 term and wish to state that while we assume no responsibility for his figures we test checked and verified same whenever it seemed expedient to do so. We have verified the Bank Balance and all deposits and securities. All postings in the General Ledger were checked with the Journal and Check Register and all totals in all of the books were verified. All receipts were checked and verified with the checks issued in payment of same and all Invoices and Credit Memos were thoroughly examined, being checked against both the Journal and Check Register.

She therefore reports under these two heads: I. CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files.

        44 THE ARROW OE' PI BETA PHI living. She could not live alone, neither is there a suitable place for her to board. She has thought that possibly some girl working for her Master s Degree might be interested in spending a year there, coming for expenses only and possibly being willing even to pay those herself. This would furnish someone to help with community work. Helen and I figured that if we did anything toward making a cab-in habitable and getting any supplies whatever it would mean putting about $500.00 into the venture. She said she was willing to try to raise enough to finance the project, but I discouraged that thinking it Would keep funds out of the budget. Through the hair, meetings in different schools, visits of the nurse to weigh and measure children, agriculture classes in Sugarlands and Laurel Lick and some work done in other schools, we have been able to do a good deal for these other schools and with good results. SUGARLANDS : Sugarlands created a good deal of worry and trouble in the late summer. This was due first of all to an uncertainty in regard to Miss Chew being able to return to her work there, then to carelessness on my part in applying to one of the school ;board who thought I should ask him for the school. Cora McCarter had the same grades again, but the ones Miss Chew had were given to the board member's son-in-law. At first this made a good deal of trouble as the people wanted Miss Chew and we felt we had not had a square deal. Before many weeks we saw that it had been a fortunate move, rather than otherwise, for it gave Miss Chew the opportunity to try out adult school work there. Her work consisted in much visiting and answering calls at her house. 'Classes were held three afternoons in the school house after the regular school was dismissed. Thirteel boys were enrolled. One walked from the lumber camps across the mountain once a week. These boys were from fifteen to twenty years of age and doing work from first or second grade to a possible fourth or fifth. The older people were taught in their homes and several men and women over sixty years of age learned to. read and write. One was delighted that she could go to the mail box and tell to whom the letters were addressed. With the coming of bad weather it seemed best to discontinue these classes so Miss Chew took her vacation in January and February and will carry classes through the spring and summer. The State allowed us $212.50 on Miss Chew's salary for the fall term and says it will continue to help us this spring. Mrs. Stark called a meeting when she was here so that the county board and Sugarlands people could come to some agreement and also that she could have some idea of how each group stood. The people later signed a paper stating that they were willing to call this year one of the four required ones to give a clear title to the land and the county board gave a written statement showing their willingness to co-operate hereafter. Nothing has discouraged the people in Sugarlands so much as not having a teachers' cottage started yet. They feel they have been prom SETTLEMriNT SCHOOL R-C,PORTS 45 ised it and that were it there they would be assured the Pi Phis were there to stay. Then several men hoped for work on the building. The county school term has been eight months, which has meant the county has financed the teaching of the school. The board has again promised a new school building to be completed by opening of next term. Our allowance of $1,600 for Sugarlands has not been used this year, therefore, I would recommend the balance left be used in helping build a teachers' cottage, it being added to the Hazel Todd Meaden Fund, if that is released. I would. recommend also that the adult work be continued another year if possible. Miss Chew's report gives the list of community activities. IMPROVEMENTS MADE DURING THE YEAR: Rock walks laid around the cottages. New flue built for Pollard Cottage. Incubator house built-one half to be used for root store house. Full time weaving teacher engaged. Third year added to high school. Engine and wood house rebuilt, making new store. Redressing school desks. Guttering and draining around schoolhouse. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR: Farmer and supervisor of boys' work engaged. Gift shop plans adopted for the summer. Central dining hall. Purchasing agent to plan meals and manage girls' dormitory, living in the dormitory. Office helper and sufficient office equipment, including typewriter, adding machine and desk. Scale of salary increase for teaching experience in the school. Teacher in boys' dormitory. Community worker for Saturdays and Sundays during the summer. Teachers' cottage in Sugarlands. Schoolhouse started or room added to present building. In closing my report I again want to express my appreciation of the entire staff and the committee. Again, I say that but for the sympathy and help each has so willingly given the other the year's program never could have been carried on so successfully. These are the things that give joy to the work here and .make us all loath to give up our connection with the School and Pi Phi work. EVELYN BISHOP, Head Resident. 46 T r. ARRow ov PI BETA PHI DIGEST ()F MINUTES Settlement School Conanittee Meeting, March 5, 1926 A full membership was present. The membership, with permission of Grand Council, met (luring tlni School session, which proved a great success, as this gave the committee a better working knowledge of conditions at the School, and a more sympathetic understanding of the staff. Hereafter, all weaving work will have the trademark of the Settlement School, which is in the form of a, blue paper sticker with red design. A branding iron carrying the trademark will be used on bas kets and furniture. The Committee decided to build the industrial unit to the new school building with the funds now available. Several gifts from individuals, and one bequest, together with certain sums voted from interests and current expenses, have helped increase this fund to such an amount as to encourage our undertaking this enterprise. The need of such is most apparent. This building will probably be a memorial building. The School plant is in very good condition. No excessive expense is necessary for the repairs as it has been our policy to keep the buildings in as good condition as possible. There may be some necessary painting work to be done. As usual, the School, its staff and problems took considerable time. Evelyn Bishop was re-elected as Head Resident. Margaret White is to be Principal of the higher grades. Emily Burton is to return after a leave of absence for one year. Marian Folsom and Elmer Watson were re-elected. Lois Rogers resigned to be office assistant to the Head Resident. Mrs. E. A. Bishop was elected to become Matron of the Girls' Dormitory, purchasing agent, and supervisor of the central dining room. Mrs. Dowell is to have charge of noon lunches for all school pupils, and Matron of the Boys' Dormitory. Jean Steele and O. J. Mattil were re-elected to carry on the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science and Agricultural work, respectively. Winogene Redding will be the teacher and super-visor of the weaving department. Too much praise cannot be given to her success along these lines. Some changes have been made in the running of the School. There are to be two principals, one for lower grade work, one for high school work. There are to be two primary teachers, as this class has grown so, owing to the consolidation of several schools. There are to be noon lunches for all pupils. This is to be self-supporting if possible. The basement of the School will be converted in classrooms for primary grades. An extra office in the Teftchers' Cottage will be in the room now used as a downstairs bedroom. All books in the Library are to be catalogued or repaired. A fifth and sixth grade teacher has to be elected, also principal of lower grades. A teacher's salary is to be fifty dollars per month for the first year, fifty-five dollars for the third year, SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 47 and sixty for the fourth year and sixty-five for the fifth year. The price of all orders for industrial work, other than from alumnae clubs, shall be increased 25%. Color cards and samples of weaving are to be sent upon request.. Alumnae Clubs are offered 1% discount for cash within 30 days from date of invoice. Board paid by new teachers is to be increased to $20.00 per month. Miss Higinbotham was granted six month's leave. Another nurse is to take her place. Requests for a typewriter and a ear discussed. An assistant to the nurse was authorized again, and Lizzie Reagan was elected as Harmo Taylor resigned. The Hazel Todd Meaden Memorial House is to be.. built at the Emma Harper Turner Center. Helen Chew was elected as head of the work, and she, with the assistance of head Resident, secured another 1)i Phi teacher, and will dictate the policy at this center. Smith-Hughes adult Education Fund again solicited. The County is building a very nice new school building at the Emma Harper Turner Center. It is with deep regret that we announce the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham. She is to become State Supervisor of Public Health Nursing of Tennessee. I could write a' lengthy eulogy on Miss Higinbotham. I could tell you of the hours of pure drudgery that she has gone through. I could tell you of thousands and thousands of such things and still would not have half begun. All who have known her and have seen .her know that contact with her has made them a better person to live in this world. Guests who desire to stay more than week ends in the school are to be charged at the rate of $1.00 a day. The fiscal year of the school has been changed to close on June 30. A reorganization of the industrial department and work is to be made. It is probable that a definite wholesale price schedule will be adopted, slightly higher than in the past to provide for increased cost of maintenance of the department and of materials, with standard discounts for quantity buying.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon."

Sterrett 5.00 REPORT OF THE CATALOGUER The work of the Cataloguer for 1925-26 has consisted of two distinct parts, regular Catalogue work, and the opening of the new Central Record and Supply Office. She therefore reports under these two heads: I. CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files.

        46 T r. ARRow ov PI BETA PHI DIGEST ()F MINUTES Settlement School Conanittee Meeting, March 5, 1926 A full membership was present. The membership, with permission of Grand Council, met (luring tlni School session, which proved a great success, as this gave the committee a better working knowledge of conditions at the School, and a more sympathetic understanding of the staff. Hereafter, all weaving work will have the trademark of the Settlement School, which is in the form of a, blue paper sticker with red design. A branding iron carrying the trademark will be used on bas kets and furniture. The Committee decided to build the industrial unit to the new school building with the funds now available. Several gifts from individuals, and one bequest, together with certain sums voted from interests and current expenses, have helped increase this fund to such an amount as to encourage our undertaking this enterprise. The need of such is most apparent. This building will probably be a memorial building. The School plant is in very good condition. No excessive expense is necessary for the repairs as it has been our policy to keep the buildings in as good condition as possible. There may be some necessary painting work to be done. As usual, the School, its staff and problems took considerable time. Evelyn Bishop was re-elected as Head Resident. Margaret White is to be Principal of the higher grades. Emily Burton is to return after a leave of absence for one year. Marian Folsom and Elmer Watson were re-elected. Lois Rogers resigned to be office assistant to the Head Resident. Mrs. E. A. Bishop was elected to become Matron of the Girls' Dormitory, purchasing agent, and supervisor of the central dining room. Mrs. Dowell is to have charge of noon lunches for all school pupils, and Matron of the Boys' Dormitory. Jean Steele and O. J. Mattil were re-elected to carry on the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science and Agricultural work, respectively. Winogene Redding will be the teacher and super-visor of the weaving department. Too much praise cannot be given to her success along these lines. Some changes have been made in the running of the School. There are to be two principals, one for lower grade work, one for high school work. There are to be two primary teachers, as this class has grown so, owing to the consolidation of several schools. There are to be noon lunches for all pupils. This is to be self-supporting if possible. The basement of the School will be converted in classrooms for primary grades. An extra office in the Teftchers' Cottage will be in the room now used as a downstairs bedroom. All books in the Library are to be catalogued or repaired. A fifth and sixth grade teacher has to be elected, also principal of lower grades. A teacher's salary is to be fifty dollars per month for the first year, fifty-five dollars for the third year, SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 47 and sixty for the fourth year and sixty-five for the fifth year. The price of all orders for industrial work, other than from alumnae clubs, shall be increased 25%. Color cards and samples of weaving are to be sent upon request.. Alumnae Clubs are offered 1% discount for cash within 30 days from date of invoice. Board paid by new teachers is to be increased to $20.00 per month. Miss Higinbotham was granted six month's leave. Another nurse is to take her place. Requests for a typewriter and a ear discussed. An assistant to the nurse was authorized again, and Lizzie Reagan was elected as Harmo Taylor resigned. The Hazel Todd Meaden Memorial House is to be.. built at the Emma Harper Turner Center. Helen Chew was elected as head of the work, and she, with the assistance of head Resident, secured another 1)i Phi teacher, and will dictate the policy at this center. Smith-Hughes adult Education Fund again solicited. The County is building a very nice new school building at the Emma Harper Turner Center. It is with deep regret that we announce the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham. She is to become State Supervisor of Public Health Nursing of Tennessee. I could write a' lengthy eulogy on Miss Higinbotham. I could tell you of the hours of pure drudgery that she has gone through. I could tell you of thousands and thousands of such things and still would not have half begun. All who have known her and have seen .her know that contact with her has made them a better person to live in this world. Guests who desire to stay more than week ends in the school are to be charged at the rate of $1.00 a day. The fiscal year of the school has been changed to close on June 30. A reorganization of the industrial department and work is to be made. It is probable that a definite wholesale price schedule will be adopted, slightly higher than in the past to provide for increased cost of maintenance of the department and of materials, with standard discounts for quantity buying.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon." If you have not read these articles it has been your loss, as they have been full of human interest. She is certainly a most ardent worker of our School and her ability and personality make a happy combination. Dorothy Smallwood Geare has done a splendid work in sending out information to those members not belonging to any alumnae club. We feel that these members should be a part of this great work and it has been our plan to get them interested in this way in the School. Gertrude Brown Freeman has successfully followed Mrs. Curtis as the Ways and Means member of the committee. I have found her ad-vice on the committee matters instructive and enlightening and feel that she has been a decided asset. Owing to illness, Ethel Curryer could not start her work until November. When you read her report you will see that she has carried her part through in a manner that would do credit to a most experienced bookkeeper. Our work has increased to such a degree that she, at times, has had to do the work of three people rather than one. She has been patient and efficient and we are indeed fortunate in having such a treasurer for the Settlement School. Each of the committee, as well as I, feel that we are fortunate in being able to serve you in this undertaking a work that has been hard that has not been altogether happy at times--that has been exacting and time claiming when we could have been enjoying ourselves at Convention.

Sterrett 5.00 REPORT OF THE CATALOGUER The work of the Cataloguer for 1925-26 has consisted of two distinct parts, regular Catalogue work, and the opening of the new Central Record and Supply Office. She therefore reports under these two heads: I. CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon." If you have not read these articles it has been your loss, as they have been full of human interest. She is certainly a most ardent worker of our School and her ability and personality make a happy combination. Dorothy Smallwood Geare has done a splendid work in sending out information to those members not belonging to any alumnae club. We feel that these members should be a part of this great work and it has been our plan to get them interested in this way in the School. Gertrude Brown Freeman has successfully followed Mrs. Curtis as the Ways and Means member of the committee. I have found her ad-vice on the committee matters instructive and enlightening and feel that she has been a decided asset. Owing to illness, Ethel Curryer could not start her work until November. When you read her report you will see that she has carried her part through in a manner that would do credit to a most experienced bookkeeper. Our work has increased to such a degree that she, at times, has had to do the work of three people rather than one. She has been patient and efficient and we are indeed fortunate in having such a treasurer for the Settlement School. Each of the committee, as well as I, feel that we are fortunate in being able to serve you in this undertaking a work that has been hard that has not been altogether happy at times--that has been exacting and time claiming when we could have been enjoying ourselves at Convention. But, being a work of such high ideals, we feel that no matter what effort it cost us it was worth it all. And, again, let us express to you our sincere appreciation of the opportunity for being a part of the greatest altruistic work any fraternity in America has ever undertaken. Remember, this School is yours. How successful its future is depends upon you. Do you want it to stand still? I think not. Do you want it to become better in every way? Your answer to this is in increased donations. NITA HILL STARK, Chairman. 50 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI REPORT OF THE TREASURER OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records a'nd accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., for the period 1925--1926 ending April 30, 1926.

CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files.

Sterrett 5.00 REPORT OF THE CATALOGUER The work of the Cataloguer for 1925-26 has consisted of two distinct parts, regular Catalogue work, and the opening of the new Central Record and Supply Office. She therefore reports under these two heads: I. CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late. Since the seventy-one chapters sent in 6,700 reports, some of which contain 400 names and addresses of members, it is clear that the Cataloguer has had sufficient data for really accurate work. Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files. 30 ARRow ov PI BETA Pu t its personnel is : Blanche Charlton Curtis, past Kappa Province Vice President, chairman ; Olive Keller Laurence, retiring Grand Vice President ; Kathleen Little, past Theta Province Vice President and representative of the New York Alumnae Club, and Genevieve Herrick Smith, Eta Province Vice President. The Grand Council formulated a recommendation for this committee, carrying out a suggestion made by the present Alumna? Editor : That it consider the advisability, following the emning Convention, of making the Alumme Editor a member of the ARROW Staff only, rather than a national officer, and of making the Assistant to the Grand Vice President a member of Convention and secretary to the alumme sessions. A motion carried that a committee composed of the Grand President, the Grand Vice President and the Assistant to the Grand Vice President work out the constitutional changes concerning the Alurnnm Department which were authorized by the 1925 Convention. The Grand Council also voted that this committee be instructed to formulate constitutional changes which would allow the election of one member of the Settlement School Committee at each Convention by the Alumme Department. Business relative to the next Convention was given general consideration and as many tentative plans were made for its con-duct as was possible. While no location was definitely decided upon as a meeting place, Yellowstone Park was believed to be the most acceptable one, and in all probability, providing further investigation proves favorable, the 1927 meeting of the fraternity will convene there. A motion carried to the effect that, in order to conserve time for legislative matters, the time limit, with one or two exceptions, upon the reports read at Convention, shall be placed at five minutes. At the close of the Grand Council Meeting, the Grand President formally installed Emilie Margaret White, Columbia A, as Grand Vice President. It was voted that the appointment of the new Assistant to the Grand Vice President be left with the Grand Vie President. At the conclusion of general planning for the constructive work and the chapter visits of Grand Officers for 1926-1927, the annual meeting of the Grand Council adjourned. FRANCESE EVANS IVES, Grand Secretary. SETTLEMENT .SCHOOL REPORTS 31 THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE At the close of this my third year as chairman of the Settlement School Committee of Pi Beta Phi, I am happy to express again to you my appreciation for the privilege of serving on the committee of an altruistic work second to none maintained by a National Panhellenic fraternity. Each year's service upon the committee has greatly strengthened the feeling that it' each individual member of Pi Beta Phi would avail herself of the opportunity of visiting the School she could not resist the temptation to become a 'more active worker for such a wonderful undertaking. My sole desire, as chairman of this work, has been the furtherance of the interest of the School, taking into consideration the necessities of the communities involved and the benefit to both the fraternity and the people with whom we come in contact. It has never been my desire to spend money foolishly in the advancement of new ideas, but to secure the best results with the least expenditure possible, considering the School, the demands upon it and the advancement of our ideals. The committee fully appreciates the amount of work that the different clubs and chapters necessarily must have done in order to raise their annual donations and for that reason, if for none other, 'we have tried to the best of our ability to expend the funds wisely. As an ex-ample of our economical handling of funds let me cite the fact that while the donations this year have been considerably less than those of last year, and, while having to subtract from this year's balance the sum pledged to the building fund last year, together with this year's pledge, our total with which to start the work next year is greater than that of last year. In other words, last year's balance should have shown $2,000 less, and our balance of this year would have read $2,000 more. I feel that this year has been most successful, financially and in every other way, with all our bills paid and those practically when due. With the consent of Grand Council our committee met this year while School was in session. We fee] most grateful for the privilege granted to us of seeing the organization in action. The information that each committee member obtained was invaluable and will bear marked results in the future. The organization for next year is about complete. There are some few changes but on the whole everything remains the same, Last year the School opened at its usual time, but owing to the fact that the summer hotels run prosperously through September, our attendance is not what we wish it to be, so that we do not deem it advisable to open school this year in August. 32 THE ARROW 05 Pi BETA PHI. Too much praise cannot be given to the staff, as each in her way was a valuable aid to the School and the cooperation, no matter how strenuous the effort may have been at times, was most praiseworthy. We are happy to announce that Miss Bishop will continue as Head Resident. Among her assets is her most unusual personality and her ability to mix and mingle with the p;'ople of every locality. This alone, if she did nothing else, would make her invaluable to the School. How-ever, the committee feels that she serves capably and well, and their personal contact with her has given them full confidence in her ability and good sense to handle any task. I shall again incorporate her re-port, as she can give you the details in a more concise form than I can. It is my earnest desire that you read her report in full, so that you may become better acquainted with the inner workings of the School. REPORT OF 'BEAD RESIDENT FOR THE YEAR 1925-1926 In making a report for the past year 1 wish to preface it by saying that in many ways it has been a most successful year, each one has been anxious to make improvements over the year previous. But I want to add a regret, too, that because of the circumstances in connection with the annual meeting of last year, some of the large things we had planned are impossible of accomplishment. The work from day to .day went on in a most satisfactory manner, school spirit was excellent, community cooperation better than ever be-fore and a splendid staff to carry on. Only we who were looking further than this year or next felt anxious to be taking up the larger progress we had in mind. However, the enforced wait may find us more ready for it this year. The staff has been as follows: Evelyn Bishop, Head Resident Phyllis Higinbotham, Nurse Harmo Taylor, Asst. to the nurse Margaret White, Departmental work, 7th-Sth and high school. Marion Folsom, Departmental work, 7th-Sth and high school Lois Rogers, 5th and 6th grades Elmer Watson, 3d and 4th grades athletic coach Helen Barrett, Primer, 1st and 2d grades Jean Steele, Domestic Science O. J. Mattil, Agriculture and community work Winogene Redding, Weaving school and community Helen Chew, Sugarlands School adult work Mrs. Dora Chapin, House mother girls' dormitory Lizzie Reagan, Cook and helper, teachers' cottage Mrs. Ownby, Cook, girls' dormitory Mrs. McCarter, Cook, boys' dormitory Leander McCarter, Firing furnaces, farm and general work SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS a Owing to the kind of work Miss Chew was doing it seemed wis for her to take her vacation in January and February instead of dui ing the summer as she was away nearly three months. Helen Barrett was compelled to go home the last month of schoc because of sickness. Her place was taken by Ann Clabo, one of our lc cal girls. Mrs. Dowell did not take any time off during the summer, so a Christmas went home for a month. Several clubs asked to have he stop over on her way back and it seemed worth while to accept thei invitations. She spoke to five clubs and chapters as well as some othe clubs. Jean Steele left us at Christmas time to enter college again an Barbara Dewell left college at that time to come back here, a Kapp arrangement for both girls and one that has not handicapped the Schoc any. Mrs. Chapin came back this year with the understanding that sli might have to leave before Christmas. MY mother was glad to finis the school year. While she has done much for the girls they have don worlds for her that she and I will never forget. The state is always most willing to give us any aid possible an has sent a number of advisors and visitors to the different department of the school. With the country opening up so much for tourists have a great many callers and people who are anxious to see the weary ing and baskets and the School. Last summer we felt sure that never would be wise again to open school as early as August 1. The oh er pupils were working at the hotels so were compelled to enter school month late, but the greatest reason for making the change was the we were deluged with visitors in the School. Of course it will be problem to keep the boys and girls in school longer in the spring, 131 we feel there is no doubt but that we must make this change. SCHOOL : The feeling among those who have been here the lunge is that the School has shown more growth and improvement this yei than in any other year of its history. There is no question about the growth in numbers. We have 11 an enrollment of 152 this year against 129 last year. This increase wl due in a large measure to many pupils coming from Cartertown, whe one of the county schools was a help. Running the truck a mile and half night and morning gave the little folks from Cartertown a chan to be in school every day and they surely took advantage of it. Whi the county did not give us any aid for transportation they did increa our monthly allowance $45.00 per month, which more than paid t] expenses of running the truck for those pupils. Another great improv meat in school has been the regular attendance. With so few chang in the teaching staff the year opened more easily and it was possit to do more constructive work. The question of discipline is never very hard one so there was little trouble in that line. The county ga eight months of free school this year, which was a great help in keepi: 34 THE ARROW Or PT BETA Pin the boys and girls during the spring term as well as helping us tinancially. The 7th, Sth and high school had nine months of school. Increase in enrollment next year is going to depend much on whether or not we have room to accommodate more. With any out-side school coming in the lower grades will be affected and they are now the over-crowded ones. Forty-five in the primary room has been almost impossible this. year and we can now count twenty little folks coming into that room another year with only ten going out. If no other school came in those grades might be carried by one teacher and a local girl as assistant, but I would not advise it. At any rate there would have to be a place to put them. Helen Barrett had splendid success with the little ones and even though she was compelled to go home at the beginning of the last month I feel that her pupils had the equivalent of a full year. The last month Ann Claho taught those grades and with very good results. Emily Burton writes that she is ready to come back again next year if we still want her and I am sure there is no doubt of that. Helen Barrett is very much interested in the Laurel Lick school, but. that is all so uncertain now we have no idea what may open up. The domestic science, agriculture and weaving departments have been carried on very successfully this year. The great gain that I feel has been made in the school is -due to a great extent to the cooperation among the teachers. While each room or each department is separate, to quite an extent, there is a sympathetic understanding among the teachers that does make for a good school and real development. The teachers are doing good, conscientious work and deserve a great deal of commendation for what they have accomplished. HIGH ScHou: The third year was added to the high school course this year. We have not been able to get an inspector out this year so are not yet on the accredited list. The County Superintendent feels there is no doubt about our grade of work. The state has added to the number of high schools in the state and to the requirements of teachers, etc., so the inspectors have been busy the entire year looking after the four year high schools. One promises to visit us ..before school closes this spring. The law required at least seven in each high school class so from that standpoint we are going to have hard work to qualify as a Grade A two-year high school. Three will complete third year this spring. We take a chance of someone dropping. On the other hand someone may come in in the fall. Our science work will be weak if we have fourth year, especially if we have no more room than we have now. There is not the incentive for hard work in small classes that there is where there is competition. Again, the roads are good enough and taxies running at reg ular hours so anyone wanting to go to Sevierville for high school work can make the trip night and morning. Against this we have the question of the morale of our own school. If we take out the older boys SETTLEM1 NT Sciroor, RIO.'ORTS 35 and girls we do weaken our school to quite an extent, especially in athletics. I feel sure we should not even consider adding the fourth year of high school until there are more class. 'rooms. The class entering high school next year will be small, one of the weakest classes we have had for some time, but the class following will more than make up for it. It seems to me it is hardly possible to make definite recommendations for next year without knowing what the decision will be in regard to building. This past year the third year work was done without ,adding an extra teacher so I feel sure we did well to add the work, but I am not sure how much more work we should add. In writing this report you will see that many times I have stressed the development of school. work because of experienced teachers having it in charge. This brings us to the question of staff' for another year. We start the new teachers at $GO.O( per month, home and travel. At the end of two, four, even eight years of work here the salary re-mains the same. This hardly seems fair yet our budget swells each year and an increase in salary seems almost impossible. Where we can cut down on expenses I do not know, nor do I see how we can increase our monthly expenses much, but I do feel there should be some way whereby we compensate the teachers for theirexperience and feel it shou'ld have consideration now. AGRICULTURE: Each morning is given over entirely to school work of this school. The classes are in agriculture and in farm shop. Instead of the. usual manual training these boys do more along the lino of farm carpentry work. They are urged to bring to the class things from home that need repairing and they are asked to make a list of things they want to make for their farms. With the text book work in agriculture, fruit growing, animal husbandry, etc., there are field trips and much practical work put in.. The afternoons are reserved for community -work and for classes in some of the other schools. One afternoon each week Mr. Mattil goes to the Sugarlands, another to Laurel Lick. Laurel hick is a new field and one taken over at the request of the teacher of the school. The people are really needy and are anxious to make the most of help that comes to them so it has been a very satisfactory field to work in. The other afternoons are given over to community work. This includes seeing sick animals, looking over poultry flocks, giving advice about pruning, spraying, etc. Because of the interest aroused in a poultry class last year some of the men have been marketing their poultry products this year with a view to taking up the business in a larger way soon. This spring a large incubator house was built and a large incubator gotten. This, of course, called for an enlargement to the broader house. The idea is to do most of the community hatching hero, the people to pay for the chicks. 36 THE ARROW of Pf BETA PHI The farm has been improved Quite a little and the stock quite care-fully taken care of. In the fall, Mr. Mattil had meetings in nearly every little school-house. He took a generator, Ford and moving pictures and many people saw movies for the first time. They were both entertaining and instructive, so, we felt did a good deal of good. The Gatlinburg Community Fair is a big event each year and one that Mr. Mattil shobld receive a great deal of credit for. Each year the school exhibits, the agricultural and home science exhibits are so much better than the year before. More people from up in the creeks come and bring something. Following this fair Mr. Mattil did the greater part of the work of putting a county exhibit up at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. It won third prize, which gave a good little sum to start our fair on next year. This whole department is doing a splendid work and filling a real need in the community and the school. Mr. Mattil will attend Cornell University this summer. DOMESTIC SCIENCE: This is another department that continues through the entire twelve months instead of the school year only. At the close of the school year Jean Steele started classes in Cartertown and Gatlinburg and continued the Sugarlands work for both girls and women. Much time was spent in visiting and trying to interest the women. It had ,been very hard twpersuade any women in the Burg to come to afternoon classes, but Jean helped several start their sewing and as some others wanted to can before Fair time she worked up a very good class. With the opening of school on August 1, the Cartertown class was discontinued, but the others went on in exactly the same way. The high school girls had classes in the morning so Jean could have the entire afternoon free for community work. This was all right for that department, but it made it extremely difficult to arrange a scedule in the school and necessitated having some high school classes at 7:30 in the morning. So much practical work the year before and not enough text book courses made it necessary to divide the high school domestic science classes so they would do extra work and bring the year's work up to standard. In the report of last year I explained the arrangements for teachers, Jean Steele to finish the spring term and continue the summer classes. Then carry the school work again until Christmas when she would go back to college and Barbara Dewell return. Even at the risk of losing state aid for this department if we discontinued some of the adult classes, we rearranged the schedule after Christmas so Barbara Dewell could take three grade classes and could put some of her high school work in the afternoon. This has relieved both teachers and pupils. The weather was too rough during January and February to have had classes in Sugarlands, but with the close of school this spring, those will be taken up again as well as work in one or two communities. SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 37 The State paid five-eighths of the salary of the domestic science teacher and no doubt will do so through the summer. Although we really are not qualifying for ,it now I believe we will be allowed it just the same. In the winter the state supervisor said that she would approve whoever we had to take the work after Miss Steele left, so l expect Barbara Dewell will continue through July. No great expense has been put into the domestic science room nor into equipment but paint, some changes in furnishings, two more windows and a lot of work have made it look fresher and brighter. A new ceiling has made the room more quiet. Investigation was made regarding steam heat for the room, but that did not prove to be possible so the range has answered all purposes and has been fairly satisfactory. The room has also been used for three grade classes. With more community work for the women and high school classes so well organized I feel this department has accomplished a great deal the past year. WEAVING: This year we have had a full time weaving teacher as recommended last spring. Winogene Redding came at the beginning of the second month of school. The looms took another move last fall, being put into the room that had been finished off for a store room under the porch of the Stuart Cottage. This was a great improvement over the log cabin, not only because of giving more light and room, but also bringing them a little nearer the school. All the looms needed overhauling and repairing so it was some little time before work could really begin. Another discouraging thing was that the eighth grade (which is the only one having weaving) is by far the weakest in the school. The girls are slow and not keen for the work. Finally, Miss Redding decided that some in the seventh grade who were older and were anxious to learn weaving should have the opportunity and since they have joined the class the work has taken on more life. Part of the morning is taken up answering calls at the house. All the afternoons are spent in, the various homes. Gene walks miles and miles and during the cold winter months has found it impossible even to be fairly comfortable when she is in the homes as they have been so very cold. The women have been very much interested and would do even more weaving than they do were we in position to keep buying their products in such large quantities. There has been a perfect craze for weaving and the children and the men are nearly as clever at it as the women. Of course, with the spring and summer farm work be-ginning, they will not have so much time for weaving. New patterns, new materials and a variety of things are being made. This time of year. we buy much more than we sell, but it is necessary in order to be ready for the fall. Miss Redding's report shows beyond question how important a full time weaving teacher is and if she returns another year that department will show still more improvement. 38 THE ARROW ov PI BETA PHI We still are handicapped because of lack of room .and until it can be provided we cannot purchase a larger loom or any other equipment. INDUSTRIAL: industrial business has grown to such an extent it really takes more time and work than any other one department, believe. This year we have bought and sold chairs, stools, weaving and baskets. As the Auditor's report will show: Total. purchases $7,552.1 0 Total sales 7,299.57 Net Loss $ 252.59 An inventory of our stock o hand shows that we have $2,360.7'1 Subtracting the total loss 2'''2.59 We have a gain of $2,10512 These figures give some idea of the immense amount of time that must be used in buying the timings from the people, packing and ship-ping them. The correspondence takes the treater part of the orrice time and even then flinch is not kept up as it should be. With the end of the school year we will practically stop buying weaving; baskets and .chairs come in more or less all summer. It is necessary to buy heavily in the spring, when the people have more time to work on baskets and weaving, in order to be ready for the fall sales. Last fall we were ,completely sold out several times and had the people working as fast as they possibly could to till the Christmas orders. The profit on the business is small and were we to consider our time spent in carrying it on we would find it was being run at a loss. I'lowever, there is another side. Many families are self-supporting because of this. Then by selling from here at a small profit the clubs can afford to handle the products and what money they make usually comes back into the school treasury. GIFT Snow : The Gift Shop has proven a success in its first month of operation. The sales amounted to practically $1,000 for the month of May, against $350 for the same month last year. BOYS DORMITORY : Leander and Mrs. McCarter lived on the hill again this year, Mrs. McCarter doing the cooking and housekeeping in return for board for her husband, daughter and part of the time for her son.. They are thoroughly good people and made a good home for the A:Joys. However, the house really needs a teacher or someone who has had more advantages and experience. The study hour needs supervision, the personal appearance. of the boys needs care, the house could be more home like. With the next year we hope for a central dining, room and that will no doubt be of great help. Twelve boys have lived in the dormitory, eight being about the average number. All the boys have been SETTLEmr.IN"l' SCHOOL REPoRTS required to work and the latter part of the year were given at. least si: hours of work during the 'week and five on Saturday in case the; stayed over the week-end. No work can be so very satisfactory withou regular supervision, but, on the whole the boys tried to do and thei failure was not so much from lack of willingness as from the right kim of daily supervision. The boys staying in the dormitory are the olds. boys of the school. It is always rather of a task to hold their interest If anything comes up to upset them much their first thought is to sto' school. The care and advice of someoneJ realizing their problems wont be of great help to the ;boys and the School. CONSOLIDATION: Talking has done little from year to year towar, bringing consolidation, but good roads are doing much. Last year th Cartertown School was discontinued and the pupils had to go to th Glades or here. Nearly all chose this School. There was no chanc of getting a wagon on the road in the fall, so we ran our truck a mil and a half each night and morning to help the children. This made th trip so much. easier that even the little ones came very regularly the fins five months of school. After Christmas the roads were to() bad for u to continue and due to one member of the School Board, no wage could be put en that road to bring the children. Some continued t walk, but many had to .stop, There is every indication of two sma schools coming in here in the fall. Of course they may not come. 1 any school does come in the rooms affected will be the primary o.ne With 47 children now in the primary room and no definite action take regard to building, I do not feel we can urge consolidation for th fall-surely not until we have dedided on our program. Another roux and another teacher are necessary. GIRLS' DORMITORY : The entire year has been very satisfactory in th girls' dormitory. Mrs. Chapin returned at the opening of the scho year. As she had been here before she knew right where to take u the work and things went on with very little difficulty. During the summer several girls worked in homes and after scho( opened continued to stay, receiving their board for work done. This, i addition to the number of families moving into the Burg accounts fc the smaller number in the cottage. Only six girls stayed in the do: mitory. They all lived in the Pollard Cottage. Four of the teaches rooming in the Stuart Cottage took their meals in the Pollard Cottage, It was impossible for the high school girls to continue preparing ti, noon meal at the school for the teachers and dormitory girls, as the did last year. It took all the class time from anything but the pray teal part of the course. Because of this and to relieve the teachers ( all house responsibility we have had a cook in the girls' dormitory ti entire year. The first of November Mrs. Chapin had to leave. We saw at one it would never do to finish the year with no head to the house so mot] er came for two weeks. After Christmas she returned and finished tl year. 40 THE ARROW OP PI BETA PHI' Surely there can be no complaint in regard to the care of the teachers this year. They have had comfortable rooms and enough to eat and no care whatever of the meals or dormitory girls. If there has been any discontent among them I do not know of it. CENTRAL DINING HALL : On the recommendation of Mrs. Stark and Mrs. Freeman last October, as well as the judgment of all, we have been planning for a central dining ball. Mrs. Stark has suggested the new school building possibly providing a place. In looking over the cottages I have felt we could arrange for the meals withopt going to the school building for them. Were all to take meals in the Teachers Cottage we would need to make changes that would have to be more or less permanent and hard to undo in case they were not satisfactory. If we use the Pollard Cottage next year we could make few changes and none that would necessitate rebuilding. By using the dining room and the downstairs teacher's room as dining rooms there would be sufficient room to take care of all the family we have. Some changes would need to be made in furnishings, but I do not think very expensive ones. This plan would mean boys, girls and teachers having meals together. Some feel this is not a wise plan, but I believe it will work out here and at least we can try it for one year. HEALTH DEPARTMENT : This department continues to be an out standing one and there never is any question of the tremendous amount accomplished for the schools and for the community. Yet, I do some-times think we take much of it for granted just because it is managed so very well. The report of Phyllis Higinbotham gives the details of the work. Dental clinics that used to be once in a while, if at all, are now regular things. The dentist ,comes once a month and always has patients waiting for him. The office is used more and more, people coming for supplies, to see a doctor, for medicines, or to have babies weighed and measured. Dr. Ogle continues to come in once a week or oftener and his services mean much to us. More school work has been done than ever before. A class in hygiene once a week at Sugarlands, pupils weighed and measured in all the nearby schools, some work clone at Laurel Lick make a pretty full school program. With this there was, of course, the smallpox and typhoid vaccinations. There was every indication of a bad typhoid epidemic in the county and I feel but for the hundreds who took the se-rum we might have had a hard time. While this district is very free from it, cases are brought in from nearby places. A college girl to assist in the office and with the school work continues to be most satisfactory, much more so than another nurse would be. The records have been put into good condition, office calls answered, correspondence attended to and many more things done to relieve the nurse. While Harmo Taylor was away in the winter a local girl took SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 41 her place and this spring will assist again as both Harm() and Lois Rogers will be in the Gift Shop. The next point is one I dread even to mention. Phyllis felt last year that she should resign because of her home people. She finally decided to come back for another year, but comes again to the same place she was last summer. In handing in her resignation I felt she should ask only for six months' leave, then i f she found she could come back the place would be here for her. In the meantime we should try to find someone for the temporary place who would probably stay on in case Phyllis .could not return. It is hard to imagine either that department or the school without Phyllis, and I feel we will suffer a great loss. I strongly recommend that Phyllis be granted a six months' leave with the understanding she return at the end of that time if possible. HEALTH UNIT : The past year we have again cooperated with the county in maintaining a county health unit. This does not in any way hamper our work and does make a good many things available, free vaccine for small pox and typhoid inoculations, clinics with county health doctor in ,charge, state specialists and visitors coming to give assistance and advice. Beside these we receive from the state about $500.00 more than we put in. This furnishes a means of getting filing cabinet, auto mileage, some travel allowances and we hope this year will all or partly furnish a typewriter for the office. To the surprise of the people of the county the court has for two years voted the health unit and we are hoping that again in October they will make a sufficient appropriation to make it possible. OFFICE: This year has showed beyond a doubt that the office work must be reorganized if it is to bekept up in anything like an efficient way. The office in the Teachers' Cottage has to be a general office. It is the only place anyone has to do office work, whether of school or industrial. It is the only place anyone has to talk business. This year extra congestion has been caused by having to do all of the work of the Gatlinburg News in the office. With the duties of house mother, pur chasing agent and the planning of meals combined there will be no time for the person having those things in charge to do any office work. Also with the constantly increasing amount of correspondence and desk work there is need of an assistant being in the office all the time. The past year there has not been time from routine office work for me scarcely to know what was going on around the place. FARM : In making a report on the farm I feel I should preface it by saying that the farm and the Smith-Hughes Agriculture in the School and the community are two separate things. In spite of the very dry weather the farm produced more than the year previous. We raised enough potatoes to carry us through the year, garden produce helped greatly on the living, we had at least fifty gallons of strawberries, fruit trees bore some, cows furnished all the milk we had and part of the 42 THE ARROW 01' PI BETA PHI year all the butter. Beside this we had eggs, chickens, pork and beef from the farm. All the fields that were cultivated were put into hay and other fodder, saving quite a little on our hay bill. We have on the farm two horses of our own and one owned by Mr. Mattil, but kept by us as we use it nearly all the time, 3 cows, 3 calves, one bull, one goat, 1 boar, 1 brood sow and some small pigs, about 100 chickens. We fat few hogs as it pays better to sell the yotng pigs and also puts good stock into the community. This year the boys have clone the milking, cared for the horses, pigs, and chickens. They have clone fairly well with the work, but it has meant waste of feed and time. Mr. Mattil has supervised all he could and Leander McCarter has tried to, too, but it is a steady job and one that needs a person with it all the time. This coming year we should employ a man as farmer and supervisor of student labor, both for the good of the farm and for the good of the boys. I doubt if it would mean the cash outlay it appears for there would be saving in other ways. Were there a farmer here all the time much of the outside labor could be turned over to the boys or done away with entirely. Also with better roads and the nurse making more trips in a car an extra horse can be used nmeh of the time on the farm, saving the team hire we now have. COMMUNITY: As more people come into the Valley and the roads improve so our people get in and out more the community activities seem to grow less. Whether we really do less or merely feel that way is a question. At any rate it is harder to get the local people together. The teachers take an active part in Sunday School and B. Y. P. U. Helen Barrett had a Junior meeting Sunday afternoons for the tots from six to eleven years. Basketball games, either of theschool or community team, have taken at least one evening a week during the winter. Movies began in April and continued through September. They were well patronized and the report shows that even with paying for some furnishings, we came out about even. In the fall pictures were shown in practically every little school around here. This was primarily to stimulate Fair interest, but as the pictures were along the line of farming, domestic science and health they were decidedly educational. 'he great ,community event of the year is the Gatlinburg Fair and this year it certainly did credit to the school, the community and the county. The exhibits were line and were brought from more homes than ever before. Several of the little schools made fine showings, even though they had little school material to work with. After this fair was over Mr. Mattil did the greater part in putting on a county exhibit at the East Tennessee Division Fair in Knoxville. The nurse also put on a tine health exhibit. The school exhibit received first prize of $15.00 and the county exhibit second prize, which gave us a neat sum to start next year's Fair on. Another year there will be a county Fair in Sevierville and 1 feel S.ECTTLEMr,NT SCHOOL 43 that with what we do here and what we should do to 'boost the ,county Fair it would be best not to make any effort to exhibit in Knoxville. The Christmas entertainment, Valentine parties, picnics, and socials during warm weather, keeping open house at `Tea(Thers' Cottage Friday and Saturday nights comprise the social side of the school, life. The crying need of the community is supervised play and recreation Saturday and Sunday afternoons the year round. Yet with every teacher working full time, some of them six (lays of the week, and then teaching Sunday School on Sunday, how can they give the one after-noon they have for their rest and recreation? We have talked and talked of finding some young man who would do that kind of work during the summer, but have never come to the point of really trying to locate one. Neither do I know whether it would be possible to find one to come for expenses only. Sugarlands needs work of this kind, too. When you see a crowd of boys going up and down and up and down the road all Sunday afternoon just looking for something to do you wonder they escape as much trouble as they do. And what saves even our dormitory boys over the week-end is more than I can tell. The barn is open for basketball some Sunday afternoons and ;base-ball is played more or less during the summer, but there should be someone in charge. Also a clubroom of some kind should be, kept open those afternoons. None of us are satisfied with the amount of community work we do, but with every hour full we seem unable to take over any more. Each summer more people come into the Burg, there are more at-tractions away from the simple pleasures the people have been used to and I feel that right now we should nmke a great effort to hold the young people to their church, their homes and their community life. I still feel that one of the best things we are doing and one most appreciated is sending out the Gatlinburg News each month. Five hundred copies are printed and 25O go up and down these creeks and are really read. It is one of the pieces of real work that we feel well re-paid for doing. EXTENSION: Each year the question of extension comes up and each time under different circumstances. The Sugarlancls work is well enough established so we do not need to question continuing so much as the best methods to pursue. With the county furnishing eight months of free school we have not had to supplement any salaries in Sugarlands for grade work. Our help was with cooking, sewing, agriculture and adult work. The work in Laurel Lick has been along this line only. Several times Dr. Ogle and the County Superintendent have asked us why we did not investigate Laurel Lick field with a view toe helping there. Our answer has been that we had now about all we could manage. This year Miss Barrett has been very much interested and would like to take the primary room there next year. The county would pay sufficient salary to be equiv.-. alent to what she received here last year. The problem would be the 44 THE ARROW OE' PI BETA PHI living. She could not live alone, neither is there a suitable place for her to board. She has thought that possibly some girl working for her Master s Degree might be interested in spending a year there, coming for expenses only and possibly being willing even to pay those herself. This would furnish someone to help with community work. Helen and I figured that if we did anything toward making a cab-in habitable and getting any supplies whatever it would mean putting about $500.00 into the venture. She said she was willing to try to raise enough to finance the project, but I discouraged that thinking it Would keep funds out of the budget. Through the hair, meetings in different schools, visits of the nurse to weigh and measure children, agriculture classes in Sugarlands and Laurel Lick and some work done in other schools, we have been able to do a good deal for these other schools and with good results. SUGARLANDS : Sugarlands created a good deal of worry and trouble in the late summer. This was due first of all to an uncertainty in regard to Miss Chew being able to return to her work there, then to carelessness on my part in applying to one of the school ;board who thought I should ask him for the school. Cora McCarter had the same grades again, but the ones Miss Chew had were given to the board member's son-in-law. At first this made a good deal of trouble as the people wanted Miss Chew and we felt we had not had a square deal. Before many weeks we saw that it had been a fortunate move, rather than otherwise, for it gave Miss Chew the opportunity to try out adult school work there. Her work consisted in much visiting and answering calls at her house. 'Classes were held three afternoons in the school house after the regular school was dismissed. Thirteel boys were enrolled. One walked from the lumber camps across the mountain once a week. These boys were from fifteen to twenty years of age and doing work from first or second grade to a possible fourth or fifth. The older people were taught in their homes and several men and women over sixty years of age learned to. read and write. One was delighted that she could go to the mail box and tell to whom the letters were addressed. With the coming of bad weather it seemed best to discontinue these classes so Miss Chew took her vacation in January and February and will carry classes through the spring and summer. The State allowed us $212.50 on Miss Chew's salary for the fall term and says it will continue to help us this spring. Mrs. Stark called a meeting when she was here so that the county board and Sugarlands people could come to some agreement and also that she could have some idea of how each group stood. The people later signed a paper stating that they were willing to call this year one of the four required ones to give a clear title to the land and the county board gave a written statement showing their willingness to co-operate hereafter. Nothing has discouraged the people in Sugarlands so much as not having a teachers' cottage started yet. They feel they have been prom SETTLEMriNT SCHOOL R-C,PORTS 45 ised it and that were it there they would be assured the Pi Phis were there to stay. Then several men hoped for work on the building. The county school term has been eight months, which has meant the county has financed the teaching of the school. The board has again promised a new school building to be completed by opening of next term. Our allowance of $1,600 for Sugarlands has not been used this year, therefore, I would recommend the balance left be used in helping build a teachers' cottage, it being added to the Hazel Todd Meaden Fund, if that is released. I would. recommend also that the adult work be continued another year if possible. Miss Chew's report gives the list of community activities. IMPROVEMENTS MADE DURING THE YEAR: Rock walks laid around the cottages. New flue built for Pollard Cottage. Incubator house built-one half to be used for root store house. Full time weaving teacher engaged. Third year added to high school. Engine and wood house rebuilt, making new store. Redressing school desks. Guttering and draining around schoolhouse. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR: Farmer and supervisor of boys' work engaged. Gift shop plans adopted for the summer. Central dining hall. Purchasing agent to plan meals and manage girls' dormitory, living in the dormitory. Office helper and sufficient office equipment, including typewriter, adding machine and desk. Scale of salary increase for teaching experience in the school. Teacher in boys' dormitory. Community worker for Saturdays and Sundays during the summer. Teachers' cottage in Sugarlands. Schoolhouse started or room added to present building. In closing my report I again want to express my appreciation of the entire staff and the committee. Again, I say that but for the sympathy and help each has so willingly given the other the year's program never could have been carried on so successfully. These are the things that give joy to the work here and .make us all loath to give up our connection with the School and Pi Phi work. EVELYN BISHOP, Head Resident. 46 T r. ARRow ov PI BETA PHI DIGEST ()F MINUTES Settlement School Conanittee Meeting, March 5, 1926 A full membership was present. The membership, with permission of Grand Council, met (luring tlni School session, which proved a great success, as this gave the committee a better working knowledge of conditions at the School, and a more sympathetic understanding of the staff. Hereafter, all weaving work will have the trademark of the Settlement School, which is in the form of a, blue paper sticker with red design. A branding iron carrying the trademark will be used on bas kets and furniture. The Committee decided to build the industrial unit to the new school building with the funds now available. Several gifts from individuals, and one bequest, together with certain sums voted from interests and current expenses, have helped increase this fund to such an amount as to encourage our undertaking this enterprise. The need of such is most apparent. This building will probably be a memorial building. The School plant is in very good condition. No excessive expense is necessary for the repairs as it has been our policy to keep the buildings in as good condition as possible. There may be some necessary painting work to be done. As usual, the School, its staff and problems took considerable time. Evelyn Bishop was re-elected as Head Resident. Margaret White is to be Principal of the higher grades. Emily Burton is to return after a leave of absence for one year. Marian Folsom and Elmer Watson were re-elected. Lois Rogers resigned to be office assistant to the Head Resident. Mrs. E. A. Bishop was elected to become Matron of the Girls' Dormitory, purchasing agent, and supervisor of the central dining room. Mrs. Dowell is to have charge of noon lunches for all school pupils, and Matron of the Boys' Dormitory. Jean Steele and O. J. Mattil were re-elected to carry on the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science and Agricultural work, respectively. Winogene Redding will be the teacher and super-visor of the weaving department. Too much praise cannot be given to her success along these lines. Some changes have been made in the running of the School. There are to be two principals, one for lower grade work, one for high school work. There are to be two primary teachers, as this class has grown so, owing to the consolidation of several schools. There are to be noon lunches for all pupils. This is to be self-supporting if possible. The basement of the School will be converted in classrooms for primary grades. An extra office in the Teftchers' Cottage will be in the room now used as a downstairs bedroom. All books in the Library are to be catalogued or repaired. A fifth and sixth grade teacher has to be elected, also principal of lower grades. A teacher's salary is to be fifty dollars per month for the first year, fifty-five dollars for the third year, SETTLEMENT SCHOOL REPORTS 47 and sixty for the fourth year and sixty-five for the fifth year. The price of all orders for industrial work, other than from alumnae clubs, shall be increased 25%. Color cards and samples of weaving are to be sent upon request.. Alumnae Clubs are offered 1% discount for cash within 30 days from date of invoice. Board paid by new teachers is to be increased to $20.00 per month. Miss Higinbotham was granted six month's leave. Another nurse is to take her place. Requests for a typewriter and a ear discussed. An assistant to the nurse was authorized again, and Lizzie Reagan was elected as Harmo Taylor resigned. The Hazel Todd Meaden Memorial House is to be.. built at the Emma Harper Turner Center. Helen Chew was elected as head of the work, and she, with the assistance of head Resident, secured another 1)i Phi teacher, and will dictate the policy at this center. Smith-Hughes adult Education Fund again solicited. The County is building a very nice new school building at the Emma Harper Turner Center. It is with deep regret that we announce the resignation of Miss Phyllis Higinbotham. She is to become State Supervisor of Public Health Nursing of Tennessee. I could write a' lengthy eulogy on Miss Higinbotham. I could tell you of the hours of pure drudgery that she has gone through. I could tell you of thousands and thousands of such things and still would not have half begun. All who have known her and have seen .her know that contact with her has made them a better person to live in this world. Guests who desire to stay more than week ends in the school are to be charged at the rate of $1.00 a day. The fiscal year of the school has been changed to close on June 30. A reorganization of the industrial department and work is to be made. It is probable that a definite wholesale price schedule will be adopted, slightly higher than in the past to provide for increased cost of maintenance of the department and of materials, with standard discounts for quantity buying.

SVI''rLEmNT SCHOOL REPORTS 49 I feel that I should not close my third annual report without an expression of appreciation to each member of the faculty of the school for their splendid cooperation. Each duty they performed was in such a manner that would only evoke the highest praise. Each year the committee feels the absence of Miss Kate Miller, Miss Melinda Stuart, Mrs. Rugg, Mrs. Curtis and Mrs. Stoolman. Their efforts in the past have certainly lightened the work of the present committee. Agnes Miller Turner has, this year, edited "News from Little Pigeon." If you have not read these articles it has been your loss, as they have been full of human interest. She is certainly a most ardent worker of our School and her ability and personality make a happy combination. Dorothy Smallwood Geare has done a splendid work in sending out information to those members not belonging to any alumnae club. We feel that these members should be a part of this great work and it has been our plan to get them interested in this way in the School. Gertrude Brown Freeman has successfully followed Mrs. Curtis as the Ways and Means member of the committee. I have found her ad-vice on the committee matters instructive and enlightening and feel that she has been a decided asset. Owing to illness, Ethel Curryer could not start her work until November. When you read her report you will see that she has carried her part through in a manner that would do credit to a most experienced bookkeeper. Our work has increased to such a degree that she, at times, has had to do the work of three people rather than one. She has been patient and efficient and we are indeed fortunate in having such a treasurer for the Settlement School. Each of the committee, as well as I, feel that we are fortunate in being able to serve you in this undertaking a work that has been hard that has not been altogether happy at times--that has been exacting and time claiming when we could have been enjoying ourselves at Convention. But, being a work of such high ideals, we feel that no matter what effort it cost us it was worth it all. And, again, let us express to you our sincere appreciation of the opportunity for being a part of the greatest altruistic work any fraternity in America has ever undertaken. Remember, this School is yours. How successful its future is depends upon you. Do you want it to stand still? I think not. Do you want it to become better in every way? Your answer to this is in increased donations. NITA HILL STARK, Chairman. 50 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI REPORT OF THE TREASURER OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records a'nd accounts, as received from you as Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, Tenn., for the period 1925--1926 ending April 30, 1926. The books were audited and records checked for the period covering your term as treasurer and we have made a combined report for the entire year using a part of the previous Auditor's statements for the first few months of the 1925 term and wish to state that while we assume no responsibility for his figures we test checked and verified same whenever it seemed expedient to do so. We have verified the Bank Balance and all deposits and securities. All postings in the General Ledger were checked with the Journal and Check Register and all totals in all of the books were verified. All receipts were checked and verified with the checks issued in payment of same and all Invoices and Credit Memos were thoroughly examined, being checked against both the Journal and Check Register.

CATALOGUE For the first time in catalogue history, all active chapters of Pi Beta Phi have submitted 100% of their membership record work, 85% of which was on time and most of the remainder only one or two days late.

Chapter lists have been revised, with especial attention to dates of graduation. and to non-graduates, as well as to transfer of membership. Many transfers, never hitherto recorded, have been placed in the national files.
