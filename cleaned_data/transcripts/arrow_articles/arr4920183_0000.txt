EVA HATHAWAY EN school was closed in the WSugarlands, Eva Hathaway, who has been such a force in that district, was invited to teach in Laurel Lick, a community still farther from Gatlin-burg than Sugarlands. The fraternity was in no position to give any assistance, of course; but members of the Settlement School Committee drove with Eva over horrible roads to see the Laurel Lick School last June. One tried to photograph the interior as it was then, but even a kodak refuses to de-scribe some things. Three months later Frankie Hill wrote of the changes in Laurel Lick: "Eva has already done wonders there. The school house looks like a different place. . . After school she and her assistant took us to their room-househome. Such a spirit as Eva has makes one feel selfish in surrounding herself with luxuries and ease. Eva has taken The changes made by Eva Hathaway at Laurel Lick have been possible only through the generosity of Mr. John Walter Tottle, of Baltimore, Maryland, who gave her $100.that one-roomed store and made it sweet and homelike. She has two beds, one chest of drawers, several chairs, a kitchen cabinet, a two-burner oil stove, and a drop-leaf table oh, yes, and a screen to hide the washstand. She has to carry water from the school house, and that's the only thing she complained of. As I looked up at the ceiling, I could see the blue sky through several cracks. She was very hospitable and in a few minutes served tea. I do not know when I ever sat at a table where the food tasted so good. The only trouble was that I had to swallow back the tears which the thought of her unselfish spirit brought. The girls are going to have to get a heater, and have a lean-to put on the back of the room for it. I think Mr. Voorheis is going to give the range, as he is quite concerned over their having no fire. The thermometer registered 48 degrees Thursday morning. * *Late August or early September. THE NOVEMBER ARROW 183 WHEN school started the first of August the weather was too hot for the children to successfully bring milk with their lunch. As the nurse had found a third of that crowd under-weight we were anxious to do some-thing. The little tots must breakfast be-fore the crack of dawn for six o'clock in the morning plenty of them are on the play ground. No wonder they are hungry by recess time. We had been given one hundred dollars by the Friends of the Mountain Children and as it was to go for special work with the children we took enough to get milk for the underweights each morning. They have thrived so well the nurse thought it wise to continue through this month and then we will be giving the one extra dish to supplement their lunches and the milk can be discontinued although I dread to give it up. This morning I have just come from Laurel Lick a good ten miles from here. You can go any one of three ways in dry weather. We have had steady rain for two days and nights so I found it about impossible to get there at all this morning. It was out of the question for us to budget anything for Extension work this year but as the people of Laurel Lick were so anxious for Miss Hathaway to teach there she decided to go and was appointed by the county board. It is a new field, plentyto do, work interesting. Her living conditions wouldn't be called all that could be desired but until there is more time to make permanent plans with the county board, know the community better and feel sure she will want to stay more than this year she would not want to have the people carry out their plan of building a cabin for her. So this year she and another teacher are living in a one-room house, carrying water a quarter of a mile and trying to teach a good country school. One boy won forty cents at our fair for some-thing he raised and he gave the money right back to Miss Hathaway, asking her to buy a tablet for his brother and himself and to keep the rest of the money for more tablets as they needed them. Not only is there no money in Laurel Lick but there isn't a store within five miles of there. Our Home Ec. teacher is starting work there, goes in one afternoon each week. I thought this was the day but fortunately she goes to another place that she can reach on horseback this afternoon and maybe by tomorrow the sun will shine and dry up the roads enough for her to get to Laurel Lick. I took the teachers al-most to the school this morning but they had to walk the last of the way and I would not recommend the roads for auto driving. EVELYN BISHOP October 16, 1932 .. .. DURING her trip to Gatlinburg in September the Chairman of the Settlement School Committee spent an afternoon visiting other schools with Don Smith, the Settlement School Smith-Hughes representative, who was distributing literature and talking to the people about the county fair. She wrote later: "There is such an improvement in Gatlinburg over the other places that one could write volumes. In one place they use an old Baptist church with its crude hard seats, have not one desk in the building, and there are such pitiful looking children. Most of the teachers were as pitiful. We have evidence of the advancement which twenty years of schooling will give to a community when we contrast Gatlinburg with other places." lugmurmulum.mmusnummiumm.imummimmumulniulsmulnusmunsuluu.n.snumaunnuinnusumusluinnur) 184 THE NOVEMBER ARROW ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE THE Settlement School Committee in session, June 22-28, at Gatlinburg: 1.

Recommended that province presidents and province vice-presidents be asked to carry with them on their official visits small uniform Arrow Craft exhibits in order to advertise new products and interest more groups in selling the goods; 4. Cut the budget made for 1931-32 by $4783 in making that for 1932-33, at the same time recognizing that alumnx and actives had continued their loyal support through the long months of decreased resources; 5. Reduced from 5 per cent to 20per cent salaries of the Settlement School staff in order to meet the reduced income under which the school is operating; 6. Recommended to Grand Council the postponement of convention from 1933 to 1934 because of hard times; 7. Set October 1, 1932, as the date of termination of Mr. Mattil's lease of the Wood Craft Shop; 8. Decided that the reduced income of the school precluded the making of repairs and alterations on the school buildings and property; 9. Recommended that the county school board be informed by the di-rector that within a few years the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School will give up the first seven grades to the county; 10. Voted a month's vacation with pay during 1932-33 to the director, Evelyn Bishop, in recognition of her devoted services to the school during a long period and under a great strain; 11. Was deeply impressed by the continued loyalty and interest of the entire staff in the face of salary reductions and most stringent limitations of money expenditures in every phase of the work. THE SCHOOL THE opening of school on August 1 found the staff unusually busy even for that time of year. As Vivian Blair from Oregon A, Barbara Horton, and Mary Rachel Armstrong did not return, their places had to be taken by new teachers. Then, with the closing of three schools in the Great Smoky National Park, Sugarlands among them, many families moved to Gatlinburg where the new pupils swelled the numbers, in the elementary department alone to one hundred and seventy. Naturally, this larger enrollment meant at least one more teacher, but Miss Bishopcould not arrange for one until after the county school election some days later. In the meantime, the staff had to manage as it could. All these problems were successfully met, though, and about the middle of September Miss Bishop wrote that she thought everything was running well, grade school being better than it had been for several years. Eleanor Brabson and Miriam Swan, who have been at the school for some time, have the primer and grades 1-2, respectively. Katherine Collins, Colorado A, 1932, is teaching grades 3 and THE NovEMBER ARROW 185 5 and is playing the piano for assembly every morning. Stella Huff, whose family is known to almost every Pi Phi, came from the Sevierville School to teach grades 4 and 6. Pauline Whaling, Illinois A, has the high school history and English courses and is working with the boys and girls in their recreation as well as in studies. Mary Rachel Armstrong returned to the University of Tennessee for graduate work after three years of directing the home economics department at Gatlinburg. In her place is Jessie Branhan, who was graduated from the university this year. Following a trip to the school early in September, Frankie Hill, former Kappa Province Vice-president and present chairman of the Settlement School Committee, wrote of the impression she received: "I feel these days gave me a new vision of the school . . . and I realize as never be-fore that all that has been done, all that we are doing now, and all that will be done in the future is yielding far more in bettering human lives than can be compared with any sum a capitalist ever received from an investment the size of ours."

Voorheis of Cincinnati completed, equipped, and gave this handsome building in the summer of 1931, O. J. Mattil, long associated with the school, and his corps of local workmen moved in and continued their making of furniture, paying as rent to the school only the amount of the insurance on the building. At that time it was impossible for the committee to commence any specialized manual training program for the boys of the school, but the committee authorized the chairman to investigate similar projects in the hope of being able eventually to inaugurate such a program in the new building. When, last spring, the situation resulting from the arrangements with Mr. Mattil was found to be unsatisfactory, the committee voted to terminate his contract at the end of his year in August. The year 1931-32 proved difficult for the school as it did for other altruistic projects generally, however, so no new enterprise could be undertaken. The committee, meeting in June, ex-tended the time of Mr. Mattil's occupancy until October so that he could reap the full benefit of the long tourist season, but decided to close the building at that time. When the finances of the school permit and satisfactory arrangements can be arrived at, the building will be opened again and a forward-looking educational program will then be inaugurated.
