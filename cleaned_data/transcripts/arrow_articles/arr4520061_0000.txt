Some of the almost enclosed valleys of this region have long been called "coves" which is a national term. One of the first of these to be settled was then called "Miller's Cove" but now contains the thriving, industrial village of Walland, situated just within the Chilohowee Range which is the outer or western parallel range of the Great Smoky Mountain System Little River, flowing swiftly down from its many lofty sources in the main range, unites its rushing waters and cuts through the outer range at Walland, and the mountain breeze blowing steadily down through "the gap" all night causes all the tree-tops in the gap to lean one way thus growing slightly bent. This gap is the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI :ern gateway of the Smoky .ntain Region.

Samuel Wear but he never settled ne of the next valleys to be there; instead he settled on West ed was Wear's Cove, .a beautiPigeon River just above the mouth NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 63 of Walden's Creek. He was a soldier of the Revolution and one of the founders of the "State of Franklin" or "Frankland," and the state of Tennessee and the County of Sevier. A marble monument has recently been erected to his memory in an old long-neglected cemetery, on his old farm where it is said that he and some of his family and neighbors were buried. Around Wear's pioneer home, a stockade was erected as a partial defense against Indian attacks. This crude, wooden fortification was called Wear's Fort. About 1795, three settlers, Aaron Crow-son, William Hatcher and a man named Percyfield or Percival, camped awhile at Wear's Fort, preparing to settle in the beautiful, vacant valley of Wear's Cove. On a preliminary visit to his new home, Percival was ambushed and killed by Indians. His friend, Crowson, who was with him, escaped to Wear's Fort and, returned with three other men, found poor Percival's body on the moutain and carried it into the valley and buried it. The grave is well known to this day, marked by two rough stones but with no inscription. Soon after this bloody tragedy Crowson and Hatcher began to build their new homes in the valley. Other settlers soon followed; a prosperous community gradually grew up and the Indians never molested the peaceful valley again, till the time of the Civil War. The name, Wear's Cove, was afterward changed to Wear's Valley and Wearwood. Early Gatlinburg Gatlinburg was settled, it seems, sometime from 1801 to 1807, the first settlers coming over the Indian Gap Trail, probably on horseback and on foot from South Carolina and North Carolina a few came in later from other directions. The place was first called, "The White Oak Flats" but the Post Office name was changed to Gatlinburg in honor of a man who kept a store there just before the Civil War and now let us return to Miller's Cove and Wear's Cove. At the outbreak of the Civil War, the people of the Smoky Mountain Region were almost unanimous for peace. They did not want war or anything that might bring war. Very few of them had any slaves they did not see much of the benefits or evils of slavery, or think much about it. They were for peace and the status quo. But Tennessee seceded from the Union and the mountaineers, from Little River Gap to the top of Smoky, stood up and protested that they had not seceded. A mass meeting of men from the mountain coves and many from below the mountains, convened in the open air near the banks of Little River just above the Gap. They had dinner and a speech or two and a muster or drill, but they had something more serious before dinner. They cut two long, straight poles and spliced them together. The skillful blacksmith, Aaron Burns, bound the splice securely with strong, iron bands. The ladies had made a silk flag the stars and stripes. This banner was fastened securely on the pole then, with the aid of ropes and long forked poles, they raised the tall flag staff and settled it in its place. The flag opened its folds and waved on the soft breeze. A great cheer rent the air and echoed and re-echoed from the rugged mountain sides. And thus did these quiet, conservative, peace-loving THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI :aineers declare their loyalty old flag, and openly challenge sovereign states to mortal .t. The spot was right where Talland Hotel or Chilohowee ow stands but there was no and no hotel there then, ne lonesome cabin in sightamily to watch the fate of ag but, yet, that wild and me glen by the side of a ain road and a roaring mountream, faced the opening of River Gap at that time the pal open gateway to the y Mountains.

They were .;custorned to war but each vas a super-expert in rifle-rig, able to hit a squirrel's eye top of a high tree. Present faint sound of iron-shod striking on flinty rocks could ird far down the river, approaching nearer. Again Captain Elijah Hatcher, an old farmer armed with a long rifle repeated his command of caution, "Boys, don't shoot unless they disturb the flag, but if they do, then shoot to kill." The enemy approached, the guards steadied their. rifles for deadly work, then, above the din of tramping hoofs, rang out the sharp command, "Halt" and all was still. The guards silently caressed the locks of their long rifles and watched and listened. The moment was laden with danger a word, a motion, might bring a flash of flame, a stroke of ready death from thirty rifles. Then, over the rippling waters came words to this purport: "Soldiers of the Confederacy, we are fighting for a new flag, the stars and bars that we all love, but on that tall pole is the old flag, the stars and stripes that our forefathers followed in the dark days of the Revolution. Don't molest it ; don't insult it; boys, salute the flag." And every Confederate soldier saluted the Union flag and some of them rode in a circle around the tall pole and swung their hats and yelled, "Hurrah, for the old flag !" Then they rode out of the jaws of death, away from the muzzles of thirty silent rifles for not a shot was fired. They rode on up the river in the night and searched the next day for men and rifles but found none. In every log house of the mountain caves the women and children treated the invaders like friends and gave them the best dinners that they could, and in the afternoon, the Confederates rode back down the river, passed the tall flag staff again and returned to Maryville without further incident. But the war grew worse NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 65 the defenders of the flag nearly all scouted through to Kentucky and joined the Union army. But the flag still floated in solitary grandeur as if to guard the Gap and, the next year, after the storms had torn it to tatters, another company of Confederate cavalry came along and camped by the tall pole. Two of them called at the cabin in sight and asked for an axe. The old woman fearing they might have de-signs on the flag pole, gave them a very dull old axe; later, she heard its dull, beating strokes and, after dark, she heard the sound of the tall pole falling like a tree. The Confederates tore the remains of the banner from its staff and carried the stars away and dropped the ragged stripes to the ground. The next day two little girls gathered the soiled fragments of red and white silk and played with them. The old flag had fallen in the Smoky Mountains would it ever be restored again ? Parson Brownlow And what about Wear's Cove with its memories of early Indian war? Since the day of the Percival tragedy in 1795, this beautiful valley had been settled in peace and remained undisturbed. But the news of secession aroused the people from their slumbers. They held a public meeting, condemned secession, and declared that they were for Union and peace, and they would have peace if they had to fight for it their mountain-walled valley must be sacred from hostile invasion. So they organized a military company, similar -to the "minute men" of the Revolution which they called a "home guard." Soon after this, a. distinguished visitor sought refuge in this se-cluded valley. He was Parson Brownlow, the famous union editor of Tennessee, the most vitriolic' writer in America, a man of rough speech and kind heart. He had suspended publication of his paper, The Whig, and sought safety in the shadow of the mountains. He rested awhile in the home of Post-master Valentine Mattox of Wear's Cove. One night his assistant editor,William Rule, arrived at the Mattox home Rule had scouted through Knoxville to warn Brown-low that his enemies were on the trail. The next day Brownlow and Rule went to the home of "Squire" Richard Crowson. About that time a wild rumor came from some unknown source that the rebels were coming, burning houses which they had .threatened to do. The rumor was false but the "home guard" shouldered their long rifles and hatened to Crowson Gap to meet the hostile invaders. As the guard passed "Squire" Crowson's house, Brownlow appeared on the porch some of the guards recognized him "Brownlow Brownlow ! a speech from Brownlow 1" they called, and this was his speech a motto of the Revolution: "Boys, trust in God and keep your powder dry." With this speech ringing in their ears they marched on to the gap to defend their homes but the enemy did not come that day; after that superior forces of Confeder-'ate cavalry often dashed in suddenly, making resistance impossible and searched the valley for men, arms, and horses. From "Squire" Crowson's house, Brownlow went farther up the valley to the home of Alexander Andrew Coulter, a firm Union man and a near relative of Alexander H. Stephens, Vice President of the Confederacy. But THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI r's house was in a very open o Brownlow soon visited the of Reverend J. B.

Audacity won the pass was given but Brownlow's friends in Wear's Cove had only seen the beginning of their sorrow. The home guard could not cope with the forces that came so frequently and so suddenly against them. They were driven into the woods like wild beasts. With great danger and. difficulty they did a little farm work, provided for their homes the best they could, and then most of them scattered through by night, marched on foot to Kentucky and joined the Union army. Wear's Cove and its immediate environs, with about sixty dwelling houses at that time, furnished seventy-four union volunteers. Men and boys enlisted, over and under military age only a few were left at home to take care of the women and children the best they could through all sorts of danger and difficulty. "Thomas's Legion" There was more division of sentiment in Gatlinburg than any other community in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. Its first settlers came over the Indian Gap trail from the Carolinas and that trail still remains a direct connection with all the South. Travel, trade, and relationship sometimes affect political sentiment. And then Colonel Thomas, the famous white chief of that remnant of the Cherokee Indian tribe in North Carolina, came over and established a military camp at Gatlin-burg and tried to hold the entire Smoky Mountain region for the Confederate cause. His block house, or main building, stood on the Burg NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 67 Hill with the camps and cabins of his dusky retainers near by. He had a mixed regiment of Indians and white men, known as "Thomas's Legion." Many citizens enlisted, more or less willingly, in his force. He did a lot of work on the rough roads, changing and improving some parts of roads, both below and above Gatlinburg, and made a road part way toward Alum Cave and tried to manufacture chemicals at or near the Cave. But he did not make the Indian Gap trail, as has been so often stated, for it was in constant use long before his time. He seemed to dream of a little military and industrial kingdom of his own here in the Smoky Mountains and some of his work appeared to be for the public benefit but a regiment of red and white laborers, loafers and guerillas cannot live on mountain land and ice cold water they must have food. So they raided around and took the corn from the crib and the bacon from the smoke house, and honey from the hive and the cattle from the pasture until they almost starved the people to death. And the people began to weary of their over lords and long for real peace and freedom and return to the old flag. Some who had once enlisted in the Legion deserted and fled to the Union army. A Union soldier re-visiting his home near Gatlinburg, was captured by guerillas and murdered. A neighbor trying to rescue him was killed also. These tragedies embittered the people and the heavy hand of military despot-ism and oppression still rested on Gatlinburg and the surrounding country. Even in Wear's Cove, beyond that big mountain, houses were robbed, horses stolen, andboys at work in the corn field were captured and taken to Gatlinburg to be conscripted for the Confederate service. But one night a force of Union cavalry suddenly arrived. in Wear's Cove and called for guides to lead them over the mountain to Gatlinburg. Civil War Ends They had important business there which must have immediate attention. Guides were soon found and one of the few men left in the valley and the weary march began. Sometimes riding, some-times leading their horses, they took the rough back road among the gray rocks and big chestnut trees along the foot of Cove Mountain and over a high gap and down through Little Green Briar Cove and up that long weary trail to the top of Horse Ridge and then over Rich Mountain down to Laurel Creek lighting the descent with a long line of pine torches. Soon after they reached the foot of the mountain a lonesome cabin appeared by the trail and an old woman aroused by the tramp of iron shod hoofs on the rocky trail, came out and gazed on the strange scene. Her two eldest sons were far away in the Union army and she with the remainder of her little family, lived with dread of the guerillas. What new danger must she face now? Who could these dark clad troopers be? Then she caught a glimpse of the flag. "Glory, glory," she shouted. "There's the old flag." An officer took it from the bearer and held it above her and let its silken folds reach her head. She threw up her arms, pulled the flag down, embraced and kissed it while tears of joy gleamed on her faded 68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI cheeks. The old flag had returned to the great Smoky Mountains. Then the troops rode over the next gap and down Fighting Creek and West Pigeon River toward Gatlin-burg. When day dawned they were spreading out like a blue cloud over the open field. The Confederates fired and fled up the ridge from their camp, continuing to fire, Indian style from behind trees on the mountain, most of their bullets whizzing over the heads of the Union troops with a long drawn sound the swan song of Confederacy supremacy in the Great Smoky Mountains. The Union troops in the open field could only fire at the puffs of smoke on the mountains, unable to see what effect their shots had on the invisible and retreating foe. The skirmish lasted several hours. Captain Jasper of the Union Army was severely wounded; a boy, Henry Walker of Wear's Cove, son of one of the guides, shot himself accidentally with a captured gun after the battle was over and died some time later. Colonel Thomas fled to North Carolina his dream of empire shattered. He died in-sane. This was the last battle of the Civil War in the Smoky Mountains and the last battle of 250 years of intermittent war between whites and Indians east of the Mississippi from Jamestown, Virginia, to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. This is a historic spot made famous by historic events. Today And now, when we stand on the crest of the Burg Hill and lookout over this peaceful .village of Gatlinburg, we see no sign that it was ever the scene of strife and war. The quail whistles merrily in the field; the wood thrush sings on the mountainside; the automobile hums along the pike on the bank of the rippling rivers. Summer homes of city people dot the green knolls. Mrs. Duffield's white cottage stands where the block house was burned, on the crest of the Burg Hill and, on each side of it, stand the cottages of Miss Evelyn Bishop, the principal teacher and Miss Laura Thorn-burgh, the gifted writer. Has the pen supplanted the sword? Near one side of the old battle field, near where the firing began, stands Riverside Hotel and near the other side where the contest was settled forever in the Smoky Mountains, stands Mountain View Hotel. And in the very center of the old battle field, where bullets from each side criss-crossed in their whizzing flight, stands Pi Beta Phi School, one of the best country schools in the United States, yes in the Re-united States for the flag that floats over the school is in color and spirit the same old flag that drooped in despair at Valley Forge and waved in triumph at Yorktown, the flag that faded at Little River Gap and shone anew at Gatlinburg the flag that the widowed mothers of the mountain coves never forgot in the days of their deepest grief the flag of the Smoky Mountains the old "Stars and Stripes."

Audacity won the pass was given but Brownlow's friends in Wear's Cove had only seen the beginning of their sorrow. The home guard could not cope with the forces that came so frequently and so suddenly against them. They were driven into the woods like wild beasts. With great danger and. difficulty they did a little farm work, provided for their homes the best they could, and then most of them scattered through by night, marched on foot to Kentucky and joined the Union army. Wear's Cove and its immediate environs, with about sixty dwelling houses at that time, furnished seventy-four union volunteers. Men and boys enlisted, over and under military age only a few were left at home to take care of the women and children the best they could through all sorts of danger and difficulty. "Thomas's Legion" There was more division of sentiment in Gatlinburg than any other community in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. Its first settlers came over the Indian Gap trail from the Carolinas and that trail still remains a direct connection with all the South. Travel, trade, and relationship sometimes affect political sentiment. And then Colonel Thomas, the famous white chief of that remnant of the Cherokee Indian tribe in North Carolina, came over and established a military camp at Gatlin-burg and tried to hold the entire Smoky Mountain region for the Confederate cause. His block house, or main building, stood on the Burg NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 67 Hill with the camps and cabins of his dusky retainers near by. He had a mixed regiment of Indians and white men, known as "Thomas's Legion." Many citizens enlisted, more or less willingly, in his force. He did a lot of work on the rough roads, changing and improving some parts of roads, both below and above Gatlinburg, and made a road part way toward Alum Cave and tried to manufacture chemicals at or near the Cave. But he did not make the Indian Gap trail, as has been so often stated, for it was in constant use long before his time. He seemed to dream of a little military and industrial kingdom of his own here in the Smoky Mountains and some of his work appeared to be for the public benefit but a regiment of red and white laborers, loafers and guerillas cannot live on mountain land and ice cold water they must have food. So they raided around and took the corn from the crib and the bacon from the smoke house, and honey from the hive and the cattle from the pasture until they almost starved the people to death. And the people began to weary of their over lords and long for real peace and freedom and return to the old flag. Some who had once enlisted in the Legion deserted and fled to the Union army. A Union soldier re-visiting his home near Gatlinburg, was captured by guerillas and murdered. A neighbor trying to rescue him was killed also. These tragedies embittered the people and the heavy hand of military despot-ism and oppression still rested on Gatlinburg and the surrounding country. Even in Wear's Cove, beyond that big mountain, houses were robbed, horses stolen, andboys at work in the corn field were captured and taken to Gatlinburg to be conscripted for the Confederate service. But one night a force of Union cavalry suddenly arrived. in Wear's Cove and called for guides to lead them over the mountain to Gatlinburg. Civil War Ends They had important business there which must have immediate attention. Guides were soon found and one of the few men left in the valley and the weary march began. Sometimes riding, some-times leading their horses, they took the rough back road among the gray rocks and big chestnut trees along the foot of Cove Mountain and over a high gap and down through Little Green Briar Cove and up that long weary trail to the top of Horse Ridge and then over Rich Mountain down to Laurel Creek lighting the descent with a long line of pine torches. Soon after they reached the foot of the mountain a lonesome cabin appeared by the trail and an old woman aroused by the tramp of iron shod hoofs on the rocky trail, came out and gazed on the strange scene. Her two eldest sons were far away in the Union army and she with the remainder of her little family, lived with dread of the guerillas. What new danger must she face now? Who could these dark clad troopers be? Then she caught a glimpse of the flag. "Glory, glory," she shouted. "There's the old flag." An officer took it from the bearer and held it above her and let its silken folds reach her head. She threw up her arms, pulled the flag down, embraced and kissed it while tears of joy gleamed on her faded 68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI cheeks. The old flag had returned to the great Smoky Mountains. Then the troops rode over the next gap and down Fighting Creek and West Pigeon River toward Gatlin-burg. When day dawned they were spreading out like a blue cloud over the open field. The Confederates fired and fled up the ridge from their camp, continuing to fire, Indian style from behind trees on the mountain, most of their bullets whizzing over the heads of the Union troops with a long drawn sound the swan song of Confederacy supremacy in the Great Smoky Mountains. The Union troops in the open field could only fire at the puffs of smoke on the mountains, unable to see what effect their shots had on the invisible and retreating foe. The skirmish lasted several hours. Captain Jasper of the Union Army was severely wounded; a boy, Henry Walker of Wear's Cove, son of one of the guides, shot himself accidentally with a captured gun after the battle was over and died some time later. Colonel Thomas fled to North Carolina his dream of empire shattered. He died in-sane. This was the last battle of the Civil War in the Smoky Mountains and the last battle of 250 years of intermittent war between whites and Indians east of the Mississippi from Jamestown, Virginia, to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. This is a historic spot made famous by historic events. Today And now, when we stand on the crest of the Burg Hill and lookout over this peaceful .village of Gatlinburg, we see no sign that it was ever the scene of strife and war.

        THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI :aineers declare their loyalty old flag, and openly challenge sovereign states to mortal .t. The spot was right where Talland Hotel or Chilohowee ow stands but there was no and no hotel there then, ne lonesome cabin in sightamily to watch the fate of ag but, yet, that wild and me glen by the side of a ain road and a roaring mountream, faced the opening of River Gap at that time the pal open gateway to the y Mountains. A New Flag flag was not on a rope and to raise and lower each ng and evening when the sounds reveille and retreat, was fastened to the mast here it proudly floated day ight, summer and winter, till ild storms tore it to tatters. a company of Confederate y started from Maryville to for men and rifles in the ain coves. A secret message Miller's Cove ahead of nd thirty mountain men as-!d to defend the flag. It was ht, beautiful moonlight night flag waved and fluttered in eeze coming down from old i; all was quiet and peaceful. uard sat among the paw-paw on the opposite bank of the v river, their long rifles rest-:ross their knees, their ears or every sound. They were .;custorned to war but each vas a super-expert in rifle-rig, able to hit a squirrel's eye top of a high tree. Present faint sound of iron-shod striking on flinty rocks could ird far down the river, approaching nearer. Again Captain Elijah Hatcher, an old farmer armed with a long rifle repeated his command of caution, "Boys, don't shoot unless they disturb the flag, but if they do, then shoot to kill." The enemy approached, the guards steadied their. rifles for deadly work, then, above the din of tramping hoofs, rang out the sharp command, "Halt" and all was still. The guards silently caressed the locks of their long rifles and watched and listened. The moment was laden with danger a word, a motion, might bring a flash of flame, a stroke of ready death from thirty rifles. Then, over the rippling waters came words to this purport: "Soldiers of the Confederacy, we are fighting for a new flag, the stars and bars that we all love, but on that tall pole is the old flag, the stars and stripes that our forefathers followed in the dark days of the Revolution. Don't molest it ; don't insult it; boys, salute the flag." And every Confederate soldier saluted the Union flag and some of them rode in a circle around the tall pole and swung their hats and yelled, "Hurrah, for the old flag !" Then they rode out of the jaws of death, away from the muzzles of thirty silent rifles for not a shot was fired. They rode on up the river in the night and searched the next day for men and rifles but found none. In every log house of the mountain caves the women and children treated the invaders like friends and gave them the best dinners that they could, and in the afternoon, the Confederates rode back down the river, passed the tall flag staff again and returned to Maryville without further incident. But the war grew worse NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 65 the defenders of the flag nearly all scouted through to Kentucky and joined the Union army. But the flag still floated in solitary grandeur as if to guard the Gap and, the next year, after the storms had torn it to tatters, another company of Confederate cavalry came along and camped by the tall pole. Two of them called at the cabin in sight and asked for an axe. The old woman fearing they might have de-signs on the flag pole, gave them a very dull old axe; later, she heard its dull, beating strokes and, after dark, she heard the sound of the tall pole falling like a tree. The Confederates tore the remains of the banner from its staff and carried the stars away and dropped the ragged stripes to the ground. The next day two little girls gathered the soiled fragments of red and white silk and played with them. The old flag had fallen in the Smoky Mountains would it ever be restored again ? Parson Brownlow And what about Wear's Cove with its memories of early Indian war? Since the day of the Percival tragedy in 1795, this beautiful valley had been settled in peace and remained undisturbed. But the news of secession aroused the people from their slumbers. They held a public meeting, condemned secession, and declared that they were for Union and peace, and they would have peace if they had to fight for it their mountain-walled valley must be sacred from hostile invasion. So they organized a military company, similar -to the "minute men" of the Revolution which they called a "home guard." Soon after this, a. distinguished visitor sought refuge in this se-cluded valley. He was Parson Brownlow, the famous union editor of Tennessee, the most vitriolic' writer in America, a man of rough speech and kind heart. He had suspended publication of his paper, The Whig, and sought safety in the shadow of the mountains. He rested awhile in the home of Post-master Valentine Mattox of Wear's Cove. One night his assistant editor,William Rule, arrived at the Mattox home Rule had scouted through Knoxville to warn Brown-low that his enemies were on the trail. The next day Brownlow and Rule went to the home of "Squire" Richard Crowson. About that time a wild rumor came from some unknown source that the rebels were coming, burning houses which they had .threatened to do. The rumor was false but the "home guard" shouldered their long rifles and hatened to Crowson Gap to meet the hostile invaders. As the guard passed "Squire" Crowson's house, Brownlow appeared on the porch some of the guards recognized him "Brownlow Brownlow ! a speech from Brownlow 1" they called, and this was his speech a motto of the Revolution: "Boys, trust in God and keep your powder dry." With this speech ringing in their ears they marched on to the gap to defend their homes but the enemy did not come that day; after that superior forces of Confeder-'ate cavalry often dashed in suddenly, making resistance impossible and searched the valley for men, arms, and horses. From "Squire" Crowson's house, Brownlow went farther up the valley to the home of Alexander Andrew Coulter, a firm Union man and a near relative of Alexander H. Stephens, Vice President of the Confederacy. But THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI r's house was in a very open o Brownlow soon visited the of Reverend J. B.

Some of the almost enclosed valleys of this region have long been called "coves" which is a national term. One of the first of these to be settled was then called "Miller's Cove" but now contains the thriving, industrial village of Walland, situated just within the Chilohowee Range which is the outer or western parallel range of the Great Smoky Mountain System Little River, flowing swiftly down from its many lofty sources in the main range, unites its rushing waters and cuts through the outer range at Walland, and the mountain breeze blowing steadily down through "the gap" all night causes all the tree-tops in the gap to lean one way thus growing slightly bent. This gap is the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI :ern gateway of the Smoky .ntain Region.

Samuel Wear but he never settled ne of the next valleys to be there; instead he settled on West ed was Wear's Cove, .a beautiPigeon River just above the mouth NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 63 of Walden's Creek. He was a soldier of the Revolution and one of the founders of the "State of Franklin" or "Frankland," and the state of Tennessee and the County of Sevier. A marble monument has recently been erected to his memory in an old long-neglected cemetery, on his old farm where it is said that he and some of his family and neighbors were buried. Around Wear's pioneer home, a stockade was erected as a partial defense against Indian attacks. This crude, wooden fortification was called Wear's Fort. About 1795, three settlers, Aaron Crow-son, William Hatcher and a man named Percyfield or Percival, camped awhile at Wear's Fort, preparing to settle in the beautiful, vacant valley of Wear's Cove. On a preliminary visit to his new home, Percival was ambushed and killed by Indians. His friend, Crowson, who was with him, escaped to Wear's Fort and, returned with three other men, found poor Percival's body on the moutain and carried it into the valley and buried it. The grave is well known to this day, marked by two rough stones but with no inscription. Soon after this bloody tragedy Crowson and Hatcher began to build their new homes in the valley. Other settlers soon followed; a prosperous community gradually grew up and the Indians never molested the peaceful valley again, till the time of the Civil War. The name, Wear's Cove, was afterward changed to Wear's Valley and Wearwood. Early Gatlinburg Gatlinburg was settled, it seems, sometime from 1801 to 1807, the first settlers coming over the Indian Gap Trail, probably on horseback and on foot from South Carolina and North Carolina a few came in later from other directions. The place was first called, "The White Oak Flats" but the Post Office name was changed to Gatlinburg in honor of a man who kept a store there just before the Civil War and now let us return to Miller's Cove and Wear's Cove. At the outbreak of the Civil War, the people of the Smoky Mountain Region were almost unanimous for peace. They did not want war or anything that might bring war. Very few of them had any slaves they did not see much of the benefits or evils of slavery, or think much about it. They were for peace and the status quo. But Tennessee seceded from the Union and the mountaineers, from Little River Gap to the top of Smoky, stood up and protested that they had not seceded. A mass meeting of men from the mountain coves and many from below the mountains, convened in the open air near the banks of Little River just above the Gap. They had dinner and a speech or two and a muster or drill, but they had something more serious before dinner. They cut two long, straight poles and spliced them together. The skillful blacksmith, Aaron Burns, bound the splice securely with strong, iron bands. The ladies had made a silk flag the stars and stripes. This banner was fastened securely on the pole then, with the aid of ropes and long forked poles, they raised the tall flag staff and settled it in its place. The flag opened its folds and waved on the soft breeze. A great cheer rent the air and echoed and re-echoed from the rugged mountain sides. And thus did these quiet, conservative, peace-loving THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI :aineers declare their loyalty old flag, and openly challenge sovereign states to mortal .t. The spot was right where Talland Hotel or Chilohowee ow stands but there was no and no hotel there then, ne lonesome cabin in sightamily to watch the fate of ag but, yet, that wild and me glen by the side of a ain road and a roaring mountream, faced the opening of River Gap at that time the pal open gateway to the y Mountains. A New Flag flag was not on a rope and to raise and lower each ng and evening when the sounds reveille and retreat, was fastened to the mast here it proudly floated day ight, summer and winter, till ild storms tore it to tatters. a company of Confederate y started from Maryville to for men and rifles in the ain coves.

It was ht, beautiful moonlight night flag waved and fluttered in eeze coming down from old i; all was quiet and peaceful. uard sat among the paw-paw on the opposite bank of the v river, their long rifles rest-:ross their knees, their ears or every sound. They were .;custorned to war but each vas a super-expert in rifle-rig, able to hit a squirrel's eye top of a high tree. Present faint sound of iron-shod striking on flinty rocks could ird far down the river, approaching nearer. Again Captain Elijah Hatcher, an old farmer armed with a long rifle repeated his command of caution, "Boys, don't shoot unless they disturb the flag, but if they do, then shoot to kill." The enemy approached, the guards steadied their. rifles for deadly work, then, above the din of tramping hoofs, rang out the sharp command, "Halt" and all was still. The guards silently caressed the locks of their long rifles and watched and listened. The moment was laden with danger a word, a motion, might bring a flash of flame, a stroke of ready death from thirty rifles. Then, over the rippling waters came words to this purport: "Soldiers of the Confederacy, we are fighting for a new flag, the stars and bars that we all love, but on that tall pole is the old flag, the stars and stripes that our forefathers followed in the dark days of the Revolution. Don't molest it ; don't insult it; boys, salute the flag." And every Confederate soldier saluted the Union flag and some of them rode in a circle around the tall pole and swung their hats and yelled, "Hurrah, for the old flag !" Then they rode out of the jaws of death, away from the muzzles of thirty silent rifles for not a shot was fired. They rode on up the river in the night and searched the next day for men and rifles but found none. In every log house of the mountain caves the women and children treated the invaders like friends and gave them the best dinners that they could, and in the afternoon, the Confederates rode back down the river, passed the tall flag staff again and returned to Maryville without further incident. But the war grew worse NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 65 the defenders of the flag nearly all scouted through to Kentucky and joined the Union army. But the flag still floated in solitary grandeur as if to guard the Gap and, the next year, after the storms had torn it to tatters, another company of Confederate cavalry came along and camped by the tall pole. Two of them called at the cabin in sight and asked for an axe. The old woman fearing they might have de-signs on the flag pole, gave them a very dull old axe; later, she heard its dull, beating strokes and, after dark, she heard the sound of the tall pole falling like a tree. The Confederates tore the remains of the banner from its staff and carried the stars away and dropped the ragged stripes to the ground. The next day two little girls gathered the soiled fragments of red and white silk and played with them. The old flag had fallen in the Smoky Mountains would it ever be restored again ? Parson Brownlow And what about Wear's Cove with its memories of early Indian war? Since the day of the Percival tragedy in 1795, this beautiful valley had been settled in peace and remained undisturbed. But the news of secession aroused the people from their slumbers. They held a public meeting, condemned secession, and declared that they were for Union and peace, and they would have peace if they had to fight for it their mountain-walled valley must be sacred from hostile invasion. So they organized a military company, similar -to the "minute men" of the Revolution which they called a "home guard." Soon after this, a. distinguished visitor sought refuge in this se-cluded valley. He was Parson Brownlow, the famous union editor of Tennessee, the most vitriolic' writer in America, a man of rough speech and kind heart. He had suspended publication of his paper, The Whig, and sought safety in the shadow of the mountains. He rested awhile in the home of Post-master Valentine Mattox of Wear's Cove. One night his assistant editor,William Rule, arrived at the Mattox home Rule had scouted through Knoxville to warn Brown-low that his enemies were on the trail. The next day Brownlow and Rule went to the home of "Squire" Richard Crowson. About that time a wild rumor came from some unknown source that the rebels were coming, burning houses which they had .threatened to do. The rumor was false but the "home guard" shouldered their long rifles and hatened to Crowson Gap to meet the hostile invaders. As the guard passed "Squire" Crowson's house, Brownlow appeared on the porch some of the guards recognized him "Brownlow Brownlow ! a speech from Brownlow 1" they called, and this was his speech a motto of the Revolution: "Boys, trust in God and keep your powder dry." With this speech ringing in their ears they marched on to the gap to defend their homes but the enemy did not come that day; after that superior forces of Confeder-'ate cavalry often dashed in suddenly, making resistance impossible and searched the valley for men, arms, and horses. From "Squire" Crowson's house, Brownlow went farther up the valley to the home of Alexander Andrew Coulter, a firm Union man and a near relative of Alexander H. Stephens, Vice President of the Confederacy. But THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI r's house was in a very open o Brownlow soon visited the of Reverend J. B.

Audacity won the pass was given but Brownlow's friends in Wear's Cove had only seen the beginning of their sorrow. The home guard could not cope with the forces that came so frequently and so suddenly against them. They were driven into the woods like wild beasts. With great danger and. difficulty they did a little farm work, provided for their homes the best they could, and then most of them scattered through by night, marched on foot to Kentucky and joined the Union army. Wear's Cove and its immediate environs, with about sixty dwelling houses at that time, furnished seventy-four union volunteers. Men and boys enlisted, over and under military age only a few were left at home to take care of the women and children the best they could through all sorts of danger and difficulty. "Thomas's Legion" There was more division of sentiment in Gatlinburg than any other community in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. Its first settlers came over the Indian Gap trail from the Carolinas and that trail still remains a direct connection with all the South. Travel, trade, and relationship sometimes affect political sentiment. And then Colonel Thomas, the famous white chief of that remnant of the Cherokee Indian tribe in North Carolina, came over and established a military camp at Gatlin-burg and tried to hold the entire Smoky Mountain region for the Confederate cause. His block house, or main building, stood on the Burg NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 67 Hill with the camps and cabins of his dusky retainers near by. He had a mixed regiment of Indians and white men, known as "Thomas's Legion." Many citizens enlisted, more or less willingly, in his force. He did a lot of work on the rough roads, changing and improving some parts of roads, both below and above Gatlinburg, and made a road part way toward Alum Cave and tried to manufacture chemicals at or near the Cave. But he did not make the Indian Gap trail, as has been so often stated, for it was in constant use long before his time. He seemed to dream of a little military and industrial kingdom of his own here in the Smoky Mountains and some of his work appeared to be for the public benefit but a regiment of red and white laborers, loafers and guerillas cannot live on mountain land and ice cold water they must have food. So they raided around and took the corn from the crib and the bacon from the smoke house, and honey from the hive and the cattle from the pasture until they almost starved the people to death. And the people began to weary of their over lords and long for real peace and freedom and return to the old flag. Some who had once enlisted in the Legion deserted and fled to the Union army. A Union soldier re-visiting his home near Gatlinburg, was captured by guerillas and murdered. A neighbor trying to rescue him was killed also. These tragedies embittered the people and the heavy hand of military despot-ism and oppression still rested on Gatlinburg and the surrounding country. Even in Wear's Cove, beyond that big mountain, houses were robbed, horses stolen, andboys at work in the corn field were captured and taken to Gatlinburg to be conscripted for the Confederate service. But one night a force of Union cavalry suddenly arrived. in Wear's Cove and called for guides to lead them over the mountain to Gatlinburg. Civil War Ends They had important business there which must have immediate attention. Guides were soon found and one of the few men left in the valley and the weary march began. Sometimes riding, some-times leading their horses, they took the rough back road among the gray rocks and big chestnut trees along the foot of Cove Mountain and over a high gap and down through Little Green Briar Cove and up that long weary trail to the top of Horse Ridge and then over Rich Mountain down to Laurel Creek lighting the descent with a long line of pine torches. Soon after they reached the foot of the mountain a lonesome cabin appeared by the trail and an old woman aroused by the tramp of iron shod hoofs on the rocky trail, came out and gazed on the strange scene. Her two eldest sons were far away in the Union army and she with the remainder of her little family, lived with dread of the guerillas. What new danger must she face now? Who could these dark clad troopers be? Then she caught a glimpse of the flag. "Glory, glory," she shouted. "There's the old flag." An officer took it from the bearer and held it above her and let its silken folds reach her head. She threw up her arms, pulled the flag down, embraced and kissed it while tears of joy gleamed on her faded 68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI cheeks. The old flag had returned to the great Smoky Mountains. Then the troops rode over the next gap and down Fighting Creek and West Pigeon River toward Gatlin-burg. When day dawned they were spreading out like a blue cloud over the open field. The Confederates fired and fled up the ridge from their camp, continuing to fire, Indian style from behind trees on the mountain, most of their bullets whizzing over the heads of the Union troops with a long drawn sound the swan song of Confederacy supremacy in the Great Smoky Mountains.

This was the last battle of the Civil War in the Smoky Mountains and the last battle of 250 years of intermittent war between whites and Indians east of the Mississippi from Jamestown, Virginia, to Gatlinburg, Tennessee.
