We had seen an important step of ^rogram for an isolated mountain corn-y completed ; the county was taking over f Pi Beta Phi's responsibilities, leaving move on to broader fields for bettering the ions of the mountain people. :er considering many possibilities for ex the services of the Settlement School, urnmer for the first time Pi Beta Phi con-I a summer school and workshop. It d to be a very successful venture. sections of the country were represented student body as may be seen from the list venteen states from which our students They were from as far east as Massabts and far west as California; from Wis on the north to Texas on the south. !ssee, Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Penniia, Illinois Louisiana New Mexico, ;sippi, Massachusetts, Iowa, North and Carolina, Missouri, Georgia, Texas, and )rnia all were there. en four o'clock came and it was time to or the day, everyone was loathe to stop the interesting and worthwhile things which being accomplished. A lovely design for a print was almost finished or the looms ready to begin weaving a drapery, lunch-lolly, purse, towel, rug, or baby blanket. Istic box or napkin ring was near comn; only a few more turns and a beautiful en bowl would be finished or a doll would 3.dy for its wig. So much interest and en-Lsm were packed into each day of the short eeks session' that six o'clock was even too to stop for the evening meal. Every opnity was seized to put a few more touches e work at hand. Miss Martha Thompson, Demonstration Agent in extension work for the state of North Carolina writes: "It was with great reluctance that I withdrew from the Pi Beta Phi summer school. It had been such fun as well as a much worthwhile experience. Since I returned to my regular work, I have had time to evaluate the help that I received and I feel that it is going to be invaluable in assisting me to develop a finer program in the county. "It would be impossible for me to tell you how very much I enjoyed the work and the association with the faculty of the summer school of Pi Beta Phi. One always gains tremendously personally and professionally when he has the privilege of such fine contacts. "In my enthusiasm I think I have already interested two or three people in going next summer, and I've always heard that was a good test of the success of a project. With every good wish and many thanks to each of you." Miss Elsa Ulbricht proved herself not only a real artist but a true teacher, one with the ability to inspire her students and capable of giving them confidence in their work. The students were congenial, happy, and enthusiastic in their work. A letter from Mrs. Gail N. Barber, Director of Industrial Arts, State Department of Education, Santa Fe, New Mexico, expresses perfectly the reaction of the students to their summer's work: "I wish to take this means of congratulating the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and the University of Tennessee on the excellent Workshop of Handicrafts and Community Recreation you have con-ducted this summer at Gatlinburg, Tennessee. "From the beginning on June 11 to the end on July 18, it was one of the most pleasant and profitable school sessions I have ever attended. The Director, Miss Elsa Ulbricht, and her assistants, were a challenge and inspiration unexcelled. Miss Ulbricht's wonderful philosophy of life is equalled only by her mastery of the techniques of the crafts. "It was an unusual experience to go to a school with a long list of problems covering everything from theory to actual practice and have them worked out right at the same time that many other people were solving a different group of problems. "In the weaving classes one could be in 172 THE DECEMBER ARROW 173 strutted in anything from primitive Indian weaving to the most intricate and delicate of wool and linen weaving. This included many forms of weaving that can be used in the smallest and poorest country school with no more equipment than the tablet backs, a little cord, a little yarn, and some knowledge on the part of the teacher. "In the general recreational crafts there seemed to be no limit. In the `wood-shed,' as we jokingly called the shop, everything from. a small Navajo rug beater to the most beautiful cherry and tulip wood bowls was turned out as if by magic. We braided and hooked rugs, worked in. plastics, made gloves and purses of leathers and felts, designed and block printed and silk screen printed yards of attractive draperies and linens, made dolls and other soft toys in fact, the list seemed endless. "The group in Community Recreation led by Mrs. Josephine Bakke, provided the diversion, pep, and fun needed to keep us all at our best. I predict that each one will go out to some community and `step up' the recreational program in a very stimulating way. "Too much could not be said of the beauty, delightful climate, and hospitality of Gatlin-.burg. Miss Ruth Dyer and the staff members present of the Settlement School extended every courtesy and made our stay a most happy one. "You will know something of the group's enthusiasm when I tell you that we were expected to work about six hours a day, five days a week, but we did work eagerly from eight in the morning until six in the evening often six days a week. "One .day we made a most interesting and instructive visit to the John C. Campbell School, at Brasstown, North Carolina. We spent the Fourth of July guided by the Great Smokie's famous `Roamin' Man of the Mountains,' Wiley Oakley, along a number of the most beautiful mountain trails. We had our lunch under an old Appalachian Trail shelter with an open fire scented with balsam boughs. We could easily imagine the Indians and early settlers as they traveled along that trail from Georgia to Maine. "The members of the Workshop took home memories of one of the most delightful and profitable experiences of our lives, and feel very grateful to all those who made it possible. "It was a real pleasure to meet and know you and your associates on the committee." In addition to the class work there were enjoyable extra-curricular activities. At a party planned by the regular school staff for the pleasure of the summer school staff and stu Melinda MELINDA OGLE WADLEY is the first graduate of the Pi Beta Phi School to receive a degree in nursing. She was born in Gatlinburg in June, 1924. Her mother Mary Ogle, named her for Melinda and Ann Stuart. Ann Stuart was Grand Treasurer of the Fraternity in 1912 when the school was established. All of Melinda's education was at the Settlement School and she graduated from ,high school in 1942. She joined the Cadet Nurse Corps and will receive her degree in nursing from the John Gaston Hospital at Memphis, Tennessee, this December, 1945. Melinda is married to C. Hughes Wadley, Jr., a pre-medic student from Memphis. dents, Mrs. Bakke's class in Recreation showed its ability to provide real fun for all. Many interesting and unusual games were played. The puppet show which was produced for the finale, was cleverly written and contained some choice remarks about the summer school which brought much laughter from the audience. The puppets were made by the girls in the class. The summer workshop was brought to a close with an open house at which time the Emma eavng Class THE DECEMBER ARROW 175 Harper Turner Craft Center was dedicated. More than one hundred guests were taken on a tour of inspection where they saw students ac-. tually at work. Those at the looms demonstrated the art of weaving articles in a fascinating assortment of colors and materials. Others were working on block prints, toys, gloves, stencils, games, sandals made with wooden soles and colored leather tops. In the woodworking shop, wooden bowls were being turned and samples of their workmanship were on display. The teaching staff was composed of Miss Elsa Ulbricht, B.B., in charge of the Handicraft Project and instructor in weaving; Hazel Lewis Dingman, B.A., M.A., instructor in miscellaneous Recreational Crafts ; George Barford, B.Ed., M.A., instructing in woodworking; and Josephine Arnquist Bakke,' B.S., Director of Recreation and Instructor in Community Recreation. University credit was given for the courses taken, and many demonstration agents, home economics majors, and others in affiliated lines of interest made up the enrollment. Pi Beta Phi can take very real pride in the accomplishments of the first summer school and workshop. We have taken a firm step in our program of developing a nationally known handicraft center which will serve to foster and keep alive the arts and crafts' of the mountain region and make these known to the world at large. The Dedication of the E..ma Harper Turner Craft Center On July 16 the new Settlement School Center for Arts and Crafts was dedicated in an impressive ceremony. Miss Emma Woerner, a member of the Settlement School Committee, presented Miss Onken, who paid high tribute to the memory of Emma Harper Turner who first thought of establishing a school for the mountain people as a memorial to our Founders. Emma Harper Turner was a charter member of Indiana Alpha Chapter and a founder of Columbia Alpha Chapter. She served the Fraternity as Grand vice-President from 1889 to 1890, and was Grand President from 1890 to 1893. She was responsible for the development of the province, system, the incorporation of the fraternity, and the custom of celebrating Founders' Day. Pictures for this section are by Dorothy Maclean, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. As a result of her efforts, our national alumnae association was formed, the first organization of its kind for a women's college fraternity. She served as president of the new organization from 1893 to 1897. In 1910 Emma Harper Turner conceived the idea of a Settlement School which would pro-vide for the education of the mountain people, and which would also create a worthwhile objective for the work of the Pi Beta Phi Alumnae Clubs. She was chairman of the first Settlement School Committee and under her supervision the school received its start. In the dedication service, Miss Onken spoke of the work to be done in the Craft Center using this appropriate theme: "We may take pleasure in being idle; we find happiness in being busy." The Emma Harper Turner Craft Center is an attractive building of two large rooms. One room houses the weaving department and ,the other is given over to woodworking. Six new looms will be added to the equipment in the weaving room this year and will provide an opportunity for many more students to learn this art. The Craft Center is under the direction of Miss Elizabeth Petrie, our Arts and Crafts teacher. An Arroweraft Chair Goes to England There have been few opportunities for individuals in America to learn of the genuine appreciation of the British people for the war packages which have found their way to war torn England. In one of the "Bundles for Britain" some unknown donor included a doll chair which bore the label of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at Gatlinburg, Tennessee. With this label as a clue, an appreciative mother wrote the following letter to their unknown benefactor addressed to the Settlement School: "To whom it may concern: "This letter is one of thanks from grateful parents whose little daughter received a beautifully made chair at Christmas time with en-closed label attached to it. "I felt I had to write and thank you and hope by enclosing this label, this letter would ultimately reach the clever person who made the chair.

It was not until this summer when the flying bombs started and Eileen and Alan, her little brother of two, became very nervous and Eileen's school had to close because of the bombs, that I evacuated to Scotland with the children for safety, leaving Daddy behind he works in an aircraft factory. "We stayed in Scotland five months altogether. Eileen and Alan forgot all about flying bombs and really became fit. We returned home in November. Eileen was taken ill on the way home, was eventually taken to hospital and had to be operated, was very ill just before Christmas and is still in hospital. Your little chair was given to her as part of her Christmas presents. She did enjoy having it, it helped her to forget her pain. "Thank you very much for being so kind to a little ill child in Southern England. Your gift reached Eileen at the America Ward, St. Thomas's Hospital, Milford, Godalming, Surrey. "Thank you very much from Eileen, her Daddy, and her little brother Alan, and her Mummy. Your most gratefully, Mary W. Thomas" A Pledge Speaks By ROSE REDDOCH Pi Beta Phi What do you mean to me? Is it possible to be able to take in my hand a pen and transcribe your significance? I wonder. Perhaps it is and yet most things that penetrate into one's emotions as you do are set to music and the lyrics swell into each heart and linger there. To everything be it great or small, there must be a contributing factor that has made it such. So it is with you, Pi Phi, and as I prepare myself to become a part of you I look ahead and dream of the many things that I shall endeavor to ,give to you and of the ever-flowing tide of rewards I shall receive. I pledge to you first, Pi Phi, my time. Surely this should begin my list, for out of my time will grow loyalty and friendship and out of these two, one of the deepest emotions of all Fraternity Spirit. Next my support, both morally and financially; my cooperation in all things and at all times and a deep endeavor to participate in all extra-curricular and scholastic activities that may be asked of me. After I have given these, one more naturally grows into my heart; respect for you and a firm declaration of faith in you that will yield to me a host of treasures that are infallible. I look forward first to the honor and prestige that comes with being a part of you, I look forward to your aid that will help me develop my character and personality, and your assistance in my problems both personal and scholastic. I look to you for friendship during my college days and all through my life thereafter. I look to you for respect that will surely come under the standards that you, Pi Beta Phi, hold. aall.m.m.amal.i.kItueti.lisgsamistmisti.ttoistlitissims.ritalitiittittaist.tomi,nistoutunists ILI PI :PHI PESONALIITIES New Unity Institute Director Announcement has been made that Francese Evans Ives, Louisiana A, has been elected Director of Unity Institute, following unanimous recommendation of Unity Institute and the board of trustees of Unity Church.

Istic box or napkin ring was near comn; only a few more turns and a beautiful en bowl would be finished or a doll would 3.dy for its wig. So much interest and en-Lsm were packed into each day of the short eeks session' that six o'clock was even too to stop for the evening meal. Every opnity was seized to put a few more touches e work at hand. Miss Martha Thompson, Demonstration Agent in extension work for the state of North Carolina writes: "It was with great reluctance that I withdrew from the Pi Beta Phi summer school. It had been such fun as well as a much worthwhile experience. Since I returned to my regular work, I have had time to evaluate the help that I received and I feel that it is going to be invaluable in assisting me to develop a finer program in the county. "It would be impossible for me to tell you how very much I enjoyed the work and the association with the faculty of the summer school of Pi Beta Phi. One always gains tremendously personally and professionally when he has the privilege of such fine contacts. "In my enthusiasm I think I have already interested two or three people in going next summer, and I've always heard that was a good test of the success of a project. With every good wish and many thanks to each of you." Miss Elsa Ulbricht proved herself not only a real artist but a true teacher, one with the ability to inspire her students and capable of giving them confidence in their work. The students were congenial, happy, and enthusiastic in their work. A letter from Mrs. Gail N. Barber, Director of Industrial Arts, State Department of Education, Santa Fe, New Mexico, expresses perfectly the reaction of the students to their summer's work: "I wish to take this means of congratulating the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and the University of Tennessee on the excellent Workshop of Handicrafts and Community Recreation you have con-ducted this summer at Gatlinburg, Tennessee. "From the beginning on June 11 to the end on July 18, it was one of the most pleasant and profitable school sessions I have ever attended. The Director, Miss Elsa Ulbricht, and her assistants, were a challenge and inspiration unexcelled. Miss Ulbricht's wonderful philosophy of life is equalled only by her mastery of the techniques of the crafts. "It was an unusual experience to go to a school with a long list of problems covering everything from theory to actual practice and have them worked out right at the same time that many other people were solving a different group of problems. "In the weaving classes one could be in 172 THE DECEMBER ARROW 173 strutted in anything from primitive Indian weaving to the most intricate and delicate of wool and linen weaving. This included many forms of weaving that can be used in the smallest and poorest country school with no more equipment than the tablet backs, a little cord, a little yarn, and some knowledge on the part of the teacher. "In the general recreational crafts there seemed to be no limit. In the `wood-shed,' as we jokingly called the shop, everything from. a small Navajo rug beater to the most beautiful cherry and tulip wood bowls was turned out as if by magic. We braided and hooked rugs, worked in. plastics, made gloves and purses of leathers and felts, designed and block printed and silk screen printed yards of attractive draperies and linens, made dolls and other soft toys in fact, the list seemed endless. "The group in Community Recreation led by Mrs. Josephine Bakke, provided the diversion, pep, and fun needed to keep us all at our best. I predict that each one will go out to some community and `step up' the recreational program in a very stimulating way. "Too much could not be said of the beauty, delightful climate, and hospitality of Gatlin-.burg. Miss Ruth Dyer and the staff members present of the Settlement School extended every courtesy and made our stay a most happy one. "You will know something of the group's enthusiasm when I tell you that we were expected to work about six hours a day, five days a week, but we did work eagerly from eight in the morning until six in the evening often six days a week. "One .day we made a most interesting and instructive visit to the John C. Campbell School, at Brasstown, North Carolina. We spent the Fourth of July guided by the Great Smokie's famous `Roamin' Man of the Mountains,' Wiley Oakley, along a number of the most beautiful mountain trails. We had our lunch under an old Appalachian Trail shelter with an open fire scented with balsam boughs. We could easily imagine the Indians and early settlers as they traveled along that trail from Georgia to Maine. "The members of the Workshop took home memories of one of the most delightful and profitable experiences of our lives, and feel very grateful to all those who made it possible. "It was a real pleasure to meet and know you and your associates on the committee." In addition to the class work there were enjoyable extra-curricular activities.

She was born in Gatlinburg in June, 1924. Her mother Mary Ogle, named her for Melinda and Ann Stuart. Ann Stuart was Grand Treasurer of the Fraternity in 1912 when the school was established. All of Melinda's education was at the Settlement School and she graduated from ,high school in 1942. She joined the Cadet Nurse Corps and will receive her degree in nursing from the John Gaston Hospital at Memphis, Tennessee, this December, 1945. Melinda is married to C. Hughes Wadley, Jr., a pre-medic student from Memphis. dents, Mrs. Bakke's class in Recreation showed its ability to provide real fun for all. Many interesting and unusual games were played. The puppet show which was produced for the finale, was cleverly written and contained some choice remarks about the summer school which brought much laughter from the audience. The puppets were made by the girls in the class. The summer workshop was brought to a close with an open house at which time the Emma eavng Class THE DECEMBER ARROW 175 Harper Turner Craft Center was dedicated. More than one hundred guests were taken on a tour of inspection where they saw students ac-. tually at work. Those at the looms demonstrated the art of weaving articles in a fascinating assortment of colors and materials. Others were working on block prints, toys, gloves, stencils, games, sandals made with wooden soles and colored leather tops. In the woodworking shop, wooden bowls were being turned and samples of their workmanship were on display. The teaching staff was composed of Miss Elsa Ulbricht, B.B., in charge of the Handicraft Project and instructor in weaving; Hazel Lewis Dingman, B.A., M.A., instructor in miscellaneous Recreational Crafts ; George Barford, B.Ed., M.A., instructing in woodworking; and Josephine Arnquist Bakke,' B.S., Director of Recreation and Instructor in Community Recreation. University credit was given for the courses taken, and many demonstration agents, home economics majors, and others in affiliated lines of interest made up the enrollment. Pi Beta Phi can take very real pride in the accomplishments of the first summer school and workshop. We have taken a firm step in our program of developing a nationally known handicraft center which will serve to foster and keep alive the arts and crafts' of the mountain region and make these known to the world at large. The Dedication of the E..ma Harper Turner Craft Center On July 16 the new Settlement School Center for Arts and Crafts was dedicated in an impressive ceremony. Miss Emma Woerner, a member of the Settlement School Committee, presented Miss Onken, who paid high tribute to the memory of Emma Harper Turner who first thought of establishing a school for the mountain people as a memorial to our Founders. Emma Harper Turner was a charter member of Indiana Alpha Chapter and a founder of Columbia Alpha Chapter. She served the Fraternity as Grand vice-President from 1889 to 1890, and was Grand President from 1890 to 1893. She was responsible for the development of the province, system, the incorporation of the fraternity, and the custom of celebrating Founders' Day. Pictures for this section are by Dorothy Maclean, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. As a result of her efforts, our national alumnae association was formed, the first organization of its kind for a women's college fraternity. She served as president of the new organization from 1893 to 1897. In 1910 Emma Harper Turner conceived the idea of a Settlement School which would pro-vide for the education of the mountain people, and which would also create a worthwhile objective for the work of the Pi Beta Phi Alumnae Clubs. She was chairman of the first Settlement School Committee and under her supervision the school received its start. In the dedication service, Miss Onken spoke of the work to be done in the Craft Center using this appropriate theme: "We may take pleasure in being idle; we find happiness in being busy." The Emma Harper Turner Craft Center is an attractive building of two large rooms. One room houses the weaving department and ,the other is given over to woodworking. Six new looms will be added to the equipment in the weaving room this year and will provide an opportunity for many more students to learn this art. The Craft Center is under the direction of Miss Elizabeth Petrie, our Arts and Crafts teacher. An Arroweraft Chair Goes to England There have been few opportunities for individuals in America to learn of the genuine appreciation of the British people for the war packages which have found their way to war torn England. In one of the "Bundles for Britain" some unknown donor included a doll chair which bore the label of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at Gatlinburg, Tennessee. With this label as a clue, an appreciative mother wrote the following letter to their unknown benefactor addressed to the Settlement School: "To whom it may concern: "This letter is one of thanks from grateful parents whose little daughter received a beautifully made chair at Christmas time with en-closed label attached to it. "I felt I had to write and thank you and hope by enclosing this label, this letter would ultimately reach the clever person who made the chair. "I will tell you a little of the little girl who received your chair her name is Eileen she 176 THE DECEMBER ARROW was six years old on 4 of Jan. we have al-ways lived in Southern England through all the bombing. It was not until this summer when the flying bombs started and Eileen and Alan, her little brother of two, became very nervous and Eileen's school had to close because of the bombs, that I evacuated to Scotland with the children for safety, leaving Daddy behind he works in an aircraft factory. "We stayed in Scotland five months altogether. Eileen and Alan forgot all about flying bombs and really became fit. We returned home in November. Eileen was taken ill on the way home, was eventually taken to hospital and had to be operated, was very ill just before Christmas and is still in hospital. Your little chair was given to her as part of her Christmas presents. She did enjoy having it, it helped her to forget her pain. "Thank you very much for being so kind to a little ill child in Southern England. Your gift reached Eileen at the America Ward, St. Thomas's Hospital, Milford, Godalming, Surrey. "Thank you very much from Eileen, her Daddy, and her little brother Alan, and her Mummy. Your most gratefully, Mary W. Thomas" A Pledge Speaks By ROSE REDDOCH Pi Beta Phi What do you mean to me? Is it possible to be able to take in my hand a pen and transcribe your significance? I wonder. Perhaps it is and yet most things that penetrate into one's emotions as you do are set to music and the lyrics swell into each heart and linger there. To everything be it great or small, there must be a contributing factor that has made it such. So it is with you, Pi Phi, and as I prepare myself to become a part of you I look ahead and dream of the many things that I shall endeavor to ,give to you and of the ever-flowing tide of rewards I shall receive. I pledge to you first, Pi Phi, my time. Surely this should begin my list, for out of my time will grow loyalty and friendship and out of these two, one of the deepest emotions of all Fraternity Spirit. Next my support, both morally and financially; my cooperation in all things and at all times and a deep endeavor to participate in all extra-curricular and scholastic activities that may be asked of me. After I have given these, one more naturally grows into my heart; respect for you and a firm declaration of faith in you that will yield to me a host of treasures that are infallible. I look forward first to the honor and prestige that comes with being a part of you, I look forward to your aid that will help me develop my character and personality, and your assistance in my problems both personal and scholastic. I look to you for friendship during my college days and all through my life thereafter. I look to you for respect that will surely come under the standards that you, Pi Beta Phi, hold. aall.m.m.amal.i.kItueti.lisgsamistmisti.ttoistlitissims.ritalitiittittaist.tomi,nistoutunists ILI PI :PHI PESONALIITIES New Unity Institute Director Announcement has been made that Francese Evans Ives, Louisiana A, has been elected Director of Unity Institute, following unanimous recommendation of Unity Institute and the board of trustees of Unity Church.
