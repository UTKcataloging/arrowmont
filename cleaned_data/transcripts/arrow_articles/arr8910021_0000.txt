        ta. PA,i Settlement School CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS, ARROWMONT After a successful Arrowmont Night program at the San ntonio Convention, the year started with enthusiasm for e prospects of the growth of Arrowmont's service to all rough the field of crafts. Several changes in personnel have occurred, but the work the Fraternity in Gatlinburg continues to expand. The rrowcraft Shop has added new crafts to its inventory bile maintaining the weaving department at a high level activity. The 1972 summer Craft School is conducting ree two-week courses and four one-week courses to pro-de opportunities for more people to come to the classes. he financial support by the members of the Fraternity in-eases each year and we are counting on their increased terest, enthusiasm, and understanding of our goals. In October, Lucile McCutchan Woodworth resigned as (ecutive Coordinator. Helen Anderson Lewis became Resent Administrator and continues in that capacity. In pril, the Board of Governors offered Mrs. Lewis a con-act as Administrator and she has accepted. Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont School of Crafts, as successful in conducting additional craft workshops 1ring the year. It is anticipated that the number of work-.ops will increase as the Fraternity is able to provide the nds for the increase in the director's time. Through her Forts, Arrowmont's fame is spreading throughout the aft world, and with the additional efforts of the members Pi Phi, it is spreading to those who would learn more out that world, and its opportunities for service. The scholarships given by the chapters, clubs and provces serve as a firsthand liaison between Arrowmont and embers of the Fraternity. The community of each donat g group is richly served when the scholarship recipient turns to use his or her newly learned skills in philanropic or educational areas. The list of Arrowmont students and staff was divided to provinces and sent to each province officer for distribu-)n to the clubs and chapters. It is hoped that each group ill contact those in its area. This can be a two-fold educa-)n; the student or staff member will learn that Pi Phis in s or her own community are among those responsible for the existence of Arrowmont, and the Pi Phis will learn more about the work done by their contributions. The 1971 annual meeting of the board was held in San Antonio in June. Members of the board met with Grand Council in Gatlinburg in October, 1971, and an interim meeting of the board was held in Gatlinburg in April, 1972. The 1972 annual meeting will be in Gatlinburg in October. Each member of the board has been busy with her responsibilities during the past year. A new manual has been compiled and staff job descriptions have been brought up to date. The requirements for the May L. Keller Award have been rewritten to comply with the I.C. '71 reorganization of the chapter activities. Memorial contributions have been acknowledged by the secretary. Clubs are encouraged to make donations to Settlement School whenever they wish to honor the memory of a Pi Phi or a member of her family. Many alumme not affiliated with alumnae clubs have responded generously to a request for contributions to Arrowmont through the blue envelope mailing by Central Office. The magazine agency showed an increase last year and the contributions made by the Pi Phi owners of the Kansas State Travel Agency continue to increase each year as more Pi Phis make their travel arrangements through them. It's been a year of building firm foundations of organization, and a year of increased understanding of the directions in which our national philanthropy is growing. The support of the members of the Fraternity will continue to be the mainstay of the Arrowcraft Shop and Arrowmont School of Crafts. We hope to make each individual Pi Phi aware of her responsibility and increase her interest as we repeatedly use the slogan MAKE ARROWMONT YOUR FAVORITE PHILANTHROPY. The chairman would like to express her gratitude to each member of the Board of Governors, Grand Council, and the staff in Gatlinburg. It has been a busy and rewarding year in the service of Pi Phi and Arrowmont. BETTY BAILEY HALL ADMINISTRATOR-Pi BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL This report will cover the period from October 15, 1971, rough May 31, 1972, since that is the length of time the esent administrator has been in this office. Arrowmont was represented at the Craftsmen's Fair in atlinburg in October, by a beautiful exhibit, combining rces with the University of Tennessee. Arrowcraft articles 2.1.e on display and for sale in the Central Booth at, the ir. Arrowcraft had a very good year, with total sales exceed g those of last year. We had 251 clubs and 37 chapters Ring Arrowcraft and the winners in the various categos are announced elsewhere. We had fewer returns of erchandise than before, and in most cases, the clubs and apters are responding to our request to pay their bills omptly after their sales. Although some expansion was ade in the shop a few years ago, we find that we still uld use more space in the sales room as well as in the )ck, shipping, and weaving rooms. There were a few changes in personnel this year. Our ,okkeeper quit at the end of the year, 1971, but we were rtunate in having Nadine Whitted do double duty and )rk with Very! Monhollen in bookkeeping at Arrowcraft, Zile serving as the Administrator's mainstay, and doing the necessary bookkeeping in this office. Nella Hill is weaving designer and manager; Faye Cook and Ruby Watson are in charge of shipping; Gene Hembree and Margie Lamon are in sales. Mrs. Kenny, who worked part time, has left and was replaced by Vickie Ownby, who will work full time in sales. In the maintenance department we have three hard working men who are on the job full time: Neal Watson, Zan-ley Watson, and Ernie Schultz. Ralph Schultz was added to the staff for the summer. All during the year the men are busy painting, making repairs of all kinds, and generally keeping the grounds and buildings in good shape. Our housekeeper and cook, Mrs. Adams, who has been with us for many years, is presently on sick leave and we miss her very much. We are looking forward to the time when she can return. In the meantime, during summer school, we have a corps of cooks under the direction of Mrs. Bogle, the dietitian who has been here several summers. In the housekeeping department, our two regular girls, Helen Vance and Janie Matthews, are being assisted by Paula Bell and Mary Clemons, college girls from Louisiana who came to Gatlinburg looking for summer work. The Barn continues to be a popular place for weekend 20 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 2 retreats for Pi Phi chapters, church groups, and other similar organizations. Bookings have been made already for weekends in the fall. We probably could rent the Barn every weekend, but we do not have enough staff to take care of the necessary maintenance and cleaning. The Barn is set up with 34 beds and 6 rollaway beds. This year we added two beds in Teachers and one bed in Pollard, plus another rollaway in Staff House. This gives us a total of 102 beds for staff, faculty, and students during the summer. In addition, we have two beds in the vacant room in the Administrative office building for Helen and Bob Russell. Helen is giving her time this summer to serve as librarian at Arrowmont. We are looking forward to a successful workshop pro-gram again this summer. So far we have 123 students registered for each of the first two sessions. Most classes are completely filled and we have had to turn some people away for lack of space in classes, or for lack of housing. Our faculty members are outstanding craftsmen as well as being excellent teachers and many have taught here in past years. Once again we will have a fine teacher in Peter Coiling-wood from England, who is a well known authority on weaving. Mr. Collingwood will be here for the first session and will teach Sprang and Advanced Weaving. Marian Heard's excellent guidance as Director continues to make Arrowmont a widely known and well respected craft school. We are fortunate too, in having Sandra Blain as assistant director. Sandy spent last year at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and now has her MFA Degree. She will be at Arrowmont all summer and will return to teaching at the University of Tennessee in the fall. In addition to Marian and Sandy, we have two girls working full time in the office at Arrowmont: Sharon Hus-key and Teresa Coons. During the workshop sessions the are aided by the six graduate assistants who do some offi( work along with many other chores. We have a fine grow of assistants this year. Last March we were host to the NCECA conferen( which drew over 600 people. We did not house this grout but they did use all the rooms at Arrowmont for wort shops and forums. In April we put on a three day wort shop for the Tennessee Arts Commission. This time all or facilities were used to full capacity. In May we housed an fed some thirty-five leaders of the annual Wildflower Pi grimage. The alumni of the College of Home Economics c the University of Tennessee held a forum and luncheon Arrowmont during the craft workshop period. Also durin April, the Board of Governors of Arrowmont held a tw day meeting. We are grateful for the loyal support of our clubs, char ters, and individual Pi Phis. We just wish it were possibi for all Pi Phis to visit their school and to get a real appr( ciation of the work that is done here. True, Gatlinburg ha changed greatly through the years from a small town to busy, bustling community filled with motels and shops c all kinds. This is to be expected since the Park visitol number in the thousands each month, even during the wir ter. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School property is an oasi in the midst of all this and is greatly appreciated by th many people who visit Arrowmont and the Arrowcral Shop,. My grateful thanks to the members of the Grand Cour cil, the Board of Governors, the Central Office staff, an, finally, the wonderful people here who have given me er couragement and their loyal support.

With our $1000.00 donation last summer to the North West Territory Libraries, a Videorecorder was purchased to be used at the Rankin Inlet Library. The Yukon Library System will receive our donation this year and the librarian is interested in providing periodicals in Indian Community drop-in Centres. It is hoped that this will provide the urgently needed contact with the twelve Indian Bands. The final decision on disposition of our donation is, of course, left to the chief librarians of the NWT and Yukon, as only they know where the need is greatest. Since the advent of Canada Loans, our loan fund forstudents in social work in many cases has not been utilize to any extent. The maximum loan was increased from to $300 this year for a trial period to determine if th would make the loan more relevant. When reports are this year we will know if this loan fund has outlived i usefulness and will then consider other directions. Th fund is self-sustaining and we wish to put it to work whe. the need is greatest. We appreciate the loyal support of the many clubs, chaj ters, and individuals who have contributed to our philai thropies. PAT FOSTER WEIR EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE The Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds committee, its purposes and functions, seem to be not as generally understood by the membership as other Fraternity projects. During World War II when Conventions could not be held, money accumulated in the general fund. In 1946 at the Swampscott Convention, it was voted to establish a new fund, to be named in honor of an alumna who had served the Fraternity well as Grand President, Grand Vice President, first chairman of the Settlement School committee, and in other capacities Emma Harper Turner. The fund was to have a dual purpose: (1) to establish a principal fund from which chapters could be granted loans for chap-ter house building or remodeling; and (2) to make grants to Pi Beta Phi alumna` who were in difficult circumstances and in need of special assistance. The money for such grants was to come from the interest paid by chapters on the loans. Over the years the principal fund has been augmented by gifts from clubs, chapters and individuals. The Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds committee in no way enters into the decisions about chapter house loans; it is concerned solely with the granting of "gifts of love" to members in great need. During the twenty-six years since this fund was established, eighty Pi Beta Phi alumnae have been given the help and encouragement which this fund provides. Members of forty-seven chapters have been represented in the roll of recipients, including twenty-eight Golden Arrow members and thirty-five young alumnm. Seventeen of the members receiving help from the fund wore the arrow for sixty years or longer! Grants are of two types: (1) emergency grants, usually a one check gift and ordinarily given only once; and (2) a small monthly check on a continuing basis, as long as the need exists. Emergency grants have usually been given to young alumni faced with almost unbearable burdens an incapacitating operation; the loss of a husband after long and expensive illness, with bills to pay and children to care for; help for the family of two young mothers facing death whose last days were brightened by the knowledge that Pi Beta Phi cared for them. The majority of the monthly checks have been given to older alumnae; several have received help for many years. These older alumnae, perhaps living alone or in nursing homes or being cared for by their families, often have little or no money beyond bare subsistence needs. Our small monthly checks provide them with a little money of theirown for small needs and extras, and give them an indepe: dence and dignity so important to morale. Many have wri ten that the "lift to the spirit," the knowledge that Pi Be Phi still cares about them, has meant as much as the bad needed money. This past year seven alumnae have been receiving gran from this fund on a monthly basis. This is a smaller nur ber than usual, but the money will be available for times the future when there are increased requests. This comm: tee is concerned that perhaps there are alumni who despc ately needed help but are unknown to us. It is hoped th alumnae will be quietly alert for any member who may 1 in need of assistance. The chairman of the committee w always be happy to explain details and procedures. Cauth should always be exercised so that an alumna does n know she has been recommended for a grant; grants a given in confidence and the name of a recipient is nev revealed unless she chooses to do so herself. Also, it mig develop that an alumna recommended to the committee f a grant might for some reason not be eligible, and it wou be cruel to raise her hopes and have her disappointed. Special tribute must be paid to Lucile Carson who i tired in June, 1971, after serving as chairman of t EHTMF for nine years. Her letters to recipients and th( families are masterpieces of compassion, tact, and beau Her guidance and ever present help to the new chairm during the past year has been invaluable and is deeply a preciated. Sally Hunt has also been extremely helpful. It would be easy to project the real meaning of this pry ect if individual histories of recipients could be told, lc that is impossible. Perhaps the true meaning of the Ean Harper Turner Memorial Fund can be conveyed by quoti from a thank you letter written almost twenty-five ye ago by one of the very earliest recipients: ". . How c you expect us to express the inexpressable! So I can of hope that you will be able to interpret this `voiceless lence' of my heart, and read there an unending gratitude my dear Pi Beta Phi sisters for this wonderful gift, whi relieves me from a great weight of anxiety in facing .f calamity which came to me so suddenly. It is indeed mr more than a gift: It is an added inspiration to prove wore of the high ideals of Pi Beta Phi, which link the past a the present with the future in a golden sphere of unbrot friendship."

PAT FOSTER WEIR EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE The Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds committee, its purposes and functions, seem to be not as generally understood by the membership as other Fraternity projects. During World War II when Conventions could not be held, money accumulated in the general fund. In 1946 at the Swampscott Convention, it was voted to establish a new fund, to be named in honor of an alumna who had served the Fraternity well as Grand President, Grand Vice President, first chairman of the Settlement School committee, and in other capacities Emma Harper Turner. The fund was to have a dual purpose: (1) to establish a principal fund from which chapters could be granted loans for chap-ter house building or remodeling; and (2) to make grants to Pi Beta Phi alumna` who were in difficult circumstances and in need of special assistance. The money for such grants was to come from the interest paid by chapters on the loans. Over the years the principal fund has been augmented by gifts from clubs, chapters and individuals. The Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds committee in no way enters into the decisions about chapter house loans; it is concerned solely with the granting of "gifts of love" to members in great need. During the twenty-six years since this fund was established, eighty Pi Beta Phi alumnae have been given the help and encouragement which this fund provides. Members of forty-seven chapters have been represented in the roll of recipients, including twenty-eight Golden Arrow members and thirty-five young alumnm. Seventeen of the members receiving help from the fund wore the arrow for sixty years or longer! Grants are of two types: (1) emergency grants, usually a one check gift and ordinarily given only once; and (2) a small monthly check on a continuing basis, as long as the need exists. Emergency grants have usually been given to young alumni faced with almost unbearable burdens an incapacitating operation; the loss of a husband after long and expensive illness, with bills to pay and children to care for; help for the family of two young mothers facing death whose last days were brightened by the knowledge that Pi Beta Phi cared for them. The majority of the monthly checks have been given to older alumnae; several have received help for many years. These older alumnae, perhaps living alone or in nursing homes or being cared for by their families, often have little or no money beyond bare subsistence needs. Our small monthly checks provide them with a little money of theirown for small needs and extras, and give them an indepe: dence and dignity so important to morale. Many have wri ten that the "lift to the spirit," the knowledge that Pi Be Phi still cares about them, has meant as much as the bad needed money. This past year seven alumnae have been receiving gran from this fund on a monthly basis. This is a smaller nur ber than usual, but the money will be available for times the future when there are increased requests. This comm: tee is concerned that perhaps there are alumni who despc ately needed help but are unknown to us. It is hoped th alumnae will be quietly alert for any member who may 1 in need of assistance. The chairman of the committee w always be happy to explain details and procedures. Cauth should always be exercised so that an alumna does n know she has been recommended for a grant; grants a given in confidence and the name of a recipient is nev revealed unless she chooses to do so herself. Also, it mig develop that an alumna recommended to the committee f a grant might for some reason not be eligible, and it wou be cruel to raise her hopes and have her disappointed. Special tribute must be paid to Lucile Carson who i tired in June, 1971, after serving as chairman of t EHTMF for nine years. Her letters to recipients and th( families are masterpieces of compassion, tact, and beau Her guidance and ever present help to the new chairm during the past year has been invaluable and is deeply a preciated. Sally Hunt has also been extremely helpful. It would be easy to project the real meaning of this pry ect if individual histories of recipients could be told, lc that is impossible. Perhaps the true meaning of the Ean Harper Turner Memorial Fund can be conveyed by quoti from a thank you letter written almost twenty-five ye ago by one of the very earliest recipients: ". . How c you expect us to express the inexpressable! So I can of hope that you will be able to interpret this `voiceless lence' of my heart, and read there an unending gratitude my dear Pi Beta Phi sisters for this wonderful gift, whi relieves me from a great weight of anxiety in facing .f calamity which came to me so suddenly. It is indeed mr more than a gift: It is an added inspiration to prove wore of the high ideals of Pi Beta Phi, which link the past a the present with the future in a golden sphere of unbrot friendship."

RUTH WILLIAMS HANSEN 25 ta. PA,i Settlement School CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS, ARROWMONT After a successful Arrowmont Night program at the San ntonio Convention, the year started with enthusiasm for e prospects of the growth of Arrowmont's service to all rough the field of crafts. Several changes in personnel have occurred, but the work the Fraternity in Gatlinburg continues to expand. The rrowcraft Shop has added new crafts to its inventory bile maintaining the weaving department at a high level activity. The 1972 summer Craft School is conducting ree two-week courses and four one-week courses to pro-de opportunities for more people to come to the classes. he financial support by the members of the Fraternity in-eases each year and we are counting on their increased terest, enthusiasm, and understanding of our goals. In October, Lucile McCutchan Woodworth resigned as (ecutive Coordinator. Helen Anderson Lewis became Resent Administrator and continues in that capacity. In pril, the Board of Governors offered Mrs. Lewis a con-act as Administrator and she has accepted. Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont School of Crafts, as successful in conducting additional craft workshops 1ring the year. It is anticipated that the number of work-.ops will increase as the Fraternity is able to provide the nds for the increase in the director's time. Through her Forts, Arrowmont's fame is spreading throughout the aft world, and with the additional efforts of the members Pi Phi, it is spreading to those who would learn more out that world, and its opportunities for service. The scholarships given by the chapters, clubs and provces serve as a firsthand liaison between Arrowmont and embers of the Fraternity. The community of each donat g group is richly served when the scholarship recipient turns to use his or her newly learned skills in philanropic or educational areas. The list of Arrowmont students and staff was divided to provinces and sent to each province officer for distribu-)n to the clubs and chapters. It is hoped that each group ill contact those in its area. This can be a two-fold educa-)n; the student or staff member will learn that Pi Phis in s or her own community are among those responsible for the existence of Arrowmont, and the Pi Phis will learn more about the work done by their contributions. The 1971 annual meeting of the board was held in San Antonio in June. Members of the board met with Grand Council in Gatlinburg in October, 1971, and an interim meeting of the board was held in Gatlinburg in April, 1972. The 1972 annual meeting will be in Gatlinburg in October. Each member of the board has been busy with her responsibilities during the past year. A new manual has been compiled and staff job descriptions have been brought up to date. The requirements for the May L. Keller Award have been rewritten to comply with the I.C. '71 reorganization of the chapter activities. Memorial contributions have been acknowledged by the secretary. Clubs are encouraged to make donations to Settlement School whenever they wish to honor the memory of a Pi Phi or a member of her family. Many alumme not affiliated with alumnae clubs have responded generously to a request for contributions to Arrowmont through the blue envelope mailing by Central Office. The magazine agency showed an increase last year and the contributions made by the Pi Phi owners of the Kansas State Travel Agency continue to increase each year as more Pi Phis make their travel arrangements through them. It's been a year of building firm foundations of organization, and a year of increased understanding of the directions in which our national philanthropy is growing. The support of the members of the Fraternity will continue to be the mainstay of the Arrowcraft Shop and Arrowmont School of Crafts. We hope to make each individual Pi Phi aware of her responsibility and increase her interest as we repeatedly use the slogan MAKE ARROWMONT YOUR FAVORITE PHILANTHROPY. The chairman would like to express her gratitude to each member of the Board of Governors, Grand Council, and the staff in Gatlinburg. It has been a busy and rewarding year in the service of Pi Phi and Arrowmont.

We had 251 clubs and 37 chapters Ring Arrowcraft and the winners in the various categos are announced elsewhere. We had fewer returns of erchandise than before, and in most cases, the clubs and apters are responding to our request to pay their bills omptly after their sales. Although some expansion was ade in the shop a few years ago, we find that we still uld use more space in the sales room as well as in the )ck, shipping, and weaving rooms. There were a few changes in personnel this year. Our ,okkeeper quit at the end of the year, 1971, but we were rtunate in having Nadine Whitted do double duty and )rk with Very! Monhollen in bookkeeping at Arrowcraft, Zile serving as the Administrator's mainstay, and doing the necessary bookkeeping in this office. Nella Hill is weaving designer and manager; Faye Cook and Ruby Watson are in charge of shipping; Gene Hembree and Margie Lamon are in sales. Mrs. Kenny, who worked part time, has left and was replaced by Vickie Ownby, who will work full time in sales. In the maintenance department we have three hard working men who are on the job full time: Neal Watson, Zan-ley Watson, and Ernie Schultz. Ralph Schultz was added to the staff for the summer. All during the year the men are busy painting, making repairs of all kinds, and generally keeping the grounds and buildings in good shape. Our housekeeper and cook, Mrs. Adams, who has been with us for many years, is presently on sick leave and we miss her very much. We are looking forward to the time when she can return. In the meantime, during summer school, we have a corps of cooks under the direction of Mrs. Bogle, the dietitian who has been here several summers. In the housekeeping department, our two regular girls, Helen Vance and Janie Matthews, are being assisted by Paula Bell and Mary Clemons, college girls from Louisiana who came to Gatlinburg looking for summer work. The Barn continues to be a popular place for weekend 20 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 2 retreats for Pi Phi chapters, church groups, and other similar organizations. Bookings have been made already for weekends in the fall. We probably could rent the Barn every weekend, but we do not have enough staff to take care of the necessary maintenance and cleaning. The Barn is set up with 34 beds and 6 rollaway beds. This year we added two beds in Teachers and one bed in Pollard, plus another rollaway in Staff House. This gives us a total of 102 beds for staff, faculty, and students during the summer. In addition, we have two beds in the vacant room in the Administrative office building for Helen and Bob Russell. Helen is giving her time this summer to serve as librarian at Arrowmont. We are looking forward to a successful workshop pro-gram again this summer. So far we have 123 students registered for each of the first two sessions. Most classes are completely filled and we have had to turn some people away for lack of space in classes, or for lack of housing. Our faculty members are outstanding craftsmen as well as being excellent teachers and many have taught here in past years. Once again we will have a fine teacher in Peter Coiling-wood from England, who is a well known authority on weaving. Mr. Collingwood will be here for the first session and will teach Sprang and Advanced Weaving. Marian Heard's excellent guidance as Director continues to make Arrowmont a widely known and well respected craft school. We are fortunate too, in having Sandra Blain as assistant director. Sandy spent last year at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and now has her MFA Degree. She will be at Arrowmont all summer and will return to teaching at the University of Tennessee in the fall. In addition to Marian and Sandy, we have two girls working full time in the office at Arrowmont: Sharon Hus-key and Teresa Coons. During the workshop sessions the are aided by the six graduate assistants who do some offi( work along with many other chores. We have a fine grow of assistants this year. Last March we were host to the NCECA conferen( which drew over 600 people. We did not house this grout but they did use all the rooms at Arrowmont for wort shops and forums. In April we put on a three day wort shop for the Tennessee Arts Commission. This time all or facilities were used to full capacity. In May we housed an fed some thirty-five leaders of the annual Wildflower Pi grimage. The alumni of the College of Home Economics c the University of Tennessee held a forum and luncheon Arrowmont during the craft workshop period. Also durin April, the Board of Governors of Arrowmont held a tw day meeting. We are grateful for the loyal support of our clubs, char ters, and individual Pi Phis. We just wish it were possibi for all Pi Phis to visit their school and to get a real appr( ciation of the work that is done here. True, Gatlinburg ha changed greatly through the years from a small town to busy, bustling community filled with motels and shops c all kinds. This is to be expected since the Park visitol number in the thousands each month, even during the wir ter. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School property is an oasi in the midst of all this and is greatly appreciated by th many people who visit Arrowmont and the Arrowcral Shop,. My grateful thanks to the members of the Grand Cour cil, the Board of Governors, the Central Office staff, an, finally, the wonderful people here who have given me er couragement and their loyal support.

With our $1000.00 donation last summer to the North West Territory Libraries, a Videorecorder was purchased to be used at the Rankin Inlet Library. The Yukon Library System will receive our donation this year and the librarian is interested in providing periodicals in Indian Community drop-in Centres. It is hoped that this will provide the urgently needed contact with the twelve Indian Bands. The final decision on disposition of our donation is, of course, left to the chief librarians of the NWT and Yukon, as only they know where the need is greatest. Since the advent of Canada Loans, our loan fund forstudents in social work in many cases has not been utilize to any extent. The maximum loan was increased from to $300 this year for a trial period to determine if th would make the loan more relevant. When reports are this year we will know if this loan fund has outlived i usefulness and will then consider other directions. Th fund is self-sustaining and we wish to put it to work whe. the need is greatest. We appreciate the loyal support of the many clubs, chaj ters, and individuals who have contributed to our philai thropies. PAT FOSTER WEIR EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE The Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds committee, its purposes and functions, seem to be not as generally understood by the membership as other Fraternity projects. During World War II when Conventions could not be held, money accumulated in the general fund. In 1946 at the Swampscott Convention, it was voted to establish a new fund, to be named in honor of an alumna who had served the Fraternity well as Grand President, Grand Vice President, first chairman of the Settlement School committee, and in other capacities Emma Harper Turner. The fund was to have a dual purpose: (1) to establish a principal fund from which chapters could be granted loans for chap-ter house building or remodeling; and (2) to make grants to Pi Beta Phi alumna` who were in difficult circumstances and in need of special assistance. The money for such grants was to come from the interest paid by chapters on the loans. Over the years the principal fund has been augmented by gifts from clubs, chapters and individuals. The Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds committee in no way enters into the decisions about chapter house loans; it is concerned solely with the granting of "gifts of love" to members in great need. During the twenty-six years since this fund was established, eighty Pi Beta Phi alumnae have been given the help and encouragement which this fund provides. Members of forty-seven chapters have been represented in the roll of recipients, including twenty-eight Golden Arrow members and thirty-five young alumnm. Seventeen of the members receiving help from the fund wore the arrow for sixty years or longer! Grants are of two types: (1) emergency grants, usually a one check gift and ordinarily given only once; and (2) a small monthly check on a continuing basis, as long as the need exists. Emergency grants have usually been given to young alumni faced with almost unbearable burdens an incapacitating operation; the loss of a husband after long and expensive illness, with bills to pay and children to care for; help for the family of two young mothers facing death whose last days were brightened by the knowledge that Pi Beta Phi cared for them. The majority of the monthly checks have been given to older alumnae; several have received help for many years. These older alumnae, perhaps living alone or in nursing homes or being cared for by their families, often have little or no money beyond bare subsistence needs. Our small monthly checks provide them with a little money of theirown for small needs and extras, and give them an indepe: dence and dignity so important to morale. Many have wri ten that the "lift to the spirit," the knowledge that Pi Be Phi still cares about them, has meant as much as the bad needed money. This past year seven alumnae have been receiving gran from this fund on a monthly basis. This is a smaller nur ber than usual, but the money will be available for times the future when there are increased requests. This comm: tee is concerned that perhaps there are alumni who despc ately needed help but are unknown to us. It is hoped th alumnae will be quietly alert for any member who may 1 in need of assistance. The chairman of the committee w always be happy to explain details and procedures. Cauth should always be exercised so that an alumna does n know she has been recommended for a grant; grants a given in confidence and the name of a recipient is nev revealed unless she chooses to do so herself. Also, it mig develop that an alumna recommended to the committee f a grant might for some reason not be eligible, and it wou be cruel to raise her hopes and have her disappointed. Special tribute must be paid to Lucile Carson who i tired in June, 1971, after serving as chairman of t EHTMF for nine years. Her letters to recipients and th( families are masterpieces of compassion, tact, and beau Her guidance and ever present help to the new chairm during the past year has been invaluable and is deeply a preciated. Sally Hunt has also been extremely helpful. It would be easy to project the real meaning of this pry ect if individual histories of recipients could be told, lc that is impossible. Perhaps the true meaning of the Ean Harper Turner Memorial Fund can be conveyed by quoti from a thank you letter written almost twenty-five ye ago by one of the very earliest recipients: ". . How c you expect us to express the inexpressable! So I can of hope that you will be able to interpret this `voiceless lence' of my heart, and read there an unending gratitude my dear Pi Beta Phi sisters for this wonderful gift, whi relieves me from a great weight of anxiety in facing .f calamity which came to me so suddenly. It is indeed mr more than a gift: It is an added inspiration to prove wore of the high ideals of Pi Beta Phi, which link the past a the present with the future in a golden sphere of unbrot friendship."
