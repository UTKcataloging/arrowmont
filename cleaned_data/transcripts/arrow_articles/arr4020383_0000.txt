EMMA HARPER TURNER Believing that the woman whose breadth of vision had glimpsed in the founding of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the opportunity for honoring our founders by the adoption of an altruistic work, educational in nature, on be-half of women less fortunate than ourselves, which would give vital interest and a bond of unison to alumnae all over the country, should have lasting honor for this service, the Twenty-Sixth Biennial Convention of II B cD at Estes Park adopted unanimously the motion that "the name of Emma Harper Turner be made as enduring as. her work by naming in her honor some building or other permanent monument at the Settlement School." When this plan was first conceived, however, it is doubtful whether many, even of those who had long known her work, realized to what an extent the fraternity is indebted to her for many of the things which we are in the habit of taking for granted. Emma Harper Turner was born in Franklin, Ind., which remained her home till her graduation from Franklin College, from which she received the degrees of B. S., M. S. and Mus. B. Emma Harper Turner, Indiana A 384 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI While a member of Indiana A, after winning first honors in the local oratorical contest, Miss Turner was sent to represent her college in the state contest at Indianapolis, in which she was awarded second place. It is as an alumna, however, that Miss Turner has done her most enduring work. Elected Grand vice-president at the Ottumwa convention in 1888 she served as a member of the committee which secured the incorporation of II B 4) as a national college fraternity, and owing to the illness of the Grand President, Mrs. Small, Miss Turner was the presiding officer at the Gales-burg Convention in 1890, at which she was herself elected Grand President. This office she held until the conclusion of the Chicago Convention in 1893, when she refused reelection to become president of the newly organized alumnae department, which office she held for the next four years. In this period also Miss Turner, as the representative of II B (I), served as secretary to the first women's Panhellenic Congress, held in Boston. It is to Miss Turner that we are directly indebted for the seal used on charters, the original province organization, two revisions of the constitution, the form of the initiation ceremony, which has been in use for the past thirty-three years, the installation ceremony, the selection and adoption of the creed, the idea of honoring our founders in the celebration of Founders' Day, the "library bureau," which according to the history of II B (I) was the origin of our "wise, philosophical, after-Christmas bete-noir, fraternity examinations' ", the establishment of the National Alumnae Association, the proposal for the Undergraduate Loan Fund and greatest of all, the idea for the Settlement School, which has proved the greatest incentive and inspiration to the whole fraternity, but most especially to its alumnae department. To choose only one tribute to the work of Miss Turner, from the History of Pi Beta Phi, we quote the following (pp. 82 and 136), "The one monumental result of the convention of 1893 in Chicago was the organization of the National Alumnae Association. This was the result of that strong-willed, indefatigable worker and far-seeing organizer, Emma Harper Turner, and to her is due all the praise and thanks of the fraternity for this strong bulwark of our national power Emma Harper Turner was president of the National Alumnae Association from 1893 to 1897. As she had been its NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 385 inspiration, so likewise during her term of office she was its life, its heart, its soul. She was as untiring in her work as she had been in her work for the general fraternity." For two years following the adoption of the Settlement School idea at the Swarthmore Convention in 1910 Miss Turner served as chairman of the first national Settlement School Committee. To Pi Beta Phis in Washington, D. C., Miss Turner has a very especial appeal, for it was when she came into the government service here, at the same time entering Columbian (now George Washington) University as a special student, that she organized the group of girls who became Columbia A of II B cl). And it is to Miss Turner, as much today as in the past, that we constantly look for constructive suggestions and help, never to be disappointed in our quest. In addition to occupying a position of great responsibility in the U. S. Post Office Department Miss Turner has found time to found in 1907 The College Women's Club of Washington, D. C. and to be one of the four originators of the movement which is today culminating in the building 'in Washington of the National Baptist Memorial, a church erected to "religious liberty, Roger Williams and the Baptist pioneers of America." In this church Miss Turner has organized and is teaching a very large women's Bible class. We feel that she is a woman who is nobly upholding the ideals of II B 1 and we rejoice that the fraternity has taken formal action to do her honor. EMILY MARGARET WHITE VACATION AT GATLINBURG What a great vacation one can .have at Gatlinburg! As Helen, Irene, Mr. Denton and Mr. Mattil drove down the school drive to the "big road" behind Old Blackberry, going to their respective homes and families, we felt a little sad to see so many of the family leaving. No time was there to weep, however. We hurried over to the school house to take down the greens and dismantle the tree that had made the school house look so festive for the Christmas entertainment, just over. Having finished this last reminder of school duties we were free to "vacation" to our hearts content. 386 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PM Then Miss Evelyn, doing the right thing as ever, sent us up to Aunt Liddie's for baskets. Aunt Lyddie has built a new cabin in a hollow back of Preacher Pink Ownby's. It is just one room with no windows and is almost completely filled with her two beds and a couple of chairs. Just enough room is left to "set" in front of the fire.. We had a jolly visit with her as usual and she entertained us with some of her "old time" stories and showed us her spring behind the cabin. As we went out we noticed a ground hog hide hanging on the outer wall. When we asked if she had been hunting she "lowed" if she hadn't someone else had, and added that ground hog hide made the best of shoe strings. The evening was spq.t at the hospital with Roscoe. He was the first patient we had had and we were pretty proud of him and always will count the evenings spent there as among the pleasantest memories of Gatlinburg. He was a jolly little chap and always had a smile for everyone. Sometimes we read him to sleep or told stories. Then we went to the office, drew up our chairs before the fire and cracked nuts or drank G. W. coffee. The days during vacation were wonderful and we took ad-vantage of them to do our Christmas shopping among the bright berries, holly trees, and mistletoe. These we packed and sent off to our homes and friends and decked the cottage until it looked quite gay. Other days, packs on our backs, we followed the creeks and ridges to our heart's content, visiting the houses along the way. When noon came we made a fire in some secluded spot and cooked a delectable lunch. A few days before Christmas we started up Baskins with heavy packs filled beyond their capacity with dolls and drums and toys of all kinds. We were rather apprehensive of thus usurping the role of Santa Claus, but knowing that otherwise many of the children would have no Christmas, took courage and stopped at the first house, which happened to be McCarters'. There were several children the mother had left a short time before and there was only the oldest daughter, Nolo, to look after the family. We left dolls for the girls and marbles for the boys. On leaving the McCarters', we came next to old Peston Ogle's. He answered our knock and asked us in. We sat by the fire for a time while he NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 387 "nursed" the baby and then we gave the two most pathetic kiddies some toys and they were too pleased for words. This ended our journey up the Baskins and we turned to the left and took up the trail over the ridge leading to Cliff Branch. It was a hard climb and we were quite breathless when we reached the top so we stretched out for a rest. It was a typical Gatlinburg ridge, with its great trees standing, stripped of their bark, the ground strewn with trees and branches brought low by the mountain wind and the bright colored galax leaves growing in frequent patches. As we lay there looking up at the blue sky and marvelling at the beauty and wildness of all this we were suddenly startled to our feet by the sound of a twig cracking down the trail. It proved, however, to be merely one of the numerous hounds which grace every home in the mountains. He sniffed at our heels and then loped along down the trail leaving us alone, but the spell had been broken so we loaded our packs and took up the trail which led down to the Cliff Branch. At the first house on the branch we found four little girls. After visiting for a time we found something for each out of our fast diminishing packs and wishing them the usual Merry Christmas again started on our way, little realizing the tragedy which was soon to fall on this secluded little home. Less than two months later the father was taken away in the influenza epidemic and the mother had become insane. After stopping at the four other cabins on the Branch we came out on Roaring Fork, where we cooked our much needed lunch under the shadows of the big cliffs, with the water splashing and trickling down their sides. When we arrived at the cottage with our empty packs we found the nurse's aunt, uncle and cousin, whom we had been expecting for several days. They had finally reached the Burg by the aid of a mule team a ride which, once had, will never be forgotten! Two days later we received the telegrams telling of their coming. Amid such daily events Christmas Eve came quickly. It was Sunday night and after B. Y. P. U. meeting in the half-demolished church house, many of the boys and girls, under the leadership of Mrs. Dowell and Mrs. Steve Whaley, undertook to go a-caroling. This was our first attempt at caroling in Gatlinburg. But what we lacked in harmony was more than made up for in earnestness. 388 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI We set out first of all, for Squire Maples', preceded by the inevitable troop of small boys, the rag-a-muffins of the Burg, who furnished unfitting music on old tin cans. From Squire Maples' we continued our walk around the hospital to surprise Roscoe, then to the cottage, to Mrs. Huff's, to Calvin Ogle's and then last to Mrs. Steve Whaley's where we unwillingly disbanded, each seeking our respective homes, yet loath to leave the bright starlight evening for the comfort of the house. After the caroling we had Roscoe's stocking to fill---a huge one which the nurse had made to draw over the bandage of his hurt leg. Then, too, we placed a small but brightly decorated Christmas tree where he could see it when first he opened his eyes next morning. He had never had a Christmas before and was very skeptical about Santa's coming, so you can imagine his joy when he awoke. Christmas morning we tiptoed down to the living room where Aunt Lizzie had a big fire roaring in the fire place. Here we all made haste to undo the packages from home and friends. Later in the morning we walked down the big road to Martha's with a basket for the children. They were all out when we arrived, so we set the basket inside the door and when they returned they really thought it was Santa Claus who had been there in their absence. Little Kate, who is in the fourth grade, wrote a story for language telling about her Christmas day when Santa Claus had been unable to get to her house during the night but had come the next day when she was out playing. When we returned from Martha's, Mrs. Dowell had a won derful dinner ready for us, turkey, cranberry sauce and all the other extras which spell Chistmas dinner. Just before plum pud ding time, Jim came in laden with ,mail and amid the excitement of opening packages and letters dinner was temporarily forgotten. After Christmas Day was over we had not much to look forward to so decided to have the "party" which had been the main topic of conversation between us during those evenings at the hospital. We sent out ,invitations to all the young people but fate was with us no longer the weather turned bad, the invita tions didn't get around until a day or two after the party and the fifteen or twenty who did come were those whom we were able to see and ask by word of mouth. However, we had a wonderful NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 389 time. It is always rather difficult to get a party started, so we planned a "conversation" game for the first. Each guest was given a little order with five topics on it, to this card was tied a silk bean bag containing 25 beans. Every one went around and filled out the card as tho it were a dance order, asking for a partner for each topic. Each couple had five minutes for each topic and every time one said "yes or no," he had to give his partner a bean. After the game the person having the most beans in his bag received a prize. Needless to say, by the time the game was over there was no danger of having the party drag. Then we played progressive Hearts, had refreshments, and before we knew it it was time for good times to break up for this night. Almost before we realized it the vacation was over and Black-berry was again between the shafts of the old buggy, this time coming up the drive from the big road, bringing back our fellow teachers who, in comparison with ours, we still maintain, had a most stupid holiday. EMILY P. BURTON MARION FOLSOM A VISIT TO LITTLE PIGEON May I tell you informally of my recent visit, the first week of October, to Gatlinburg? Of course when ,,the Committee met in June, we missed seeing School in session. How much nicer it was this time to be there and to see all of those happy, little faces ! You know the most of the mountain children are far prettier and happier looking than are our city ones. It is an unfortunate circumstance which prevents the Committee from meeting during the school term because they miss seeing those children who are so eager to learn that when offered a half holiday, they refuse. Miss Bishop gave those who had been present each day for a month without a tardy mark, and who had good lessons and deportment, a half holiday as a reward. One boy said that he was going to be late as he wanted to learn that much more in that holiday. Now that is a spirit which is typical of them all. That spirit is one of the things that is making our Pi Beta Phi School the success that it is. This year, the Committee with necessary repairs and additions, has provided adequate dormitory space. We rent Miss 390 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Bishop's and Miss Higginbotham's cottage for the boys with Mrs. Roberts, a II , in charge. The Pollard cottage is all finished and is in charge of Mrs. Duf field. It was most gratifying to see the cheerful coziness of the place. The girls had arranged flowers throughout the house. This was not done for my visit as I did not announce the date of my arrival. We have a big room for the girls to sleep in and each one has her own bed, desk and dresser. The dressers were built by the boys in their work shop. The girls draped them in checked pink gingham to match the draperies which they used in both their sleeping quarters and dressing room. Mrs. Duf field is a wonder as she is teaching them to use just what can be bought at the stores in Gatlinbm-g. Each girl has made her own dresses, underwear and kimona. The Stuart Cottage is almost completed and will be equally as nice as the Pollard cottage. It will be filled by Christmas time. The Jennie Nichol Hospital is still and will ever be an important center. Miss Higginbotham has her sister, Mary, to assist her, and neither one of them has time to eat. During the month of August, a dentist offered to run a dental clinic for three weeks. His fees were very modest and he worked from six in the morning until eight at night. Not only did he render a great service to the children but also to the older folks who availed themselves of this wonderful opportunity. The dental chair which was a gift last year certainly was useful again. The Settlement School staff is the same as last year with the exception of two who resigned. We expected to get State aid in domestic science and weaving which we failed to do, so those positions are not filled as yet. Miss Bishop expects to use in the weaving, one of our own graduates who has been away to a higher school to finish up this year. A domestic science teacher will be in Gatlinburg by November 1. This is the best time for her to begin and she will conduct canning and practical things through the summer months. A new barn is being built. It is to be a model for the people of the community to follow and for that reason we are using modern stanchions for the cattle instead of stalls. The plans are modern in every detail although we are leaving out much equip NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 391 anent which we could use but which would be impractical for that community. If only we had more money to meet the needs, it would be wonderful. I do not believe that our fraternity realizes what an opportunity we have to do all that is good for the people up there. A visit to Little Pigeon will show how much every one in that Settlement wants to cooperate and assist, acid you really feel quite badly that you can do no more. It is always a marvel to me how well the staff does' under such difficulties as they have to overcome. While I was up there they were all busy with the Community Fair which has become an annual event of the School. In addition to the grownups' exhibits, the girls were busy getting their dresses and clothing made, and putting up jellies. The boys were finishing their work in the shop and getting their apples, vegetables, pigs and chickens all ready. The pigs fairly shone! I regretted very much that I could not stay another week to witness it all. I cannot close my later before adding just how much the School will miss Dr. Massey and Mrs. Maples. From the beginning these two have given us wise advice and have been ever ready to aid us in whatever cause we needed them. Their going on to their everlasting Home of course was for the best, but the School will suffer as will all of those who loved them so dearly. Cordially yours, NITA HILL STARK (MRS. J. LUTCHER, JR.) Chairman. IN MEMORIAM CABEEN, (MRS. J. D.) MARY CHASE CHAMBERLAIN, Illinois Z, and infant son died in Galesburg, Ill., on September 21, 1923. Mrs. Cabeen before entering the University of Illinois had lived and attended school in Topeka, Kan. Since her marriage in 1910 she has been a resident of Galesburg, Illinois, and a member of the Alumae Association there. Surviving her are her husband and two children: Rebecca Mary, eight years old, and Robert, five. Her loss will be especially felt by the active chapter at Galesburg, to whom she was a warm friend and adviser.

The dressers were built by the boys in their work shop. The girls draped them in checked pink gingham to match the draperies which they used in both their sleeping quarters and dressing room.

        386 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PM Then Miss Evelyn, doing the right thing as ever, sent us up to Aunt Liddie's for baskets. Aunt Lyddie has built a new cabin in a hollow back of Preacher Pink Ownby's. It is just one room with no windows and is almost completely filled with her two beds and a couple of chairs. Just enough room is left to "set" in front of the fire.. We had a jolly visit with her as usual and she entertained us with some of her "old time" stories and showed us her spring behind the cabin. As we went out we noticed a ground hog hide hanging on the outer wall. When we asked if she had been hunting she "lowed" if she hadn't someone else had, and added that ground hog hide made the best of shoe strings. The evening was spq.t at the hospital with Roscoe. He was the first patient we had had and we were pretty proud of him and always will count the evenings spent there as among the pleasantest memories of Gatlinburg. He was a jolly little chap and always had a smile for everyone. Sometimes we read him to sleep or told stories. Then we went to the office, drew up our chairs before the fire and cracked nuts or drank G. W. coffee. The days during vacation were wonderful and we took ad-vantage of them to do our Christmas shopping among the bright berries, holly trees, and mistletoe. These we packed and sent off to our homes and friends and decked the cottage until it looked quite gay. Other days, packs on our backs, we followed the creeks and ridges to our heart's content, visiting the houses along the way. When noon came we made a fire in some secluded spot and cooked a delectable lunch. A few days before Christmas we started up Baskins with heavy packs filled beyond their capacity with dolls and drums and toys of all kinds. We were rather apprehensive of thus usurping the role of Santa Claus, but knowing that otherwise many of the children would have no Christmas, took courage and stopped at the first house, which happened to be McCarters'. There were several children the mother had left a short time before and there was only the oldest daughter, Nolo, to look after the family. We left dolls for the girls and marbles for the boys. On leaving the McCarters', we came next to old Peston Ogle's. He answered our knock and asked us in. We sat by the fire for a time while he NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 387 "nursed" the baby and then we gave the two most pathetic kiddies some toys and they were too pleased for words. This ended our journey up the Baskins and we turned to the left and took up the trail over the ridge leading to Cliff Branch. It was a hard climb and we were quite breathless when we reached the top so we stretched out for a rest. It was a typical Gatlinburg ridge, with its great trees standing, stripped of their bark, the ground strewn with trees and branches brought low by the mountain wind and the bright colored galax leaves growing in frequent patches. As we lay there looking up at the blue sky and marvelling at the beauty and wildness of all this we were suddenly startled to our feet by the sound of a twig cracking down the trail. It proved, however, to be merely one of the numerous hounds which grace every home in the mountains. He sniffed at our heels and then loped along down the trail leaving us alone, but the spell had been broken so we loaded our packs and took up the trail which led down to the Cliff Branch. At the first house on the branch we found four little girls. After visiting for a time we found something for each out of our fast diminishing packs and wishing them the usual Merry Christmas again started on our way, little realizing the tragedy which was soon to fall on this secluded little home. Less than two months later the father was taken away in the influenza epidemic and the mother had become insane. After stopping at the four other cabins on the Branch we came out on Roaring Fork, where we cooked our much needed lunch under the shadows of the big cliffs, with the water splashing and trickling down their sides. When we arrived at the cottage with our empty packs we found the nurse's aunt, uncle and cousin, whom we had been expecting for several days. They had finally reached the Burg by the aid of a mule team a ride which, once had, will never be forgotten! Two days later we received the telegrams telling of their coming. Amid such daily events Christmas Eve came quickly. It was Sunday night and after B. Y. P. U. meeting in the half-demolished church house, many of the boys and girls, under the leadership of Mrs. Dowell and Mrs. Steve Whaley, undertook to go a-caroling. This was our first attempt at caroling in Gatlinburg. But what we lacked in harmony was more than made up for in earnestness. 388 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI We set out first of all, for Squire Maples', preceded by the inevitable troop of small boys, the rag-a-muffins of the Burg, who furnished unfitting music on old tin cans. From Squire Maples' we continued our walk around the hospital to surprise Roscoe, then to the cottage, to Mrs. Huff's, to Calvin Ogle's and then last to Mrs. Steve Whaley's where we unwillingly disbanded, each seeking our respective homes, yet loath to leave the bright starlight evening for the comfort of the house. After the caroling we had Roscoe's stocking to fill---a huge one which the nurse had made to draw over the bandage of his hurt leg. Then, too, we placed a small but brightly decorated Christmas tree where he could see it when first he opened his eyes next morning. He had never had a Christmas before and was very skeptical about Santa's coming, so you can imagine his joy when he awoke. Christmas morning we tiptoed down to the living room where Aunt Lizzie had a big fire roaring in the fire place. Here we all made haste to undo the packages from home and friends. Later in the morning we walked down the big road to Martha's with a basket for the children. They were all out when we arrived, so we set the basket inside the door and when they returned they really thought it was Santa Claus who had been there in their absence. Little Kate, who is in the fourth grade, wrote a story for language telling about her Christmas day when Santa Claus had been unable to get to her house during the night but had come the next day when she was out playing. When we returned from Martha's, Mrs. Dowell had a won derful dinner ready for us, turkey, cranberry sauce and all the other extras which spell Chistmas dinner. Just before plum pud ding time, Jim came in laden with ,mail and amid the excitement of opening packages and letters dinner was temporarily forgotten. After Christmas Day was over we had not much to look forward to so decided to have the "party" which had been the main topic of conversation between us during those evenings at the hospital. We sent out ,invitations to all the young people but fate was with us no longer the weather turned bad, the invita tions didn't get around until a day or two after the party and the fifteen or twenty who did come were those whom we were able to see and ask by word of mouth. However, we had a wonderful NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 389 time. It is always rather difficult to get a party started, so we planned a "conversation" game for the first. Each guest was given a little order with five topics on it, to this card was tied a silk bean bag containing 25 beans. Every one went around and filled out the card as tho it were a dance order, asking for a partner for each topic. Each couple had five minutes for each topic and every time one said "yes or no," he had to give his partner a bean. After the game the person having the most beans in his bag received a prize. Needless to say, by the time the game was over there was no danger of having the party drag. Then we played progressive Hearts, had refreshments, and before we knew it it was time for good times to break up for this night. Almost before we realized it the vacation was over and Black-berry was again between the shafts of the old buggy, this time coming up the drive from the big road, bringing back our fellow teachers who, in comparison with ours, we still maintain, had a most stupid holiday. EMILY P. BURTON MARION FOLSOM A VISIT TO LITTLE PIGEON May I tell you informally of my recent visit, the first week of October, to Gatlinburg? Of course when ,,the Committee met in June, we missed seeing School in session. How much nicer it was this time to be there and to see all of those happy, little faces ! You know the most of the mountain children are far prettier and happier looking than are our city ones. It is an unfortunate circumstance which prevents the Committee from meeting during the school term because they miss seeing those children who are so eager to learn that when offered a half holiday, they refuse. Miss Bishop gave those who had been present each day for a month without a tardy mark, and who had good lessons and deportment, a half holiday as a reward. One boy said that he was going to be late as he wanted to learn that much more in that holiday. Now that is a spirit which is typical of them all. That spirit is one of the things that is making our Pi Beta Phi School the success that it is. This year, the Committee with necessary repairs and additions, has provided adequate dormitory space. We rent Miss 390 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Bishop's and Miss Higginbotham's cottage for the boys with Mrs. Roberts, a II , in charge.

EMMA HARPER TURNER Believing that the woman whose breadth of vision had glimpsed in the founding of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School the opportunity for honoring our founders by the adoption of an altruistic work, educational in nature, on be-half of women less fortunate than ourselves, which would give vital interest and a bond of unison to alumnae all over the country, should have lasting honor for this service, the Twenty-Sixth Biennial Convention of II B cD at Estes Park adopted unanimously the motion that "the name of Emma Harper Turner be made as enduring as. her work by naming in her honor some building or other permanent monument at the Settlement School." When this plan was first conceived, however, it is doubtful whether many, even of those who had long known her work, realized to what an extent the fraternity is indebted to her for many of the things which we are in the habit of taking for granted.

Emma Harper Turner, Indiana A 384 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI While a member of Indiana A, after winning first honors in the local oratorical contest, Miss Turner was sent to represent her college in the state contest at Indianapolis, in which she was awarded second place.

Elected Grand vice-president at the Ottumwa convention in 1888 she served as a member of the committee which secured the incorporation of II B 4) as a national college fraternity, and owing to the illness of the Grand President, Mrs. Small, Miss Turner was the presiding officer at the Gales-burg Convention in 1890, at which she was herself elected Grand President. This office she held until the conclusion of the Chicago Convention in 1893, when she refused reelection to become president of the newly organized alumnae department, which office she held for the next four years. In this period also Miss Turner, as the representative of II B (I), served as secretary to the first women's Panhellenic Congress, held in Boston. It is to Miss Turner that we are directly indebted for the seal used on charters, the original province organization, two revisions of the constitution, the form of the initiation ceremony, which has been in use for the past thirty-three years, the installation ceremony, the selection and adoption of the creed, the idea of honoring our founders in the celebration of Founders' Day, the "library bureau," which according to the history of II B (I) was the origin of our "wise, philosophical, after-Christmas bete-noir, fraternity examinations' ", the establishment of the National Alumnae Association, the proposal for the Undergraduate Loan Fund and greatest of all, the idea for the Settlement School, which has proved the greatest incentive and inspiration to the whole fraternity, but most especially to its alumnae department. To choose only one tribute to the work of Miss Turner, from the History of Pi Beta Phi, we quote the following (pp. 82 and 136), "The one monumental result of the convention of 1893 in Chicago was the organization of the National Alumnae Association. This was the result of that strong-willed, indefatigable worker and far-seeing organizer, Emma Harper Turner, and to her is due all the praise and thanks of the fraternity for this strong bulwark of our national power Emma Harper Turner was president of the National Alumnae Association from 1893 to 1897. As she had been its NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 385 inspiration, so likewise during her term of office she was its life, its heart, its soul. She was as untiring in her work as she had been in her work for the general fraternity." For two years following the adoption of the Settlement School idea at the Swarthmore Convention in 1910 Miss Turner served as chairman of the first national Settlement School Committee. To Pi Beta Phis in Washington, D. C., Miss Turner has a very especial appeal, for it was when she came into the government service here, at the same time entering Columbian (now George Washington) University as a special student, that she organized the group of girls who became Columbia A of II B cl). And it is to Miss Turner, as much today as in the past, that we constantly look for constructive suggestions and help, never to be disappointed in our quest. In addition to occupying a position of great responsibility in the U. S. Post Office Department Miss Turner has found time to found in 1907 The College Women's Club of Washington, D. C. and to be one of the four originators of the movement which is today culminating in the building 'in Washington of the National Baptist Memorial, a church erected to "religious liberty, Roger Williams and the Baptist pioneers of America." In this church Miss Turner has organized and is teaching a very large women's Bible class. We feel that she is a woman who is nobly upholding the ideals of II B 1 and we rejoice that the fraternity has taken formal action to do her honor. EMILY MARGARET WHITE VACATION AT GATLINBURG What a great vacation one can .have at Gatlinburg! As Helen, Irene, Mr. Denton and Mr. Mattil drove down the school drive to the "big road" behind Old Blackberry, going to their respective homes and families, we felt a little sad to see so many of the family leaving. No time was there to weep, however. We hurried over to the school house to take down the greens and dismantle the tree that had made the school house look so festive for the Christmas entertainment, just over. Having finished this last reminder of school duties we were free to "vacation" to our hearts content. 386 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PM Then Miss Evelyn, doing the right thing as ever, sent us up to Aunt Liddie's for baskets. Aunt Lyddie has built a new cabin in a hollow back of Preacher Pink Ownby's. It is just one room with no windows and is almost completely filled with her two beds and a couple of chairs. Just enough room is left to "set" in front of the fire.. We had a jolly visit with her as usual and she entertained us with some of her "old time" stories and showed us her spring behind the cabin. As we went out we noticed a ground hog hide hanging on the outer wall. When we asked if she had been hunting she "lowed" if she hadn't someone else had, and added that ground hog hide made the best of shoe strings. The evening was spq.t at the hospital with Roscoe. He was the first patient we had had and we were pretty proud of him and always will count the evenings spent there as among the pleasantest memories of Gatlinburg. He was a jolly little chap and always had a smile for everyone. Sometimes we read him to sleep or told stories. Then we went to the office, drew up our chairs before the fire and cracked nuts or drank G. W. coffee. The days during vacation were wonderful and we took ad-vantage of them to do our Christmas shopping among the bright berries, holly trees, and mistletoe. These we packed and sent off to our homes and friends and decked the cottage until it looked quite gay. Other days, packs on our backs, we followed the creeks and ridges to our heart's content, visiting the houses along the way. When noon came we made a fire in some secluded spot and cooked a delectable lunch. A few days before Christmas we started up Baskins with heavy packs filled beyond their capacity with dolls and drums and toys of all kinds. We were rather apprehensive of thus usurping the role of Santa Claus, but knowing that otherwise many of the children would have no Christmas, took courage and stopped at the first house, which happened to be McCarters'. There were several children the mother had left a short time before and there was only the oldest daughter, Nolo, to look after the family. We left dolls for the girls and marbles for the boys. On leaving the McCarters', we came next to old Peston Ogle's. He answered our knock and asked us in. We sat by the fire for a time while he NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 387 "nursed" the baby and then we gave the two most pathetic kiddies some toys and they were too pleased for words. This ended our journey up the Baskins and we turned to the left and took up the trail over the ridge leading to Cliff Branch. It was a hard climb and we were quite breathless when we reached the top so we stretched out for a rest. It was a typical Gatlinburg ridge, with its great trees standing, stripped of their bark, the ground strewn with trees and branches brought low by the mountain wind and the bright colored galax leaves growing in frequent patches. As we lay there looking up at the blue sky and marvelling at the beauty and wildness of all this we were suddenly startled to our feet by the sound of a twig cracking down the trail. It proved, however, to be merely one of the numerous hounds which grace every home in the mountains. He sniffed at our heels and then loped along down the trail leaving us alone, but the spell had been broken so we loaded our packs and took up the trail which led down to the Cliff Branch. At the first house on the branch we found four little girls. After visiting for a time we found something for each out of our fast diminishing packs and wishing them the usual Merry Christmas again started on our way, little realizing the tragedy which was soon to fall on this secluded little home. Less than two months later the father was taken away in the influenza epidemic and the mother had become insane. After stopping at the four other cabins on the Branch we came out on Roaring Fork, where we cooked our much needed lunch under the shadows of the big cliffs, with the water splashing and trickling down their sides. When we arrived at the cottage with our empty packs we found the nurse's aunt, uncle and cousin, whom we had been expecting for several days. They had finally reached the Burg by the aid of a mule team a ride which, once had, will never be forgotten! Two days later we received the telegrams telling of their coming. Amid such daily events Christmas Eve came quickly. It was Sunday night and after B. Y. P. U. meeting in the half-demolished church house, many of the boys and girls, under the leadership of Mrs. Dowell and Mrs. Steve Whaley, undertook to go a-caroling. This was our first attempt at caroling in Gatlinburg. But what we lacked in harmony was more than made up for in earnestness. 388 THE ARROW Or PI BETA PHI We set out first of all, for Squire Maples', preceded by the inevitable troop of small boys, the rag-a-muffins of the Burg, who furnished unfitting music on old tin cans. From Squire Maples' we continued our walk around the hospital to surprise Roscoe, then to the cottage, to Mrs. Huff's, to Calvin Ogle's and then last to Mrs. Steve Whaley's where we unwillingly disbanded, each seeking our respective homes, yet loath to leave the bright starlight evening for the comfort of the house. After the caroling we had Roscoe's stocking to fill---a huge one which the nurse had made to draw over the bandage of his hurt leg. Then, too, we placed a small but brightly decorated Christmas tree where he could see it when first he opened his eyes next morning. He had never had a Christmas before and was very skeptical about Santa's coming, so you can imagine his joy when he awoke. Christmas morning we tiptoed down to the living room where Aunt Lizzie had a big fire roaring in the fire place. Here we all made haste to undo the packages from home and friends. Later in the morning we walked down the big road to Martha's with a basket for the children. They were all out when we arrived, so we set the basket inside the door and when they returned they really thought it was Santa Claus who had been there in their absence. Little Kate, who is in the fourth grade, wrote a story for language telling about her Christmas day when Santa Claus had been unable to get to her house during the night but had come the next day when she was out playing. When we returned from Martha's, Mrs. Dowell had a won derful dinner ready for us, turkey, cranberry sauce and all the other extras which spell Chistmas dinner. Just before plum pud ding time, Jim came in laden with ,mail and amid the excitement of opening packages and letters dinner was temporarily forgotten. After Christmas Day was over we had not much to look forward to so decided to have the "party" which had been the main topic of conversation between us during those evenings at the hospital. We sent out ,invitations to all the young people but fate was with us no longer the weather turned bad, the invita tions didn't get around until a day or two after the party and the fifteen or twenty who did come were those whom we were able to see and ask by word of mouth. However, we had a wonderful NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 389 time. It is always rather difficult to get a party started, so we planned a "conversation" game for the first. Each guest was given a little order with five topics on it, to this card was tied a silk bean bag containing 25 beans. Every one went around and filled out the card as tho it were a dance order, asking for a partner for each topic. Each couple had five minutes for each topic and every time one said "yes or no," he had to give his partner a bean. After the game the person having the most beans in his bag received a prize. Needless to say, by the time the game was over there was no danger of having the party drag. Then we played progressive Hearts, had refreshments, and before we knew it it was time for good times to break up for this night. Almost before we realized it the vacation was over and Black-berry was again between the shafts of the old buggy, this time coming up the drive from the big road, bringing back our fellow teachers who, in comparison with ours, we still maintain, had a most stupid holiday. EMILY P. BURTON MARION FOLSOM A VISIT TO LITTLE PIGEON May I tell you informally of my recent visit, the first week of October, to Gatlinburg? Of course when ,,the Committee met in June, we missed seeing School in session. How much nicer it was this time to be there and to see all of those happy, little faces ! You know the most of the mountain children are far prettier and happier looking than are our city ones. It is an unfortunate circumstance which prevents the Committee from meeting during the school term because they miss seeing those children who are so eager to learn that when offered a half holiday, they refuse. Miss Bishop gave those who had been present each day for a month without a tardy mark, and who had good lessons and deportment, a half holiday as a reward. One boy said that he was going to be late as he wanted to learn that much more in that holiday. Now that is a spirit which is typical of them all. That spirit is one of the things that is making our Pi Beta Phi School the success that it is. This year, the Committee with necessary repairs and additions, has provided adequate dormitory space. We rent Miss 390 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Bishop's and Miss Higginbotham's cottage for the boys with Mrs. Roberts, a II , in charge. The Pollard cottage is all finished and is in charge of Mrs. Duf field. It was most gratifying to see the cheerful coziness of the place. The girls had arranged flowers throughout the house. This was not done for my visit as I did not announce the date of my arrival. We have a big room for the girls to sleep in and each one has her own bed, desk and dresser. The dressers were built by the boys in their work shop. The girls draped them in checked pink gingham to match the draperies which they used in both their sleeping quarters and dressing room. Mrs. Duf field is a wonder as she is teaching them to use just what can be bought at the stores in Gatlinbm-g. Each girl has made her own dresses, underwear and kimona. The Stuart Cottage is almost completed and will be equally as nice as the Pollard cottage. It will be filled by Christmas time. The Jennie Nichol Hospital is still and will ever be an important center. Miss Higginbotham has her sister, Mary, to assist her, and neither one of them has time to eat. During the month of August, a dentist offered to run a dental clinic for three weeks. His fees were very modest and he worked from six in the morning until eight at night. Not only did he render a great service to the children but also to the older folks who availed themselves of this wonderful opportunity. The dental chair which was a gift last year certainly was useful again. The Settlement School staff is the same as last year with the exception of two who resigned. We expected to get State aid in domestic science and weaving which we failed to do, so those positions are not filled as yet. Miss Bishop expects to use in the weaving, one of our own graduates who has been away to a higher school to finish up this year. A domestic science teacher will be in Gatlinburg by November 1. This is the best time for her to begin and she will conduct canning and practical things through the summer months. A new barn is being built. It is to be a model for the people of the community to follow and for that reason we are using modern stanchions for the cattle instead of stalls. The plans are modern in every detail although we are leaving out much equip NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 391 anent which we could use but which would be impractical for that community. If only we had more money to meet the needs, it would be wonderful. I do not believe that our fraternity realizes what an opportunity we have to do all that is good for the people up there. A visit to Little Pigeon will show how much every one in that Settlement wants to cooperate and assist, acid you really feel quite badly that you can do no more. It is always a marvel to me how well the staff does' under such difficulties as they have to overcome. While I was up there they were all busy with the Community Fair which has become an annual event of the School. In addition to the grownups' exhibits, the girls were busy getting their dresses and clothing made, and putting up jellies. The boys were finishing their work in the shop and getting their apples, vegetables, pigs and chickens all ready. The pigs fairly shone! I regretted very much that I could not stay another week to witness it all. I cannot close my later before adding just how much the School will miss Dr. Massey and Mrs. Maples. From the beginning these two have given us wise advice and have been ever ready to aid us in whatever cause we needed them. Their going on to their everlasting Home of course was for the best, but the School will suffer as will all of those who loved them so dearly. Cordially yours, NITA HILL STARK (MRS. J. LUTCHER, JR.) Chairman. IN MEMORIAM CABEEN, (MRS. J. D.) MARY CHASE CHAMBERLAIN, Illinois Z, and infant son died in Galesburg, Ill., on September 21, 1923.
