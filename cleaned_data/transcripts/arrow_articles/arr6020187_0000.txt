Hunter College, the Bronx, N.Y., in February of this year became a training school for WAVES, SPARS, and Marines. In Navy slang we are in "Boot Camp" learning to march, being instructed in the background, workings, and customs of the organization of which we are proud to be a part. We must forget our civilian habits and take on new ones overnight, those of a service much older and wiser than we.

"All Hands Hit The Deck" and off we march to another full day. From here we are sent to Specialized Schools and then comes the happy day when we actually make use of all the training we have had. It is a little like being back in college, but the discipline is much stricter than any our good advisors ever imposed.

It is a wonderful feeling to be able to say the Coast Guard Semper Paratus, Always Ready! 99 NEWS F OM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by BETH LERoY, Massachusetts A The opening of school is always an exciting event and the opening of the Pi Beta Phi school this fall brought with it several interesting developments. In the first place it marked the transition of the basic program and the financial responsibility of both elementary and High Schools to Sevier County. It signified a growth of civic consciousness that the community could now assume, and pridefully, its rightful share in the training and education of its youth. It emphasized anew the sound principles of participation which have undergirded our Settlement School since its inception and it has served as a new milestone in our progress. Excerpts from a letter from Agnes Spring, "ad interim" Director, give some absorbing and vivid word pictures. "The first day of school the campus looked like a technicolor movie when the rays of the sunlight drifted through the clouds, down to the broad expanse of green in front of the school. The children stood in groups in gay colored dresses and sweaters, the corn in the garden contrasted with the long row of brilliant zinnias." "The bells were not working the first day, so Ben got some storage batteries. I gave Mr. Husky the dinner bell so that he could call the classes to order. I'm mentioning this as the children didn't know what it meant and kept insisting that the bell had not rung so we've progressed from the days of the handbell to the electric buzzer." "Monday we had our first military drill. A man named Mays, just back from a medical discharge from the Army, is giving the boys military drill, upon Mr. Fleming's invitation. They seem interested in it." "The first chapel or assembly on Tuesday morning, September 6, was a real inspiration. Margery won the laurels in applause. (She led the singing.) How they all love her! But then, as she says, she `borned most of them.' " "The High School is down in registration, due chiefly to the fact that the boys and girls have taken jobs and the eighteen year olds have been called into service. We have 85 in High School, but the elementary school is crowded and then some! In Assembly about 30 children were standing along the side of the room. Some ofthe primary grades have as high as 51 pupils. It is quite wonderful that they have been able to get enough teachers to keep the grades going !" Then she added a note which proves that although progress is maintained in the school, just outside is the same vast wilderness. "Four children going home from school last week met an `old b'ar and her cubs.' The children came way back to the Assembly grounds and waited until their father came to look for them. A bear also killed a pig on the road not far from Charlie Ogle's store. Someone shot him and he was found dead the next morning in the swimming pool in Little Pigeon. A man, who lives within the Park borders, is out on $1,000 bond for killing a bear that killed his pigs and chick-ens and bit his cow's ear off. He has been ordered to move out of the Park. A queer world! I thought the bears had been around here the first morning of school when I went to the Elementary Building. We had had rain the night before and the steps were from our own bare-footed school youngsters! "At Assembly for the Elementary School, 29 children received certificates for vacation reading. They belong to the `Wings over America' Club, sponsored by the state school library system. The children receive stars and ranks for the number of books they read. The certificates were made on our school mimeograph." When the court met in executive session last April to vote upon the question of taking over the Pi Beta Phi school every citizen in Gatlin-burg who was available hastened to the Court-house in Sevierville to witness the proceedings and to take part if it were necessary in promoting the idea. There were many who, both individually and in groups, later told the School Committee what happened and who also gave warm support to the work which Pi Beta Phi has done for over thirty years for their mountain community. Mary L. Owenby, our Mary L., has written how she has felt toward our School and what it has meant to her family. "I just want to tell you what the Gatlinburg School has done for our country. To start with, it is, the best thing that 187 THE DECEMBER ARROW ever came into our country. We diden't have eny school worth enything. You no your self it was just one little roomed house and not very meny in school and now it is a large school and good bildens and another grand thing is the Arrow-craft Shop. Just think of the work that it gives the people and before the school started here we dident have enything to work at only farming. I made a very few chairs and sold them to the people around in the community at .50ct each, made two chairs and took them to Gatlinburg for some one. They said to me why dont you take one of them up to the school and said you probly could sell some there I done what they said I took one up there Miss Evelyn Bishop was there at that time She said yes I will take some chairs she said to make 6 and she would give me $1.50 each for them and I made them and took them in She ordered 12 and from then on it was all I could make you no I thought I was flying getting $1.50 ct in sted of just 50 ct I made chairs for several years and went to weaving I have ben weaving 14 years I make good at the weaving I am living very well I have plenty to eat and ware and have very good cabin to live in and have 2 good cows and have got some money I dident have eny thing before the school came to Gatlinburg I will tell you a little about how I lived before the school started in Gatlinburg I lived hard we ate what we made on the farm all But our flower we cant make much wheet here we had to buy our flower I would save all the flower sacks and color them to make close for my children to ware to school I dident have enything to buy with and while that is the case there was lots of others in the same fix but I dont guess you could get them to tell you that and another thing they wasent very meny lived in Gatlinburg just a few Char-lie Ogle's store was just a little one room bilding and now it is a ten room bilding if that school hadent started up there it would have always ben just like it was I would like to no what could have ben more help to our country than the school I cant say enough good things about it I had better stop." This sincere and spontaneous outpouring of appreciation and gratitude for the help which the Pi Beta Phi SchoOl has been and still is, to Mary L. and her family in inspiration, education of her children, and in helping her to economic independence, found its counterpart in those April days in the hearts of hundreds of mountain people who wended their way to the court-house in Sevierville to signify their willingness to use their resources to the limit in order that Pi. Beta Phi might continue its services to the community through different channels. That the transition of responsibility for f school program was successfully made, was d to the confidence of the community in the co tinuous progress of Pi Beta Phi's triple progra of health, education and economic independen through Arrowcraft over a long period of ye and its faith in the chairman of the Settlemc School Committee, Mrs. Ethel Copp and t 36,000 Pi Beta Phi women whom she rep sented. Many minor adjustments which ml be made during the next year depend upon t] same mutual understanding and mutual : tegrity.

The largest number working in any one year is 106, the smallest number, 93. Aunt Lizzie Reagan, now aged 85, is our oldest weaver, and her daughter and grand-daughter have woven for Arrowcraft, "How do you raise money to pay your preacher ?" I asked Mrs. Steve Whaley. "Do you have teas, suppers, bridge parties and rummage sales ?" "0, no," was Mrs. Whaley's answer, "We have suppers and teas and rummage sales for the Parent Teacher Association, but for our church we SACRIFICE." Several boys were on the playground one hot summer afternoon. A member of Committee asked Mr. Fleming if there were generally more boys there at that time of the day. "0, yes," he said, "Generally there are many more, but after all, it isn't the number of boys who are on the playground at a given time, it is the `QUALITY of the CONTACT' that counts." "What is the quality of my contact with the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School ?" is a question that every sorority sister should ask herself this coming year. Then, too, "Am I doing all I can to help?" A Few Words for the Arrow "I would like to say that the School has meant everything to Gatlinburg. It has sent boys and girls out from high school into college who will make great men and women. It has furnished employment for countless numbers of men and women who otherwise would not have had the opportunity to earn all they have.

Aunt Lizzie Reagan, now aged 85, is our oldest weaver, and her daughter and grand-daughter have woven for Arrowcraft, "How do you raise money to pay your preacher ?" I asked Mrs. Steve Whaley. "Do you have teas, suppers, bridge parties and rummage sales ?" "0, no," was Mrs. Whaley's answer, "We have suppers and teas and rummage sales for the Parent Teacher Association, but for our church we SACRIFICE." Several boys were on the playground one hot summer afternoon. A member of Committee asked Mr. Fleming if there were generally more boys there at that time of the day. "0, yes," he said, "Generally there are many more, but after all, it isn't the number of boys who are on the playground at a given time, it is the `QUALITY of the CONTACT' that counts." "What is the quality of my contact with the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School ?" is a question that every sorority sister should ask herself this coming year. Then, too, "Am I doing all I can to help?" A Few Words for the Arrow "I would like to say that the School has meant everything to Gatlinburg. It has sent boys and girls out from high school into college who will make great men and women.

Mr. Lincoln's Wife, Farrar and Rinehart,. 406 pp. Anne Colver's book comprising a factual, coupled with fictional, account of the intimate and daily life of Abraham Lincoln's wife is enlightening and stimulating reading. Like the wife of another great president, Andrew Jackson, Mary Todd Lincoln suffered more than her share of abuse and public malignment. Her ambition, innate and long-nourished, partially thwarted the lives of her husband and even her children. But underneath her explosive exterior her heart was warm and understanding. Often, similar to Miss Mitchell's incomparable Scarlett O'Hara, Mary Lincoln lived the philosophy of putting off presenting difficulties "until tomorrow." Under the author's smooth and sympathetic pen, the book's principal character becomes not a heroine, but a person any of us might know, replete with mistakes, good intentions, impatience, tenderness, and moments of happiness and disillusion. Mary's oldest sister, Elizabeth Edwards once said, "Precious few persons are cut out to be happy and unless I miss my guess Mary's not one of them." Undoubtedly fate played an undeniable part in her life and in the end she was a woman who had never entirely attained her goal. She was attracted to tall, lanky, serious-minded Abraham Lincoln from the outset she loved him throughout their stormy marital career. But always between them was a barrier a gulf that remained unsurmountable. It was she who urged him to run for Congress and later for the Senate against Stephen A. Douglas. It was she who encouraged him to accept the presidential nomination. During her sojourn in the White House, she was accused of being a spy, and her mode of dress was ridiculed in current periodicals. Her philanthropic activities in nursing the wounded and her vital interest in the problem of negro education were overlooked. Being a southerner from Lexington, Kentucky, she was termed a spy. She lost three brothers in the Civil War. She had few friends even her own sisters did not understand her. The book is peopled with the great and neargreat of the turbulent, stormy "war between states era." It presents a glowing, grapi though sympathy-provoking account of a c man who meant well, but whose own persona: and jumbled emotions precluded her reach life's fruition.

It is a wonderful feeling to be able to say the Coast Guard Semper Paratus, Always Ready! 99 NEWS F OM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by BETH LERoY, Massachusetts A The opening of school is always an exciting event and the opening of the Pi Beta Phi school this fall brought with it several interesting developments. In the first place it marked the transition of the basic program and the financial responsibility of both elementary and High Schools to Sevier County. It signified a growth of civic consciousness that the community could now assume, and pridefully, its rightful share in the training and education of its youth. It emphasized anew the sound principles of participation which have undergirded our Settlement School since its inception and it has served as a new milestone in our progress. Excerpts from a letter from Agnes Spring, "ad interim" Director, give some absorbing and vivid word pictures. "The first day of school the campus looked like a technicolor movie when the rays of the sunlight drifted through the clouds, down to the broad expanse of green in front of the school. The children stood in groups in gay colored dresses and sweaters, the corn in the garden contrasted with the long row of brilliant zinnias." "The bells were not working the first day, so Ben got some storage batteries. I gave Mr. Husky the dinner bell so that he could call the classes to order. I'm mentioning this as the children didn't know what it meant and kept insisting that the bell had not rung so we've progressed from the days of the handbell to the electric buzzer." "Monday we had our first military drill. A man named Mays, just back from a medical discharge from the Army, is giving the boys military drill, upon Mr. Fleming's invitation. They seem interested in it." "The first chapel or assembly on Tuesday morning, September 6, was a real inspiration. Margery won the laurels in applause. (She led the singing.) How they all love her! But then, as she says, she `borned most of them.' " "The High School is down in registration, due chiefly to the fact that the boys and girls have taken jobs and the eighteen year olds have been called into service. We have 85 in High School, but the elementary school is crowded and then some! In Assembly about 30 children were standing along the side of the room. Some ofthe primary grades have as high as 51 pupils. It is quite wonderful that they have been able to get enough teachers to keep the grades going !" Then she added a note which proves that although progress is maintained in the school, just outside is the same vast wilderness. "Four children going home from school last week met an `old b'ar and her cubs.' The children came way back to the Assembly grounds and waited until their father came to look for them. A bear also killed a pig on the road not far from Charlie Ogle's store. Someone shot him and he was found dead the next morning in the swimming pool in Little Pigeon. A man, who lives within the Park borders, is out on $1,000 bond for killing a bear that killed his pigs and chick-ens and bit his cow's ear off. He has been ordered to move out of the Park. A queer world! I thought the bears had been around here the first morning of school when I went to the Elementary Building. We had had rain the night before and the steps were from our own bare-footed school youngsters! "At Assembly for the Elementary School, 29 children received certificates for vacation reading. They belong to the `Wings over America' Club, sponsored by the state school library system. The children receive stars and ranks for the number of books they read. The certificates were made on our school mimeograph." When the court met in executive session last April to vote upon the question of taking over the Pi Beta Phi school every citizen in Gatlin-burg who was available hastened to the Court-house in Sevierville to witness the proceedings and to take part if it were necessary in promoting the idea. There were many who, both individually and in groups, later told the School Committee what happened and who also gave warm support to the work which Pi Beta Phi has done for over thirty years for their mountain community. Mary L. Owenby, our Mary L., has written how she has felt toward our School and what it has meant to her family. "I just want to tell you what the Gatlinburg School has done for our country. To start with, it is, the best thing that 187 THE DECEMBER ARROW ever came into our country. We diden't have eny school worth enything. You no your self it was just one little roomed house and not very meny in school and now it is a large school and good bildens and another grand thing is the Arrow-craft Shop. Just think of the work that it gives the people and before the school started here we dident have enything to work at only farming. I made a very few chairs and sold them to the people around in the community at .50ct each, made two chairs and took them to Gatlinburg for some one. They said to me why dont you take one of them up to the school and said you probly could sell some there I done what they said I took one up there Miss Evelyn Bishop was there at that time She said yes I will take some chairs she said to make 6 and she would give me $1.50 each for them and I made them and took them in She ordered 12 and from then on it was all I could make you no I thought I was flying getting $1.50 ct in sted of just 50 ct I made chairs for several years and went to weaving I have ben weaving 14 years I make good at the weaving I am living very well I have plenty to eat and ware and have very good cabin to live in and have 2 good cows and have got some money I dident have eny thing before the school came to Gatlinburg I will tell you a little about how I lived before the school started in Gatlinburg I lived hard we ate what we made on the farm all But our flower we cant make much wheet here we had to buy our flower I would save all the flower sacks and color them to make close for my children to ware to school I dident have enything to buy with and while that is the case there was lots of others in the same fix but I dont guess you could get them to tell you that and another thing they wasent very meny lived in Gatlinburg just a few Char-lie Ogle's store was just a little one room bilding and now it is a ten room bilding if that school hadent started up there it would have always ben just like it was I would like to no what could have ben more help to our country than the school I cant say enough good things about it I had better stop." This sincere and spontaneous outpouring of appreciation and gratitude for the help which the Pi Beta Phi SchoOl has been and still is, to Mary L. and her family in inspiration, education of her children, and in helping her to economic independence, found its counterpart in those April days in the hearts of hundreds of mountain people who wended their way to the court-house in Sevierville to signify their willingness to use their resources to the limit in order that Pi. Beta Phi might continue its services to the community through different channels. That the transition of responsibility for f school program was successfully made, was d to the confidence of the community in the co tinuous progress of Pi Beta Phi's triple progra of health, education and economic independen through Arrowcraft over a long period of ye and its faith in the chairman of the Settlemc School Committee, Mrs. Ethel Copp and t 36,000 Pi Beta Phi women whom she rep sented. Many minor adjustments which ml be made during the next year depend upon t] same mutual understanding and mutual : tegrity.
