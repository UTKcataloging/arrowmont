        620 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON CALENDAR, SYMPHONY, AND COAT-OF-ARMS The Committee on Calendar, Symphony, and Coat-of-Arms submits the following report: The work of this committee has been accomplished by three sub-committees: Calendar Katherine Griest and Anna F. T. Pettit. Symphony Lois Janvier. Coat-of-Arms Anna F. T. Pettit. These sub-committees make the following reports : The sub-committee on Calendar submits the following report: Two calendars have been issued by your committee: one for 1911 and one for 1912, both printed by Walter H. Jenkins, Philadelphia. Five hundred copies were printed in 1911 and four hundred in 1912. The price of the 1911 calendar was fifty cents ($.50) ; of the 1912, sixty cents ($.60). Total receipts, 1911 $189.79 Total expenditures, 1911 208.29 Deficit 1911 $ 18.50 Total receipts; 1912 $202.05 Total expenditures, 1912 170.80 Balance 1912 $ 31.25 Deficit -1911 18.50 Total Balance 1911 and 1912 $ 12.75 This balance has been paid to the Grand Treasurer. The committee feels convinced that the issuing of a calendar is of value to the fraternity; that the fraternity ought to be able to support a calendar; that the publication is not worth the effort unless 600 pledges have been se-cured (equivalent to less than TO per cent of our membership) by June of the preceding year. Respectfully submitted, ANNA F. T. PETTIT. KATFIARINE GRIEST. The sub-committee on Coat-of-Arms submits the following report: The plans for a coat-of-arms adopted at the 1910 Convention has been carried out as closely as possible. The coat-of-arms was designed by Mr. Charles J. Young of the Bailey Banks 8: Biddle Company, Philadelphia. It was adopted by the Grand Council in February, 1912, and copyrighted for the, fraternity in the name of Anna F. T. Pettit in March, 1912. At the request of the Grand Council, the committee ordered from Bailey Banks and Biddle Company a steel plate for year book inserts. Permission to use the coat-of-arms on stationery and for mounting jewelry has been granted to several official jewelers. The following is the heraldic blazoning: "On a Lozenge Gules an eagle displayed charged on the breast with a sun in splendor, both proper thereon the word Lux of the first. In the dexter claw a monogram of the letters I. C. and in the sinister claw the badge of the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity." A more detailed report of the work of the committee will be found in the ARROW for July, 1912. Respectfully submitted, ANNA F. T. PETTIT. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON UNIFORM INITIATION ROBES The committee to select a uniform initiation gown was appointed by the REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 621 Grand President in the summer of 1910 and completed its work in the spring of 1911. The committee consisted of Sophie P. Woodman, New York Beta, '07, chairman; Mabel McCann-Molloy, New York Beta, '1o; Dema Harshbarger, Illinois Delta, '11 and Louise de la Barre, Minnesota Alpha, 'II. As it was found that the Mississippi formed a dividing line as to shipping rates the chief work of the committee naturally devolved upon Miss de la Barre and the chairman. After much conference, the Butterick pattern, No. 4478 was selected by the committee and submitted to the Grand Council who adopted the design in November, 1910. The use of this pattern then became obligatory upon all chapters of Pi Beta Phi and old gowns were ordered destroyed. The committee desired to have the material, as well as the style, the same. Therefore arrangements were made with John Wanamaker in New York, who will ship goods with value amounting to $5 or over anywhere this side of the Mississippi and with L. S. Donaldson of Minneapolis who will do the same in the west, and all chapters sent directly to one of these firms. As the general order was so large a reduction , of 2 cents per yard was made. The best quality of cheese-cloth was used, 15 cents a yard being at Wanamaker's the list price. The material is* washable and looks much like mull. A sample is appended. Each chapter was required to make as many gowns as it had members, urged to make a few extra and advised that they be chapter property. It is hoped that, if more gowns are necessary, the material may be as near the other cheese-cloth as possible. It may be obtained from the above mentioned firms at any time for the ordinary price and will be sent free if $5 worth is ordered. Upon special request, the committee gave California Alpha the right to make the gowns of crepe. Any work for Pi Beta Phi gives much pleasure but costs many stamps. Fifteen chapters, only, had reported on the date set in the circular sent out by the chairman. An extension of two months was readily granted to those who asked for it, but at the end of that time eight chapters, from which nothing whatever had been heard were reported to the Grand President. It is too bad that the carelessness of perhaps only the corresponding secretary, should hurt the reputation of the whole chapter and detract from the keen pleasure experienced in the work by the chairman of the committee. She sincerely thanks the various chapters for their courtesy and good nature and words of appreciation over the gowns, and especially commends Louise de la Barre for her promptness and efficiency. Respectfully submitted, SOPHIE PARSONS WOODMAN. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON SETTLEMENT SCHOOL (This outline follows development of the work in chronological order as far as possible but is a bare outline only. All original correspondence from the field, copies of replies and official papers were submitted to convention and later transferred to the committee elect. These papers tell the story in detail). The National Committee in charge of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School work among the mountain whites, elected at the Swarthmore Convention, 1910, was composed of the following alumnae personnel: The Grand Vice-President, Mrs. Chas. Branson, New York Beta; the Grand Secretary, Julia E. Rogers, Iowa Zeta, Jennie Allyn, Massachusetts Alpha, Edith Carpenter, Vermont Alpha, Anna F. T. Pettit, Pennsylvania Alpha, Leila Soule, Michigan Alpha, Mary B. Harris, Pennsylvania Beta, Mrs. Chas. Wolfe, Illinois Delta, Mrs. Mary Wallihan Gibson, Colorado Beta, Jennie Rainey, Louisiana Alpha, Emma Harper Turner, Columbia Alpha, chairman with the Washington Alumnae Club, invited to become auxiliary to the National Committee. Mrs. D. K. Shute of Washington was appointed treasurer. In 1911 Mrs. Wolfe finding it impossible to continue the committee work 6 2 2 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI resigned and Mrs. Kate King Bostwick, Michigan Alpha, was appointed to fill her place. In 1911 also, the beloved Jennie Rainey passed to the great beyond, and the Louisiana Alpha Alumnce Club was requested to elect her successor on the committee which it did in Miss Lois Janvier. Under instructions from Swarthmore, the investigation of possible school sites was begun at once. September 1910, at request of the chairman, Miss Lizette Woerner, Wisconsin Alpha, made a trip into the Kentucky mountains. (Report filed in official returns to incoming committee). August 1910, Miss Pettit, the Grand President, Dr. Keller, and the committee chairman made a trip into the mountain country of Tennessee. (Reports of this trip are found in the ARROW of 1910 and 1911 and official committee files). Much of need was found and learned later that it does not seem wise to put into print but it was reported to Convention and will be reported gladly by letter or word of mouth. which is the true mountain method of disseminating information. The mountain people are peculiarly sensitive and clannish and resent keenly any reflection upon their mode of life or thought. The Hindman Kentucky school already large and with over Soo on the waiting list adheres strictly to the plan of not printing reports, lest the same returning prove the death of local co-operation if not the incentive to more dire results, for the feud spirit is not dead among these people. They still avenge their own and will continue to do so until education gives the broader, better vision of life. (See articles by Lucy Furman in Century of 1910-'11 "Mothering on Perilous"). This much, however, may be said. In many mountain districts one finds abject poverty, and in all, hard living conditions; no sanitary provisions whatsoever; the size of the family out of all proportion to that of the abode, making privacy an impossible thing; that prejudice and suspicion consequent upon mountain isolation abound and that communities are torn by jealousies, factions and church denominational wars, denominationalism being a particularly vital matter. In certain instances lamentable ignorance prevails, grammar being an unknown tongue and, too often, any little public school revenue becomes but a political asset in the hands of leaders. Conditions are peculiarly hard and narrow for women. Many mountain men seem to be living still in a time when men fished and hunted only, while women did all the work about the home, farming and providing fuel and, in the mountains, always, always bearing children no matter what the conditions into which they are born. As said one mountain woman pathetically, "Men and dogs has a kind'er easy time in these ?yere parts but wimmen and steers has it mighty hard." Any work looking to a broader visioned life for the women is generally looked upon with disfavor by the men. A Pi Beta Phi teacher of experience substituting in a mountain school near Asheville, summer of 1911, reports by personal letter that "The great need of mountain women is a vision of beauty. Their lives are void of beauty," and yet these people are passionately fond of music, it is truly a passion with them and that may prove the key to any influence we may desire. As was said to Moses of old "What is in thine hand"? It is music in ours and the mutual sympathy and understanding so desired for our work may possibly find being and development through friendly intercourse between the violin and fiddle. As to method, after consultation with Southern educators and many friends of the movement, the unanimous appeal of all being to the same effect, the con-nsittee recommended Pi Beta Phi co-operation with the public schools, if possible under arrangements satisfactory to the fraternity, rather than an in-dependent work. REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 623 The grounds were as follows: Public School co-operation appears to be the best help toward self help. The American state must always be the natural supply of elementary, secular education while philanthropic supplies are abnormal and unnatural and should be but temporary. Wise help, therefore, will be directed definitely toward hastening the day of normal conditions and the very apparent crying need everywhere in the mountains at present is for concrete demonstration of what rural public schools should be and of the results obtainable from a wise expenditure of school revenue however small. All territory within borders of the United States is covered by public school provision of some kind and conditions are as they are in many-localities only because of the kind. In many instances available revenues are pitiably small, being in direct proportion to taxes received; and hence almost nothing in poor agricultural districts. This means short school terms, poor buildings, no equipment, no comforts, no attractions, and small salaried teachers (often a child graduate of the same school). Co-operation with the public schools would also give a most desirable opportunity for teaching civics. The recommendation above was endorsed and adopted unanimously by the National Committee and later plans based upon it. Correspondence with many localities regarding the location of our pro-posed school brought overtures from many and particularly attractive was that received from Wears Valley, Sevier Co., Tenn., 15 miles over the mountains from the county seat. Here is a school established originally under Presbyterian auspices and thus continued. The property is valued at $3,000 with a comparatively large school in successful operation and supported by the good will and co-operation of the people. This whole plant was offered us outright as a gift for the simple taking. The proposition was considered long and seriously but was finally decided adversely by the National Committee on the ground of insurficient need the community being apparently able financially to provide any school de ired. A sub-committee of the National Committee being found advisable for detail work and the possibility of meetings, such a committee was authorized; same to consist of the Grand Vice-President of Philadelphia, Grand Secretary of New York, Mary B. Harris of Baltimore, Anna F. T. Pettit of Philadelphia and the chairman E. H. Turner of Washington. The Grand President Dr. Keller being invited also. This committee was empowered to act. The first meeting was held at Mrs. Branson's home, December, IIIO. (For minutes see ARROW of January, 1911). Consequent upon action of above committee meeting, that no permanent work be undertaken without first securing an endowment fund, a campaign for this fund was begun in January, 1911, under the leadership of Mrs. Bran-son who then became treasurer of the National Committee vice Mrs. Shue resigned. Mrs. Branson's assistants in this campaign were Misses Anna Pettit and Anne Stewart and Mrs. Kate King Bostwick together with members of the National Committee and to them much credit, sincere thanks and appreciation of the fraternity are due. Owing to many unforseen and unavoidable developments at the time, the work could not be carried out as planned but what was done was well done and may be taken up later. (For receipts see report of treasurer of the National Committee). A second meeting of the sub-committee was held in Philadelhia, May, 1911 at the home of Miss Anna F. T. Pettit. (For report see ARROW, July, 1911). At this meeting a decision was reached favoring Gatlinburg, Tenn. for the school site. (See report of Dr. Keller, ARROW, July, 1911). The factors determining this decision were Need; opportunities of in624 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Iluence as to territory and population; ability of Pi Beta Phi to meet the special local need. $500.00 was appropriated as a maximum limit for school expenses of the first session. Gatlinburg is in the eastern part of Sevier Co.; a center of teaming routes into the mountains; a point of large influence no railroad connections but the prospective terminus of a branch road from Sevierville; wildly beautiful country, not a town but a community along the big road; served by rural mail carriers; has a little public school house that has not been re-roofed in 30 years; school furniture home made and 20 years old. (Steps are being taken at present to build a new school house.) About 200 children are within school influence of this point and many very needy outlying coves are accessible from it. The public school term usually begins in August and closes at Christmas,-teacher's salary, $30.00. Negotiations were opened at once with the School Board and citizens but delays almost disheartening attended every step. County school officials had been changed the while and the new officials needed to be informed and interested. Beginning in June, it was found impossible to secure definite, satisfactory action even by December. "There's a hull day termorrer that haint never been teched yit" is a mountain maxim that is followed literally. The outsider must content his soul in patience and abide by the mountaineer's pleasure or fail utterly. The National Committee, growing desperate, decided to enter the community at once by an independent and perhaps temporary school, and conduct all further negotiations through a representative on the field. The Grand Council endorsed said action and officially notified the chairman to that effect at the same time pledging its moral support. In January, 1912, a second delegated committee was authorized by the National Committee to make all arrangements for conduct of the first school session this committee to consist of delegates from Washington, Mary B. Harris and Dr. Keller of Baltimore and the National Committee chairman. The work of securing suitable teachers and a nurse had been going on for a year. Every effort was made to secure Pi Beta Phis, the positions being offered to five or six specially recommended. Certain requirements were absolutely necessary-ability, versatility, sympathy, the missionary spirit, normal training in elementary school work; domestic science and art; nursing; music, settlement work and, if possible, experience or acquaintance with work among the mountaineers. A Pi Phi was engaged but growing ill was obliged to decline the position. Thereupon through friends, Miss Martha Hill of Nashville was brought to our attention. Miss Hill is a teacher of public school experience in the elementary school branches and drawing; has also taught music; has done missionary school work in the mountains and was desirous of entering it again; her brother is director of athletics at Vanderbilt University; her sister is on the committee in charge of the women's department, Tennessee State Fair. Miss Hill was highly recommended by the President, Nashville Colonial Dames and by Miss J. Steele, Assistant Principal, Fairmont Seminary of Washington. She was engaged January 20. The contract with Miss Hill covered 3 months; salary $40.00 per month together with living expenses and travel expenses from and to Nashville (her home). Having no Pi Phi representative near or on the field much liberty and discretion was necessarily left to Miss Hill in the matter of equipment, which included a preliminary trip of investigation and arrangements, rental of house, furnishing same with simple essentials, kitchen equipment capable of REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 625 domestic science teaching, general school equipment and materials for kindergarten. Miss Hill very generously gave her services the first two months (before opening the school) for $20.00 per month. The school continued to June 29. (Five months' service). (See statement of expenditures attached). Miss Hill very soon discovered one cause of many delays in our work, a portion of the community being opposed to our advent for fear of a new church establishment. The possibility of a purely altruistic idea prompting such work seemed wholly foreign to the local conception. They feared the Greeks bearing gifts and a "new church" had been the result in a certain near by community. Therefore the denominations already on hand flew to the defense at once and naturally. Certain church men have been particularly virulent in their opposition to us, and one minister prayed publicly for the removal of "this evil that has come among us." But Miss Hill persisted. She secured a living house of 3 rooms, porches, outbuildings, old fashioned well at rental of $1.50 per month. Rent how-ever, seems the only reasonable element in mountain expenses. After heroic efforts, days and days of cleaning, the place was made livable and kodaks present it attractive. (These views will appear in later ARROWS). Into this house the barest necessities in furniture were put. (Find list of assets attached). School opened with 14 pupils and closed with 33. Following is the program of closing day exercises.

The organ is a great attraction and was used for the visitors by request. Profusion of bright wild flowers; everything as clean and nice looking as it could be made. (Needed: Pi Beta Phi Pennants and Colors and Motto for Scho'ol). Program Great success! "Nothing like it through here before." In addition to the school work Miss Hill has done much visiting; held regular Mother's meeting; musical evening for the young people; attended public meetings addressing two, and best of all has made friends with those who were unfriendly at the beginning and has received assurances of good will, official in character. Regret at close of the school was universal and its reopening is awaited eagerly. The women have begged that the work be continued and theirs is the greatest need. To them it has meant something new and interesting and who can say what encouragement, what suggestions, what glimpses they may have caught already of "things lovely and of good report" even to a woman, and this in but five months effort. HOUSE FURNISHING Furnishing the Pi Beta Phi house in the mountains has awakened intense interest throughout the fraternity and is a matter of limitless pleasurable possibilities. Miss Louise Van Sant, Maryland Alpha, has been acting chairman of special furnishings which was to cover things needed and desired but not obtainable under the first appropriation. A spirited campaign of solicitation has been conducted among the alumni clubs and in consequence many gifts and pledges have already been received and many more will be the stories of which will doubtless be told in the individual reports, as they should be for the honor should rest peculiarly where it belongs. Mention might be made however of the organ given by Baltimore and Washington Pi Phis jointly for which they sacrificed their Founders' Day banquet, and of the kindness of Mr. Percy Foster of Washington, piano dealer who very generously gave the organ at cost price donating also the stool, crating and cartage and, in addition, Mr. Foster holds for our order 50 song books for assembly use which he will kindly give whenever we are ready to receive them. A pledge of the table silver comes from the Los Angeles Club; of linen from Boston; of a sewing machine from Franklin. Window shades were given by Baltimore; a box of rugs and books by Washington; a cereal double boiler by Philadelphia; magazine subscriptions by Syracuse and may the good work go on. Does not every club and perhaps chapter want to have a place on this honor roll? There is so much that may be done beyond the bare necessities. We have visions of the home and school room both copies of beautiful pictures, kodak work, arts and crafts, needle work for which perchance a market may be found, a stereoptican, a Victrola and even a little Pi Beta Phi Dispensary what may not a fraternity like ours do in a work like this? (Examine list of furnishings attached). Miss Ethel McCullough, Indiana Alpha, Librarian of Evansville, Ind., very kindly took charge of the School and House Library project but the limited time before Convention did not permit development of her plans. She will doubtless be glad to confer with the committee elect. In answer to many questions: 1. It has not seemed wise or necessary to invest in property or attempt the erection of buildings at present or until more thorough investigations are made. 2. Applications for the positions of teacher and nurse are desired; some have been received and will be considered for the coming year. In conclusion then, as the result' of its two years' work, in behalf of the REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 627 Settlement School project the National Committee has the honor to present a Pi Beta Phi school in successful operation with a promising future and the beginning of a Pi Beta Phi home in the mountains. Two meetings of the committee have been held at this Convention, June 27 and 28 at which official action was taken as follows: The National Committee would respectfully recommend to Convention. 1. That Miss Martha Hill be re-engaged as school teacher for the present with a Pi Beta Phi as understudy. 2. That the Chicago Alumna: Club be requested to assume control of the settlement school project, which club has our full confidence for such work. The one city plan makes possible advantages of committee meetings and the reduction of correspondence to a minimum. For the Committee, MARY WALLIHAN GIBSON, Secretary. Finally the chairman desires to thank the whole fraternity most sincerely for its loyal support, its patience and forbearance during these trying two years of the beginnings of things. The work has not been easy, being almost wholly one of correspondence, and conditions have been especially trying but possibly no more so than is common to the development of any large philanthropic project. Especially would she recommend to the fraternity for grateful appreciation her co-laborers on the various committees. The National Committee that by its national character has found the task hard yet, in spite of the difficulties, has brought to it an intelligence, interest, earnestness and sympathy that have made possible whatever success has been attained, and again to those who so unselfishly labored in the money campaign especially Mrs. Branson, Mrs. Bostwick, Miss Stewart, Miss Pettit, and also to the Washington Pi Phis who for two long years have given to this cause their untiring, unselfish devotion, co-operation, inspiration everything at their command. Nor should we forget a word appreciative of Miss Hill on the field who has made our cause her own and accomplished splendid things for us. We are debtors both to the Greeks and Barbarians for kindnesses untold and in re-turn would only offer, "We have kept the Faith We have followed the Creed." Respectfully, EMMA H. TURNER, Chairman.

The committee recommends that the fraternity's uniform treasurers' book be used for the simplification of these accounts, and that numbered vouchers be filed. The committee also recommends the payment of Miss Turner's expense account of $120.66 for the two years now ending, from the appropriation made for current expenses of the school. x. It was voted, in the committee, that the fraternity be asked to appropriate from its treasury the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) a year to help defray the current expenses of the Settlement School during the interim of Convention. 2. It was further voted that the active chapters be released from their pledges, and that pledges hereafter be solicited only from aim-11nm. 3. Voted, that the permanent endowment fund be turned over to the new committee and invested by them as they may decide. ELIZABETH A. HELMICK, Chairman. ANNA R. NICKERSON. MAY COPELAND DRYBREAD.

        6 2 2 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI resigned and Mrs. Kate King Bostwick, Michigan Alpha, was appointed to fill her place. In 1911 also, the beloved Jennie Rainey passed to the great beyond, and the Louisiana Alpha Alumnce Club was requested to elect her successor on the committee which it did in Miss Lois Janvier. Under instructions from Swarthmore, the investigation of possible school sites was begun at once. September 1910, at request of the chairman, Miss Lizette Woerner, Wisconsin Alpha, made a trip into the Kentucky mountains. (Report filed in official returns to incoming committee). August 1910, Miss Pettit, the Grand President, Dr. Keller, and the committee chairman made a trip into the mountain country of Tennessee. (Reports of this trip are found in the ARROW of 1910 and 1911 and official committee files). Much of need was found and learned later that it does not seem wise to put into print but it was reported to Convention and will be reported gladly by letter or word of mouth. which is the true mountain method of disseminating information. The mountain people are peculiarly sensitive and clannish and resent keenly any reflection upon their mode of life or thought. The Hindman Kentucky school already large and with over Soo on the waiting list adheres strictly to the plan of not printing reports, lest the same returning prove the death of local co-operation if not the incentive to more dire results, for the feud spirit is not dead among these people. They still avenge their own and will continue to do so until education gives the broader, better vision of life. (See articles by Lucy Furman in Century of 1910-'11 "Mothering on Perilous"). This much, however, may be said. In many mountain districts one finds abject poverty, and in all, hard living conditions; no sanitary provisions whatsoever; the size of the family out of all proportion to that of the abode, making privacy an impossible thing; that prejudice and suspicion consequent upon mountain isolation abound and that communities are torn by jealousies, factions and church denominational wars, denominationalism being a particularly vital matter. In certain instances lamentable ignorance prevails, grammar being an unknown tongue and, too often, any little public school revenue becomes but a political asset in the hands of leaders. Conditions are peculiarly hard and narrow for women. Many mountain men seem to be living still in a time when men fished and hunted only, while women did all the work about the home, farming and providing fuel and, in the mountains, always, always bearing children no matter what the conditions into which they are born. As said one mountain woman pathetically, "Men and dogs has a kind'er easy time in these ?yere parts but wimmen and steers has it mighty hard." Any work looking to a broader visioned life for the women is generally looked upon with disfavor by the men. A Pi Beta Phi teacher of experience substituting in a mountain school near Asheville, summer of 1911, reports by personal letter that "The great need of mountain women is a vision of beauty. Their lives are void of beauty," and yet these people are passionately fond of music, it is truly a passion with them and that may prove the key to any influence we may desire. As was said to Moses of old "What is in thine hand"? It is music in ours and the mutual sympathy and understanding so desired for our work may possibly find being and development through friendly intercourse between the violin and fiddle. As to method, after consultation with Southern educators and many friends of the movement, the unanimous appeal of all being to the same effect, the con-nsittee recommended Pi Beta Phi co-operation with the public schools, if possible under arrangements satisfactory to the fraternity, rather than an in-dependent work. REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 623 The grounds were as follows: Public School co-operation appears to be the best help toward self help. The American state must always be the natural supply of elementary, secular education while philanthropic supplies are abnormal and unnatural and should be but temporary. Wise help, therefore, will be directed definitely toward hastening the day of normal conditions and the very apparent crying need everywhere in the mountains at present is for concrete demonstration of what rural public schools should be and of the results obtainable from a wise expenditure of school revenue however small. All territory within borders of the United States is covered by public school provision of some kind and conditions are as they are in many-localities only because of the kind. In many instances available revenues are pitiably small, being in direct proportion to taxes received; and hence almost nothing in poor agricultural districts. This means short school terms, poor buildings, no equipment, no comforts, no attractions, and small salaried teachers (often a child graduate of the same school). Co-operation with the public schools would also give a most desirable opportunity for teaching civics. The recommendation above was endorsed and adopted unanimously by the National Committee and later plans based upon it. Correspondence with many localities regarding the location of our pro-posed school brought overtures from many and particularly attractive was that received from Wears Valley, Sevier Co., Tenn., 15 miles over the mountains from the county seat. Here is a school established originally under Presbyterian auspices and thus continued. The property is valued at $3,000 with a comparatively large school in successful operation and supported by the good will and co-operation of the people. This whole plant was offered us outright as a gift for the simple taking. The proposition was considered long and seriously but was finally decided adversely by the National Committee on the ground of insurficient need the community being apparently able financially to provide any school de ired. A sub-committee of the National Committee being found advisable for detail work and the possibility of meetings, such a committee was authorized; same to consist of the Grand Vice-President of Philadelphia, Grand Secretary of New York, Mary B. Harris of Baltimore, Anna F. T. Pettit of Philadelphia and the chairman E. H. Turner of Washington. The Grand President Dr. Keller being invited also. This committee was empowered to act. The first meeting was held at Mrs. Branson's home, December, IIIO. (For minutes see ARROW of January, 1911). Consequent upon action of above committee meeting, that no permanent work be undertaken without first securing an endowment fund, a campaign for this fund was begun in January, 1911, under the leadership of Mrs. Bran-son who then became treasurer of the National Committee vice Mrs. Shue resigned. Mrs. Branson's assistants in this campaign were Misses Anna Pettit and Anne Stewart and Mrs. Kate King Bostwick together with members of the National Committee and to them much credit, sincere thanks and appreciation of the fraternity are due. Owing to many unforseen and unavoidable developments at the time, the work could not be carried out as planned but what was done was well done and may be taken up later. (For receipts see report of treasurer of the National Committee). A second meeting of the sub-committee was held in Philadelhia, May, 1911 at the home of Miss Anna F. T. Pettit. (For report see ARROW, July, 1911). At this meeting a decision was reached favoring Gatlinburg, Tenn. for the school site. (See report of Dr. Keller, ARROW, July, 1911). The factors determining this decision were Need; opportunities of in624 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Iluence as to territory and population; ability of Pi Beta Phi to meet the special local need. $500.00 was appropriated as a maximum limit for school expenses of the first session. Gatlinburg is in the eastern part of Sevier Co.; a center of teaming routes into the mountains; a point of large influence no railroad connections but the prospective terminus of a branch road from Sevierville; wildly beautiful country, not a town but a community along the big road; served by rural mail carriers; has a little public school house that has not been re-roofed in 30 years; school furniture home made and 20 years old. (Steps are being taken at present to build a new school house.) About 200 children are within school influence of this point and many very needy outlying coves are accessible from it. The public school term usually begins in August and closes at Christmas,-teacher's salary, $30.00. Negotiations were opened at once with the School Board and citizens but delays almost disheartening attended every step. County school officials had been changed the while and the new officials needed to be informed and interested. Beginning in June, it was found impossible to secure definite, satisfactory action even by December. "There's a hull day termorrer that haint never been teched yit" is a mountain maxim that is followed literally. The outsider must content his soul in patience and abide by the mountaineer's pleasure or fail utterly. The National Committee, growing desperate, decided to enter the community at once by an independent and perhaps temporary school, and conduct all further negotiations through a representative on the field. The Grand Council endorsed said action and officially notified the chairman to that effect at the same time pledging its moral support. In January, 1912, a second delegated committee was authorized by the National Committee to make all arrangements for conduct of the first school session this committee to consist of delegates from Washington, Mary B. Harris and Dr. Keller of Baltimore and the National Committee chairman. The work of securing suitable teachers and a nurse had been going on for a year. Every effort was made to secure Pi Beta Phis, the positions being offered to five or six specially recommended. Certain requirements were absolutely necessary-ability, versatility, sympathy, the missionary spirit, normal training in elementary school work; domestic science and art; nursing; music, settlement work and, if possible, experience or acquaintance with work among the mountaineers. A Pi Phi was engaged but growing ill was obliged to decline the position. Thereupon through friends, Miss Martha Hill of Nashville was brought to our attention. Miss Hill is a teacher of public school experience in the elementary school branches and drawing; has also taught music; has done missionary school work in the mountains and was desirous of entering it again; her brother is director of athletics at Vanderbilt University; her sister is on the committee in charge of the women's department, Tennessee State Fair. Miss Hill was highly recommended by the President, Nashville Colonial Dames and by Miss J. Steele, Assistant Principal, Fairmont Seminary of Washington. She was engaged January 20. The contract with Miss Hill covered 3 months; salary $40.00 per month together with living expenses and travel expenses from and to Nashville (her home). Having no Pi Phi representative near or on the field much liberty and discretion was necessarily left to Miss Hill in the matter of equipment, which included a preliminary trip of investigation and arrangements, rental of house, furnishing same with simple essentials, kitchen equipment capable of REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 625 domestic science teaching, general school equipment and materials for kindergarten. Miss Hill very generously gave her services the first two months (before opening the school) for $20.00 per month. The school continued to June 29. (Five months' service). (See statement of expenditures attached). Miss Hill very soon discovered one cause of many delays in our work, a portion of the community being opposed to our advent for fear of a new church establishment. The possibility of a purely altruistic idea prompting such work seemed wholly foreign to the local conception. They feared the Greeks bearing gifts and a "new church" had been the result in a certain near by community. Therefore the denominations already on hand flew to the defense at once and naturally. Certain church men have been particularly virulent in their opposition to us, and one minister prayed publicly for the removal of "this evil that has come among us." But Miss Hill persisted. She secured a living house of 3 rooms, porches, outbuildings, old fashioned well at rental of $1.50 per month. Rent how-ever, seems the only reasonable element in mountain expenses. After heroic efforts, days and days of cleaning, the place was made livable and kodaks present it attractive. (These views will appear in later ARROWS). Into this house the barest necessities in furniture were put. (Find list of assets attached). School opened with 14 pupils and closed with 33. Following is the program of closing day exercises.

The organ is a great attraction and was used for the visitors by request. Profusion of bright wild flowers; everything as clean and nice looking as it could be made. (Needed: Pi Beta Phi Pennants and Colors and Motto for Scho'ol). Program Great success! "Nothing like it through here before." In addition to the school work Miss Hill has done much visiting; held regular Mother's meeting; musical evening for the young people; attended public meetings addressing two, and best of all has made friends with those who were unfriendly at the beginning and has received assurances of good will, official in character. Regret at close of the school was universal and its reopening is awaited eagerly. The women have begged that the work be continued and theirs is the greatest need. To them it has meant something new and interesting and who can say what encouragement, what suggestions, what glimpses they may have caught already of "things lovely and of good report" even to a woman, and this in but five months effort. HOUSE FURNISHING Furnishing the Pi Beta Phi house in the mountains has awakened intense interest throughout the fraternity and is a matter of limitless pleasurable possibilities. Miss Louise Van Sant, Maryland Alpha, has been acting chairman of special furnishings which was to cover things needed and desired but not obtainable under the first appropriation. A spirited campaign of solicitation has been conducted among the alumni clubs and in consequence many gifts and pledges have already been received and many more will be the stories of which will doubtless be told in the individual reports, as they should be for the honor should rest peculiarly where it belongs. Mention might be made however of the organ given by Baltimore and Washington Pi Phis jointly for which they sacrificed their Founders' Day banquet, and of the kindness of Mr. Percy Foster of Washington, piano dealer who very generously gave the organ at cost price donating also the stool, crating and cartage and, in addition, Mr. Foster holds for our order 50 song books for assembly use which he will kindly give whenever we are ready to receive them. A pledge of the table silver comes from the Los Angeles Club; of linen from Boston; of a sewing machine from Franklin. Window shades were given by Baltimore; a box of rugs and books by Washington; a cereal double boiler by Philadelphia; magazine subscriptions by Syracuse and may the good work go on. Does not every club and perhaps chapter want to have a place on this honor roll? There is so much that may be done beyond the bare necessities. We have visions of the home and school room both copies of beautiful pictures, kodak work, arts and crafts, needle work for which perchance a market may be found, a stereoptican, a Victrola and even a little Pi Beta Phi Dispensary what may not a fraternity like ours do in a work like this? (Examine list of furnishings attached). Miss Ethel McCullough, Indiana Alpha, Librarian of Evansville, Ind., very kindly took charge of the School and House Library project but the limited time before Convention did not permit development of her plans. She will doubtless be glad to confer with the committee elect. In answer to many questions: 1. It has not seemed wise or necessary to invest in property or attempt the erection of buildings at present or until more thorough investigations are made. 2. Applications for the positions of teacher and nurse are desired; some have been received and will be considered for the coming year. In conclusion then, as the result' of its two years' work, in behalf of the REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 627 Settlement School project the National Committee has the honor to present a Pi Beta Phi school in successful operation with a promising future and the beginning of a Pi Beta Phi home in the mountains. Two meetings of the committee have been held at this Convention, June 27 and 28 at which official action was taken as follows: The National Committee would respectfully recommend to Convention. 1. That Miss Martha Hill be re-engaged as school teacher for the present with a Pi Beta Phi as understudy. 2. That the Chicago Alumna: Club be requested to assume control of the settlement school project, which club has our full confidence for such work. The one city plan makes possible advantages of committee meetings and the reduction of correspondence to a minimum. For the Committee, MARY WALLIHAN GIBSON, Secretary. Finally the chairman desires to thank the whole fraternity most sincerely for its loyal support, its patience and forbearance during these trying two years of the beginnings of things. The work has not been easy, being almost wholly one of correspondence, and conditions have been especially trying but possibly no more so than is common to the development of any large philanthropic project. Especially would she recommend to the fraternity for grateful appreciation her co-laborers on the various committees. The National Committee that by its national character has found the task hard yet, in spite of the difficulties, has brought to it an intelligence, interest, earnestness and sympathy that have made possible whatever success has been attained, and again to those who so unselfishly labored in the money campaign especially Mrs. Branson, Mrs. Bostwick, Miss Stewart, Miss Pettit, and also to the Washington Pi Phis who for two long years have given to this cause their untiring, unselfish devotion, co-operation, inspiration everything at their command. Nor should we forget a word appreciative of Miss Hill on the field who has made our cause her own and accomplished splendid things for us. We are debtors both to the Greeks and Barbarians for kindnesses untold and in re-turn would only offer, "We have kept the Faith We have followed the Creed." Respectfully, EMMA H. TURNER, Chairman.

The committee also recommends the payment of Miss Turner's expense account of $120.66 for the two years now ending, from the appropriation made for current expenses of the school. x. It was voted, in the committee, that the fraternity be asked to appropriate from its treasury the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) a year to help defray the current expenses of the Settlement School during the interim of Convention. 2. It was further voted that the active chapters be released from their pledges, and that pledges hereafter be solicited only from aim-11nm. 3. Voted, that the permanent endowment fund be turned over to the new committee and invested by them as they may decide. ELIZABETH A. HELMICK, Chairman. ANNA R. NICKERSON. MAY COPELAND DRYBREAD.

        626 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Class in Stick Laying. Exhibit of sewing tacked on walls for inspection of visitors. The organ is a great attraction and was used for the visitors by request. Profusion of bright wild flowers; everything as clean and nice looking as it could be made. (Needed: Pi Beta Phi Pennants and Colors and Motto for Scho'ol). Program Great success! "Nothing like it through here before." In addition to the school work Miss Hill has done much visiting; held regular Mother's meeting; musical evening for the young people; attended public meetings addressing two, and best of all has made friends with those who were unfriendly at the beginning and has received assurances of good will, official in character. Regret at close of the school was universal and its reopening is awaited eagerly. The women have begged that the work be continued and theirs is the greatest need. To them it has meant something new and interesting and who can say what encouragement, what suggestions, what glimpses they may have caught already of "things lovely and of good report" even to a woman, and this in but five months effort. HOUSE FURNISHING Furnishing the Pi Beta Phi house in the mountains has awakened intense interest throughout the fraternity and is a matter of limitless pleasurable possibilities. Miss Louise Van Sant, Maryland Alpha, has been acting chairman of special furnishings which was to cover things needed and desired but not obtainable under the first appropriation. A spirited campaign of solicitation has been conducted among the alumni clubs and in consequence many gifts and pledges have already been received and many more will be the stories of which will doubtless be told in the individual reports, as they should be for the honor should rest peculiarly where it belongs. Mention might be made however of the organ given by Baltimore and Washington Pi Phis jointly for which they sacrificed their Founders' Day banquet, and of the kindness of Mr. Percy Foster of Washington, piano dealer who very generously gave the organ at cost price donating also the stool, crating and cartage and, in addition, Mr. Foster holds for our order 50 song books for assembly use which he will kindly give whenever we are ready to receive them. A pledge of the table silver comes from the Los Angeles Club; of linen from Boston; of a sewing machine from Franklin. Window shades were given by Baltimore; a box of rugs and books by Washington; a cereal double boiler by Philadelphia; magazine subscriptions by Syracuse and may the good work go on. Does not every club and perhaps chapter want to have a place on this honor roll? There is so much that may be done beyond the bare necessities. We have visions of the home and school room both copies of beautiful pictures, kodak work, arts and crafts, needle work for which perchance a market may be found, a stereoptican, a Victrola and even a little Pi Beta Phi Dispensary what may not a fraternity like ours do in a work like this? (Examine list of furnishings attached). Miss Ethel McCullough, Indiana Alpha, Librarian of Evansville, Ind., very kindly took charge of the School and House Library project but the limited time before Convention did not permit development of her plans. She will doubtless be glad to confer with the committee elect. In answer to many questions: 1. It has not seemed wise or necessary to invest in property or attempt the erection of buildings at present or until more thorough investigations are made. 2. Applications for the positions of teacher and nurse are desired; some have been received and will be considered for the coming year. In conclusion then, as the result' of its two years' work, in behalf of the REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 627 Settlement School project the National Committee has the honor to present a Pi Beta Phi school in successful operation with a promising future and the beginning of a Pi Beta Phi home in the mountains. Two meetings of the committee have been held at this Convention, June 27 and 28 at which official action was taken as follows: The National Committee would respectfully recommend to Convention. 1. That Miss Martha Hill be re-engaged as school teacher for the present with a Pi Beta Phi as understudy. 2. That the Chicago Alumna: Club be requested to assume control of the settlement school project, which club has our full confidence for such work. The one city plan makes possible advantages of committee meetings and the reduction of correspondence to a minimum. For the Committee, MARY WALLIHAN GIBSON, Secretary. Finally the chairman desires to thank the whole fraternity most sincerely for its loyal support, its patience and forbearance during these trying two years of the beginnings of things. The work has not been easy, being almost wholly one of correspondence, and conditions have been especially trying but possibly no more so than is common to the development of any large philanthropic project. Especially would she recommend to the fraternity for grateful appreciation her co-laborers on the various committees. The National Committee that by its national character has found the task hard yet, in spite of the difficulties, has brought to it an intelligence, interest, earnestness and sympathy that have made possible whatever success has been attained, and again to those who so unselfishly labored in the money campaign especially Mrs. Branson, Mrs. Bostwick, Miss Stewart, Miss Pettit, and also to the Washington Pi Phis who for two long years have given to this cause their untiring, unselfish devotion, co-operation, inspiration everything at their command. Nor should we forget a word appreciative of Miss Hill on the field who has made our cause her own and accomplished splendid things for us. We are debtors both to the Greeks and Barbarians for kindnesses untold and in re-turn would only offer, "We have kept the Faith We have followed the Creed." Respectfully, EMMA H. TURNER, Chairman.

T. Pettit. Symphony Lois Janvier. Coat-of-Arms Anna F. T. Pettit. These sub-committees make the following reports : The sub-committee on Calendar submits the following report: Two calendars have been issued by your committee: one for 1911 and one for 1912, both printed by Walter H. Jenkins, Philadelphia. Five hundred copies were printed in 1911 and four hundred in 1912. The price of the 1911 calendar was fifty cents ($.50) ; of the 1912, sixty cents ($.60). Total receipts, 1911 $189.79 Total expenditures, 1911 208.29 Deficit 1911 $ 18.50 Total receipts; 1912 $202.05 Total expenditures, 1912 170.80 Balance 1912 $ 31.25 Deficit -1911 18.50 Total Balance 1911 and 1912 $ 12.75 This balance has been paid to the Grand Treasurer. The committee feels convinced that the issuing of a calendar is of value to the fraternity; that the fraternity ought to be able to support a calendar; that the publication is not worth the effort unless 600 pledges have been se-cured (equivalent to less than TO per cent of our membership) by June of the preceding year. Respectfully submitted, ANNA F. T. PETTIT. KATFIARINE GRIEST. The sub-committee on Coat-of-Arms submits the following report: The plans for a coat-of-arms adopted at the 1910 Convention has been carried out as closely as possible. The coat-of-arms was designed by Mr. Charles J. Young of the Bailey Banks 8: Biddle Company, Philadelphia. It was adopted by the Grand Council in February, 1912, and copyrighted for the, fraternity in the name of Anna F. T. Pettit in March, 1912. At the request of the Grand Council, the committee ordered from Bailey Banks and Biddle Company a steel plate for year book inserts. Permission to use the coat-of-arms on stationery and for mounting jewelry has been granted to several official jewelers. The following is the heraldic blazoning: "On a Lozenge Gules an eagle displayed charged on the breast with a sun in splendor, both proper thereon the word Lux of the first. In the dexter claw a monogram of the letters I. C. and in the sinister claw the badge of the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity." A more detailed report of the work of the committee will be found in the ARROW for July, 1912. Respectfully submitted, ANNA F. T. PETTIT. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON UNIFORM INITIATION ROBES The committee to select a uniform initiation gown was appointed by the REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 621 Grand President in the summer of 1910 and completed its work in the spring of 1911. The committee consisted of Sophie P. Woodman, New York Beta, '07, chairman; Mabel McCann-Molloy, New York Beta, '1o; Dema Harshbarger, Illinois Delta, '11 and Louise de la Barre, Minnesota Alpha, 'II. As it was found that the Mississippi formed a dividing line as to shipping rates the chief work of the committee naturally devolved upon Miss de la Barre and the chairman. After much conference, the Butterick pattern, No. 4478 was selected by the committee and submitted to the Grand Council who adopted the design in November, 1910. The use of this pattern then became obligatory upon all chapters of Pi Beta Phi and old gowns were ordered destroyed. The committee desired to have the material, as well as the style, the same. Therefore arrangements were made with John Wanamaker in New York, who will ship goods with value amounting to $5 or over anywhere this side of the Mississippi and with L. S. Donaldson of Minneapolis who will do the same in the west, and all chapters sent directly to one of these firms. As the general order was so large a reduction , of 2 cents per yard was made. The best quality of cheese-cloth was used, 15 cents a yard being at Wanamaker's the list price. The material is* washable and looks much like mull. A sample is appended. Each chapter was required to make as many gowns as it had members, urged to make a few extra and advised that they be chapter property. It is hoped that, if more gowns are necessary, the material may be as near the other cheese-cloth as possible. It may be obtained from the above mentioned firms at any time for the ordinary price and will be sent free if $5 worth is ordered. Upon special request, the committee gave California Alpha the right to make the gowns of crepe. Any work for Pi Beta Phi gives much pleasure but costs many stamps. Fifteen chapters, only, had reported on the date set in the circular sent out by the chairman. An extension of two months was readily granted to those who asked for it, but at the end of that time eight chapters, from which nothing whatever had been heard were reported to the Grand President. It is too bad that the carelessness of perhaps only the corresponding secretary, should hurt the reputation of the whole chapter and detract from the keen pleasure experienced in the work by the chairman of the committee. She sincerely thanks the various chapters for their courtesy and good nature and words of appreciation over the gowns, and especially commends Louise de la Barre for her promptness and efficiency. Respectfully submitted, SOPHIE PARSONS WOODMAN. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON SETTLEMENT SCHOOL (This outline follows development of the work in chronological order as far as possible but is a bare outline only. All original correspondence from the field, copies of replies and official papers were submitted to convention and later transferred to the committee elect. These papers tell the story in detail). The National Committee in charge of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School work among the mountain whites, elected at the Swarthmore Convention, 1910, was composed of the following alumnae personnel: The Grand Vice-President, Mrs. Chas. Branson, New York Beta; the Grand Secretary, Julia E. Rogers, Iowa Zeta, Jennie Allyn, Massachusetts Alpha, Edith Carpenter, Vermont Alpha, Anna F. T. Pettit, Pennsylvania Alpha, Leila Soule, Michigan Alpha, Mary B. Harris, Pennsylvania Beta, Mrs. Chas. Wolfe, Illinois Delta, Mrs. Mary Wallihan Gibson, Colorado Beta, Jennie Rainey, Louisiana Alpha, Emma Harper Turner, Columbia Alpha, chairman with the Washington Alumnae Club, invited to become auxiliary to the National Committee. Mrs. D. K. Shute of Washington was appointed treasurer. In 1911 Mrs. Wolfe finding it impossible to continue the committee work 6 2 2 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI resigned and Mrs. Kate King Bostwick, Michigan Alpha, was appointed to fill her place. In 1911 also, the beloved Jennie Rainey passed to the great beyond, and the Louisiana Alpha Alumnce Club was requested to elect her successor on the committee which it did in Miss Lois Janvier. Under instructions from Swarthmore, the investigation of possible school sites was begun at once. September 1910, at request of the chairman, Miss Lizette Woerner, Wisconsin Alpha, made a trip into the Kentucky mountains. (Report filed in official returns to incoming committee). August 1910, Miss Pettit, the Grand President, Dr. Keller, and the committee chairman made a trip into the mountain country of Tennessee. (Reports of this trip are found in the ARROW of 1910 and 1911 and official committee files). Much of need was found and learned later that it does not seem wise to put into print but it was reported to Convention and will be reported gladly by letter or word of mouth. which is the true mountain method of disseminating information. The mountain people are peculiarly sensitive and clannish and resent keenly any reflection upon their mode of life or thought. The Hindman Kentucky school already large and with over Soo on the waiting list adheres strictly to the plan of not printing reports, lest the same returning prove the death of local co-operation if not the incentive to more dire results, for the feud spirit is not dead among these people. They still avenge their own and will continue to do so until education gives the broader, better vision of life. (See articles by Lucy Furman in Century of 1910-'11 "Mothering on Perilous"). This much, however, may be said. In many mountain districts one finds abject poverty, and in all, hard living conditions; no sanitary provisions whatsoever; the size of the family out of all proportion to that of the abode, making privacy an impossible thing; that prejudice and suspicion consequent upon mountain isolation abound and that communities are torn by jealousies, factions and church denominational wars, denominationalism being a particularly vital matter. In certain instances lamentable ignorance prevails, grammar being an unknown tongue and, too often, any little public school revenue becomes but a political asset in the hands of leaders. Conditions are peculiarly hard and narrow for women. Many mountain men seem to be living still in a time when men fished and hunted only, while women did all the work about the home, farming and providing fuel and, in the mountains, always, always bearing children no matter what the conditions into which they are born. As said one mountain woman pathetically, "Men and dogs has a kind'er easy time in these ?yere parts but wimmen and steers has it mighty hard." Any work looking to a broader visioned life for the women is generally looked upon with disfavor by the men. A Pi Beta Phi teacher of experience substituting in a mountain school near Asheville, summer of 1911, reports by personal letter that "The great need of mountain women is a vision of beauty. Their lives are void of beauty," and yet these people are passionately fond of music, it is truly a passion with them and that may prove the key to any influence we may desire. As was said to Moses of old "What is in thine hand"? It is music in ours and the mutual sympathy and understanding so desired for our work may possibly find being and development through friendly intercourse between the violin and fiddle. As to method, after consultation with Southern educators and many friends of the movement, the unanimous appeal of all being to the same effect, the con-nsittee recommended Pi Beta Phi co-operation with the public schools, if possible under arrangements satisfactory to the fraternity, rather than an in-dependent work. REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 623 The grounds were as follows: Public School co-operation appears to be the best help toward self help. The American state must always be the natural supply of elementary, secular education while philanthropic supplies are abnormal and unnatural and should be but temporary. Wise help, therefore, will be directed definitely toward hastening the day of normal conditions and the very apparent crying need everywhere in the mountains at present is for concrete demonstration of what rural public schools should be and of the results obtainable from a wise expenditure of school revenue however small. All territory within borders of the United States is covered by public school provision of some kind and conditions are as they are in many-localities only because of the kind. In many instances available revenues are pitiably small, being in direct proportion to taxes received; and hence almost nothing in poor agricultural districts. This means short school terms, poor buildings, no equipment, no comforts, no attractions, and small salaried teachers (often a child graduate of the same school). Co-operation with the public schools would also give a most desirable opportunity for teaching civics. The recommendation above was endorsed and adopted unanimously by the National Committee and later plans based upon it. Correspondence with many localities regarding the location of our pro-posed school brought overtures from many and particularly attractive was that received from Wears Valley, Sevier Co., Tenn., 15 miles over the mountains from the county seat. Here is a school established originally under Presbyterian auspices and thus continued. The property is valued at $3,000 with a comparatively large school in successful operation and supported by the good will and co-operation of the people. This whole plant was offered us outright as a gift for the simple taking. The proposition was considered long and seriously but was finally decided adversely by the National Committee on the ground of insurficient need the community being apparently able financially to provide any school de ired. A sub-committee of the National Committee being found advisable for detail work and the possibility of meetings, such a committee was authorized; same to consist of the Grand Vice-President of Philadelphia, Grand Secretary of New York, Mary B. Harris of Baltimore, Anna F. T. Pettit of Philadelphia and the chairman E. H. Turner of Washington. The Grand President Dr. Keller being invited also. This committee was empowered to act. The first meeting was held at Mrs. Branson's home, December, IIIO. (For minutes see ARROW of January, 1911). Consequent upon action of above committee meeting, that no permanent work be undertaken without first securing an endowment fund, a campaign for this fund was begun in January, 1911, under the leadership of Mrs. Bran-son who then became treasurer of the National Committee vice Mrs. Shue resigned. Mrs. Branson's assistants in this campaign were Misses Anna Pettit and Anne Stewart and Mrs. Kate King Bostwick together with members of the National Committee and to them much credit, sincere thanks and appreciation of the fraternity are due. Owing to many unforseen and unavoidable developments at the time, the work could not be carried out as planned but what was done was well done and may be taken up later. (For receipts see report of treasurer of the National Committee). A second meeting of the sub-committee was held in Philadelhia, May, 1911 at the home of Miss Anna F. T. Pettit. (For report see ARROW, July, 1911). At this meeting a decision was reached favoring Gatlinburg, Tenn. for the school site. (See report of Dr. Keller, ARROW, July, 1911). The factors determining this decision were Need; opportunities of in624 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Iluence as to territory and population; ability of Pi Beta Phi to meet the special local need. $500.00 was appropriated as a maximum limit for school expenses of the first session. Gatlinburg is in the eastern part of Sevier Co.; a center of teaming routes into the mountains; a point of large influence no railroad connections but the prospective terminus of a branch road from Sevierville; wildly beautiful country, not a town but a community along the big road; served by rural mail carriers; has a little public school house that has not been re-roofed in 30 years; school furniture home made and 20 years old. (Steps are being taken at present to build a new school house.) About 200 children are within school influence of this point and many very needy outlying coves are accessible from it. The public school term usually begins in August and closes at Christmas,-teacher's salary, $30.00. Negotiations were opened at once with the School Board and citizens but delays almost disheartening attended every step. County school officials had been changed the while and the new officials needed to be informed and interested. Beginning in June, it was found impossible to secure definite, satisfactory action even by December. "There's a hull day termorrer that haint never been teched yit" is a mountain maxim that is followed literally. The outsider must content his soul in patience and abide by the mountaineer's pleasure or fail utterly. The National Committee, growing desperate, decided to enter the community at once by an independent and perhaps temporary school, and conduct all further negotiations through a representative on the field. The Grand Council endorsed said action and officially notified the chairman to that effect at the same time pledging its moral support. In January, 1912, a second delegated committee was authorized by the National Committee to make all arrangements for conduct of the first school session this committee to consist of delegates from Washington, Mary B. Harris and Dr. Keller of Baltimore and the National Committee chairman. The work of securing suitable teachers and a nurse had been going on for a year. Every effort was made to secure Pi Beta Phis, the positions being offered to five or six specially recommended. Certain requirements were absolutely necessary-ability, versatility, sympathy, the missionary spirit, normal training in elementary school work; domestic science and art; nursing; music, settlement work and, if possible, experience or acquaintance with work among the mountaineers. A Pi Phi was engaged but growing ill was obliged to decline the position. Thereupon through friends, Miss Martha Hill of Nashville was brought to our attention. Miss Hill is a teacher of public school experience in the elementary school branches and drawing; has also taught music; has done missionary school work in the mountains and was desirous of entering it again; her brother is director of athletics at Vanderbilt University; her sister is on the committee in charge of the women's department, Tennessee State Fair. Miss Hill was highly recommended by the President, Nashville Colonial Dames and by Miss J. Steele, Assistant Principal, Fairmont Seminary of Washington. She was engaged January 20. The contract with Miss Hill covered 3 months; salary $40.00 per month together with living expenses and travel expenses from and to Nashville (her home). Having no Pi Phi representative near or on the field much liberty and discretion was necessarily left to Miss Hill in the matter of equipment, which included a preliminary trip of investigation and arrangements, rental of house, furnishing same with simple essentials, kitchen equipment capable of REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 625 domestic science teaching, general school equipment and materials for kindergarten. Miss Hill very generously gave her services the first two months (before opening the school) for $20.00 per month. The school continued to June 29. (Five months' service). (See statement of expenditures attached). Miss Hill very soon discovered one cause of many delays in our work, a portion of the community being opposed to our advent for fear of a new church establishment. The possibility of a purely altruistic idea prompting such work seemed wholly foreign to the local conception. They feared the Greeks bearing gifts and a "new church" had been the result in a certain near by community. Therefore the denominations already on hand flew to the defense at once and naturally. Certain church men have been particularly virulent in their opposition to us, and one minister prayed publicly for the removal of "this evil that has come among us." But Miss Hill persisted. She secured a living house of 3 rooms, porches, outbuildings, old fashioned well at rental of $1.50 per month. Rent how-ever, seems the only reasonable element in mountain expenses. After heroic efforts, days and days of cleaning, the place was made livable and kodaks present it attractive. (These views will appear in later ARROWS). Into this house the barest necessities in furniture were put. (Find list of assets attached). School opened with 14 pupils and closed with 33. Following is the program of closing day exercises.

The organ is a great attraction and was used for the visitors by request. Profusion of bright wild flowers; everything as clean and nice looking as it could be made. (Needed: Pi Beta Phi Pennants and Colors and Motto for Scho'ol). Program Great success! "Nothing like it through here before." In addition to the school work Miss Hill has done much visiting; held regular Mother's meeting; musical evening for the young people; attended public meetings addressing two, and best of all has made friends with those who were unfriendly at the beginning and has received assurances of good will, official in character. Regret at close of the school was universal and its reopening is awaited eagerly. The women have begged that the work be continued and theirs is the greatest need. To them it has meant something new and interesting and who can say what encouragement, what suggestions, what glimpses they may have caught already of "things lovely and of good report" even to a woman, and this in but five months effort. HOUSE FURNISHING Furnishing the Pi Beta Phi house in the mountains has awakened intense interest throughout the fraternity and is a matter of limitless pleasurable possibilities. Miss Louise Van Sant, Maryland Alpha, has been acting chairman of special furnishings which was to cover things needed and desired but not obtainable under the first appropriation. A spirited campaign of solicitation has been conducted among the alumni clubs and in consequence many gifts and pledges have already been received and many more will be the stories of which will doubtless be told in the individual reports, as they should be for the honor should rest peculiarly where it belongs. Mention might be made however of the organ given by Baltimore and Washington Pi Phis jointly for which they sacrificed their Founders' Day banquet, and of the kindness of Mr. Percy Foster of Washington, piano dealer who very generously gave the organ at cost price donating also the stool, crating and cartage and, in addition, Mr. Foster holds for our order 50 song books for assembly use which he will kindly give whenever we are ready to receive them. A pledge of the table silver comes from the Los Angeles Club; of linen from Boston; of a sewing machine from Franklin. Window shades were given by Baltimore; a box of rugs and books by Washington; a cereal double boiler by Philadelphia; magazine subscriptions by Syracuse and may the good work go on. Does not every club and perhaps chapter want to have a place on this honor roll? There is so much that may be done beyond the bare necessities. We have visions of the home and school room both copies of beautiful pictures, kodak work, arts and crafts, needle work for which perchance a market may be found, a stereoptican, a Victrola and even a little Pi Beta Phi Dispensary what may not a fraternity like ours do in a work like this? (Examine list of furnishings attached). Miss Ethel McCullough, Indiana Alpha, Librarian of Evansville, Ind., very kindly took charge of the School and House Library project but the limited time before Convention did not permit development of her plans. She will doubtless be glad to confer with the committee elect. In answer to many questions: 1. It has not seemed wise or necessary to invest in property or attempt the erection of buildings at present or until more thorough investigations are made. 2. Applications for the positions of teacher and nurse are desired; some have been received and will be considered for the coming year. In conclusion then, as the result' of its two years' work, in behalf of the REPORTS OF COMMITTEES 627 Settlement School project the National Committee has the honor to present a Pi Beta Phi school in successful operation with a promising future and the beginning of a Pi Beta Phi home in the mountains. Two meetings of the committee have been held at this Convention, June 27 and 28 at which official action was taken as follows: The National Committee would respectfully recommend to Convention. 1. That Miss Martha Hill be re-engaged as school teacher for the present with a Pi Beta Phi as understudy. 2. That the Chicago Alumna: Club be requested to assume control of the settlement school project, which club has our full confidence for such work. The one city plan makes possible advantages of committee meetings and the reduction of correspondence to a minimum. For the Committee, MARY WALLIHAN GIBSON, Secretary. Finally the chairman desires to thank the whole fraternity most sincerely for its loyal support, its patience and forbearance during these trying two years of the beginnings of things. The work has not been easy, being almost wholly one of correspondence, and conditions have been especially trying but possibly no more so than is common to the development of any large philanthropic project. Especially would she recommend to the fraternity for grateful appreciation her co-laborers on the various committees. The National Committee that by its national character has found the task hard yet, in spite of the difficulties, has brought to it an intelligence, interest, earnestness and sympathy that have made possible whatever success has been attained, and again to those who so unselfishly labored in the money campaign especially Mrs. Branson, Mrs. Bostwick, Miss Stewart, Miss Pettit, and also to the Washington Pi Phis who for two long years have given to this cause their untiring, unselfish devotion, co-operation, inspiration everything at their command. Nor should we forget a word appreciative of Miss Hill on the field who has made our cause her own and accomplished splendid things for us. We are debtors both to the Greeks and Barbarians for kindnesses untold and in re-turn would only offer, "We have kept the Faith We have followed the Creed." Respectfully, EMMA H. TURNER, Chairman.

REPORT OF THE AUDITING COMMITTEE Your auditing committee begs leave to submit the following report: The accounts of your treasurer and sub-treasurer were examined and found to be correct. The committee recommends that the fraternity's uniform treasurers' book be used for the simplification of these accounts, and that numbered vouchers be filed. The committee also recommends the payment of Miss Turner's expense account of $120.66 for the two years now ending, from the appropriation made for current expenses of the school. x. It was voted, in the committee, that the fraternity be asked to appropriate from its treasury the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) a year to help defray the current expenses of the Settlement School during the interim of Convention. 2. It was further voted that the active chapters be released from their pledges, and that pledges hereafter be solicited only from aim-11nm. 3. Voted, that the permanent endowment fund be turned over to the new committee and invested by them as they may decide. ELIZABETH A. HELMICK, Chairman. ANNA R. NICKERSON. MAY COPELAND DRYBREAD.
