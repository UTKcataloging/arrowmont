It is most fitting on behalf of the Settlement School to bring greetings from this youngest national park, Great Smoky Mountain National Park, to the oldest, Yellowstone National Park. As you know, Gatlinburg was an isolated community when the Pi Phis sought it out for a field of philanthropic work twenty-two years ago, and for a long time our School dominated the life was the pulse for a radius of many miles. Now, however, al-though our School continues to wield tremendous power, it must be acknowledged that it is not working altogether with native mountain people. It takes only a short time in the village to become aware of the outside forces which have entered into the life of the community. The rapid changes have consti-tuted the greatest problems and will conti to do so more and more in the coming yE Our Government has located the offices the Park in Gatlinburg, and the Bureau Public Roads has also established its ofl within a stone's throw of our School. Tl two organizations have brought some spirits into the community and many of t, children have come into our schools, and parents are counted among our splendid trons. Perhaps one of the biggest probl arising within the past year was brot about by the locating of several Conse don Camps in close proximity to the Sch Several of our staff assisted in the educatic work done in the camp, and also took in many of the entertainment features. From this it is not to be inferred that need for our School no longer exists. Far f it only a short distance back from the n highway, there has been only slight the in conditions, and in the remote coves need for our work is as great as ever. The School had the largest total en. ment in its history. The classes from the p er through the sixth grade were in the G THE SEPTEMBER ARROW jeanor Brabson and Miriine Tennessee girls who a number of years, taught t grades respectively.

Mr. Don Smith, our Smith-Hughes representative, completed his fifth year's work with our boys, and too much cannot be said in praise of the splendid work he has done with our boys, teaching them agriculture and farm management, just the practical things that boys in that section of the country find so necessary and helpful. Miss Jessie Branham had her usual classes in home economics. The discouraging feature to her was the smallness of her classes, but she was faithful to the few, and we know the girls benefited greatly from her careful instruction. Her classes among the women in several nearby communities were well attended. One of her most enthusiastic groups was a class of high school boys who asked her to teach them cooking in a night class. Just an hour spent visiting this class made me realize that boys need lessons in the culinary arts. These boys were apt listeners, and their delicious food at-tested to their ability to execute their instructions. We realize the high school teachers were discouraged, but this did not retard their interest in carrying on the work both in school and after school hours. Pauline Whaling worked faithfully with the high school boys and girls, teaching a Sunday School class, working in the B.Y.P.U., and holding gym classes both in the afternoons and evenings. We regret her resignation, but we are assured of her active interest in the community, as she is now Mrs. Jack Huff, and her home ad-dress is Gatlinburg; Tenn., or Summit of Mt. Le Conte. Virginia Moore has continued her work as nurse for the school and has given of her services day or night to the entire community. She has worked alone at the hospital as we could not afford an assistant she has had in the past. She has done an exceptionally splendid work in the School, and her health groups were awarded more blue ribbons than. any other school competing in Sevier County. She has been most appreciative of the aid that has come to her through the gifts of clubs and individuals, in the form of layettes, and nursing supplies, such as bandages, dressings, etc. Lucy Field, Texas A, has been bookkeeper for the past year. This was her first year out of school, but her degree signified a good foundation, and her willing spirit of cooperation has been a great help to the Treasurer of the Settlement School, Miss THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Grace Post. It has been a source of great gratification to see the spirit of our workers as they have made sacrifices to help bring us through a period when schools like ours and larger, too, have had to close their doors. We cannot claim that we have made any great strides in advancement, but we are most sincerely grateful that through a loyal cooperation on the part of the staff and the fraternity there has been a way opened for us to keep step with the steady progress we have made in the past twenty-two years. Too much praise cannot be given to Mrs. Mary Ella McDonald who has served for two years as House Manager and Matron of the Girls' Dormitory. Due to her wise guidance the expenses of our boarding department are held to a minimum. The staff are ever grateful to her for the attractive surprises she plans to make living cheerier for them. Those in charge of the Arrow Craft Shop have been able to call this the biggest and best year in the history of the Shop, and owe a debt of gratitude to the alum= clubs and chapters who have come to them and sold the beautiful handwoven articles in all parts of the country. Strange as it may seem, our Shop has had a splendid business and increasing sales each year since it began operations. Mrs. Pattengill, Iowa Z, became manager the first of the year, and with her direction, and Miss Redding and Miss Carr to plan new and attractive articles, the alum= have found a ready market for the finished products. In the month of April there was four times as much sold in the Arrow Craft Shop and Mountain View Hotel Shop as was sold for the same month last year. The co-operation received by the Shop is truly a most satisfying and conclusive evidence that we are filling a need for the community and the women who weave. In one instance, one woman's weaving supports a family of eleven. A visit to our exhibit in the hotel here is a treat and we are happy for each one to come and look at the display. Last fall the American Federation of Art prepared an exhibit of Southern Mountain Handicraft, and as members of the Handicraft Guild, we were asked to contribute some of our weaving, and we proudly prepared a collection which we felt was most representative of the type of things our weavers made. At the timethis exhibit was at the Corcoran Art in Washington, D.C., the Guild pr Mrs. Roosevelt with many articles ft various exhibits. We were delighted sent her a dress pattern of white ca woven by one of our own girls, an was the thrill to Mag Parton when ceived a lovely note of thanks from tl Lady of the United States.

To of the Committee and to Grand chairman wishes to express her for their constant support, their ouncil and help. , may we quote from an article ared in The New Republic of 34. "The question of educating :Man mountaineers is more imn most Americans realize. The s are not a handful of quaint le distilling moonshine and singhan ballads in the forgotten coves Ridge. They number millions. ,ria County in Pennsylvania their ends to northern Georgia and a dabama; it includes portions of ome of the Appalachian counties :he most densely populated and ed rural districts in North ae mountain people closely resem-7k mountaineers and the poor-land people of central Kentucky. On the other hand, they are sharply distinguished from the poor whites of the Cotton Belt, who labor *under the triple burden of poverty, dependency, and contempt. The mountain whites, though equally poor, are proud and self-dependent. "Even in the fifth year of the depression, they are receiving more education than they did at the beginning of the century, and this in spite of the fact that their living conditions have declined during the same period. There are now primary schools al-most everywhere, and even high schools of a fair quality. But the poorer children often can't attend them, because they have no shoes for the winter and no money to buy text-books. And college is usually an insuperable problem for families that don't see thirty dollars in cash from one year's end till the next. A limited approach toward solving this problem has been made by the mountain colleges of which the largest and best known are Berea in Kentucky, Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee and the Berry School in Georgia. "The general problem of educating the mountain people is too big for them ever to solve with the resources at their disposal. It is a problem too widespread and important for private charity. Perhaps the greatest untapped human resources in America are locked up in the Appalachian coves ; they must be released; the mountain people must be given a chance to show what they can do. Abraham Lincoln came from stock like this, in the poor land country of Kentucky. The leaders of the American proletariat in the future may possibly be drawn from much the same back ground." In memory of the group of twelve college girls who at their first meeting in April 1867, voted to send a load of coal to a poor and needy family living near the campus of Monmouth College so are we, their successors, carrying our torch lighted from theirs and doing our share in continuing the responsibility of education we have been doing for twenty-two years in the heart of the Great Smokies. We are pioneer workers in the field; our work has prospered, the community needs us. Let us heed the call for service to the mountain people, we can not fail them! FRANKIE COCHRAN HILL, Chairman THE SEPTEMBER ARROW ECTO ETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL it Is' PI School SCHOOL opened August 6, 1933, with an enrollment of 240 pupils, a decided in-crease in the grammar school but, because of our closing the dormitories, a decrease in the high school. It was necessary for us to have another teacher in the grammar school, where, as a result, we were able to have better organization in the lower grades. The teachers not only give their services in the school room but do community work as well. Without the enforcement of the state attendance law, we depend largely upon the teachers' visits to the homes for keeping up attendance. This year the county board of education paid the salaries of six primary teachers and have been most accommodating in sup-plying the school with chalk, erasers, and floor oil. The county also furnished a bus to bring the grammar children from Cherokee Orchard, Elkmont Mountain, and Sugar-lands. We hope that next year the county will see the need to furnish transportation for high school pupils. Our junior high school, consisting of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades, had a total enrollment of forty pupils with thirteen dropping out before the close of school in April. Some of these pupils moved away, a few were forced to leave school because of sickness, while others said that they had lost interest. While our athletic program did not come up to that of last year because of decreased enrollment, we did have a basketball season directed by Mr. Hampton, the principal, and physical training and volley ball for the girls under the supervision of Pauline Whaling. Diplomas were given to eight girls who completed their eighth grade work, and tenth grade state certificates to four boys and one girl. Practically every one of these last five students hopes to finish his high school work. Parent-Teacher? Association Again we have had a very active and large group in the Parent-Teachers' Association, with more mothers than ever working to continue to provide hot lunches for the school children. At the beginning of the year, the equipment in the lunch room, which is inthe basement of the elementary school b ing, was repainted and necessary sup were replaced. Many undernourished chi] were brought to a normal weight thr, the efforts of the Parent-Teachers. 4A seventy children were fed in the lunch daily. The members raise money to the expense of the lunch room by se pop corn and candy at the basketball g and before and after the movies on F nights. During the fall the P.T.A. sponsor rummage sale and a pie supper. In the si they had box suppers, and this summer had a number of ice cream socials. In way they hope to have a good fund to the lunches in the fall. Home Economics The Smith-Hughes home economics was continued in the high school anc rural districts by Jessie Branham, a gra( of the University of Tennessee. Because c small number of girls enrolled in the high school grades, we thought it advi to give the seventh and eighth grade sewing and cooking. There was a Iota rollment of twenty-four girls in these local school classes, six leaving schoo fore the close of the year. Even though c: were small, many practical problems worked out by the girls, who also have eral finished articles which show spli workmanship. In the fall Miss Brai proved to be very helpful to many o local women when she sponsored a car class. During the early spring eight o local women enrolled in an evening ( making class where many dresses were r Along with the local teaching, Miss ham sponsored adult classes in the G and Laurel Lick and had a class of ei grade girls in the school at Elkmont. F weeks she taught cooking to an evening of high school boys. Agriculture and Farm Undoubtedly our Smith-Hughes vocal agriculture work has been a wonderful ence for the boys attending our schoc well as being an inspiration to the adu this area. In the junior high school ag ture classes, Don Smith had fifteen boy$. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW d their home project work which of the care of milk cows, laying ck gardens, horses, and potatoes.

Health g the past year Miss Virginia Moore, is been carrying on the usual health in Gatlinburg and nearby commu-'ith the cooperation of the county )hysician. Many children have been and examined by Miss Moore and ity doctor. Dental clinics have been different times during the year for Iren from the Gatlinburg, Elkmont, Banner, Glades, and McCookville Well baby clinics were started in the ring and will continue throughout mer in various communities in and itlinburg. During the past eleven regular weekly clinics in the Jennie Memorial Health Center were nec-)r the purpose of infant advice, in-Is, and dressings. [umber of communicable diseases in creased this spring. It was fortunate for us that the greatest number of cases of measles and chicken pox developed during and after the last week of school and did not seriously interfere with attendance. Tuberculin tests were made on 169 children in the II B School, of whom ten were found to be positive. These children will be examined at the regular tuberculosis clinic in Sevierville. A few children at a time were taken all durinb (' the summer. During February and March children in the Grades School received cod liver oil and milk at the noon hour from the funds of the Friends of Mountain Children. A large number of children were found to be under-weight at the time of the school examination. One of the most outstanding health projects of the year was the Blue Ribbon health parade which was held in Sevierville on March 10. We had 117 Blue Ribbon children from the Pi Beta Phi School this year. Last year we had only fifty from the same grades (primer through the eighth). Our school issued more blue ribbons to children than did any other school in the county. A blue ribbon child has had all remediable defects corrected, has been immunized against typhoid, diphtheria, small pox, has kept a satisfactory health habit record for one month, and has done satisfactory school work. Three ninth-grade girls received certificates from the State Health Department in Nashville for completing the course in home hygiene and care of the sick.

Even though National Panhellenic Congress is apparently still unwilling to take a stand on any issue of real importance, something has been achieved when individual fraternities will work closely together to meet specific situations. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that eventually National Panhellenic Congress itself will attain its potential position of influence and effectiveness by adopting a constructive program of cooperation in the things which are vital to the future of fraternities. A situation which is very definitely a Panhellenic problem has arisen, within the past three years, in decreased college enrollments and in decreased financial ability of students to affiliate with fraternities. When all college expenditures must be closely watched and represent sacrifices on the part of parents, it is inevitable that girls should study chapters carefully and affiliate only when they may join the fraternities which represent their real preferences and which offer much both locally and nationally. This situation has tended to strengthen the strong chapters and to weaken those less well established. Al-though some fraternity chapters have been forced to discontinue and some National Panhellenic Congress fraternities have amalgamated with the newer nationals, it is gratifying that no member fraternity of N.P.C. has failed to survive these days of severe testing. Faced with the probability of losing c ters which were unable to pledge and tiate enough girls to make it numerically financially possible for them to continue, era" campuses have put into effect a so-a Quota System. Last fall, five campuses such a system, each campus having its rulings which set some sort of limit upor number of pledges which any chapter a have. The hope was that if the stror groups pledged fewer members, the we ones would be able to pledge enoug] assure their being able to continue. N.P.C. Committee on College Panhelle whose chairman is Miss Green of K .). has recently issued a report on the re achieved this year and has stated that i: opinion the system has failed of its pose. The results have been that the st chapters have been unable to pledge al] girls who wished to affiliate with then many instances, but that the unsucce chapters have still been unable to fill quotas. In spite of the questionable su, of the quota system, however, there is patently an increased demand for it on part of struggling chapters and many i campuses will have some such system it feet this coming fall. There are more ous and far-reaching issues involved than mere ability or inability of any one chapt pledge during a rushing season as r pledges as it needs. Fraternity members face the fact that by keeping girls oh the fraternities which they wish to join, hellenics are either building up a strong 1 of women students with no fraternity filiations, or are forcing girls, who wisl

Mr. Don Smith, our Smith-Hughes representative, completed his fifth year's work with our boys, and too much cannot be said in praise of the splendid work he has done with our boys, teaching them agriculture and farm management, just the practical things that boys in that section of the country find so necessary and helpful. Miss Jessie Branham had her usual classes in home economics. The discouraging feature to her was the smallness of her classes, but she was faithful to the few, and we know the girls benefited greatly from her careful instruction. Her classes among the women in several nearby communities were well attended. One of her most enthusiastic groups was a class of high school boys who asked her to teach them cooking in a night class. Just an hour spent visiting this class made me realize that boys need lessons in the culinary arts. These boys were apt listeners, and their delicious food at-tested to their ability to execute their instructions. We realize the high school teachers were discouraged, but this did not retard their interest in carrying on the work both in school and after school hours. Pauline Whaling worked faithfully with the high school boys and girls, teaching a Sunday School class, working in the B.Y.P.U., and holding gym classes both in the afternoons and evenings. We regret her resignation, but we are assured of her active interest in the community, as she is now Mrs. Jack Huff, and her home ad-dress is Gatlinburg; Tenn., or Summit of Mt. Le Conte. Virginia Moore has continued her work as nurse for the school and has given of her services day or night to the entire community. She has worked alone at the hospital as we could not afford an assistant she has had in the past. She has done an exceptionally splendid work in the School, and her health groups were awarded more blue ribbons than. any other school competing in Sevier County. She has been most appreciative of the aid that has come to her through the gifts of clubs and individuals, in the form of layettes, and nursing supplies, such as bandages, dressings, etc. Lucy Field, Texas A, has been bookkeeper for the past year. This was her first year out of school, but her degree signified a good foundation, and her willing spirit of cooperation has been a great help to the Treasurer of the Settlement School, Miss THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Grace Post. It has been a source of great gratification to see the spirit of our workers as they have made sacrifices to help bring us through a period when schools like ours and larger, too, have had to close their doors. We cannot claim that we have made any great strides in advancement, but we are most sincerely grateful that through a loyal cooperation on the part of the staff and the fraternity there has been a way opened for us to keep step with the steady progress we have made in the past twenty-two years. Too much praise cannot be given to Mrs. Mary Ella McDonald who has served for two years as House Manager and Matron of the Girls' Dormitory. Due to her wise guidance the expenses of our boarding department are held to a minimum. The staff are ever grateful to her for the attractive surprises she plans to make living cheerier for them. Those in charge of the Arrow Craft Shop have been able to call this the biggest and best year in the history of the Shop, and owe a debt of gratitude to the alum= clubs and chapters who have come to them and sold the beautiful handwoven articles in all parts of the country. Strange as it may seem, our Shop has had a splendid business and increasing sales each year since it began operations. Mrs. Pattengill, Iowa Z, became manager the first of the year, and with her direction, and Miss Redding and Miss Carr to plan new and attractive articles, the alum= have found a ready market for the finished products. In the month of April there was four times as much sold in the Arrow Craft Shop and Mountain View Hotel Shop as was sold for the same month last year. The co-operation received by the Shop is truly a most satisfying and conclusive evidence that we are filling a need for the community and the women who weave. In one instance, one woman's weaving supports a family of eleven. A visit to our exhibit in the hotel here is a treat and we are happy for each one to come and look at the display. Last fall the American Federation of Art prepared an exhibit of Southern Mountain Handicraft, and as members of the Handicraft Guild, we were asked to contribute some of our weaving, and we proudly prepared a collection which we felt was most representative of the type of things our weavers made. At the timethis exhibit was at the Corcoran Art in Washington, D.C., the Guild pr Mrs. Roosevelt with many articles ft various exhibits. We were delighted sent her a dress pattern of white ca woven by one of our own girls, an was the thrill to Mag Parton when ceived a lovely note of thanks from tl Lady of the United States.

To of the Committee and to Grand chairman wishes to express her for their constant support, their ouncil and help. , may we quote from an article ared in The New Republic of 34. "The question of educating :Man mountaineers is more imn most Americans realize. The s are not a handful of quaint le distilling moonshine and singhan ballads in the forgotten coves Ridge. They number millions. ,ria County in Pennsylvania their ends to northern Georgia and a dabama; it includes portions of ome of the Appalachian counties :he most densely populated and ed rural districts in North ae mountain people closely resem-7k mountaineers and the poor-land people of central Kentucky. On the other hand, they are sharply distinguished from the poor whites of the Cotton Belt, who labor *under the triple burden of poverty, dependency, and contempt. The mountain whites, though equally poor, are proud and self-dependent. "Even in the fifth year of the depression, they are receiving more education than they did at the beginning of the century, and this in spite of the fact that their living conditions have declined during the same period. There are now primary schools al-most everywhere, and even high schools of a fair quality. But the poorer children often can't attend them, because they have no shoes for the winter and no money to buy text-books. And college is usually an insuperable problem for families that don't see thirty dollars in cash from one year's end till the next. A limited approach toward solving this problem has been made by the mountain colleges of which the largest and best known are Berea in Kentucky, Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee and the Berry School in Georgia. "The general problem of educating the mountain people is too big for them ever to solve with the resources at their disposal. It is a problem too widespread and important for private charity. Perhaps the greatest untapped human resources in America are locked up in the Appalachian coves ; they must be released; the mountain people must be given a chance to show what they can do. Abraham Lincoln came from stock like this, in the poor land country of Kentucky. The leaders of the American proletariat in the future may possibly be drawn from much the same back ground." In memory of the group of twelve college girls who at their first meeting in April 1867, voted to send a load of coal to a poor and needy family living near the campus of Monmouth College so are we, their successors, carrying our torch lighted from theirs and doing our share in continuing the responsibility of education we have been doing for twenty-two years in the heart of the Great Smokies. We are pioneer workers in the field; our work has prospered, the community needs us. Let us heed the call for service to the mountain people, we can not fail them! FRANKIE COCHRAN HILL, Chairman THE SEPTEMBER ARROW ECTO ETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL it Is' PI School SCHOOL opened August 6, 1933, with an enrollment of 240 pupils, a decided in-crease in the grammar school but, because of our closing the dormitories, a decrease in the high school. It was necessary for us to have another teacher in the grammar school, where, as a result, we were able to have better organization in the lower grades. The teachers not only give their services in the school room but do community work as well. Without the enforcement of the state attendance law, we depend largely upon the teachers' visits to the homes for keeping up attendance. This year the county board of education paid the salaries of six primary teachers and have been most accommodating in sup-plying the school with chalk, erasers, and floor oil. The county also furnished a bus to bring the grammar children from Cherokee Orchard, Elkmont Mountain, and Sugar-lands. We hope that next year the county will see the need to furnish transportation for high school pupils. Our junior high school, consisting of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades, had a total enrollment of forty pupils with thirteen dropping out before the close of school in April. Some of these pupils moved away, a few were forced to leave school because of sickness, while others said that they had lost interest. While our athletic program did not come up to that of last year because of decreased enrollment, we did have a basketball season directed by Mr. Hampton, the principal, and physical training and volley ball for the girls under the supervision of Pauline Whaling. Diplomas were given to eight girls who completed their eighth grade work, and tenth grade state certificates to four boys and one girl. Practically every one of these last five students hopes to finish his high school work. Parent-Teacher? Association Again we have had a very active and large group in the Parent-Teachers' Association, with more mothers than ever working to continue to provide hot lunches for the school children. At the beginning of the year, the equipment in the lunch room, which is inthe basement of the elementary school b ing, was repainted and necessary sup were replaced. Many undernourished chi] were brought to a normal weight thr, the efforts of the Parent-Teachers. 4A seventy children were fed in the lunch daily. The members raise money to the expense of the lunch room by se pop corn and candy at the basketball g and before and after the movies on F nights. During the fall the P.T.A. sponsor rummage sale and a pie supper. In the si they had box suppers, and this summer had a number of ice cream socials. In way they hope to have a good fund to the lunches in the fall. Home Economics The Smith-Hughes home economics was continued in the high school anc rural districts by Jessie Branham, a gra( of the University of Tennessee. Because c small number of girls enrolled in the high school grades, we thought it advi to give the seventh and eighth grade sewing and cooking. There was a Iota rollment of twenty-four girls in these local school classes, six leaving schoo fore the close of the year. Even though c: were small, many practical problems worked out by the girls, who also have eral finished articles which show spli workmanship. In the fall Miss Brai proved to be very helpful to many o local women when she sponsored a car class. During the early spring eight o local women enrolled in an evening ( making class where many dresses were r Along with the local teaching, Miss ham sponsored adult classes in the G and Laurel Lick and had a class of ei grade girls in the school at Elkmont. F weeks she taught cooking to an evening of high school boys. Agriculture and Farm Undoubtedly our Smith-Hughes vocal agriculture work has been a wonderful ence for the boys attending our schoc well as being an inspiration to the adu this area. In the junior high school ag ture classes, Don Smith had fifteen boy$. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW d their home project work which of the care of milk cows, laying ck gardens, horses, and potatoes.

Health g the past year Miss Virginia Moore, is been carrying on the usual health in Gatlinburg and nearby commu-'ith the cooperation of the county )hysician. Many children have been and examined by Miss Moore and ity doctor. Dental clinics have been different times during the year for Iren from the Gatlinburg, Elkmont, Banner, Glades, and McCookville Well baby clinics were started in the ring and will continue throughout mer in various communities in and itlinburg. During the past eleven regular weekly clinics in the Jennie Memorial Health Center were nec-)r the purpose of infant advice, in-Is, and dressings. [umber of communicable diseases in creased this spring. It was fortunate for us that the greatest number of cases of measles and chicken pox developed during and after the last week of school and did not seriously interfere with attendance. Tuberculin tests were made on 169 children in the II B School, of whom ten were found to be positive. These children will be examined at the regular tuberculosis clinic in Sevierville. A few children at a time were taken all durinb (' the summer. During February and March children in the Grades School received cod liver oil and milk at the noon hour from the funds of the Friends of Mountain Children. A large number of children were found to be under-weight at the time of the school examination. One of the most outstanding health projects of the year was the Blue Ribbon health parade which was held in Sevierville on March 10. We had 117 Blue Ribbon children from the Pi Beta Phi School this year. Last year we had only fifty from the same grades (primer through the eighth). Our school issued more blue ribbons to children than did any other school in the county. A blue ribbon child has had all remediable defects corrected, has been immunized against typhoid, diphtheria, small pox, has kept a satisfactory health habit record for one month, and has done satisfactory school work. Three ninth-grade girls received certificates from the State Health Department in Nashville for completing the course in home hygiene and care of the sick.

I have also received a copy of the audit of your Settlement School books and Arrow Craft Shop books in Gatlinburg, which was made by Messrs. Homer K. Jones and Company, Certified Public Accountants, of Knoxville, Tennessee. The figures contained in this report have been combined with those shown by the books of your Settlement School Treasurer and the resulting figures are shown in the accompany report BALANCE SHEET It is gratifying to note that the cash position of the School has improved during the year under review and that you now have $9,500 on deposit with the First Trust and Savings Bank of Pasadena, California, as against $3,900 at the beginning of the period. At the same time, the current position of the Arrow Craft Shop has not improved. The cash on deposit has been reduced from $980 to less than $15. The Accounts Receivable have increased $1,500 and the Inventory of Supplies has increased $1,000. Schedule A-2 shows the Fixed Assets in detail, less the reserve for depreciation, and the Live Stock Inventory which was for-warded to your Treasurer from Gatlinburg. Deferred Charges consist of the unexpired portion of insurance and a convention charge against the Arrow Craft Shop. The deposits in the Bank of Sevierville, which was closed at the date of the last audit, have been re-classified by Messrs. Homer K. Jones and Company as Certificates of Deposit and Deposits. As I understand it, 60 per cent o. f the amount left on deposit has been turned into five equal Certificates of Deposit, which are payable, the first on September 5, 1934, and the other four semi-annually thereafter. Accrued Interest Payable represents the interest accrued to July 1, 1934, at 4 per cent, for a six months period on the mortgage of$3,900.

Even though National Panhellenic Congress is apparently still unwilling to take a stand on any issue of real importance, something has been achieved when individual fraternities will work closely together to meet specific situations. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that eventually National Panhellenic Congress itself will attain its potential position of influence and effectiveness by adopting a constructive program of cooperation in the things which are vital to the future of fraternities. A situation which is very definitely a Panhellenic problem has arisen, within the past three years, in decreased college enrollments and in decreased financial ability of students to affiliate with fraternities. When all college expenditures must be closely watched and represent sacrifices on the part of parents, it is inevitable that girls should study chapters carefully and affiliate only when they may join the fraternities which represent their real preferences and which offer much both locally and nationally. This situation has tended to strengthen the strong chapters and to weaken those less well established. Al-though some fraternity chapters have been forced to discontinue and some National Panhellenic Congress fraternities have amalgamated with the newer nationals, it is gratifying that no member fraternity of N.P.C. has failed to survive these days of severe testing. Faced with the probability of losing c ters which were unable to pledge and tiate enough girls to make it numerically financially possible for them to continue, era" campuses have put into effect a so-a Quota System. Last fall, five campuses such a system, each campus having its rulings which set some sort of limit upor number of pledges which any chapter a have. The hope was that if the stror groups pledged fewer members, the we ones would be able to pledge enoug] assure their being able to continue. N.P.C. Committee on College Panhelle whose chairman is Miss Green of K .). has recently issued a report on the re achieved this year and has stated that i: opinion the system has failed of its pose. The results have been that the st chapters have been unable to pledge al] girls who wished to affiliate with then many instances, but that the unsucce chapters have still been unable to fill quotas. In spite of the questionable su, of the quota system, however, there is patently an increased demand for it on part of struggling chapters and many i campuses will have some such system it feet this coming fall. There are more ous and far-reaching issues involved than mere ability or inability of any one chapt pledge during a rushing season as r pledges as it needs. Fraternity members face the fact that by keeping girls oh the fraternities which they wish to join, hellenics are either building up a strong 1 of women students with no fraternity filiations, or are forcing girls, who wisl

To of the Committee and to Grand chairman wishes to express her for their constant support, their ouncil and help. , may we quote from an article ared in The New Republic of 34. "The question of educating :Man mountaineers is more imn most Americans realize. The s are not a handful of quaint le distilling moonshine and singhan ballads in the forgotten coves Ridge. They number millions. ,ria County in Pennsylvania their ends to northern Georgia and a dabama; it includes portions of ome of the Appalachian counties :he most densely populated and ed rural districts in North ae mountain people closely resem-7k mountaineers and the poor-land people of central Kentucky. On the other hand, they are sharply distinguished from the poor whites of the Cotton Belt, who labor *under the triple burden of poverty, dependency, and contempt. The mountain whites, though equally poor, are proud and self-dependent. "Even in the fifth year of the depression, they are receiving more education than they did at the beginning of the century, and this in spite of the fact that their living conditions have declined during the same period. There are now primary schools al-most everywhere, and even high schools of a fair quality. But the poorer children often can't attend them, because they have no shoes for the winter and no money to buy text-books. And college is usually an insuperable problem for families that don't see thirty dollars in cash from one year's end till the next. A limited approach toward solving this problem has been made by the mountain colleges of which the largest and best known are Berea in Kentucky, Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee and the Berry School in Georgia. "The general problem of educating the mountain people is too big for them ever to solve with the resources at their disposal. It is a problem too widespread and important for private charity. Perhaps the greatest untapped human resources in America are locked up in the Appalachian coves ; they must be released; the mountain people must be given a chance to show what they can do. Abraham Lincoln came from stock like this, in the poor land country of Kentucky. The leaders of the American proletariat in the future may possibly be drawn from much the same back ground." In memory of the group of twelve college girls who at their first meeting in April 1867, voted to send a load of coal to a poor and needy family living near the campus of Monmouth College so are we, their successors, carrying our torch lighted from theirs and doing our share in continuing the responsibility of education we have been doing for twenty-two years in the heart of the Great Smokies. We are pioneer workers in the field; our work has prospered, the community needs us. Let us heed the call for service to the mountain people, we can not fail them! FRANKIE COCHRAN HILL, Chairman THE SEPTEMBER ARROW ECTO ETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL it Is' PI School SCHOOL opened August 6, 1933, with an enrollment of 240 pupils, a decided in-crease in the grammar school but, because of our closing the dormitories, a decrease in the high school. It was necessary for us to have another teacher in the grammar school, where, as a result, we were able to have better organization in the lower grades. The teachers not only give their services in the school room but do community work as well. Without the enforcement of the state attendance law, we depend largely upon the teachers' visits to the homes for keeping up attendance. This year the county board of education paid the salaries of six primary teachers and have been most accommodating in sup-plying the school with chalk, erasers, and floor oil. The county also furnished a bus to bring the grammar children from Cherokee Orchard, Elkmont Mountain, and Sugar-lands. We hope that next year the county will see the need to furnish transportation for high school pupils. Our junior high school, consisting of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades, had a total enrollment of forty pupils with thirteen dropping out before the close of school in April. Some of these pupils moved away, a few were forced to leave school because of sickness, while others said that they had lost interest. While our athletic program did not come up to that of last year because of decreased enrollment, we did have a basketball season directed by Mr. Hampton, the principal, and physical training and volley ball for the girls under the supervision of Pauline Whaling. Diplomas were given to eight girls who completed their eighth grade work, and tenth grade state certificates to four boys and one girl. Practically every one of these last five students hopes to finish his high school work. Parent-Teacher? Association Again we have had a very active and large group in the Parent-Teachers' Association, with more mothers than ever working to continue to provide hot lunches for the school children. At the beginning of the year, the equipment in the lunch room, which is inthe basement of the elementary school b ing, was repainted and necessary sup were replaced. Many undernourished chi] were brought to a normal weight thr, the efforts of the Parent-Teachers. 4A seventy children were fed in the lunch daily. The members raise money to the expense of the lunch room by se pop corn and candy at the basketball g and before and after the movies on F nights. During the fall the P.T.A. sponsor rummage sale and a pie supper. In the si they had box suppers, and this summer had a number of ice cream socials. In way they hope to have a good fund to the lunches in the fall. Home Economics The Smith-Hughes home economics was continued in the high school anc rural districts by Jessie Branham, a gra( of the University of Tennessee. Because c small number of girls enrolled in the high school grades, we thought it advi to give the seventh and eighth grade sewing and cooking. There was a Iota rollment of twenty-four girls in these local school classes, six leaving schoo fore the close of the year. Even though c: were small, many practical problems worked out by the girls, who also have eral finished articles which show spli workmanship. In the fall Miss Brai proved to be very helpful to many o local women when she sponsored a car class. During the early spring eight o local women enrolled in an evening ( making class where many dresses were r Along with the local teaching, Miss ham sponsored adult classes in the G and Laurel Lick and had a class of ei grade girls in the school at Elkmont. F weeks she taught cooking to an evening of high school boys. Agriculture and Farm Undoubtedly our Smith-Hughes vocal agriculture work has been a wonderful ence for the boys attending our schoc well as being an inspiration to the adu this area. In the junior high school ag ture classes, Don Smith had fifteen boy$. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW d their home project work which of the care of milk cows, laying ck gardens, horses, and potatoes.

Health g the past year Miss Virginia Moore, is been carrying on the usual health in Gatlinburg and nearby commu-'ith the cooperation of the county )hysician. Many children have been and examined by Miss Moore and ity doctor. Dental clinics have been different times during the year for Iren from the Gatlinburg, Elkmont, Banner, Glades, and McCookville Well baby clinics were started in the ring and will continue throughout mer in various communities in and itlinburg. During the past eleven regular weekly clinics in the Jennie Memorial Health Center were nec-)r the purpose of infant advice, in-Is, and dressings. [umber of communicable diseases in creased this spring. It was fortunate for us that the greatest number of cases of measles and chicken pox developed during and after the last week of school and did not seriously interfere with attendance. Tuberculin tests were made on 169 children in the II B School, of whom ten were found to be positive. These children will be examined at the regular tuberculosis clinic in Sevierville. A few children at a time were taken all durinb (' the summer. During February and March children in the Grades School received cod liver oil and milk at the noon hour from the funds of the Friends of Mountain Children. A large number of children were found to be under-weight at the time of the school examination. One of the most outstanding health projects of the year was the Blue Ribbon health parade which was held in Sevierville on March 10. We had 117 Blue Ribbon children from the Pi Beta Phi School this year. Last year we had only fifty from the same grades (primer through the eighth). Our school issued more blue ribbons to children than did any other school in the county. A blue ribbon child has had all remediable defects corrected, has been immunized against typhoid, diphtheria, small pox, has kept a satisfactory health habit record for one month, and has done satisfactory school work. Three ninth-grade girls received certificates from the State Health Department in Nashville for completing the course in home hygiene and care of the sick.

Even though National Panhellenic Congress is apparently still unwilling to take a stand on any issue of real importance, something has been achieved when individual fraternities will work closely together to meet specific situations. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that eventually National Panhellenic Congress itself will attain its potential position of influence and effectiveness by adopting a constructive program of cooperation in the things which are vital to the future of fraternities. A situation which is very definitely a Panhellenic problem has arisen, within the past three years, in decreased college enrollments and in decreased financial ability of students to affiliate with fraternities. When all college expenditures must be closely watched and represent sacrifices on the part of parents, it is inevitable that girls should study chapters carefully and affiliate only when they may join the fraternities which represent their real preferences and which offer much both locally and nationally. This situation has tended to strengthen the strong chapters and to weaken those less well established. Al-though some fraternity chapters have been forced to discontinue and some National Panhellenic Congress fraternities have amalgamated with the newer nationals, it is gratifying that no member fraternity of N.P.C. has failed to survive these days of severe testing. Faced with the probability of losing c ters which were unable to pledge and tiate enough girls to make it numerically financially possible for them to continue, era" campuses have put into effect a so-a Quota System. Last fall, five campuses such a system, each campus having its rulings which set some sort of limit upor number of pledges which any chapter a have. The hope was that if the stror groups pledged fewer members, the we ones would be able to pledge enoug] assure their being able to continue. N.P.C. Committee on College Panhelle whose chairman is Miss Green of K .). has recently issued a report on the re achieved this year and has stated that i: opinion the system has failed of its pose. The results have been that the st chapters have been unable to pledge al] girls who wished to affiliate with then many instances, but that the unsucce chapters have still been unable to fill quotas. In spite of the questionable su, of the quota system, however, there is patently an increased demand for it on part of struggling chapters and many i campuses will have some such system it feet this coming fall. There are more ous and far-reaching issues involved than mere ability or inability of any one chapt pledge during a rushing season as r pledges as it needs. Fraternity members face the fact that by keeping girls oh the fraternities which they wish to join, hellenics are either building up a strong 1 of women students with no fraternity filiations, or are forcing girls, who wisl

Dental clinics have been different times during the year for Iren from the Gatlinburg, Elkmont, Banner, Glades, and McCookville Well baby clinics were started in the ring and will continue throughout mer in various communities in and itlinburg. During the past eleven regular weekly clinics in the Jennie Memorial Health Center were nec-)r the purpose of infant advice, in-Is, and dressings. [umber of communicable diseases in creased this spring. It was fortunate for us that the greatest number of cases of measles and chicken pox developed during and after the last week of school and did not seriously interfere with attendance. Tuberculin tests were made on 169 children in the II B School, of whom ten were found to be positive. These children will be examined at the regular tuberculosis clinic in Sevierville. A few children at a time were taken all durinb (' the summer. During February and March children in the Grades School received cod liver oil and milk at the noon hour from the funds of the Friends of Mountain Children. A large number of children were found to be under-weight at the time of the school examination. One of the most outstanding health projects of the year was the Blue Ribbon health parade which was held in Sevierville on March 10. We had 117 Blue Ribbon children from the Pi Beta Phi School this year. Last year we had only fifty from the same grades (primer through the eighth). Our school issued more blue ribbons to children than did any other school in the county. A blue ribbon child has had all remediable defects corrected, has been immunized against typhoid, diphtheria, small pox, has kept a satisfactory health habit record for one month, and has done satisfactory school work. Three ninth-grade girls received certificates from the State Health Department in Nashville for completing the course in home hygiene and care of the sick.

Respectfully submitted, MARYALICE CHAFFEE THE SEPTEMBER ARROW EPO T OF THE 'T'I'EASU .E OF PI \ ETA PH] I' \ SETTLEMENT SCHOOL NATIONAL BOARD OF TRUSTEE FUNDS, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Mrs. Lois Franklin Stoolman, Chairman, 1001 South Third Street, Champaign, Illinois, Ladies: In accordance with the request of Miss Grace Post, who is your Settlement School Treasurer, I have made an audit of the books and records of your Settlement School, which she keeps as Treasurer, for the year ended June 30, 1934. I have also received a copy of the audit of your Settlement School books and Arrow Craft Shop books in Gatlinburg, which was made by Messrs. Homer K. Jones and Company, Certified Public Accountants, of Knoxville, Tennessee. The figures contained in this report have been combined with those shown by the books of your Settlement School Treasurer and the resulting figures are shown in the accompany report BALANCE SHEET It is gratifying to note that the cash position of the School has improved during the year under review and that you now have $9,500 on deposit with the First Trust and Savings Bank of Pasadena, California, as against $3,900 at the beginning of the period. At the same time, the current position of the Arrow Craft Shop has not improved. The cash on deposit has been reduced from $980 to less than $15. The Accounts Receivable have increased $1,500 and the Inventory of Supplies has increased $1,000. Schedule A-2 shows the Fixed Assets in detail, less the reserve for depreciation, and the Live Stock Inventory which was for-warded to your Treasurer from Gatlinburg. Deferred Charges consist of the unexpired portion of insurance and a convention charge against the Arrow Craft Shop. The deposits in the Bank of Sevierville, which was closed at the date of the last audit, have been re-classified by Messrs. Homer K. Jones and Company as Certificates of Deposit and Deposits.

Even though National Panhellenic Congress is apparently still unwilling to take a stand on any issue of real importance, something has been achieved when individual fraternities will work closely together to meet specific situations. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that eventually National Panhellenic Congress itself will attain its potential position of influence and effectiveness by adopting a constructive program of cooperation in the things which are vital to the future of fraternities. A situation which is very definitely a Panhellenic problem has arisen, within the past three years, in decreased college enrollments and in decreased financial ability of students to affiliate with fraternities. When all college expenditures must be closely watched and represent sacrifices on the part of parents, it is inevitable that girls should study chapters carefully and affiliate only when they may join the fraternities which represent their real preferences and which offer much both locally and nationally. This situation has tended to strengthen the strong chapters and to weaken those less well established. Al-though some fraternity chapters have been forced to discontinue and some National Panhellenic Congress fraternities have amalgamated with the newer nationals, it is gratifying that no member fraternity of N.P.C. has failed to survive these days of severe testing. Faced with the probability of losing c ters which were unable to pledge and tiate enough girls to make it numerically financially possible for them to continue, era" campuses have put into effect a so-a Quota System. Last fall, five campuses such a system, each campus having its rulings which set some sort of limit upor number of pledges which any chapter a have. The hope was that if the stror groups pledged fewer members, the we ones would be able to pledge enoug] assure their being able to continue. N.P.C. Committee on College Panhelle whose chairman is Miss Green of K .). has recently issued a report on the re achieved this year and has stated that i: opinion the system has failed of its pose. The results have been that the st chapters have been unable to pledge al] girls who wished to affiliate with then many instances, but that the unsucce chapters have still been unable to fill quotas. In spite of the questionable su, of the quota system, however, there is patently an increased demand for it on part of struggling chapters and many i campuses will have some such system it feet this coming fall. There are more ous and far-reaching issues involved than mere ability or inability of any one chapt pledge during a rushing season as r pledges as it needs. Fraternity members face the fact that by keeping girls oh the fraternities which they wish to join, hellenics are either building up a strong 1 of women students with no fraternity filiations, or are forcing girls, who wisl

Even though National Panhellenic Congress is apparently still unwilling to take a stand on any issue of real importance, something has been achieved when individual fraternities will work closely together to meet specific situations. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that eventually National Panhellenic Congress itself will attain its potential position of influence and effectiveness by adopting a constructive program of cooperation in the things which are vital to the future of fraternities. A situation which is very definitely a Panhellenic problem has arisen, within the past three years, in decreased college enrollments and in decreased financial ability of students to affiliate with fraternities. When all college expenditures must be closely watched and represent sacrifices on the part of parents, it is inevitable that girls should study chapters carefully and affiliate only when they may join the fraternities which represent their real preferences and which offer much both locally and nationally. This situation has tended to strengthen the strong chapters and to weaken those less well established. Al-though some fraternity chapters have been forced to discontinue and some National Panhellenic Congress fraternities have amalgamated with the newer nationals, it is gratifying that no member fraternity of N.P.C. has failed to survive these days of severe testing. Faced with the probability of losing c ters which were unable to pledge and tiate enough girls to make it numerically financially possible for them to continue, era" campuses have put into effect a so-a Quota System. Last fall, five campuses such a system, each campus having its rulings which set some sort of limit upor number of pledges which any chapter a have. The hope was that if the stror groups pledged fewer members, the we ones would be able to pledge enoug] assure their being able to continue. N.P.C. Committee on College Panhelle whose chairman is Miss Green of K .). has recently issued a report on the re achieved this year and has stated that i: opinion the system has failed of its pose. The results have been that the st chapters have been unable to pledge al] girls who wished to affiliate with then many instances, but that the unsucce chapters have still been unable to fill quotas. In spite of the questionable su, of the quota system, however, there is patently an increased demand for it on part of struggling chapters and many i campuses will have some such system it feet this coming fall. There are more ous and far-reaching issues involved than mere ability or inability of any one chapt pledge during a rushing season as r pledges as it needs. Fraternity members face the fact that by keeping girls oh the fraternities which they wish to join, hellenics are either building up a strong 1 of women students with no fraternity filiations, or are forcing girls, who wisl

Even though National Panhellenic Congress is apparently still unwilling to take a stand on any issue of real importance, something has been achieved when individual fraternities will work closely together to meet specific situations. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that eventually National Panhellenic Congress itself will attain its potential position of influence and effectiveness by adopting a constructive program of cooperation in the things which are vital to the future of fraternities. A situation which is very definitely a Panhellenic problem has arisen, within the past three years, in decreased college enrollments and in decreased financial ability of students to affiliate with fraternities. When all college expenditures must be closely watched and represent sacrifices on the part of parents, it is inevitable that girls should study chapters carefully and affiliate only when they may join the fraternities which represent their real preferences and which offer much both locally and nationally. This situation has tended to strengthen the strong chapters and to weaken those less well established. Al-though some fraternity chapters have been forced to discontinue and some National Panhellenic Congress fraternities have amalgamated with the newer nationals, it is gratifying that no member fraternity of N.P.C. has failed to survive these days of severe testing. Faced with the probability of losing c ters which were unable to pledge and tiate enough girls to make it numerically financially possible for them to continue, era" campuses have put into effect a so-a Quota System. Last fall, five campuses such a system, each campus having its rulings which set some sort of limit upor number of pledges which any chapter a have. The hope was that if the stror groups pledged fewer members, the we ones would be able to pledge enoug] assure their being able to continue. N.P.C. Committee on College Panhelle whose chairman is Miss Green of K .). has recently issued a report on the re achieved this year and has stated that i: opinion the system has failed of its pose. The results have been that the st chapters have been unable to pledge al] girls who wished to affiliate with then many instances, but that the unsucce chapters have still been unable to fill quotas. In spite of the questionable su, of the quota system, however, there is patently an increased demand for it on part of struggling chapters and many i campuses will have some such system it feet this coming fall. There are more ous and far-reaching issues involved than mere ability or inability of any one chapt pledge during a rushing season as r pledges as it needs. Fraternity members face the fact that by keeping girls oh the fraternities which they wish to join, hellenics are either building up a strong 1 of women students with no fraternity filiations, or are forcing girls, who wisl

Even though National Panhellenic Congress is apparently still unwilling to take a stand on any issue of real importance, something has been achieved when individual fraternities will work closely together to meet specific situations. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that eventually National Panhellenic Congress itself will attain its potential position of influence and effectiveness by adopting a constructive program of cooperation in the things which are vital to the future of fraternities. A situation which is very definitely a Panhellenic problem has arisen, within the past three years, in decreased college enrollments and in decreased financial ability of students to affiliate with fraternities. When all college expenditures must be closely watched and represent sacrifices on the part of parents, it is inevitable that girls should study chapters carefully and affiliate only when they may join the fraternities which represent their real preferences and which offer much both locally and nationally. This situation has tended to strengthen the strong chapters and to weaken those less well established. Al-though some fraternity chapters have been forced to discontinue and some National Panhellenic Congress fraternities have amalgamated with the newer nationals, it is gratifying that no member fraternity of N.P.C. has failed to survive these days of severe testing. Faced with the probability of losing c ters which were unable to pledge and tiate enough girls to make it numerically financially possible for them to continue, era" campuses have put into effect a so-a Quota System. Last fall, five campuses such a system, each campus having its rulings which set some sort of limit upor number of pledges which any chapter a have. The hope was that if the stror groups pledged fewer members, the we ones would be able to pledge enoug] assure their being able to continue. N.P.C. Committee on College Panhelle whose chairman is Miss Green of K .). has recently issued a report on the re achieved this year and has stated that i: opinion the system has failed of its pose. The results have been that the st chapters have been unable to pledge al] girls who wished to affiliate with then many instances, but that the unsucce chapters have still been unable to fill quotas. In spite of the questionable su, of the quota system, however, there is patently an increased demand for it on part of struggling chapters and many i campuses will have some such system it feet this coming fall. There are more ous and far-reaching issues involved than mere ability or inability of any one chapt pledge during a rushing season as r pledges as it needs. Fraternity members face the fact that by keeping girls oh the fraternities which they wish to join, hellenics are either building up a strong 1 of women students with no fraternity filiations, or are forcing girls, who wisl

It is most fitting on behalf of the Settlement School to bring greetings from this youngest national park, Great Smoky Mountain National Park, to the oldest, Yellowstone National Park. As you know, Gatlinburg was an isolated community when the Pi Phis sought it out for a field of philanthropic work twenty-two years ago, and for a long time our School dominated the life was the pulse for a radius of many miles. Now, however, al-though our School continues to wield tremendous power, it must be acknowledged that it is not working altogether with native mountain people. It takes only a short time in the village to become aware of the outside forces which have entered into the life of the community. The rapid changes have consti-tuted the greatest problems and will conti to do so more and more in the coming yE Our Government has located the offices the Park in Gatlinburg, and the Bureau Public Roads has also established its ofl within a stone's throw of our School. Tl two organizations have brought some spirits into the community and many of t, children have come into our schools, and parents are counted among our splendid trons. Perhaps one of the biggest probl arising within the past year was brot about by the locating of several Conse don Camps in close proximity to the Sch Several of our staff assisted in the educatic work done in the camp, and also took in many of the entertainment features. From this it is not to be inferred that need for our School no longer exists. Far f it only a short distance back from the n highway, there has been only slight the in conditions, and in the remote coves need for our work is as great as ever. The School had the largest total en. ment in its history.

Mr. Don Smith, our Smith-Hughes representative, completed his fifth year's work with our boys, and too much cannot be said in praise of the splendid work he has done with our boys, teaching them agriculture and farm management, just the practical things that boys in that section of the country find so necessary and helpful. Miss Jessie Branham had her usual classes in home economics. The discouraging feature to her was the smallness of her classes, but she was faithful to the few, and we know the girls benefited greatly from her careful instruction. Her classes among the women in several nearby communities were well attended. One of her most enthusiastic groups was a class of high school boys who asked her to teach them cooking in a night class. Just an hour spent visiting this class made me realize that boys need lessons in the culinary arts. These boys were apt listeners, and their delicious food at-tested to their ability to execute their instructions. We realize the high school teachers were discouraged, but this did not retard their interest in carrying on the work both in school and after school hours. Pauline Whaling worked faithfully with the high school boys and girls, teaching a Sunday School class, working in the B.Y.P.U., and holding gym classes both in the afternoons and evenings. We regret her resignation, but we are assured of her active interest in the community, as she is now Mrs. Jack Huff, and her home ad-dress is Gatlinburg; Tenn., or Summit of Mt. Le Conte. Virginia Moore has continued her work as nurse for the school and has given of her services day or night to the entire community. She has worked alone at the hospital as we could not afford an assistant she has had in the past. She has done an exceptionally splendid work in the School, and her health groups were awarded more blue ribbons than. any other school competing in Sevier County. She has been most appreciative of the aid that has come to her through the gifts of clubs and individuals, in the form of layettes, and nursing supplies, such as bandages, dressings, etc. Lucy Field, Texas A, has been bookkeeper for the past year. This was her first year out of school, but her degree signified a good foundation, and her willing spirit of cooperation has been a great help to the Treasurer of the Settlement School, Miss THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Grace Post. It has been a source of great gratification to see the spirit of our workers as they have made sacrifices to help bring us through a period when schools like ours and larger, too, have had to close their doors. We cannot claim that we have made any great strides in advancement, but we are most sincerely grateful that through a loyal cooperation on the part of the staff and the fraternity there has been a way opened for us to keep step with the steady progress we have made in the past twenty-two years. Too much praise cannot be given to Mrs. Mary Ella McDonald who has served for two years as House Manager and Matron of the Girls' Dormitory. Due to her wise guidance the expenses of our boarding department are held to a minimum. The staff are ever grateful to her for the attractive surprises she plans to make living cheerier for them. Those in charge of the Arrow Craft Shop have been able to call this the biggest and best year in the history of the Shop, and owe a debt of gratitude to the alum= clubs and chapters who have come to them and sold the beautiful handwoven articles in all parts of the country. Strange as it may seem, our Shop has had a splendid business and increasing sales each year since it began operations. Mrs. Pattengill, Iowa Z, became manager the first of the year, and with her direction, and Miss Redding and Miss Carr to plan new and attractive articles, the alum= have found a ready market for the finished products. In the month of April there was four times as much sold in the Arrow Craft Shop and Mountain View Hotel Shop as was sold for the same month last year. The co-operation received by the Shop is truly a most satisfying and conclusive evidence that we are filling a need for the community and the women who weave. In one instance, one woman's weaving supports a family of eleven. A visit to our exhibit in the hotel here is a treat and we are happy for each one to come and look at the display. Last fall the American Federation of Art prepared an exhibit of Southern Mountain Handicraft, and as members of the Handicraft Guild, we were asked to contribute some of our weaving, and we proudly prepared a collection which we felt was most representative of the type of things our weavers made. At the timethis exhibit was at the Corcoran Art in Washington, D.C., the Guild pr Mrs. Roosevelt with many articles ft various exhibits.

To of the Committee and to Grand chairman wishes to express her for their constant support, their ouncil and help. , may we quote from an article ared in The New Republic of 34. "The question of educating :Man mountaineers is more imn most Americans realize. The s are not a handful of quaint le distilling moonshine and singhan ballads in the forgotten coves Ridge. They number millions. ,ria County in Pennsylvania their ends to northern Georgia and a dabama; it includes portions of ome of the Appalachian counties :he most densely populated and ed rural districts in North ae mountain people closely resem-7k mountaineers and the poor-land people of central Kentucky. On the other hand, they are sharply distinguished from the poor whites of the Cotton Belt, who labor *under the triple burden of poverty, dependency, and contempt. The mountain whites, though equally poor, are proud and self-dependent. "Even in the fifth year of the depression, they are receiving more education than they did at the beginning of the century, and this in spite of the fact that their living conditions have declined during the same period. There are now primary schools al-most everywhere, and even high schools of a fair quality. But the poorer children often can't attend them, because they have no shoes for the winter and no money to buy text-books. And college is usually an insuperable problem for families that don't see thirty dollars in cash from one year's end till the next. A limited approach toward solving this problem has been made by the mountain colleges of which the largest and best known are Berea in Kentucky, Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee and the Berry School in Georgia. "The general problem of educating the mountain people is too big for them ever to solve with the resources at their disposal. It is a problem too widespread and important for private charity. Perhaps the greatest untapped human resources in America are locked up in the Appalachian coves ; they must be released; the mountain people must be given a chance to show what they can do. Abraham Lincoln came from stock like this, in the poor land country of Kentucky. The leaders of the American proletariat in the future may possibly be drawn from much the same back ground." In memory of the group of twelve college girls who at their first meeting in April 1867, voted to send a load of coal to a poor and needy family living near the campus of Monmouth College so are we, their successors, carrying our torch lighted from theirs and doing our share in continuing the responsibility of education we have been doing for twenty-two years in the heart of the Great Smokies. We are pioneer workers in the field; our work has prospered, the community needs us. Let us heed the call for service to the mountain people, we can not fail them! FRANKIE COCHRAN HILL, Chairman THE SEPTEMBER ARROW ECTO ETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL it Is' PI School SCHOOL opened August 6, 1933, with an enrollment of 240 pupils, a decided in-crease in the grammar school but, because of our closing the dormitories, a decrease in the high school. It was necessary for us to have another teacher in the grammar school, where, as a result, we were able to have better organization in the lower grades. The teachers not only give their services in the school room but do community work as well. Without the enforcement of the state attendance law, we depend largely upon the teachers' visits to the homes for keeping up attendance. This year the county board of education paid the salaries of six primary teachers and have been most accommodating in sup-plying the school with chalk, erasers, and floor oil. The county also furnished a bus to bring the grammar children from Cherokee Orchard, Elkmont Mountain, and Sugar-lands. We hope that next year the county will see the need to furnish transportation for high school pupils. Our junior high school, consisting of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades, had a total enrollment of forty pupils with thirteen dropping out before the close of school in April. Some of these pupils moved away, a few were forced to leave school because of sickness, while others said that they had lost interest. While our athletic program did not come up to that of last year because of decreased enrollment, we did have a basketball season directed by Mr. Hampton, the principal, and physical training and volley ball for the girls under the supervision of Pauline Whaling. Diplomas were given to eight girls who completed their eighth grade work, and tenth grade state certificates to four boys and one girl. Practically every one of these last five students hopes to finish his high school work. Parent-Teacher? Association Again we have had a very active and large group in the Parent-Teachers' Association, with more mothers than ever working to continue to provide hot lunches for the school children. At the beginning of the year, the equipment in the lunch room, which is inthe basement of the elementary school b ing, was repainted and necessary sup were replaced. Many undernourished chi] were brought to a normal weight thr, the efforts of the Parent-Teachers. 4A seventy children were fed in the lunch daily. The members raise money to the expense of the lunch room by se pop corn and candy at the basketball g and before and after the movies on F nights. During the fall the P.T.A. sponsor rummage sale and a pie supper. In the si they had box suppers, and this summer had a number of ice cream socials. In way they hope to have a good fund to the lunches in the fall. Home Economics The Smith-Hughes home economics was continued in the high school anc rural districts by Jessie Branham, a gra( of the University of Tennessee. Because c small number of girls enrolled in the high school grades, we thought it advi to give the seventh and eighth grade sewing and cooking. There was a Iota rollment of twenty-four girls in these local school classes, six leaving schoo fore the close of the year. Even though c: were small, many practical problems worked out by the girls, who also have eral finished articles which show spli workmanship. In the fall Miss Brai proved to be very helpful to many o local women when she sponsored a car class. During the early spring eight o local women enrolled in an evening ( making class where many dresses were r Along with the local teaching, Miss ham sponsored adult classes in the G and Laurel Lick and had a class of ei grade girls in the school at Elkmont. F weeks she taught cooking to an evening of high school boys. Agriculture and Farm Undoubtedly our Smith-Hughes vocal agriculture work has been a wonderful ence for the boys attending our schoc well as being an inspiration to the adu this area. In the junior high school ag ture classes, Don Smith had fifteen boy$. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW d their home project work which of the care of milk cows, laying ck gardens, horses, and potatoes.

Health g the past year Miss Virginia Moore, is been carrying on the usual health in Gatlinburg and nearby commu-'ith the cooperation of the county )hysician. Many children have been and examined by Miss Moore and ity doctor. Dental clinics have been different times during the year for Iren from the Gatlinburg, Elkmont, Banner, Glades, and McCookville Well baby clinics were started in the ring and will continue throughout mer in various communities in and itlinburg. During the past eleven regular weekly clinics in the Jennie Memorial Health Center were nec-)r the purpose of infant advice, in-Is, and dressings. [umber of communicable diseases in creased this spring. It was fortunate for us that the greatest number of cases of measles and chicken pox developed during and after the last week of school and did not seriously interfere with attendance. Tuberculin tests were made on 169 children in the II B School, of whom ten were found to be positive. These children will be examined at the regular tuberculosis clinic in Sevierville. A few children at a time were taken all durinb (' the summer. During February and March children in the Grades School received cod liver oil and milk at the noon hour from the funds of the Friends of Mountain Children. A large number of children were found to be under-weight at the time of the school examination. One of the most outstanding health projects of the year was the Blue Ribbon health parade which was held in Sevierville on March 10. We had 117 Blue Ribbon children from the Pi Beta Phi School this year. Last year we had only fifty from the same grades (primer through the eighth). Our school issued more blue ribbons to children than did any other school in the county. A blue ribbon child has had all remediable defects corrected, has been immunized against typhoid, diphtheria, small pox, has kept a satisfactory health habit record for one month, and has done satisfactory school work. Three ninth-grade girls received certificates from the State Health Department in Nashville for completing the course in home hygiene and care of the sick.

Even though National Panhellenic Congress is apparently still unwilling to take a stand on any issue of real importance, something has been achieved when individual fraternities will work closely together to meet specific situations. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that eventually National Panhellenic Congress itself will attain its potential position of influence and effectiveness by adopting a constructive program of cooperation in the things which are vital to the future of fraternities. A situation which is very definitely a Panhellenic problem has arisen, within the past three years, in decreased college enrollments and in decreased financial ability of students to affiliate with fraternities. When all college expenditures must be closely watched and represent sacrifices on the part of parents, it is inevitable that girls should study chapters carefully and affiliate only when they may join the fraternities which represent their real preferences and which offer much both locally and nationally. This situation has tended to strengthen the strong chapters and to weaken those less well established. Al-though some fraternity chapters have been forced to discontinue and some National Panhellenic Congress fraternities have amalgamated with the newer nationals, it is gratifying that no member fraternity of N.P.C. has failed to survive these days of severe testing. Faced with the probability of losing c ters which were unable to pledge and tiate enough girls to make it numerically financially possible for them to continue, era" campuses have put into effect a so-a Quota System. Last fall, five campuses such a system, each campus having its rulings which set some sort of limit upor number of pledges which any chapter a have. The hope was that if the stror groups pledged fewer members, the we ones would be able to pledge enoug] assure their being able to continue. N.P.C. Committee on College Panhelle whose chairman is Miss Green of K .). has recently issued a report on the re achieved this year and has stated that i: opinion the system has failed of its pose. The results have been that the st chapters have been unable to pledge al] girls who wished to affiliate with then many instances, but that the unsucce chapters have still been unable to fill quotas. In spite of the questionable su, of the quota system, however, there is patently an increased demand for it on part of struggling chapters and many i campuses will have some such system it feet this coming fall. There are more ous and far-reaching issues involved than mere ability or inability of any one chapt pledge during a rushing season as r pledges as it needs. Fraternity members face the fact that by keeping girls oh the fraternities which they wish to join, hellenics are either building up a strong 1 of women students with no fraternity filiations, or are forcing girls, who wisl
