The interest shown in the repeated and generous assistance to the same child through several years has afforded much pleasure and satisfaction to many groups. Some children who have been sponsored over a period of two or three years have been able to get along without further help and these sponsorships to others where the need was most pressing. Berkeley, California, Alumnae Club, Ontario Alpha, and Kansas Alpha have given full sponsorships this year. Harrisburg-Carlisle Pennsylvania Club and Manitoba Alpha have taken one together. The other contributions have been used frequently as a unit. The contributions are as follows: Berkeley, California Alum= Club $96.00 Calgary, Alberta Alumna Club 8.00 Harrisburg-Carlisle, Pennsylvania Club 48.00 Wilmington, Delaware Alumna Club 10.00 Kansas A 96.00 Manitoba A 40.00 Ontario A 98.00 Wyoming A 5.00 Your contact member has enjoyed the opportunity of being of service and also the pleasure in the many contacts which this has made possible. Respectfully submitted, LOIS F. STOOLMAN, Contact Member Committee Ieeport. CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE . This is a report of a year's co-operation and if you do not believe in co-operation, try running your car with only three wheels. The Settlement School can be visualized as a three-legged stool on which each leg is equally important. One leg on the Settlement School stool is the Pi Beta Phi membership; the second leg is the Settlement School Committee and Grand Council, and the third leg is the local staff . It is impossible to decide which leg is the most vital for unless all three function to give support, the stool cannot render the service for which it was intended. The first leg, the Pi Beta Phi membership, voluntarily through the years without assessment has provided the financial support for the fraternity's philanthropic project through gifts of money, Arrowcraft sales and work. The Settlement School theme song to the membership could well be "You Made Me What I Am Today." Last year, 89 active chapters contributed and the following 7 Provinces (old) co-operated 100% in support of the Settlement School: Alpha West, Beta, Delta, Iota, Epsilon, Kappa, Mu. Three chapters which gave $100.00 or more were Indiana Gamma, $100.00; Missouri Beta, $150.00 and Texas Alpha, $100.00. There were 242 alumnle clubs which made gifts and 5 Provinces (old) supported the project 100%: Gamma, Epsilon, Delta, Iota, Mu. There were 10 clubs which contributed $150.00 or more and (*) marks those whose gifts were increased over the previous year. St. Louis, Mo $900.00 *Seattle, Wash $200.00 *Houston, Tex 400.00 Northern New jersey 175.00 Kansas City, Mo 300.00 Cleveland East 166.00 Philadelphia, Pa. . . 250.00 *Sabine District, Tex. . 163.00 Indianapolis, Ind. . 210.00 Denver, Colo 150.00 The new Newark-Granville, Ohio Club sent a Loyalty Day check in addition to the regular gift. There was a slight increase in the total sum of annual gifts and this trend was gratefully recognized and encouraged for the future. Obviously the above income was not sufficient, but thanks to a large number of chapters and clubs, $7987.31 was realized in magazine commissions. This was approximately $500.00 more than last year and almost reached the goal of $8000.00. It was encouraging to note that 119 clubs and 46 chapters increased their magazine commis-'lions. Texas Alpha was highest among chapters and Denver, Colorado led the alumnx clubs. California Zeta and the San Jose, California Alumnx Club rated special mention for the highest commissions per capita. If all chapters and clubs realized how much the Settlement School budget counted on the additional funds from magazine commissions, they would work out a business-like method for securing greater sales. Although no drive was made for funds to complete the furnishings of the Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House, additional money was received which will make possible future purchases to meet some needs. The generous friends who gave in addition to regular gifts were Newark-Granville, Ohio Club, Chicago South Club, Houston, Texas Club, Corpus Christi, Texas Club, Indianola, Iowa Club, Pittsburgh, Pa. Club. Three clubs, Southwestern Indiana, Champaign-Urbana and Seattle, Washington sent final payments for their bed-rooms and that meant all bedrooms were paid in full. Mrs. D. C. Stevenson sent a birthday check to be used for something extra in the memorial room for her daughter, Suzanne Stevenson Knight. A tea cart in memory of Gladys Reineke Finch was purchased with the money from Detroit, Michigan. With the money from I Ky. two serving tables were added in honor c Woerner, a former Settlement School treasurer. 'I additions to the dining room match the cherry and will see daily use. Albany, N.Y. Club presentee tray in memory of Dorothy Pavey as did the MG Club which honored May Keller. Even with the gifts, the tea table leaves much to be desired N staff has an open house. The Health Center received the Sigma Phi Gan rective Fund and this year the amount available w; double. This was used for glasses for the neediest c Yuba-Sutter Club sent $10 for medicinal suppli( Health Center. Through the years, individual members, clubs an have sent memorial gifts to Settlement School in flowers in times of bereavement. These have always lated until sufficient funds were available for the pu some special piece of equipment. It was voted to bt freeze for the Staff House. Not only will this male sible to freeze our own chickens and garden pr the right moment, but it will allow economical pu. meat in quantity. The present refrigeration did not ice-making unit; so the freezer will furnish ice c the staff after Workshop. Pi Phis found still another way to remember th Sums of money were sent to permit the librarian needed books to the Grace Coolidge Library. Man mas gifts to share with the three rural schools were Eventually these inadequate, one-room schools will t but until that day they are the only schools son] mountain children will know. What did this support with money accompl: one thing, it furnished teachers for Physical Educe Health, Arts and Crafts, Music, Woodworking and ism plus needed supplies for their classes. Pi Phi r operates the school, for the County reached the poi it could supply the basic educational program. Th( of teachers was determined by the average daily al and this secured just enough for the minimum The fraternity supplied the additional teachers jects which are considered important in most throughout the country. About half of the children school bus. They walked down the little mountain wait along_ the highway for the bus. Pi Phi-money made it possible for. children fro: mountain home to finish their high school educ Pi Phi dorms .for $5 a month plus a willingness t specified number of hours each month, young pee during the school year. The training obtained the kitchen and dining room work was extremely val perience in a town which catered to the tourist its main "industry." This support made it possible to keep up the which every 365 days grows a year older. The year-old chlorinator gave out this fall and had placed. From the standpoint of sanitation and ec, was wise to dispose of the mules and to buy which did not eat feed during the winter. A stol first furnace in Gatlinburg resulted in more ec comfortable heat in Teachers' Cottage. Hot watt wore out just as buildings forty years in use neec ing, repairing and renovation. A wind storm blew Heath Center sign and necessitated replacement. tion utilities were supplied with the funds. Th maintained the school buildings but buildings by Pi Phi and the County could be easily distingu to the difference in standards. Future supervision better results. 37 3 The money supplied by the Pi Phis also protected the .ant with adequate insurance. The Settlement School has ways been safe-guarded in every way with insurance proction. Committed to the preservation and spread of the crafts, was fitting that the Settlement School housed the eleventh nnmer Craft Workshop sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and to University of Tennessee. For several years this project u been self-supporting. It is an inspiring thought that i Phi came to bring educational privileges to this area at in turn found the people had the crafts which Pi hi could help them share with the rest of the world. hrough the Workshop students, the crafts have crossed le mountains to go into all parts of the country. This year Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tenessee again united in the promotion of its first Foreign raft Study Tour. There were twenty-four people who left my 20 for Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, France rid England where, under the tutelage of Professor Marian [eard of UT, Director of Craft Workshop and a member f Pi Beta Phi, they gained an appreciation of the craftsien of other countries. It was interesting to see that eleven f the student tourists had attended Workshop at Settle-lent School. You recall that the words of the song mentioned above lent something like this. "You made me what I am today; I hope you're satisfied." t is hoped that Pi Phi is proud of Settlement School and :s contribution to that area, but it is hoped that the fra-!rnity is not completely satisfied. A certain kind of disatisfaction results in progress. It is not the leap at the tart but the steady going that gets there. The Settlement chool could have a magnificent plant but if the continued upport of the membership was not forthcoming each year, he whole project would collapse. With continued high :osts, Pi Phi groups are asked to rethink contributions anivally for if gifts remain the same as they were ten ears ago, it is a certain fact the Settlement School ex-)enses have not done so. The Committee is grateful for he many hours of work and planning which made the financial support possible. Everybody' business is nobody's business; hence a Settlenent School Committee came into existence. The sec-)nd leg of this "Settlement School stool," the Committee and Grand Council, assumed responsibility for this Pi ,Phi Droject. Money in the bank and a plant needed supervision Ind a staff as well as a program. Five women from different parts of the country served this year on the Committee and each had a specific assignment. There was a chairman, who functioned as most of those do, and there .was Mrs. Thomas Graham, the treasurer, who spent hours df work receiving, recording and disbursing the SettleMent School money. Mrs. Fred Archibald served as secretary; Mrs. Clare Dobler was the Publicity member and prepared material for Arrowcraft sales. She sent photos for newspapers when she was promised the prompt return of them. Bah she and the chairman were always glad to help with program suggestions. It was hoped that the local presidents turned over the program material received in the fall mailing to the one in charge of the annual Settlement School pro-gram. Mrs. Dobler prepared copy for each issue of the AR Row which merited careful reading. This year Mrs. Frank Gibson's term expired and Mrs. Ray Finger, former Grand Secretary, replaced her. She will schedule the Slides and Films. It was decided unwise to ship the films to groups where there was no one intimately acquainted with the Settlement School. Through years of use, the movie has been repaired with consequent cuts so that the original continuity does not fit. Previous visits to the school in the capacity of an officer or Committee member plus the reading of the script will easily prepare such a member to make a running commentary throughout the movie. Without this background, the film will have little meaning. The koda THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI chrome slides were used this year with an accompanying script. They offered an informative program for both actives and alumnae. Would it be possible this year for each group to ship these program aids to the next place promptly? It seems a little chore to perform but each year some have been disappointed because of failure to do so. Mrs. Henry Moore, Grand Treasurer, served as contact member from Grand Council and as former Settlement School treasurer brought great understanding to the job. The Grand President was consulted often and the chairman's monthly Committee letter was received by these two members of Grand Council plus the Grand Vice President. At the annual Committee meeting, after the grounds and buildings were inspected, each staff member was interviewed. There were conferences with the auditor, insurance broker, the County Superintendent of Education and some of the local members of the Board of Education. Item by item the budget was reviewed and a new budget set up for the coming year. Each phase of Committee work was discussed. The Arrowcraft merchandise was studied and plans for the future were made with the Arrowcraft Manager and Supervisor of Weaving and Designer. Someone said that a committee is composed of women who keep the minutes and waste the hours. He did not get that impression from our meeting for the Committee worked from early until late to give its particular support to the project. The third leg of the stool, the Settlement School staff, worked in Gatlinburg and the surrounding country in the name of Pi Beta Phi. Adequate funds and a plant could not maintain the Settlement School without the support of a good staff. The co-operation of this staff was a vital factor in the accomplishments of the last year. Marion Mueller, the Director, returned from her strenuous Convention duties as Manager of Arrowcraft to asume the responsibilities of the Director when Ruth Dyer retired in August 1954. Until the first of February, she also supervised Arrowcraft. Marion has always worked in the belief that there were many ways in which to help the mountain people, who lived in little homes tucked away on narrow roads. The older generation seem to be a forgotten people caught between the old and the new. They cannot take a job in Gatlinburg. The best they can do is to farm a little, raise some tobacco, weave and make some rustic furniture. They have real affection for the staff as shown by one woman when Mrs. Mueller visited her who said, `You 'uns always stay in such a hurry." The Director had local super-vision of the staff and property and was Pi Beta Phi's representative in Gatlinburg. Her assistant, Nancy Jo Hayes, taught one Journalism class which sponsored the HIGHLAND ECHO. She helped with the dorm girls and coached school plays. One important task was to serve as secretary of the Summer Craft Workshop which meant a great deal of correspondence during the early spring. This year marked the 35th anniversary of the establishment of health service by the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. For nearly twenty years of this time Marjorie Chalmers has served as the Pi Beta Phi nurse in charge of the Health Center. This has been a rather unusual set-up comparable to the several types of service given in most larger cities by the Public Health Visiting and School Nursing, Red Cross and Emergency Service. In this Atomic Age, our horizons have broadened and the Pi Phi nurse served as one of the 2 women from Sevier County on the Women's State Advisory Defense Committee. During the year Mrs. Chalmers organized and executed a number of clinics aside from the regular Friday afternoon open house. The Polio Clinic was held in the Health Center and buses, trucks, and cars brought children from "our" 3 rural schools as well as 6 other localities. There were 203 first and second graders who received the Salk vaccine. Classes for adults were conducted; instruction in the schools and at Scout troops was given. The annual school physical examinations were completed by November with reports of any defects sent to the parents. Complete records were THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI filed. The 3 rural schools had regular visits. Marjorie Chalmers enjoys the confidence and affection of her patients. Elizabeth Rue, the new Manager of Arrowcraft, adapted quickly to the new tasks and began to make a place for herself at Settlement School and in the community. The mountain girls, who have been such loyal members of the Arrowcraft staff, continued happily under her management. Clubs will find Elizabeth anxious to help. When visiting the Arrowcraft Shop, be sure to ask for Mrs. Rue and she will also tell you how to find Mrs. Mueller who likes to meet visiting Pi Phis and to point out the interest spots. Mrs. Tina McMorran, the Designer and Supervisor of Weaving, designed new Arrowcraft products, as usual. Her tote bag made a great hit with the Province officers. It was Tina and Elizabeth, and Marion who came into close con-tact with the mountain folks. This outlet for the native handicraft has made it possible for these people to raise their standard of living. Pi Phis in general do not realize that our Government each year sends many foreign visitors to Arrowcraft for the express purpose of seeing how we have introduced fireside industry into that area. In July a group of Paraguayan educators, on a craft tour, were escorted by Mrs. Mueller for a whole day. The trip was prearranged through the Department of Education in Washington and included 24 people counting the bus driver. Marion arranged a visit to seven different craft centers and reported once again Pi Phi helped the community share its skill and craft with others. As usual our staff co-operated with the Southern High-land Guild when the Fair was held in Asheville. We demonstrated weaving and contributed articles for the exhibits for we are members of the Guild. All profit from Arrowcraft went to the maintenance of Settlement School and much credit was deserved by the staff for its assistance to the clubs. Edna Cook, remembered by Miami Convention delegates, will soon leave to be married after nine years of service. Our best wishes follow her. As mentioned previously, Marian Heard, the Convention Initiate at Miami, headed the eleventh annual Summer Craft Workshop. It was a huge success and reached the all-time high in attendance and the limit of our capacity to house students. There were 124 class enrollments representing 90 different people from 27 states and 2 foreigncountries. Nine Pi Phis were in the Workshop; t them serving as Assistants were Hannah Norwooc Kirby and Mary Jean Stoddard. Miss Heard sect outstanding faculty with Kenneth Bates, the authc Enameling, as a feature attraction. Winogene Redd; the Weaving instructor. It was a pleasure to welcorr for she was the Designer and Weaving Supervisor rowcraft for over 16 years and did much for our ' and Arrowcraft in the early days. As usual, there was great enthusiasm among t dents and the testimonies, which came unsolicited chairman, would thrill all Pi Phis. The contemplation far-reaching effect of this Workshop inspired tin mittee to dream of future possibilities. Nothing ev ,pens to the world which did not first happen ins mind of some man. The Workshop seems to offer ante to people with various needs. First, there ar who earn a living as a teacher or producing cra Physiotherapy makes use of the crafts. Community need training in recreational crafts as well as those a serving the handicapped. Psychiatrists recommend in these strenuous days. Medical science has addec years to the average life expectancy. Many elderly can lead productive lives and, in fact, need an Who knows but there could be a series of Wo beamed to meet definite needs. Located in a cra which we have pioneered to preserve, the Settlement is strategically placed to encourage mountain a-and to give training to those in search of new a might be that Pi Phi may have the opportunity to a second time in Gatlinburg. There are so many t( places to park dotted along the road to success but a look ahead to keep from falling behind. Maybe on( present buildings, with a minimum expense, could 1 to accommodate more people! Only he who sees visible can do the impossible. Pi Beta Phi can be proud of the Settlement project which cooperation for forty-three years ha possible. As Kipling said: "It aint the guns nor armament That makes the army as a whole. It's the everlasting team work Of every bloomin' soul." VIRGINIA BRACKETT GREEN, Cha; REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1955 Pigeon or back again perhaps to the Health Cent cannot drive into the Burg very far without see of the four Settlement School signs Health Ce Arrowcraft, all on the main street. New dormito. should guide newcomers in their tour of Settlemen grounds. Arrowcraft Arrowcraft is a "must" for most Pi Phis and coming to Gatlinburg whether they are craft-minder We are proud of our handcraft shop of the Souther lands, one of the few strictly handcraft shops in t More and more visitors from other lands come h( year to see our crafts. At this writing a party fro guay is scheduled, twenty-three educators intereste, crafts. If you visit Arrowcraft, Elizabeth Rue, our new since February first, will probably greet you; and permits, take y0l.l on a tour through our shop, pi the newest items, perhaps a bargain; introduce yo. sales girls, all of whom are natives and several g of Pi Beta Phi high school. The figurines of our I which were presented by Northern New Jersey Club to Pi Beta Phi at 1954 Convention are now displayed in Arrowcraft. Even though I have se! many times, I cannot look at them without a feelini Each noble service that men have wrought Was first conceived as a fruitful thought; Each worthy cause with a future glorious By quietly growing becomes victorious" And so Settlement School grows and develops with its goal of service to humanity. This area presents a conflicting picture; Gatlinburg with its many tourist accommodations, while only a few miles distant are the typical mountaineer homes of many years vintage and an occasional new, modest house all but a few equipped with electricity. With electricity one will find the modern washing machine, but because of the inadequate houses, more than likely it will be on the front porch. Several bits of evidence of progress in the Burg are the new County gymnasium; a Town House in the making; a much-needed sewer system ; several new motor courts and swimming pools; drastic changes on Roaring Fork for highway construction. While we are thirteen miles from the nearest train (and that a milk train!), the town now boasts a real train for children, Diesel engine with whistle which is somewhat startling to us former urbanites who have be-come accustomed to the birds, frogs, and constant babbling of Little Pigeon. A reminder of the old Gatlinburg is a large flock of ducks which creates considerable commotion when "mamma duck" decides to lead the ducklings across our highway from perhaps Arrowcraft lawn to Little I0 and reverence. It seems most fitting that our Founders ;hould be on display here at Settlement School our liv-.ng memorial to them. Our Arrowcraft designer, Tina McMorran, has recently :ompleted her fifth altar hanging, this for a church in ,yeorgia. Making these hangings is quite a large project which has to be done in late winter and spring after ship-Ding season to our Clubs. The dossal at the Methodist and Episcopal Churches here in Gatlinburg were also designed and made by Tina. -Iealth Center One cannot leave Arrowcraft without noting our Health :enter the scene of much activity throughout the year. Marjorie Chalmer's records of field visits, inoculations, iealth talks, individual inspections and examinations, chest (-rays show an increase over the fiscal year of 1954. The Sevier County Medical Association has had its monthly meetings at Health Center; classes in First Aid were offered :o adults, twice a week in the evenings for five weeks; -egular Friday clinics are held throughout the year; pre-;chool clinics are held in July; three series of classes in Horne Nursing were offered. Numerous gifts from Alumna: Clubs to Health Center have been distributed. Infants clothing, especially "hippins" Ire much in demand. Sigma Phi Gamma has contributed generously to the corrective Fund for eye examinations and glasses. And so, in many ways, our Health Center contributes to civic security. School Ruth Dyer's leaving as Director shortly before school started last year left quite a vacancy after she had been here ten years, yet we were thrown into a whirl of activities which continued until the end of May. Pi Phi again provided several extracurricular teachers Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft, Music, Physical Education and Basketball Coach, Nurse and Health Center. Our Nancy Jo Hayes had a Journalism class in addition to her duties as assistant to the Director. Ilene Smith who did practice teaching at Pi Beta Phi was a Workshop student last summer and is scheduled to teach Arts and Crafts this year. Carl Huskey will continue as woodcraft instructor. If NX7anzie Tuttle makes as many improvements in the music department as last year, no doubt there will be some prima donnas springing forth. The primary music programs were as superior as the high school Glee Club. Earl Ogle's basketball season was most successful with both boys' and girls' teams going to the semi-finals. Nancy Jo guided her Journalism group to the only "superior" rating for its publication in its class in East Tennessee. She and five Journalism students drove to Memphis for the Tennessee High School Press Association Convention where the award was received. Two groups of practice teachers from the University of Tennessee were placed in the Gatlinburg school during the year. We had an informal get-together with each group. The fact that several practice teachers of recent years have come back to teach in the Burg proves that we really do not give too bad an impression. The newest project of the school is a band which the P.T.A. is sponsoring. Undoubtedly this will add to school spirit especially when they step forth with uniforms which are not even in the embryo stage at this writing. Nancy Jo and I are both on P.T.A. Board. Carl Lewelling was appointed school principal this year. We all think Carl will be a good principal primarily because of his experience having taught in this school five years. County Schools Cartertown, Banner, and Glades are the three County schools which have received aid from our nurse and gifts from us at Christmas. However, to say these schools are bleak and barren is inadequate. Each is the traditional one-room school for grades one through eight. County THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Superintendent Roy Ledwell cannot foresee consolidation for some time. The simplest things would be a treat for these youngsters some of them our future dormitory students. Imagine! Several of our dormitory students last year had not been to Cherokee which is only thirty-two miles over the mountains from Gatlinburg. One high school dormitory girl who lives near the Glades had never been to Wears Valley a possible fifteen miles distant. Dormitories Staff House has been the scene of many activities throughout the year. Open House for Ruth Dyer; another in June honoring Grand Council and Settlement School Committee; two informals for Practice Teachers; and two meetings of the Tennessee Division of Southern Highland Guild were the larger functions. Part of the year the house was filled to capacity, several teachers and all the Workshop Staff have made quite a "family." Last year Stuart Dormitory was the home of eight high school girls who were chaperoned by our house-keeper, Lola Knipp. We were proud of our three seniors who had a high average, were in school activities, and still found time for their chores here at Settlement School, The girls seemed to develop dorm spirit and really liked "living in." One sophomore left two weeks after school started and was married shortly thereafter. She was only sixteen, but not young by the standards of the natives. The small percentage of graduates in the High School indicates the lack of "students." The largest graduation class is twenty-nine, I believe. Last year's junior class was quite large forty-three. It will be interesting to see how many complete their senior year. More and more of the graduates go to college but a small percent of natives go beyond high school. However, we have one senior (dormitory) boy who seems sincere in his wish to become a geologist. If he continues, I hope we can help him fulfill his desire. No doubt more would go to college if a supplementary scholarship were available. Mrs. Herman Henry from Pigeon Forge gave piano lessons two days a week in Stuart Dormitory during the school year. She has given lessons here several years, thus adding a bit of culture. Farm Richard Watson is our farmer, and a minister by avocation. He provides us with the usual garden, and tends chickens thus providing much of our table supplies. This year our two mules, of the old era, gave way to a new walking tractor. (In our hills there would be many a spill if a man tried to ride a tractor.) Workshop Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop for 1955 could be classified a huge success from all reports. No doubt much credit should be given Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamma Workshop Director, and Convention Initiate in 1954. One could never find a more enthusiastic group of craftsmen. There were as many reasons for coming as the number of states represented twenty-seven, plus Canada and Lebanon. Some were working toward degrees; a few had their own shops ; many taught in various fields; one or two admittedly came "just for fun." Nine Pi Phis were in the group. Our dormitories were filled to capacity and when three cots were set up in the living room at Teachers' Cottage (across from my office), and one was placed in the pressing and sewing room at Staff House, one member of the staff said she was going to look under her bed to be sure nobody was under there. A spirit of fun prevailed along with the urge to study. We cannot keep from dreaming of bigger and better workshops. Pi Beta Phi Auditorium During the summer while touring our grounds one notes a huge sign "Gateway Theatre" which is at the entrance THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI of our high school building. This is Mr. John Richard's ninth season to lease Pi Phi auditorium. Nine former students of The American Academy of Dramatic Arts, New York City, are with him this summer. Their repertory of five plays has contributed to good entertainment for tourists as well as local residents. Perhaps some of you have been fortunate enough to be in Gatlinburg on Old Timers' Day in June. This celebration is usually held in our Pi Beta Phi school auditorium. Our Arlie Watson and Neal Watson assume responsibility for the refreshment stand on our campus. Husband, Cow Calling; Duet, Trio, and Quartet Singing; Ballad Singing; Biggest Hunting and Fishing Tale; Old Harp Singing led by Haskew Travena; Corn Shucking Contest were part of the scheduled program. This year the program was dedicated to Wiley Oakley (deceased November, 1954), a native guide known by many as the "Roamin' Man of the Mountains." Shortly before Mr. Richards and Company arrived the auditorium served as a hostelry for thirty-two stranded Boy Scouts from Florida. Their bus was temporarily out of order, due to a landslide hitting the parked bus while the scouts were climbing Mt. Le Conte. Quite a unique service for us, but deeply appreciated. Gifts It is heartening to receive so many gifts from alumnae and friends. Sometimes we do feel "far away" and when a gift comes for the school from afar, one cannot help realizing the magnitude of our Pi Beta Phi project here in the mountains. Numerous gifts from Clubs, Active Chapters, and individuals were received at Christmas. These were for Staff, dormitories, school children, and some needy in the area. Pi Phi helped Santa provide one gift in Christmas wrap-pings for each child in the three county schools. Gifts of money made possible a treat of oranges for all the children. A check from Pittsburgh Alumnae Club specified that it be used for records. Several books were added to our Grace Coolidge Library Washington, D.C., Alumnae Club continued with its custom of giving memorial books. It is an open field for one to play Santa and most gratifying to see the resulting bit of happiness, especially with the County children. Our Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House fared well with two new serving tables and a tea cart made in cherry to match our three large dining tables. Carl Huskey, our woodcraft instructor in the school, made them in his shop five miles out in the Glades. Two silver trays were added to our treasures, contributing considerably to the attractiveness of our tea table.

        3 The money supplied by the Pi Phis also protected the .ant with adequate insurance. The Settlement School has ways been safe-guarded in every way with insurance proction. Committed to the preservation and spread of the crafts, was fitting that the Settlement School housed the eleventh nnmer Craft Workshop sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and to University of Tennessee. For several years this project u been self-supporting. It is an inspiring thought that i Phi came to bring educational privileges to this area at in turn found the people had the crafts which Pi hi could help them share with the rest of the world. hrough the Workshop students, the crafts have crossed le mountains to go into all parts of the country. This year Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tenessee again united in the promotion of its first Foreign raft Study Tour. There were twenty-four people who left my 20 for Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, France rid England where, under the tutelage of Professor Marian [eard of UT, Director of Craft Workshop and a member f Pi Beta Phi, they gained an appreciation of the craftsien of other countries. It was interesting to see that eleven f the student tourists had attended Workshop at Settle-lent School. You recall that the words of the song mentioned above lent something like this. "You made me what I am today; I hope you're satisfied." t is hoped that Pi Phi is proud of Settlement School and :s contribution to that area, but it is hoped that the fra-!rnity is not completely satisfied. A certain kind of disatisfaction results in progress. It is not the leap at the tart but the steady going that gets there. The Settlement chool could have a magnificent plant but if the continued upport of the membership was not forthcoming each year, he whole project would collapse. With continued high :osts, Pi Phi groups are asked to rethink contributions anivally for if gifts remain the same as they were ten ears ago, it is a certain fact the Settlement School ex-)enses have not done so. The Committee is grateful for he many hours of work and planning which made the financial support possible. Everybody' business is nobody's business; hence a Settlenent School Committee came into existence. The sec-)nd leg of this "Settlement School stool," the Committee and Grand Council, assumed responsibility for this Pi ,Phi Droject. Money in the bank and a plant needed supervision Ind a staff as well as a program. Five women from different parts of the country served this year on the Committee and each had a specific assignment. There was a chairman, who functioned as most of those do, and there .was Mrs. Thomas Graham, the treasurer, who spent hours df work receiving, recording and disbursing the SettleMent School money. Mrs. Fred Archibald served as secretary; Mrs. Clare Dobler was the Publicity member and prepared material for Arrowcraft sales. She sent photos for newspapers when she was promised the prompt return of them. Bah she and the chairman were always glad to help with program suggestions. It was hoped that the local presidents turned over the program material received in the fall mailing to the one in charge of the annual Settlement School pro-gram. Mrs. Dobler prepared copy for each issue of the AR Row which merited careful reading. This year Mrs. Frank Gibson's term expired and Mrs. Ray Finger, former Grand Secretary, replaced her. She will schedule the Slides and Films. It was decided unwise to ship the films to groups where there was no one intimately acquainted with the Settlement School. Through years of use, the movie has been repaired with consequent cuts so that the original continuity does not fit. Previous visits to the school in the capacity of an officer or Committee member plus the reading of the script will easily prepare such a member to make a running commentary throughout the movie. Without this background, the film will have little meaning. The koda THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI chrome slides were used this year with an accompanying script. They offered an informative program for both actives and alumnae. Would it be possible this year for each group to ship these program aids to the next place promptly? It seems a little chore to perform but each year some have been disappointed because of failure to do so. Mrs. Henry Moore, Grand Treasurer, served as contact member from Grand Council and as former Settlement School treasurer brought great understanding to the job. The Grand President was consulted often and the chairman's monthly Committee letter was received by these two members of Grand Council plus the Grand Vice President. At the annual Committee meeting, after the grounds and buildings were inspected, each staff member was interviewed. There were conferences with the auditor, insurance broker, the County Superintendent of Education and some of the local members of the Board of Education. Item by item the budget was reviewed and a new budget set up for the coming year. Each phase of Committee work was discussed. The Arrowcraft merchandise was studied and plans for the future were made with the Arrowcraft Manager and Supervisor of Weaving and Designer. Someone said that a committee is composed of women who keep the minutes and waste the hours. He did not get that impression from our meeting for the Committee worked from early until late to give its particular support to the project. The third leg of the stool, the Settlement School staff, worked in Gatlinburg and the surrounding country in the name of Pi Beta Phi. Adequate funds and a plant could not maintain the Settlement School without the support of a good staff. The co-operation of this staff was a vital factor in the accomplishments of the last year. Marion Mueller, the Director, returned from her strenuous Convention duties as Manager of Arrowcraft to asume the responsibilities of the Director when Ruth Dyer retired in August 1954. Until the first of February, she also supervised Arrowcraft. Marion has always worked in the belief that there were many ways in which to help the mountain people, who lived in little homes tucked away on narrow roads. The older generation seem to be a forgotten people caught between the old and the new. They cannot take a job in Gatlinburg. The best they can do is to farm a little, raise some tobacco, weave and make some rustic furniture. They have real affection for the staff as shown by one woman when Mrs. Mueller visited her who said, `You 'uns always stay in such a hurry." The Director had local super-vision of the staff and property and was Pi Beta Phi's representative in Gatlinburg. Her assistant, Nancy Jo Hayes, taught one Journalism class which sponsored the HIGHLAND ECHO. She helped with the dorm girls and coached school plays. One important task was to serve as secretary of the Summer Craft Workshop which meant a great deal of correspondence during the early spring. This year marked the 35th anniversary of the establishment of health service by the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. For nearly twenty years of this time Marjorie Chalmers has served as the Pi Beta Phi nurse in charge of the Health Center. This has been a rather unusual set-up comparable to the several types of service given in most larger cities by the Public Health Visiting and School Nursing, Red Cross and Emergency Service. In this Atomic Age, our horizons have broadened and the Pi Phi nurse served as one of the 2 women from Sevier County on the Women's State Advisory Defense Committee. During the year Mrs. Chalmers organized and executed a number of clinics aside from the regular Friday afternoon open house. The Polio Clinic was held in the Health Center and buses, trucks, and cars brought children from "our" 3 rural schools as well as 6 other localities. There were 203 first and second graders who received the Salk vaccine. Classes for adults were conducted; instruction in the schools and at Scout troops was given. The annual school physical examinations were completed by November with reports of any defects sent to the parents. Complete records were THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI filed. The 3 rural schools had regular visits. Marjorie Chalmers enjoys the confidence and affection of her patients. Elizabeth Rue, the new Manager of Arrowcraft, adapted quickly to the new tasks and began to make a place for herself at Settlement School and in the community. The mountain girls, who have been such loyal members of the Arrowcraft staff, continued happily under her management. Clubs will find Elizabeth anxious to help. When visiting the Arrowcraft Shop, be sure to ask for Mrs. Rue and she will also tell you how to find Mrs. Mueller who likes to meet visiting Pi Phis and to point out the interest spots. Mrs. Tina McMorran, the Designer and Supervisor of Weaving, designed new Arrowcraft products, as usual. Her tote bag made a great hit with the Province officers. It was Tina and Elizabeth, and Marion who came into close con-tact with the mountain folks. This outlet for the native handicraft has made it possible for these people to raise their standard of living. Pi Phis in general do not realize that our Government each year sends many foreign visitors to Arrowcraft for the express purpose of seeing how we have introduced fireside industry into that area. In July a group of Paraguayan educators, on a craft tour, were escorted by Mrs. Mueller for a whole day. The trip was prearranged through the Department of Education in Washington and included 24 people counting the bus driver. Marion arranged a visit to seven different craft centers and reported once again Pi Phi helped the community share its skill and craft with others. As usual our staff co-operated with the Southern High-land Guild when the Fair was held in Asheville. We demonstrated weaving and contributed articles for the exhibits for we are members of the Guild. All profit from Arrowcraft went to the maintenance of Settlement School and much credit was deserved by the staff for its assistance to the clubs. Edna Cook, remembered by Miami Convention delegates, will soon leave to be married after nine years of service. Our best wishes follow her. As mentioned previously, Marian Heard, the Convention Initiate at Miami, headed the eleventh annual Summer Craft Workshop. It was a huge success and reached the all-time high in attendance and the limit of our capacity to house students. There were 124 class enrollments representing 90 different people from 27 states and 2 foreigncountries. Nine Pi Phis were in the Workshop; t them serving as Assistants were Hannah Norwooc Kirby and Mary Jean Stoddard. Miss Heard sect outstanding faculty with Kenneth Bates, the authc Enameling, as a feature attraction. Winogene Redd; the Weaving instructor. It was a pleasure to welcorr for she was the Designer and Weaving Supervisor rowcraft for over 16 years and did much for our ' and Arrowcraft in the early days. As usual, there was great enthusiasm among t dents and the testimonies, which came unsolicited chairman, would thrill all Pi Phis. The contemplation far-reaching effect of this Workshop inspired tin mittee to dream of future possibilities. Nothing ev ,pens to the world which did not first happen ins mind of some man. The Workshop seems to offer ante to people with various needs. First, there ar who earn a living as a teacher or producing cra Physiotherapy makes use of the crafts. Community need training in recreational crafts as well as those a serving the handicapped. Psychiatrists recommend in these strenuous days. Medical science has addec years to the average life expectancy. Many elderly can lead productive lives and, in fact, need an Who knows but there could be a series of Wo beamed to meet definite needs. Located in a cra which we have pioneered to preserve, the Settlement is strategically placed to encourage mountain a-and to give training to those in search of new a might be that Pi Phi may have the opportunity to a second time in Gatlinburg. There are so many t( places to park dotted along the road to success but a look ahead to keep from falling behind. Maybe on( present buildings, with a minimum expense, could 1 to accommodate more people! Only he who sees visible can do the impossible. Pi Beta Phi can be proud of the Settlement project which cooperation for forty-three years ha possible. As Kipling said: "It aint the guns nor armament That makes the army as a whole. It's the everlasting team work Of every bloomin' soul." VIRGINIA BRACKETT GREEN, Cha; REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1955 Pigeon or back again perhaps to the Health Cent cannot drive into the Burg very far without see of the four Settlement School signs Health Ce Arrowcraft, all on the main street. New dormito. should guide newcomers in their tour of Settlemen grounds. Arrowcraft Arrowcraft is a "must" for most Pi Phis and coming to Gatlinburg whether they are craft-minder We are proud of our handcraft shop of the Souther lands, one of the few strictly handcraft shops in t More and more visitors from other lands come h( year to see our crafts. At this writing a party fro guay is scheduled, twenty-three educators intereste, crafts. If you visit Arrowcraft, Elizabeth Rue, our new since February first, will probably greet you; and permits, take y0l.l on a tour through our shop, pi the newest items, perhaps a bargain; introduce yo. sales girls, all of whom are natives and several g of Pi Beta Phi high school. The figurines of our I which were presented by Northern New Jersey Club to Pi Beta Phi at 1954 Convention are now displayed in Arrowcraft. Even though I have se! many times, I cannot look at them without a feelini Each noble service that men have wrought Was first conceived as a fruitful thought; Each worthy cause with a future glorious By quietly growing becomes victorious" And so Settlement School grows and develops with its goal of service to humanity. This area presents a conflicting picture; Gatlinburg with its many tourist accommodations, while only a few miles distant are the typical mountaineer homes of many years vintage and an occasional new, modest house all but a few equipped with electricity. With electricity one will find the modern washing machine, but because of the inadequate houses, more than likely it will be on the front porch. Several bits of evidence of progress in the Burg are the new County gymnasium; a Town House in the making; a much-needed sewer system ; several new motor courts and swimming pools; drastic changes on Roaring Fork for highway construction. While we are thirteen miles from the nearest train (and that a milk train!), the town now boasts a real train for children, Diesel engine with whistle which is somewhat startling to us former urbanites who have be-come accustomed to the birds, frogs, and constant babbling of Little Pigeon. A reminder of the old Gatlinburg is a large flock of ducks which creates considerable commotion when "mamma duck" decides to lead the ducklings across our highway from perhaps Arrowcraft lawn to Little I0 and reverence. It seems most fitting that our Founders ;hould be on display here at Settlement School our liv-.ng memorial to them. Our Arrowcraft designer, Tina McMorran, has recently :ompleted her fifth altar hanging, this for a church in ,yeorgia. Making these hangings is quite a large project which has to be done in late winter and spring after ship-Ding season to our Clubs. The dossal at the Methodist and Episcopal Churches here in Gatlinburg were also designed and made by Tina. -Iealth Center One cannot leave Arrowcraft without noting our Health :enter the scene of much activity throughout the year. Marjorie Chalmer's records of field visits, inoculations, iealth talks, individual inspections and examinations, chest (-rays show an increase over the fiscal year of 1954. The Sevier County Medical Association has had its monthly meetings at Health Center; classes in First Aid were offered :o adults, twice a week in the evenings for five weeks; -egular Friday clinics are held throughout the year; pre-;chool clinics are held in July; three series of classes in Horne Nursing were offered. Numerous gifts from Alumna: Clubs to Health Center have been distributed. Infants clothing, especially "hippins" Ire much in demand. Sigma Phi Gamma has contributed generously to the corrective Fund for eye examinations and glasses. And so, in many ways, our Health Center contributes to civic security. School Ruth Dyer's leaving as Director shortly before school started last year left quite a vacancy after she had been here ten years, yet we were thrown into a whirl of activities which continued until the end of May. Pi Phi again provided several extracurricular teachers Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft, Music, Physical Education and Basketball Coach, Nurse and Health Center. Our Nancy Jo Hayes had a Journalism class in addition to her duties as assistant to the Director. Ilene Smith who did practice teaching at Pi Beta Phi was a Workshop student last summer and is scheduled to teach Arts and Crafts this year. Carl Huskey will continue as woodcraft instructor. If NX7anzie Tuttle makes as many improvements in the music department as last year, no doubt there will be some prima donnas springing forth. The primary music programs were as superior as the high school Glee Club. Earl Ogle's basketball season was most successful with both boys' and girls' teams going to the semi-finals. Nancy Jo guided her Journalism group to the only "superior" rating for its publication in its class in East Tennessee. She and five Journalism students drove to Memphis for the Tennessee High School Press Association Convention where the award was received. Two groups of practice teachers from the University of Tennessee were placed in the Gatlinburg school during the year. We had an informal get-together with each group. The fact that several practice teachers of recent years have come back to teach in the Burg proves that we really do not give too bad an impression. The newest project of the school is a band which the P.T.A. is sponsoring. Undoubtedly this will add to school spirit especially when they step forth with uniforms which are not even in the embryo stage at this writing. Nancy Jo and I are both on P.T.A. Board. Carl Lewelling was appointed school principal this year. We all think Carl will be a good principal primarily because of his experience having taught in this school five years. County Schools Cartertown, Banner, and Glades are the three County schools which have received aid from our nurse and gifts from us at Christmas. However, to say these schools are bleak and barren is inadequate. Each is the traditional one-room school for grades one through eight. County THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Superintendent Roy Ledwell cannot foresee consolidation for some time. The simplest things would be a treat for these youngsters some of them our future dormitory students. Imagine! Several of our dormitory students last year had not been to Cherokee which is only thirty-two miles over the mountains from Gatlinburg. One high school dormitory girl who lives near the Glades had never been to Wears Valley a possible fifteen miles distant. Dormitories Staff House has been the scene of many activities throughout the year. Open House for Ruth Dyer; another in June honoring Grand Council and Settlement School Committee; two informals for Practice Teachers; and two meetings of the Tennessee Division of Southern Highland Guild were the larger functions. Part of the year the house was filled to capacity, several teachers and all the Workshop Staff have made quite a "family." Last year Stuart Dormitory was the home of eight high school girls who were chaperoned by our house-keeper, Lola Knipp. We were proud of our three seniors who had a high average, were in school activities, and still found time for their chores here at Settlement School, The girls seemed to develop dorm spirit and really liked "living in." One sophomore left two weeks after school started and was married shortly thereafter. She was only sixteen, but not young by the standards of the natives. The small percentage of graduates in the High School indicates the lack of "students." The largest graduation class is twenty-nine, I believe. Last year's junior class was quite large forty-three. It will be interesting to see how many complete their senior year. More and more of the graduates go to college but a small percent of natives go beyond high school. However, we have one senior (dormitory) boy who seems sincere in his wish to become a geologist. If he continues, I hope we can help him fulfill his desire. No doubt more would go to college if a supplementary scholarship were available. Mrs. Herman Henry from Pigeon Forge gave piano lessons two days a week in Stuart Dormitory during the school year. She has given lessons here several years, thus adding a bit of culture. Farm Richard Watson is our farmer, and a minister by avocation. He provides us with the usual garden, and tends chickens thus providing much of our table supplies. This year our two mules, of the old era, gave way to a new walking tractor. (In our hills there would be many a spill if a man tried to ride a tractor.) Workshop Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop for 1955 could be classified a huge success from all reports. No doubt much credit should be given Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamma Workshop Director, and Convention Initiate in 1954. One could never find a more enthusiastic group of craftsmen. There were as many reasons for coming as the number of states represented twenty-seven, plus Canada and Lebanon. Some were working toward degrees; a few had their own shops ; many taught in various fields; one or two admittedly came "just for fun." Nine Pi Phis were in the group. Our dormitories were filled to capacity and when three cots were set up in the living room at Teachers' Cottage (across from my office), and one was placed in the pressing and sewing room at Staff House, one member of the staff said she was going to look under her bed to be sure nobody was under there. A spirit of fun prevailed along with the urge to study. We cannot keep from dreaming of bigger and better workshops. Pi Beta Phi Auditorium During the summer while touring our grounds one notes a huge sign "Gateway Theatre" which is at the entrance THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI of our high school building. This is Mr. John Richard's ninth season to lease Pi Phi auditorium. Nine former students of The American Academy of Dramatic Arts, New York City, are with him this summer. Their repertory of five plays has contributed to good entertainment for tourists as well as local residents. Perhaps some of you have been fortunate enough to be in Gatlinburg on Old Timers' Day in June. This celebration is usually held in our Pi Beta Phi school auditorium.

One sophomore left two weeks after school started and was married shortly thereafter. She was only sixteen, but not young by the standards of the natives. The small percentage of graduates in the High School indicates the lack of "students." The largest graduation class is twenty-nine, I believe. Last year's junior class was quite large forty-three. It will be interesting to see how many complete their senior year. More and more of the graduates go to college but a small percent of natives go beyond high school. However, we have one senior (dormitory) boy who seems sincere in his wish to become a geologist. If he continues, I hope we can help him fulfill his desire. No doubt more would go to college if a supplementary scholarship were available. Mrs. Herman Henry from Pigeon Forge gave piano lessons two days a week in Stuart Dormitory during the school year. She has given lessons here several years, thus adding a bit of culture. Farm Richard Watson is our farmer, and a minister by avocation. He provides us with the usual garden, and tends chickens thus providing much of our table supplies. This year our two mules, of the old era, gave way to a new walking tractor. (In our hills there would be many a spill if a man tried to ride a tractor.) Workshop Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop for 1955 could be classified a huge success from all reports. No doubt much credit should be given Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamma Workshop Director, and Convention Initiate in 1954. One could never find a more enthusiastic group of craftsmen. There were as many reasons for coming as the number of states represented twenty-seven, plus Canada and Lebanon. Some were working toward degrees; a few had their own shops ; many taught in various fields; one or two admittedly came "just for fun." Nine Pi Phis were in the group. Our dormitories were filled to capacity and when three cots were set up in the living room at Teachers' Cottage (across from my office), and one was placed in the pressing and sewing room at Staff House, one member of the staff said she was going to look under her bed to be sure nobody was under there. A spirit of fun prevailed along with the urge to study. We cannot keep from dreaming of bigger and better workshops. Pi Beta Phi Auditorium During the summer while touring our grounds one notes a huge sign "Gateway Theatre" which is at the entrance THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI of our high school building. This is Mr. John Richard's ninth season to lease Pi Phi auditorium. Nine former students of The American Academy of Dramatic Arts, New York City, are with him this summer. Their repertory of five plays has contributed to good entertainment for tourists as well as local residents. Perhaps some of you have been fortunate enough to be in Gatlinburg on Old Timers' Day in June. This celebration is usually held in our Pi Beta Phi school auditorium. Our Arlie Watson and Neal Watson assume responsibility for the refreshment stand on our campus. Husband, Cow Calling; Duet, Trio, and Quartet Singing; Ballad Singing; Biggest Hunting and Fishing Tale; Old Harp Singing led by Haskew Travena; Corn Shucking Contest were part of the scheduled program. This year the program was dedicated to Wiley Oakley (deceased November, 1954), a native guide known by many as the "Roamin' Man of the Mountains." Shortly before Mr. Richards and Company arrived the auditorium served as a hostelry for thirty-two stranded Boy Scouts from Florida. Their bus was temporarily out of order, due to a landslide hitting the parked bus while the scouts were climbing Mt. Le Conte. Quite a unique service for us, but deeply appreciated. Gifts It is heartening to receive so many gifts from alumnae and friends. Sometimes we do feel "far away" and when a gift comes for the school from afar, one cannot help realizing the magnitude of our Pi Beta Phi project here in the mountains. Numerous gifts from Clubs, Active Chapters, and individuals were received at Christmas. These were for Staff, dormitories, school children, and some needy in the area. Pi Phi helped Santa provide one gift in Christmas wrap-pings for each child in the three county schools. Gifts of money made possible a treat of oranges for all the children. A check from Pittsburgh Alumnae Club specified that it be used for records. Several books were added to our Grace Coolidge Library Washington, D.C., Alumnae Club continued with its custom of giving memorial books. It is an open field for one to play Santa and most gratifying to see the resulting bit of happiness, especially with the County children. Our Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House fared well with two new serving tables and a tea cart made in cherry to match our three large dining tables. Carl Huskey, our woodcraft instructor in the school, made them in his shop five miles out in the Glades. Two silver trays were added to our treasures, contributing considerably to the attractiveness of our tea table.

The interest shown in the repeated and generous assistance to the same child through several years has afforded much pleasure and satisfaction to many groups. Some children who have been sponsored over a period of two or three years have been able to get along without further help and these sponsorships to others where the need was most pressing. Berkeley, California, Alumnae Club, Ontario Alpha, and Kansas Alpha have given full sponsorships this year. Harrisburg-Carlisle Pennsylvania Club and Manitoba Alpha have taken one together. The other contributions have been used frequently as a unit. The contributions are as follows: Berkeley, California Alum= Club $96.00 Calgary, Alberta Alumna Club 8.00 Harrisburg-Carlisle, Pennsylvania Club 48.00 Wilmington, Delaware Alumna Club 10.00 Kansas A 96.00 Manitoba A 40.00 Ontario A 98.00 Wyoming A 5.00 Your contact member has enjoyed the opportunity of being of service and also the pleasure in the many contacts which this has made possible. Respectfully submitted, LOIS F. STOOLMAN, Contact Member Committee Ieeport. CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE . This is a report of a year's co-operation and if you do not believe in co-operation, try running your car with only three wheels. The Settlement School can be visualized as a three-legged stool on which each leg is equally important. One leg on the Settlement School stool is the Pi Beta Phi membership; the second leg is the Settlement School Committee and Grand Council, and the third leg is the local staff . It is impossible to decide which leg is the most vital for unless all three function to give support, the stool cannot render the service for which it was intended. The first leg, the Pi Beta Phi membership, voluntarily through the years without assessment has provided the financial support for the fraternity's philanthropic project through gifts of money, Arrowcraft sales and work. The Settlement School theme song to the membership could well be "You Made Me What I Am Today." Last year, 89 active chapters contributed and the following 7 Provinces (old) co-operated 100% in support of the Settlement School: Alpha West, Beta, Delta, Iota, Epsilon, Kappa, Mu. Three chapters which gave $100.00 or more were Indiana Gamma, $100.00; Missouri Beta, $150.00 and Texas Alpha, $100.00. There were 242 alumnle clubs which made gifts and 5 Provinces (old) supported the project 100%: Gamma, Epsilon, Delta, Iota, Mu. There were 10 clubs which contributed $150.00 or more and (*) marks those whose gifts were increased over the previous year. St. Louis, Mo $900.00 *Seattle, Wash $200.00 *Houston, Tex 400.00 Northern New jersey 175.00 Kansas City, Mo 300.00 Cleveland East 166.00 Philadelphia, Pa. . . 250.00 *Sabine District, Tex. . 163.00 Indianapolis, Ind. . 210.00 Denver, Colo 150.00 The new Newark-Granville, Ohio Club sent a Loyalty Day check in addition to the regular gift. There was a slight increase in the total sum of annual gifts and this trend was gratefully recognized and encouraged for the future. Obviously the above income was not sufficient, but thanks to a large number of chapters and clubs, $7987.31 was realized in magazine commissions. This was approximately $500.00 more than last year and almost reached the goal of $8000.00. It was encouraging to note that 119 clubs and 46 chapters increased their magazine commis-'lions. Texas Alpha was highest among chapters and Denver, Colorado led the alumnx clubs. California Zeta and the San Jose, California Alumnx Club rated special mention for the highest commissions per capita. If all chapters and clubs realized how much the Settlement School budget counted on the additional funds from magazine commissions, they would work out a business-like method for securing greater sales. Although no drive was made for funds to complete the furnishings of the Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House, additional money was received which will make possible future purchases to meet some needs. The generous friends who gave in addition to regular gifts were Newark-Granville, Ohio Club, Chicago South Club, Houston, Texas Club, Corpus Christi, Texas Club, Indianola, Iowa Club, Pittsburgh, Pa. Club. Three clubs, Southwestern Indiana, Champaign-Urbana and Seattle, Washington sent final payments for their bed-rooms and that meant all bedrooms were paid in full. Mrs. D. C. Stevenson sent a birthday check to be used for something extra in the memorial room for her daughter, Suzanne Stevenson Knight. A tea cart in memory of Gladys Reineke Finch was purchased with the money from Detroit, Michigan. With the money from I Ky. two serving tables were added in honor c Woerner, a former Settlement School treasurer. 'I additions to the dining room match the cherry and will see daily use. Albany, N.Y. Club presentee tray in memory of Dorothy Pavey as did the MG Club which honored May Keller. Even with the gifts, the tea table leaves much to be desired N staff has an open house. The Health Center received the Sigma Phi Gan rective Fund and this year the amount available w; double. This was used for glasses for the neediest c Yuba-Sutter Club sent $10 for medicinal suppli( Health Center. Through the years, individual members, clubs an have sent memorial gifts to Settlement School in flowers in times of bereavement. These have always lated until sufficient funds were available for the pu some special piece of equipment. It was voted to bt freeze for the Staff House. Not only will this male sible to freeze our own chickens and garden pr the right moment, but it will allow economical pu. meat in quantity. The present refrigeration did not ice-making unit; so the freezer will furnish ice c the staff after Workshop. Pi Phis found still another way to remember th Sums of money were sent to permit the librarian needed books to the Grace Coolidge Library. Man mas gifts to share with the three rural schools were Eventually these inadequate, one-room schools will t but until that day they are the only schools son] mountain children will know. What did this support with money accompl: one thing, it furnished teachers for Physical Educe Health, Arts and Crafts, Music, Woodworking and ism plus needed supplies for their classes. Pi Phi r operates the school, for the County reached the poi it could supply the basic educational program. Th( of teachers was determined by the average daily al and this secured just enough for the minimum The fraternity supplied the additional teachers jects which are considered important in most throughout the country. About half of the children school bus. They walked down the little mountain wait along_ the highway for the bus. Pi Phi-money made it possible for. children fro: mountain home to finish their high school educ Pi Phi dorms .for $5 a month plus a willingness t specified number of hours each month, young pee during the school year. The training obtained the kitchen and dining room work was extremely val perience in a town which catered to the tourist its main "industry." This support made it possible to keep up the which every 365 days grows a year older. The year-old chlorinator gave out this fall and had placed. From the standpoint of sanitation and ec, was wise to dispose of the mules and to buy which did not eat feed during the winter. A stol first furnace in Gatlinburg resulted in more ec comfortable heat in Teachers' Cottage. Hot watt wore out just as buildings forty years in use neec ing, repairing and renovation. A wind storm blew Heath Center sign and necessitated replacement. tion utilities were supplied with the funds. Th maintained the school buildings but buildings by Pi Phi and the County could be easily distingu to the difference in standards. Future supervision better results. 37 3 The money supplied by the Pi Phis also protected the .ant with adequate insurance. The Settlement School has ways been safe-guarded in every way with insurance proction. Committed to the preservation and spread of the crafts, was fitting that the Settlement School housed the eleventh nnmer Craft Workshop sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and to University of Tennessee. For several years this project u been self-supporting. It is an inspiring thought that i Phi came to bring educational privileges to this area at in turn found the people had the crafts which Pi hi could help them share with the rest of the world. hrough the Workshop students, the crafts have crossed le mountains to go into all parts of the country. This year Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tenessee again united in the promotion of its first Foreign raft Study Tour. There were twenty-four people who left my 20 for Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, France rid England where, under the tutelage of Professor Marian [eard of UT, Director of Craft Workshop and a member f Pi Beta Phi, they gained an appreciation of the craftsien of other countries. It was interesting to see that eleven f the student tourists had attended Workshop at Settle-lent School. You recall that the words of the song mentioned above lent something like this. "You made me what I am today; I hope you're satisfied." t is hoped that Pi Phi is proud of Settlement School and :s contribution to that area, but it is hoped that the fra-!rnity is not completely satisfied. A certain kind of disatisfaction results in progress. It is not the leap at the tart but the steady going that gets there. The Settlement chool could have a magnificent plant but if the continued upport of the membership was not forthcoming each year, he whole project would collapse. With continued high :osts, Pi Phi groups are asked to rethink contributions anivally for if gifts remain the same as they were ten ears ago, it is a certain fact the Settlement School ex-)enses have not done so. The Committee is grateful for he many hours of work and planning which made the financial support possible. Everybody' business is nobody's business; hence a Settlenent School Committee came into existence. The sec-)nd leg of this "Settlement School stool," the Committee and Grand Council, assumed responsibility for this Pi ,Phi Droject. Money in the bank and a plant needed supervision Ind a staff as well as a program. Five women from different parts of the country served this year on the Committee and each had a specific assignment. There was a chairman, who functioned as most of those do, and there .was Mrs. Thomas Graham, the treasurer, who spent hours df work receiving, recording and disbursing the SettleMent School money. Mrs. Fred Archibald served as secretary; Mrs. Clare Dobler was the Publicity member and prepared material for Arrowcraft sales. She sent photos for newspapers when she was promised the prompt return of them. Bah she and the chairman were always glad to help with program suggestions. It was hoped that the local presidents turned over the program material received in the fall mailing to the one in charge of the annual Settlement School pro-gram. Mrs. Dobler prepared copy for each issue of the AR Row which merited careful reading. This year Mrs. Frank Gibson's term expired and Mrs. Ray Finger, former Grand Secretary, replaced her. She will schedule the Slides and Films. It was decided unwise to ship the films to groups where there was no one intimately acquainted with the Settlement School. Through years of use, the movie has been repaired with consequent cuts so that the original continuity does not fit. Previous visits to the school in the capacity of an officer or Committee member plus the reading of the script will easily prepare such a member to make a running commentary throughout the movie. Without this background, the film will have little meaning. The koda THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI chrome slides were used this year with an accompanying script. They offered an informative program for both actives and alumnae. Would it be possible this year for each group to ship these program aids to the next place promptly? It seems a little chore to perform but each year some have been disappointed because of failure to do so. Mrs. Henry Moore, Grand Treasurer, served as contact member from Grand Council and as former Settlement School treasurer brought great understanding to the job. The Grand President was consulted often and the chairman's monthly Committee letter was received by these two members of Grand Council plus the Grand Vice President. At the annual Committee meeting, after the grounds and buildings were inspected, each staff member was interviewed. There were conferences with the auditor, insurance broker, the County Superintendent of Education and some of the local members of the Board of Education. Item by item the budget was reviewed and a new budget set up for the coming year. Each phase of Committee work was discussed. The Arrowcraft merchandise was studied and plans for the future were made with the Arrowcraft Manager and Supervisor of Weaving and Designer. Someone said that a committee is composed of women who keep the minutes and waste the hours. He did not get that impression from our meeting for the Committee worked from early until late to give its particular support to the project. The third leg of the stool, the Settlement School staff, worked in Gatlinburg and the surrounding country in the name of Pi Beta Phi. Adequate funds and a plant could not maintain the Settlement School without the support of a good staff. The co-operation of this staff was a vital factor in the accomplishments of the last year. Marion Mueller, the Director, returned from her strenuous Convention duties as Manager of Arrowcraft to asume the responsibilities of the Director when Ruth Dyer retired in August 1954. Until the first of February, she also supervised Arrowcraft. Marion has always worked in the belief that there were many ways in which to help the mountain people, who lived in little homes tucked away on narrow roads. The older generation seem to be a forgotten people caught between the old and the new. They cannot take a job in Gatlinburg. The best they can do is to farm a little, raise some tobacco, weave and make some rustic furniture. They have real affection for the staff as shown by one woman when Mrs. Mueller visited her who said, `You 'uns always stay in such a hurry." The Director had local super-vision of the staff and property and was Pi Beta Phi's representative in Gatlinburg. Her assistant, Nancy Jo Hayes, taught one Journalism class which sponsored the HIGHLAND ECHO. She helped with the dorm girls and coached school plays. One important task was to serve as secretary of the Summer Craft Workshop which meant a great deal of correspondence during the early spring. This year marked the 35th anniversary of the establishment of health service by the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. For nearly twenty years of this time Marjorie Chalmers has served as the Pi Beta Phi nurse in charge of the Health Center. This has been a rather unusual set-up comparable to the several types of service given in most larger cities by the Public Health Visiting and School Nursing, Red Cross and Emergency Service. In this Atomic Age, our horizons have broadened and the Pi Phi nurse served as one of the 2 women from Sevier County on the Women's State Advisory Defense Committee. During the year Mrs. Chalmers organized and executed a number of clinics aside from the regular Friday afternoon open house. The Polio Clinic was held in the Health Center and buses, trucks, and cars brought children from "our" 3 rural schools as well as 6 other localities. There were 203 first and second graders who received the Salk vaccine. Classes for adults were conducted; instruction in the schools and at Scout troops was given. The annual school physical examinations were completed by November with reports of any defects sent to the parents. Complete records were THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI filed. The 3 rural schools had regular visits. Marjorie Chalmers enjoys the confidence and affection of her patients. Elizabeth Rue, the new Manager of Arrowcraft, adapted quickly to the new tasks and began to make a place for herself at Settlement School and in the community. The mountain girls, who have been such loyal members of the Arrowcraft staff, continued happily under her management. Clubs will find Elizabeth anxious to help. When visiting the Arrowcraft Shop, be sure to ask for Mrs. Rue and she will also tell you how to find Mrs. Mueller who likes to meet visiting Pi Phis and to point out the interest spots. Mrs. Tina McMorran, the Designer and Supervisor of Weaving, designed new Arrowcraft products, as usual. Her tote bag made a great hit with the Province officers. It was Tina and Elizabeth, and Marion who came into close con-tact with the mountain folks. This outlet for the native handicraft has made it possible for these people to raise their standard of living. Pi Phis in general do not realize that our Government each year sends many foreign visitors to Arrowcraft for the express purpose of seeing how we have introduced fireside industry into that area. In July a group of Paraguayan educators, on a craft tour, were escorted by Mrs. Mueller for a whole day. The trip was prearranged through the Department of Education in Washington and included 24 people counting the bus driver. Marion arranged a visit to seven different craft centers and reported once again Pi Phi helped the community share its skill and craft with others. As usual our staff co-operated with the Southern High-land Guild when the Fair was held in Asheville. We demonstrated weaving and contributed articles for the exhibits for we are members of the Guild. All profit from Arrowcraft went to the maintenance of Settlement School and much credit was deserved by the staff for its assistance to the clubs. Edna Cook, remembered by Miami Convention delegates, will soon leave to be married after nine years of service. Our best wishes follow her. As mentioned previously, Marian Heard, the Convention Initiate at Miami, headed the eleventh annual Summer Craft Workshop. It was a huge success and reached the all-time high in attendance and the limit of our capacity to house students. There were 124 class enrollments representing 90 different people from 27 states and 2 foreigncountries. Nine Pi Phis were in the Workshop; t them serving as Assistants were Hannah Norwooc Kirby and Mary Jean Stoddard. Miss Heard sect outstanding faculty with Kenneth Bates, the authc Enameling, as a feature attraction. Winogene Redd; the Weaving instructor. It was a pleasure to welcorr for she was the Designer and Weaving Supervisor rowcraft for over 16 years and did much for our ' and Arrowcraft in the early days. As usual, there was great enthusiasm among t dents and the testimonies, which came unsolicited chairman, would thrill all Pi Phis. The contemplation far-reaching effect of this Workshop inspired tin mittee to dream of future possibilities. Nothing ev ,pens to the world which did not first happen ins mind of some man. The Workshop seems to offer ante to people with various needs. First, there ar who earn a living as a teacher or producing cra Physiotherapy makes use of the crafts. Community need training in recreational crafts as well as those a serving the handicapped. Psychiatrists recommend in these strenuous days. Medical science has addec years to the average life expectancy. Many elderly can lead productive lives and, in fact, need an Who knows but there could be a series of Wo beamed to meet definite needs. Located in a cra which we have pioneered to preserve, the Settlement is strategically placed to encourage mountain a-and to give training to those in search of new a might be that Pi Phi may have the opportunity to a second time in Gatlinburg. There are so many t( places to park dotted along the road to success but a look ahead to keep from falling behind. Maybe on( present buildings, with a minimum expense, could 1 to accommodate more people! Only he who sees visible can do the impossible. Pi Beta Phi can be proud of the Settlement project which cooperation for forty-three years ha possible. As Kipling said: "It aint the guns nor armament That makes the army as a whole. It's the everlasting team work Of every bloomin' soul." VIRGINIA BRACKETT GREEN, Cha; REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1955 Pigeon or back again perhaps to the Health Cent cannot drive into the Burg very far without see of the four Settlement School signs Health Ce Arrowcraft, all on the main street. New dormito. should guide newcomers in their tour of Settlemen grounds. Arrowcraft Arrowcraft is a "must" for most Pi Phis and coming to Gatlinburg whether they are craft-minder We are proud of our handcraft shop of the Souther lands, one of the few strictly handcraft shops in t More and more visitors from other lands come h( year to see our crafts. At this writing a party fro guay is scheduled, twenty-three educators intereste, crafts.

The figurines of our I which were presented by Northern New Jersey Club to Pi Beta Phi at 1954 Convention are now displayed in Arrowcraft. Even though I have se! many times, I cannot look at them without a feelini Each noble service that men have wrought Was first conceived as a fruitful thought; Each worthy cause with a future glorious By quietly growing becomes victorious" And so Settlement School grows and develops with its goal of service to humanity. This area presents a conflicting picture; Gatlinburg with its many tourist accommodations, while only a few miles distant are the typical mountaineer homes of many years vintage and an occasional new, modest house all but a few equipped with electricity. With electricity one will find the modern washing machine, but because of the inadequate houses, more than likely it will be on the front porch. Several bits of evidence of progress in the Burg are the new County gymnasium; a Town House in the making; a much-needed sewer system ; several new motor courts and swimming pools; drastic changes on Roaring Fork for highway construction. While we are thirteen miles from the nearest train (and that a milk train!), the town now boasts a real train for children, Diesel engine with whistle which is somewhat startling to us former urbanites who have be-come accustomed to the birds, frogs, and constant babbling of Little Pigeon. A reminder of the old Gatlinburg is a large flock of ducks which creates considerable commotion when "mamma duck" decides to lead the ducklings across our highway from perhaps Arrowcraft lawn to Little I0 and reverence. It seems most fitting that our Founders ;hould be on display here at Settlement School our liv-.ng memorial to them. Our Arrowcraft designer, Tina McMorran, has recently :ompleted her fifth altar hanging, this for a church in ,yeorgia. Making these hangings is quite a large project which has to be done in late winter and spring after ship-Ding season to our Clubs. The dossal at the Methodist and Episcopal Churches here in Gatlinburg were also designed and made by Tina. -Iealth Center One cannot leave Arrowcraft without noting our Health :enter the scene of much activity throughout the year. Marjorie Chalmer's records of field visits, inoculations, iealth talks, individual inspections and examinations, chest (-rays show an increase over the fiscal year of 1954. The Sevier County Medical Association has had its monthly meetings at Health Center; classes in First Aid were offered :o adults, twice a week in the evenings for five weeks; -egular Friday clinics are held throughout the year; pre-;chool clinics are held in July; three series of classes in Horne Nursing were offered. Numerous gifts from Alumna: Clubs to Health Center have been distributed. Infants clothing, especially "hippins" Ire much in demand. Sigma Phi Gamma has contributed generously to the corrective Fund for eye examinations and glasses. And so, in many ways, our Health Center contributes to civic security. School Ruth Dyer's leaving as Director shortly before school started last year left quite a vacancy after she had been here ten years, yet we were thrown into a whirl of activities which continued until the end of May. Pi Phi again provided several extracurricular teachers Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft, Music, Physical Education and Basketball Coach, Nurse and Health Center. Our Nancy Jo Hayes had a Journalism class in addition to her duties as assistant to the Director. Ilene Smith who did practice teaching at Pi Beta Phi was a Workshop student last summer and is scheduled to teach Arts and Crafts this year. Carl Huskey will continue as woodcraft instructor. If NX7anzie Tuttle makes as many improvements in the music department as last year, no doubt there will be some prima donnas springing forth. The primary music programs were as superior as the high school Glee Club. Earl Ogle's basketball season was most successful with both boys' and girls' teams going to the semi-finals. Nancy Jo guided her Journalism group to the only "superior" rating for its publication in its class in East Tennessee. She and five Journalism students drove to Memphis for the Tennessee High School Press Association Convention where the award was received. Two groups of practice teachers from the University of Tennessee were placed in the Gatlinburg school during the year. We had an informal get-together with each group. The fact that several practice teachers of recent years have come back to teach in the Burg proves that we really do not give too bad an impression. The newest project of the school is a band which the P.T.A. is sponsoring. Undoubtedly this will add to school spirit especially when they step forth with uniforms which are not even in the embryo stage at this writing. Nancy Jo and I are both on P.T.A. Board. Carl Lewelling was appointed school principal this year. We all think Carl will be a good principal primarily because of his experience having taught in this school five years. County Schools Cartertown, Banner, and Glades are the three County schools which have received aid from our nurse and gifts from us at Christmas. However, to say these schools are bleak and barren is inadequate. Each is the traditional one-room school for grades one through eight. County THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Superintendent Roy Ledwell cannot foresee consolidation for some time. The simplest things would be a treat for these youngsters some of them our future dormitory students. Imagine! Several of our dormitory students last year had not been to Cherokee which is only thirty-two miles over the mountains from Gatlinburg. One high school dormitory girl who lives near the Glades had never been to Wears Valley a possible fifteen miles distant. Dormitories Staff House has been the scene of many activities throughout the year. Open House for Ruth Dyer; another in June honoring Grand Council and Settlement School Committee; two informals for Practice Teachers; and two meetings of the Tennessee Division of Southern Highland Guild were the larger functions. Part of the year the house was filled to capacity, several teachers and all the Workshop Staff have made quite a "family." Last year Stuart Dormitory was the home of eight high school girls who were chaperoned by our house-keeper, Lola Knipp. We were proud of our three seniors who had a high average, were in school activities, and still found time for their chores here at Settlement School, The girls seemed to develop dorm spirit and really liked "living in." One sophomore left two weeks after school started and was married shortly thereafter. She was only sixteen, but not young by the standards of the natives. The small percentage of graduates in the High School indicates the lack of "students." The largest graduation class is twenty-nine, I believe. Last year's junior class was quite large forty-three. It will be interesting to see how many complete their senior year. More and more of the graduates go to college but a small percent of natives go beyond high school. However, we have one senior (dormitory) boy who seems sincere in his wish to become a geologist. If he continues, I hope we can help him fulfill his desire. No doubt more would go to college if a supplementary scholarship were available. Mrs. Herman Henry from Pigeon Forge gave piano lessons two days a week in Stuart Dormitory during the school year. She has given lessons here several years, thus adding a bit of culture. Farm Richard Watson is our farmer, and a minister by avocation. He provides us with the usual garden, and tends chickens thus providing much of our table supplies. This year our two mules, of the old era, gave way to a new walking tractor. (In our hills there would be many a spill if a man tried to ride a tractor.) Workshop Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop for 1955 could be classified a huge success from all reports. No doubt much credit should be given Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamma Workshop Director, and Convention Initiate in 1954. One could never find a more enthusiastic group of craftsmen. There were as many reasons for coming as the number of states represented twenty-seven, plus Canada and Lebanon. Some were working toward degrees; a few had their own shops ; many taught in various fields; one or two admittedly came "just for fun." Nine Pi Phis were in the group. Our dormitories were filled to capacity and when three cots were set up in the living room at Teachers' Cottage (across from my office), and one was placed in the pressing and sewing room at Staff House, one member of the staff said she was going to look under her bed to be sure nobody was under there. A spirit of fun prevailed along with the urge to study. We cannot keep from dreaming of bigger and better workshops. Pi Beta Phi Auditorium During the summer while touring our grounds one notes a huge sign "Gateway Theatre" which is at the entrance THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI of our high school building. This is Mr. John Richard's ninth season to lease Pi Phi auditorium. Nine former students of The American Academy of Dramatic Arts, New York City, are with him this summer. Their repertory of five plays has contributed to good entertainment for tourists as well as local residents. Perhaps some of you have been fortunate enough to be in Gatlinburg on Old Timers' Day in June. This celebration is usually held in our Pi Beta Phi school auditorium. Our Arlie Watson and Neal Watson assume responsibility for the refreshment stand on our campus. Husband, Cow Calling; Duet, Trio, and Quartet Singing; Ballad Singing; Biggest Hunting and Fishing Tale; Old Harp Singing led by Haskew Travena; Corn Shucking Contest were part of the scheduled program. This year the program was dedicated to Wiley Oakley (deceased November, 1954), a native guide known by many as the "Roamin' Man of the Mountains." Shortly before Mr. Richards and Company arrived the auditorium served as a hostelry for thirty-two stranded Boy Scouts from Florida. Their bus was temporarily out of order, due to a landslide hitting the parked bus while the scouts were climbing Mt. Le Conte. Quite a unique service for us, but deeply appreciated. Gifts It is heartening to receive so many gifts from alumnae and friends. Sometimes we do feel "far away" and when a gift comes for the school from afar, one cannot help realizing the magnitude of our Pi Beta Phi project here in the mountains. Numerous gifts from Clubs, Active Chapters, and individuals were received at Christmas. These were for Staff, dormitories, school children, and some needy in the area. Pi Phi helped Santa provide one gift in Christmas wrap-pings for each child in the three county schools. Gifts of money made possible a treat of oranges for all the children. A check from Pittsburgh Alumnae Club specified that it be used for records. Several books were added to our Grace Coolidge Library Washington, D.C., Alumnae Club continued with its custom of giving memorial books. It is an open field for one to play Santa and most gratifying to see the resulting bit of happiness, especially with the County children. Our Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House fared well with two new serving tables and a tea cart made in cherry to match our three large dining tables. Carl Huskey, our woodcraft instructor in the school, made them in his shop five miles out in the Glades. Two silver trays were added to our treasures, contributing considerably to the attractiveness of our tea table. Donors Albany Alum= Club inmemory of Dorothy Simpson Pavey, Richmond Club in honor of Dr. May L. Keller. Improvements of Grounds Something is always "going on" at Settlemem and even though you now have a birdseye vie' attention should be called to a few of our in provements. Those of you who are familiar ' grounds would miss the shed which was back of ' Cottage. It has given way for extra parking 4% wall and flowers at one end adding to the landsc first furnace in Gatlinburg still serves Teachers' quite well, and this year a stoker was added, thus ing the last bit of handfiring for Arlie. The sl words of appreciation from Arlie are certainly wall stoker cost. Now he does not have to come ov( breakfast! At one time he had seven furnaces to The old log cabin (our museum piece on th was braced and reshingled with shakes (hand he lumber from Pi Beta Phi hill) . The enrollment in the school has increased s( constantly trying to keep abreast of the times. T. likewise increased. This spring our school lane w topped part way, and an extra coat of oil and gra' the rest. There were many "thanks" for that, be( lane had been quite muddy and full of holes. Staff Needless to say there is a constant struggle to in repair on our grounds, forty-three years of w an ever-present effort to keep abreast of the tin our staff on the alert all the time. A most coopers has helped fulfill our work. I have not mentioned 3 Adams whose official title is "cook," but is alway to pitch in wherever she is needed. Arlie Wat! loyal as any Pi Phi having been here as mainten: for twenty-eight years. If it is ten o'clock at nig] night long that he is needed for an emergency, be sure he will stand by and not complain. His si is a most efficient co-worker with his father. ] to Arlie and Neal that the Arrowcraft Express pac crated, if necessary, and hauled thirteen miles t Sevierville. We can count on our truck going thi most inclement weather. Nancy Jo Hayes, Gamma, has helped me most efficiently always carry on. It is indeed a privilege and a challer here at Settlement School in this land of high hori: its ever-changing views which "quicken the pulse, mind, and make humble the heart." Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MI Come to Convention, Huntington-Sheraton Hotel, Pasadena, California, June 24-30, 1956. -----3
