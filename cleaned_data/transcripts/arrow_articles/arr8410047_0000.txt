        Settlement School CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE After 57 years of service, the Settlement School Committee, established in 1910, will be replaced by a new Board of Control under the leadership of Elizabeth Yelm Kingman, Mrs. Eugene, Colorado Beta. The Board of Control will be the governing body ,of Art and Crafts Center, established on the foundation of the Settlement School as the Centennial Fund Project. It is with pride and optimism, that, we, the members of the last Settlement School Committee submit our final re-port. We are passing on to the Board of Control: A well established Summer Craft Workshop School of national renown A successful Arrowcraft Shop The Red Barn project Special Craft Workshops, offered spring and fall. The success of the operation of the Settlement School has been made possible because of the devoted service of the members of the staff. Director of Settlement School: Mrs. Marion W. Prince, Indiana Gamma, has served the fraternity for 14 years and will be retiring during her 15th year. Manager of Arrowcraft Shop: Mrs. Maria Hutchins Tate, Florida Beta, has served the fraternity 5 years and has resigned, effective July 15th, 1967. Director of Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee: Miss Marian Heard, Professor of Craft Design, University of Tennessee has served the fraternity for 22 years and will continue her interest in the Centennial Project. Pi Beta Phi has always been concerned with helping others to help themselves, this is evident in the organization of Chapters and Clubs. This concern has been ex-tended to people outside the membership of Pi Beta Phi through the program of the first philanthropy supported by a fraternity THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL. In 1910, the first Settlement School Committee was formed to find an opportunity to offer education in an area where it was most needed. In 1912, the area of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, was selected. The Settlement School was established to offer education to children to prepare them for a better way of life. A high school was added, many boys and girls went on to college and returned to Gatlinburg to improve the economic development of the community. Pi Beta Phi helped hundreds of children by offering educational opportunities. Pi Beta Phi appreciated the beauty and value of hand-made articles found in the homes of the area. The first cottage industry in the United States was established through providing a market for handwoven items and baskets which the people were encouraged to make. Arrowcraft Shop was opened in 1926. Countless number of weavers and craftsmen have enjoyed happier, fuller lives because of the opportunity for self expression and the ability to improve themselves economically. 82,000 members of Pi Beta Phi and hundreds of thousands of customers of Arrowcraft Shop have had the opportunity of purchasing these articles. In 1923, the Red Barn was constructed to teach improved methods in agriculture. Hundreds of young boys and farmers benefited from this experience. Sitting on bales ,of hay, the people of Gatlinburg saw the first movies shown in the area. The Barn served as a recreation center on Saturday nights. In 1959, the Red Barn was remodeled into a dormitory for summer Craft Workshop students. On weekends in the fall and spring it has been offered to philanthropicand educational groups, as well as Pi Phi chapters for retreats. At least 5000 boys, girls and adults have enjoyed the beauty of the Great Smoky Mountains because of the availability of the Red Barn. In 1943, Sevier County assumed full responsibility for the public school system in Gatlinburg. In 1945, a unique association was established between a State University and a fraternity when the first Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee was offered to 50 students, Stu-dents, ages 16 to 80 have come from all over the United States and many foreign countries. They have been art students, teachers, therapists, craftsmen and hobbyists. The majority return to their communities to give the benefit of the skills and techniques learned in Workshop to thousands of other students and individuals. Approximately, 3000 students have attended classes in craft workshops, and hundreds of thousands of other people have benefited. Each year work scholarships have been given to 6 or 7 students to be assistants to Craft Workshop Instructors. In addition, during the past 6 years, 10 clubs have given scholarships to students from their areas to attend Summer Craft Workshop. These clubs are: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Berkeley, California; Buffalo, New York; Chicago South Suburban, Illinois; Chicago West Suburban, Illinois; Houston, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Orlando-Winter Park, Florida; Spokane, Washington; Southern California Area Council. Pi Beta Phi has been able to help others help, them-selves because of the generous support of Chapters and Clubs to Settlement School. In appreciation of this support the Settlement School Committee is happy to present Little Pigeon Awards.

Arrowcraft Shop Personnel: It was with extreme regret that the resignation of Mrs. Maria Tate, Arrowcraft Shop Manager had to be accepted. The position is still open, any Pi Beta Phi who is interested in applying please write to Mrs. Eugene Kingman, Chairman of the Board of Control, 312 So. 56th Street, Omaha, Nebraska, 68132. Mrs. Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma will continue as manager of the Arrowcraft Shop in the Mountain View Hotel. Faye Cook is Head of Shipping and likes to fill big orders. June Parrot is her assistant. Nella. Hill continues to be the acting Weaving Designer and Supervisor, with assistance from Mrs. Patricia Crowley Spillman, New Mexico Alpha, Albuquerque New Mexico. Mrs. Spillman creates the new designs and is working on an hourly basis in her home in New Mexico. Nella Hill and Mrs. Spillman work out the process of production. Other members of the sales staff are: Jean Hembree, Ruby Watson, and Ruth Kenney. Mrs. Margaret Mayfield is the Bookkeeper. Pi Beta Phi is indebted to this wonderful staff for their loyalty and interest in making Arrow-craft Shop the successful project that it is. Craft Workshops: Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee and Directed by Miss Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamma, continues to be a tremendous success with the most outstanding craftsmen as instructors. L966 School had the largest enrollment of the 22 years it has been offered. Miss Betty Street, University of Illinois, Assistant Director contributes to the success of the program through her ability as a craftsman and as an administrator. Pi Beta Phi is grateful for the devoted hours of service given by Miss Heard and Miss Street. Courses offered are: Weaving, Pottery, Ceramics, Enameling, Jewelry, Textile Design, Recreational Crafts and Stitchery. Seven Assistantship scholarships were given for the 1966 session and also for the 1967 session. Club scholarships have been listed. Other workshops were held in the spring of 1967. Red Barn Besides being an attractive dormitory for 32 students attending Summer Craft Workshop, it is in constant demand by religious, educational and philanthropic groups for weekend retreats in fall and spring. Pi Beta Phi chapters are urged to take advantage of using it for educational seminars. The Settlement School grounds and buildings are kept in excellent repair and appearance by our loyal maintenance men. Orlie Watson, is on duty each weekend to check on the safety of all equipment. Neal Watson, Head Maintenance man, Zanley Watson and Richard Watson work diligently and with a personal pride in keeping everything in excellent condition. We are indebted to them for their loyal service to Settlement School. Legacies and Gifts Mrs. Anne Wilson was thanked personally for the generous legacy given by her husband, Mr. Matthew J. Wilson Jr. The legacy was in the form of stock, the income to be used toward the salary of outstanding instructors of the Summer Craft workshop. The bequest was made to the Settlement School of Pi Beta Phi. Mrs. Wilson was Anne Coghlan, Colorado Alpha, and is now living in Scottsdale, Arizona. Mrs. Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, gave an enameling kiln in memory of her daughter, Mildred Rankin Rader, Ohio Beta. Mr. John Collier and Mr. James Collier gave $100.00 as a memorial to their father, Mr. James D. Collier, in June 1966. A second gift of $100,00 was received in June of 1967. James D. Collier and Co. is the Insurance Agency for Settlement School. Craft Honorary Fund contributors: Dorothy C. Thor-man, Sally B. Schneiter, Eloise Hensley, Sally W. Gordon, 48 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and Edith H. Rankin. It is with deepest gratitude that these gifts are accepted. Director of Settlement School Mrs. Marion W. Prince, changed to this name in March 1967 when she married Mr. Herbert Prince of Gatlinburg. We all wish her a very happy new life. Her resignation has been accepted effective not later than December 1967. Marion W. Prince, Indiana Gamma, has served the fraternity for 14 years. Pi Beta Phi is indebted to her for her loyal and devoted service to Settlement School. Her standards have always been high and as a result a firm foundation has been established for the continuation of the program into the Centennial Fund Project. Committee Members: Treasurer Sally Bozman Schneiter, Indiana Alpha; Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha; Sally W. Gordon, Wisconsin Alpha; Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta; and Dorothy Coleman Thorman, Illinois Epsilon, have carried out the responsibilities of their offices as efficiently as possible with a loyalty and devotion to the ideals of Pi Beta Phi. We thank Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice-President of Philanthropies, for her leader-ship, as contact member for Grand Council. During the past four years all work has been directed toward preparing the Settlement School for the change that is to take place with the Centennial Convention of 1967. We are delighted that the same ideal of wanting to help others help themselves through education is to be continued in the establishment of the 'Centennial Fund Project. As members of the Settlement School Committee we have enjoyed our work. Our relationship with each other and with everyone associated with Settlement School has been stimulating and rewarding. We are grateful to the fraternity for providing us with this experience of service to the Memorial to the Founders of Pi Beta Phi. In June 1967, the last Settlement School Committee completes its services and passes on to the new organization of the Centennial Fund Project this wonderful heritage of 57 years THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DOROTHY COLEMAN THORMAN SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR The spirit of 1867 is launched into the second century of Pi Beta Phi. Those who were at our Centennial Convention in June realize that many goals were achieved during our first hundred years and that goals were set for our second century. There is no better place to realize these achievements of Pi Beta Phi than at our Memorial to our Founders Settlement School. Members who have worked devotedly for our project realize the magnitude of these accomplishments. It is with pride that these are reviewed for the last fiscal year. This could well be termed the year of transition with the launching of the new craft program. The building of the County Elementary School erases the last area for several of our workshop classes hence a new classroom building is a necessity for further expansion. And we have had expansion almost yearly since 1945 in our workshop with the University of Tennessee. In 1967 there were twenty more people than a year ago. Twenty-seven states and Canada were represented among our personnel. There were two from far-away Washington (state), two from Massachusetts, six from Florida and seven from Texas. Our one Pi Phi assistant was from Texas. Sorry, there was a dearth of Pi Phi applicants. This could be a wonderful experience for senior art or craft majors and recent graduates. It is an opportunity to live at our Pi Beta Phi School in the Smokies, and to obtain credit for one course. The Lolita Prouty 'Ceramic wing was recently completed (dedicated June 1966). This pottery wing is a great satisfaction for those who use it, and a great source of pride for Pi Beta Phi. Many of the workshop classes were filled. Imagine fifteen or more students learning to put on a warp on a floor loom, or a similar number making pots--turning on the wheel. One can readily see why such laboratory classes are limited in number. The standard of workmanship is high, and it is largely for this reason our students appreciate the school. Almost without exception our students were not only satisfied with their experience at our school, but many reiterated their intention of re-turning next year. There were more men enrolled this year than usual. For the last two years there have been two trailers and because of the shortage of dormitory space four double motel rooms were subsidized for the six weeks. The climax of workshop is the Open House when the public is invited to view the students' work. Here again much enthusiasm is displayed. At this point a big "thank you" is in order for the workshop director, Marian Heard (Tennessee Gamma), who has served for twenty-two summers. The following is a partial list of student occupations this summer: under-graduate and graduate students, elementary teachers, homeeconomics teachers, art teachers, extension workers, retired teachers, librarian, secretary, housewives, home demonstration agents, art supervisor, craft instructor, insurance representative, banker, psychiatric social worker, textile pat-tern maker, and architect. A big "thank you" is extended to the following Alumni Clubs who provided scholarships for students Albuquerque, Buffalo, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Orlando, Spokane and St. Petersburg. Three Pi Phis attended as students. Along with the growth of the workshop a memorial Craft Library has grown. Scholarships and memorial gifts are two most acceptable ways of promoting this project. Word-of-the-mouth publicity spreads the information, too. In the future additional workshops will be scheduled. There are myriads of possibilities for future seminars, little workshops and big workshops! Arrowcraft Shop represents a large part of the Settlement School and Craft program. Started in 1925 primarily to provide an outlet for the craftsmen, it has also served as an 'outlet for our Clubs in their philanthropic work. The patronage and loyalty of our Alumnae Clubs and Active Chapters is deeply appreciated. Forty-five Alumna Clubs paid Arrowcraft one thousand dollars or more. Twenty-five active chapters (busy as they are) found time to order from Arrowcraft. New. Arrowcraft price lists have been mailed to each Alumni Club. Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta-Delta) is acting manager since Maria Tate's (Florida Beta) departure July 15. Trish Crowley Spilman (New Mexico Alpha) has capably designed not only Centennial items, but new items for the price list. A desirable Centennial item is the wine and blue bookmark for all 'Pi Phis. For the active chapters Arrowcraft has Centennial Pi Phi mugs Greek letters with 100 on the mug. Elizabeth Rue (Iowa Gamma) operates the Arrowcraft Shop at the Mountain View Hotel in her semi-retirement. Our Red Barn has become very popular when work-shops are not in session. The kitchenette, Chaunticleer's dining area, the Owls' Nest for assemblies, twenty-nine single beds and eight portable cots provide housing for varied groups. These groups must be essentially education-al or philanthropic. Word-of-the-mouth information has spread regarding the availability of the Barn. Bus loads come for socalled retreats, for one or two nights or more. Neighboring Pi Phi Chapters have come from South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee and Indiana. And we welcome Pi Phis especially. We usually have an armchair tour of the premises, than a quiz with Arrowcraft prizes as a reward for the most prompt answers. Only highlights are given in this brief report. There have been changes and growth in Gatlinburg as well as at THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 49 our Settlement School. It is a constant effort to meet these changes as we strive for growth in our program and thus meet the ideals of Pi Beta Phi in having a project of which all Pi Phis can be proud. Respectfully submitted, MARION W. PRINCE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE May 31, 1967 A ccountants' Report Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We have examined the balance sheet of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School (a division of Pi Beta Phi) as of May 31, 1967, and the related statements of income and expenses and fund balances for the year then ended. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We previously made a similar examination of the financial statements for the preceding year. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and statements of income and expenses and fund balances present fairly the financial position of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at May 31, 1967, and the results of its operations for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

It was with regret that Grand Council rejected some invitations from schools of sound scholastic reputation. Loyal and interested Pi Phi local alum= would have been willing to provide their assistance but the current faculty attitudes and restrictionson membership selection rights, precluded further consideration. Other invitations were rejected because the schools do not meet Pi Phi requirements or because our current commitments prevented our involvement. Over a year ago a petition was received from Pi Alpha Theta, a local sorority at Bethany College, Bethany, West Virginia, for active membership in Pi Beta Phi. Also, a very cordial invitation from the President of Bethany College to locate a chapter of Pi Beta Phi on the Bethany campus. Bethany College, established in March 1840, is located near Wheeling, West Virginia and 38 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is a distinguished and fully accredited institution for higher education. Enrollment deliberately limited to about 1100 students, admission is selective. The faculty is composed of 70% doctorates and all professors have their masters degree. Pupil-teacher ratio is 14 to 1. The Director of Extension, the Delta Province President and Alumnae Province President, a delegate from the chapters in Delta province have visited the college and met with Pi Alpha Theta local sorority. No negative votes have been received since the visit. This group of young women in Pi Alpha Theta have put a lot of thought and work into their organization. Their scholastic average is above the all sorority, all women and all college. Pi Beta Phi was selected after studying Baird's Manual because of Pi Phi strong alumnm organization and our well known service to others. They also knew of the local Alumnae Club in Wheeling, West Virginia. Delta Province Alumnae Clubs and chapters have enthusiastically endorsed Pi Alpha Theta for active membership in Pi Beta Phi. There are 4 national sororities at Bethany College Alpha Xi Delta installed in 19013; Zeta Tau Alpha installed in 1905 ; Kappa Delta in-stalled in 1923 and Phi Mu installed in 1939. There will be no expense for housing as the sororities live in sorority suites in the dormitories. The school has offered the counselor a position as assistant head resident of the dormitory where Pi Alpha Theta lives, room and board will be free, her own apartment plus a salary of around $150 per month. She will be allowed to take courses or audit them. The Director of Extension moved that the convention accept the petition of Pi Alpha Theta of Bethany College, at Bethany, West Virginia to be a colony of Pi Beta Phi in the fall of 1967. The motion was seconded by the delegate from West Virginia Alpha. The Delta Province President, Alumnae Province President, delegate from the Wheeling Alumnae Club and the delegate from North Carolina Beta spoke in favor of accepting the petition of Pi Alpha Theta. The convention voted to accept the petition and Pi Beta Phi will have a colony on the Bethany College campus in the fall of 1967. The second invitation came from Dean Betty Cosby and the Panhellenic Council of the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. The invitation reads as follows, "On behalf of the Panhellenic Council of the University of Florida and the office of the Dean of Women, I should like to extend to Pi Beta Phi an invitation tcY colonize at the University at your earliest convenience." For over ten years there has been hope that this invitation would come to Pi Beta Phi. The Director of Extension met with the actives and alumnae from Theta Province, attending the Centennial Convention, to discuss the invitation from the University of Florida. It was the unan 51

        48 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and Edith H. Rankin. It is with deepest gratitude that these gifts are accepted. Director of Settlement School Mrs. Marion W. Prince, changed to this name in March 1967 when she married Mr. Herbert Prince of Gatlinburg. We all wish her a very happy new life. Her resignation has been accepted effective not later than December 1967. Marion W. Prince, Indiana Gamma, has served the fraternity for 14 years. Pi Beta Phi is indebted to her for her loyal and devoted service to Settlement School. Her standards have always been high and as a result a firm foundation has been established for the continuation of the program into the Centennial Fund Project. Committee Members: Treasurer Sally Bozman Schneiter, Indiana Alpha; Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha; Sally W. Gordon, Wisconsin Alpha; Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta; and Dorothy Coleman Thorman, Illinois Epsilon, have carried out the responsibilities of their offices as efficiently as possible with a loyalty and devotion to the ideals of Pi Beta Phi. We thank Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice-President of Philanthropies, for her leader-ship, as contact member for Grand Council. During the past four years all work has been directed toward preparing the Settlement School for the change that is to take place with the Centennial Convention of 1967. We are delighted that the same ideal of wanting to help others help themselves through education is to be continued in the establishment of the 'Centennial Fund Project. As members of the Settlement School Committee we have enjoyed our work. Our relationship with each other and with everyone associated with Settlement School has been stimulating and rewarding. We are grateful to the fraternity for providing us with this experience of service to the Memorial to the Founders of Pi Beta Phi. In June 1967, the last Settlement School Committee completes its services and passes on to the new organization of the Centennial Fund Project this wonderful heritage of 57 years THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DOROTHY COLEMAN THORMAN SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR The spirit of 1867 is launched into the second century of Pi Beta Phi. Those who were at our Centennial Convention in June realize that many goals were achieved during our first hundred years and that goals were set for our second century. There is no better place to realize these achievements of Pi Beta Phi than at our Memorial to our Founders Settlement School. Members who have worked devotedly for our project realize the magnitude of these accomplishments. It is with pride that these are reviewed for the last fiscal year. This could well be termed the year of transition with the launching of the new craft program. The building of the County Elementary School erases the last area for several of our workshop classes hence a new classroom building is a necessity for further expansion. And we have had expansion almost yearly since 1945 in our workshop with the University of Tennessee. In 1967 there were twenty more people than a year ago. Twenty-seven states and Canada were represented among our personnel. There were two from far-away Washington (state), two from Massachusetts, six from Florida and seven from Texas. Our one Pi Phi assistant was from Texas. Sorry, there was a dearth of Pi Phi applicants. This could be a wonderful experience for senior art or craft majors and recent graduates. It is an opportunity to live at our Pi Beta Phi School in the Smokies, and to obtain credit for one course. The Lolita Prouty 'Ceramic wing was recently completed (dedicated June 1966). This pottery wing is a great satisfaction for those who use it, and a great source of pride for Pi Beta Phi. Many of the workshop classes were filled. Imagine fifteen or more students learning to put on a warp on a floor loom, or a similar number making pots--turning on the wheel. One can readily see why such laboratory classes are limited in number. The standard of workmanship is high, and it is largely for this reason our students appreciate the school. Almost without exception our students were not only satisfied with their experience at our school, but many reiterated their intention of re-turning next year. There were more men enrolled this year than usual. For the last two years there have been two trailers and because of the shortage of dormitory space four double motel rooms were subsidized for the six weeks. The climax of workshop is the Open House when the public is invited to view the students' work. Here again much enthusiasm is displayed. At this point a big "thank you" is in order for the workshop director, Marian Heard (Tennessee Gamma), who has served for twenty-two summers. The following is a partial list of student occupations this summer: under-graduate and graduate students, elementary teachers, homeeconomics teachers, art teachers, extension workers, retired teachers, librarian, secretary, housewives, home demonstration agents, art supervisor, craft instructor, insurance representative, banker, psychiatric social worker, textile pat-tern maker, and architect. A big "thank you" is extended to the following Alumni Clubs who provided scholarships for students Albuquerque, Buffalo, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Orlando, Spokane and St. Petersburg. Three Pi Phis attended as students. Along with the growth of the workshop a memorial Craft Library has grown. Scholarships and memorial gifts are two most acceptable ways of promoting this project. Word-of-the-mouth publicity spreads the information, too. In the future additional workshops will be scheduled. There are myriads of possibilities for future seminars, little workshops and big workshops! Arrowcraft Shop represents a large part of the Settlement School and Craft program. Started in 1925 primarily to provide an outlet for the craftsmen, it has also served as an 'outlet for our Clubs in their philanthropic work. The patronage and loyalty of our Alumnae Clubs and Active Chapters is deeply appreciated. Forty-five Alumna Clubs paid Arrowcraft one thousand dollars or more. Twenty-five active chapters (busy as they are) found time to order from Arrowcraft. New. Arrowcraft price lists have been mailed to each Alumni Club. Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta-Delta) is acting manager since Maria Tate's (Florida Beta) departure July 15. Trish Crowley Spilman (New Mexico Alpha) has capably designed not only Centennial items, but new items for the price list. A desirable Centennial item is the wine and blue bookmark for all 'Pi Phis. For the active chapters Arrowcraft has Centennial Pi Phi mugs Greek letters with 100 on the mug. Elizabeth Rue (Iowa Gamma) operates the Arrowcraft Shop at the Mountain View Hotel in her semi-retirement. Our Red Barn has become very popular when work-shops are not in session. The kitchenette, Chaunticleer's dining area, the Owls' Nest for assemblies, twenty-nine single beds and eight portable cots provide housing for varied groups. These groups must be essentially education-al or philanthropic. Word-of-the-mouth information has spread regarding the availability of the Barn. Bus loads come for socalled retreats, for one or two nights or more. Neighboring Pi Phi Chapters have come from South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee and Indiana. And we welcome Pi Phis especially. We usually have an armchair tour of the premises, than a quiz with Arrowcraft prizes as a reward for the most prompt answers. Only highlights are given in this brief report. There have been changes and growth in Gatlinburg as well as at THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 49 our Settlement School. It is a constant effort to meet these changes as we strive for growth in our program and thus meet the ideals of Pi Beta Phi in having a project of which all Pi Phis can be proud. Respectfully submitted, MARION W. PRINCE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE May 31, 1967 A ccountants' Report Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We have examined the balance sheet of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School (a division of Pi Beta Phi) as of May 31, 1967, and the related statements of income and expenses and fund balances for the year then ended. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We previously made a similar examination of the financial statements for the preceding year. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and statements of income and expenses and fund balances present fairly the financial position of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at May 31, 1967, and the results of its operations for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

Bethany College, established in March 1840, is located near Wheeling, West Virginia and 38 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is a distinguished and fully accredited institution for higher education. Enrollment deliberately limited to about 1100 students, admission is selective. The faculty is composed of 70% doctorates and all professors have their masters degree. Pupil-teacher ratio is 14 to 1. The Director of Extension, the Delta Province President and Alumnae Province President, a delegate from the chapters in Delta province have visited the college and met with Pi Alpha Theta local sorority. No negative votes have been received since the visit. This group of young women in Pi Alpha Theta have put a lot of thought and work into their organization. Their scholastic average is above the all sorority, all women and all college. Pi Beta Phi was selected after studying Baird's Manual because of Pi Phi strong alumnm organization and our well known service to others. They also knew of the local Alumnae Club in Wheeling, West Virginia. Delta Province Alumnae Clubs and chapters have enthusiastically endorsed Pi Alpha Theta for active membership in Pi Beta Phi. There are 4 national sororities at Bethany College Alpha Xi Delta installed in 19013; Zeta Tau Alpha installed in 1905 ; Kappa Delta in-stalled in 1923 and Phi Mu installed in 1939. There will be no expense for housing as the sororities live in sorority suites in the dormitories. The school has offered the counselor a position as assistant head resident of the dormitory where Pi Alpha Theta lives, room and board will be free, her own apartment plus a salary of around $150 per month. She will be allowed to take courses or audit them. The Director of Extension moved that the convention accept the petition of Pi Alpha Theta of Bethany College, at Bethany, West Virginia to be a colony of Pi Beta Phi in the fall of 1967. The motion was seconded by the delegate from West Virginia Alpha. The Delta Province President, Alumnae Province President, delegate from the Wheeling Alumnae Club and the delegate from North Carolina Beta spoke in favor of accepting the petition of Pi Alpha Theta. The convention voted to accept the petition and Pi Beta Phi will have a colony on the Bethany College campus in the fall of 1967. The second invitation came from Dean Betty Cosby and the Panhellenic Council of the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. The invitation reads as follows, "On behalf of the Panhellenic Council of the University of Florida and the office of the Dean of Women, I should like to extend to Pi Beta Phi an invitation tcY colonize at the University at your earliest convenience." For over ten years there has been hope that this invitation would come to Pi Beta Phi. The Director of Extension met with the actives and alumnae from Theta Province, attending the Centennial Convention, to discuss the invitation from the University of Florida. It was the unan 51 Settlement School CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE After 57 years of service, the Settlement School Committee, established in 1910, will be replaced by a new Board of Control under the leadership of Elizabeth Yelm Kingman, Mrs. Eugene, Colorado Beta. The Board of Control will be the governing body ,of Art and Crafts Center, established on the foundation of the Settlement School as the Centennial Fund Project. It is with pride and optimism, that, we, the members of the last Settlement School Committee submit our final re-port. We are passing on to the Board of Control: A well established Summer Craft Workshop School of national renown A successful Arrowcraft Shop The Red Barn project Special Craft Workshops, offered spring and fall. The success of the operation of the Settlement School has been made possible because of the devoted service of the members of the staff. Director of Settlement School: Mrs. Marion W. Prince, Indiana Gamma, has served the fraternity for 14 years and will be retiring during her 15th year. Manager of Arrowcraft Shop: Mrs. Maria Hutchins Tate, Florida Beta, has served the fraternity 5 years and has resigned, effective July 15th, 1967. Director of Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee: Miss Marian Heard, Professor of Craft Design, University of Tennessee has served the fraternity for 22 years and will continue her interest in the Centennial Project. Pi Beta Phi has always been concerned with helping others to help themselves, this is evident in the organization of Chapters and Clubs. This concern has been ex-tended to people outside the membership of Pi Beta Phi through the program of the first philanthropy supported by a fraternity THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL. In 1910, the first Settlement School Committee was formed to find an opportunity to offer education in an area where it was most needed. In 1912, the area of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, was selected. The Settlement School was established to offer education to children to prepare them for a better way of life. A high school was added, many boys and girls went on to college and returned to Gatlinburg to improve the economic development of the community. Pi Beta Phi helped hundreds of children by offering educational opportunities. Pi Beta Phi appreciated the beauty and value of hand-made articles found in the homes of the area. The first cottage industry in the United States was established through providing a market for handwoven items and baskets which the people were encouraged to make. Arrowcraft Shop was opened in 1926. Countless number of weavers and craftsmen have enjoyed happier, fuller lives because of the opportunity for self expression and the ability to improve themselves economically. 82,000 members of Pi Beta Phi and hundreds of thousands of customers of Arrowcraft Shop have had the opportunity of purchasing these articles. In 1923, the Red Barn was constructed to teach improved methods in agriculture. Hundreds of young boys and farmers benefited from this experience. Sitting on bales ,of hay, the people of Gatlinburg saw the first movies shown in the area. The Barn served as a recreation center on Saturday nights. In 1959, the Red Barn was remodeled into a dormitory for summer Craft Workshop students. On weekends in the fall and spring it has been offered to philanthropicand educational groups, as well as Pi Phi chapters for retreats. At least 5000 boys, girls and adults have enjoyed the beauty of the Great Smoky Mountains because of the availability of the Red Barn. In 1943, Sevier County assumed full responsibility for the public school system in Gatlinburg. In 1945, a unique association was established between a State University and a fraternity when the first Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee was offered to 50 students, Stu-dents, ages 16 to 80 have come from all over the United States and many foreign countries. They have been art students, teachers, therapists, craftsmen and hobbyists. The majority return to their communities to give the benefit of the skills and techniques learned in Workshop to thousands of other students and individuals. Approximately, 3000 students have attended classes in craft workshops, and hundreds of thousands of other people have benefited. Each year work scholarships have been given to 6 or 7 students to be assistants to Craft Workshop Instructors. In addition, during the past 6 years, 10 clubs have given scholarships to students from their areas to attend Summer Craft Workshop. These clubs are: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Berkeley, California; Buffalo, New York; Chicago South Suburban, Illinois; Chicago West Suburban, Illinois; Houston, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Orlando-Winter Park, Florida; Spokane, Washington; Southern California Area Council. Pi Beta Phi has been able to help others help, them-selves because of the generous support of Chapters and Clubs to Settlement School. In appreciation of this support the Settlement School Committee is happy to present Little Pigeon Awards.

Arrowcraft Shop Personnel: It was with extreme regret that the resignation of Mrs. Maria Tate, Arrowcraft Shop Manager had to be accepted. The position is still open, any Pi Beta Phi who is interested in applying please write to Mrs. Eugene Kingman, Chairman of the Board of Control, 312 So. 56th Street, Omaha, Nebraska, 68132. Mrs. Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma will continue as manager of the Arrowcraft Shop in the Mountain View Hotel. Faye Cook is Head of Shipping and likes to fill big orders. June Parrot is her assistant. Nella. Hill continues to be the acting Weaving Designer and Supervisor, with assistance from Mrs. Patricia Crowley Spillman, New Mexico Alpha, Albuquerque New Mexico. Mrs. Spillman creates the new designs and is working on an hourly basis in her home in New Mexico. Nella Hill and Mrs. Spillman work out the process of production. Other members of the sales staff are: Jean Hembree, Ruby Watson, and Ruth Kenney. Mrs. Margaret Mayfield is the Bookkeeper. Pi Beta Phi is indebted to this wonderful staff for their loyalty and interest in making Arrow-craft Shop the successful project that it is. Craft Workshops: Summer Craft Workshop, co-sponsored with the University of Tennessee and Directed by Miss Marian Heard, Tennessee Gamma, continues to be a tremendous success with the most outstanding craftsmen as instructors. L966 School had the largest enrollment of the 22 years it has been offered. Miss Betty Street, University of Illinois, Assistant Director contributes to the success of the program through her ability as a craftsman and as an administrator. Pi Beta Phi is grateful for the devoted hours of service given by Miss Heard and Miss Street. Courses offered are: Weaving, Pottery, Ceramics, Enameling, Jewelry, Textile Design, Recreational Crafts and Stitchery. Seven Assistantship scholarships were given for the 1966 session and also for the 1967 session. Club scholarships have been listed. Other workshops were held in the spring of 1967. Red Barn Besides being an attractive dormitory for 32 students attending Summer Craft Workshop, it is in constant demand by religious, educational and philanthropic groups for weekend retreats in fall and spring. Pi Beta Phi chapters are urged to take advantage of using it for educational seminars. The Settlement School grounds and buildings are kept in excellent repair and appearance by our loyal maintenance men. Orlie Watson, is on duty each weekend to check on the safety of all equipment. Neal Watson, Head Maintenance man, Zanley Watson and Richard Watson work diligently and with a personal pride in keeping everything in excellent condition. We are indebted to them for their loyal service to Settlement School. Legacies and Gifts Mrs. Anne Wilson was thanked personally for the generous legacy given by her husband, Mr. Matthew J. Wilson Jr. The legacy was in the form of stock, the income to be used toward the salary of outstanding instructors of the Summer Craft workshop. The bequest was made to the Settlement School of Pi Beta Phi. Mrs. Wilson was Anne Coghlan, Colorado Alpha, and is now living in Scottsdale, Arizona. Mrs. Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, gave an enameling kiln in memory of her daughter, Mildred Rankin Rader, Ohio Beta. Mr. John Collier and Mr. James Collier gave $100.00 as a memorial to their father, Mr. James D. Collier, in June 1966. A second gift of $100,00 was received in June of 1967. James D. Collier and Co. is the Insurance Agency for Settlement School. Craft Honorary Fund contributors: Dorothy C. Thor-man, Sally B. Schneiter, Eloise Hensley, Sally W. Gordon, 48 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI and Edith H. Rankin. It is with deepest gratitude that these gifts are accepted. Director of Settlement School Mrs. Marion W. Prince, changed to this name in March 1967 when she married Mr. Herbert Prince of Gatlinburg. We all wish her a very happy new life. Her resignation has been accepted effective not later than December 1967. Marion W. Prince, Indiana Gamma, has served the fraternity for 14 years. Pi Beta Phi is indebted to her for her loyal and devoted service to Settlement School. Her standards have always been high and as a result a firm foundation has been established for the continuation of the program into the Centennial Fund Project. Committee Members: Treasurer Sally Bozman Schneiter, Indiana Alpha; Eloise Glazner Hensley, Texas Alpha; Sally W. Gordon, Wisconsin Alpha; Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta; and Dorothy Coleman Thorman, Illinois Epsilon, have carried out the responsibilities of their offices as efficiently as possible with a loyalty and devotion to the ideals of Pi Beta Phi. We thank Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice-President of Philanthropies, for her leader-ship, as contact member for Grand Council. During the past four years all work has been directed toward preparing the Settlement School for the change that is to take place with the Centennial Convention of 1967. We are delighted that the same ideal of wanting to help others help themselves through education is to be continued in the establishment of the 'Centennial Fund Project. As members of the Settlement School Committee we have enjoyed our work. Our relationship with each other and with everyone associated with Settlement School has been stimulating and rewarding. We are grateful to the fraternity for providing us with this experience of service to the Memorial to the Founders of Pi Beta Phi. In June 1967, the last Settlement School Committee completes its services and passes on to the new organization of the Centennial Fund Project this wonderful heritage of 57 years THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DOROTHY COLEMAN THORMAN SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR The spirit of 1867 is launched into the second century of Pi Beta Phi. Those who were at our Centennial Convention in June realize that many goals were achieved during our first hundred years and that goals were set for our second century. There is no better place to realize these achievements of Pi Beta Phi than at our Memorial to our Founders Settlement School. Members who have worked devotedly for our project realize the magnitude of these accomplishments. It is with pride that these are reviewed for the last fiscal year. This could well be termed the year of transition with the launching of the new craft program. The building of the County Elementary School erases the last area for several of our workshop classes hence a new classroom building is a necessity for further expansion. And we have had expansion almost yearly since 1945 in our workshop with the University of Tennessee. In 1967 there were twenty more people than a year ago. Twenty-seven states and Canada were represented among our personnel. There were two from far-away Washington (state), two from Massachusetts, six from Florida and seven from Texas. Our one Pi Phi assistant was from Texas. Sorry, there was a dearth of Pi Phi applicants. This could be a wonderful experience for senior art or craft majors and recent graduates. It is an opportunity to live at our Pi Beta Phi School in the Smokies, and to obtain credit for one course. The Lolita Prouty 'Ceramic wing was recently completed (dedicated June 1966). This pottery wing is a great satisfaction for those who use it, and a great source of pride for Pi Beta Phi. Many of the workshop classes were filled. Imagine fifteen or more students learning to put on a warp on a floor loom, or a similar number making pots--turning on the wheel. One can readily see why such laboratory classes are limited in number. The standard of workmanship is high, and it is largely for this reason our students appreciate the school. Almost without exception our students were not only satisfied with their experience at our school, but many reiterated their intention of re-turning next year. There were more men enrolled this year than usual. For the last two years there have been two trailers and because of the shortage of dormitory space four double motel rooms were subsidized for the six weeks. The climax of workshop is the Open House when the public is invited to view the students' work. Here again much enthusiasm is displayed. At this point a big "thank you" is in order for the workshop director, Marian Heard (Tennessee Gamma), who has served for twenty-two summers. The following is a partial list of student occupations this summer: under-graduate and graduate students, elementary teachers, homeeconomics teachers, art teachers, extension workers, retired teachers, librarian, secretary, housewives, home demonstration agents, art supervisor, craft instructor, insurance representative, banker, psychiatric social worker, textile pat-tern maker, and architect. A big "thank you" is extended to the following Alumni Clubs who provided scholarships for students Albuquerque, Buffalo, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Orlando, Spokane and St. Petersburg. Three Pi Phis attended as students. Along with the growth of the workshop a memorial Craft Library has grown. Scholarships and memorial gifts are two most acceptable ways of promoting this project. Word-of-the-mouth publicity spreads the information, too. In the future additional workshops will be scheduled. There are myriads of possibilities for future seminars, little workshops and big workshops! Arrowcraft Shop represents a large part of the Settlement School and Craft program. Started in 1925 primarily to provide an outlet for the craftsmen, it has also served as an 'outlet for our Clubs in their philanthropic work. The patronage and loyalty of our Alumnae Clubs and Active Chapters is deeply appreciated. Forty-five Alumna Clubs paid Arrowcraft one thousand dollars or more. Twenty-five active chapters (busy as they are) found time to order from Arrowcraft. New. Arrowcraft price lists have been mailed to each Alumni Club. Marjorie Chalmers (Illinois Beta-Delta) is acting manager since Maria Tate's (Florida Beta) departure July 15. Trish Crowley Spilman (New Mexico Alpha) has capably designed not only Centennial items, but new items for the price list. A desirable Centennial item is the wine and blue bookmark for all 'Pi Phis. For the active chapters Arrowcraft has Centennial Pi Phi mugs Greek letters with 100 on the mug. Elizabeth Rue (Iowa Gamma) operates the Arrowcraft Shop at the Mountain View Hotel in her semi-retirement. Our Red Barn has become very popular when work-shops are not in session. The kitchenette, Chaunticleer's dining area, the Owls' Nest for assemblies, twenty-nine single beds and eight portable cots provide housing for varied groups. These groups must be essentially education-al or philanthropic. Word-of-the-mouth information has spread regarding the availability of the Barn. Bus loads come for socalled retreats, for one or two nights or more. Neighboring Pi Phi Chapters have come from South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee and Indiana. And we welcome Pi Phis especially. We usually have an armchair tour of the premises, than a quiz with Arrowcraft prizes as a reward for the most prompt answers. Only highlights are given in this brief report. There have been changes and growth in Gatlinburg as well as at THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 49 our Settlement School. It is a constant effort to meet these changes as we strive for growth in our program and thus meet the ideals of Pi Beta Phi in having a project of which all Pi Phis can be proud. Respectfully submitted, MARION W. PRINCE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE May 31, 1967 A ccountants' Report Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We have examined the balance sheet of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School (a division of Pi Beta Phi) as of May 31, 1967, and the related statements of income and expenses and fund balances for the year then ended. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We previously made a similar examination of the financial statements for the preceding year. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and statements of income and expenses and fund balances present fairly the financial position of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at May 31, 1967, and the results of its operations for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

Although Pi Beta Phi is 100 years old we are eagerly sought and still growing and going strong. During the current year 47 inquiries have been received by the Director of Extension. There were 26 from local groups, 6 from administrations wishing Pi Phi to establish a chapter on their campus, 4 from Dean of Women and 11 from Alumme. The following are extension requests reviewed in the past year: Indiana University, New Kensington, Pennsylvania University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin Sacramento State College, Sacramento, California Stephen F. Austin College, Nacogdoches, Texas Newberry College, Newberry, South Carolina State College of Iowa, Cedar Falls, Iowa Defiance College, Defiance, Ohio Jacksonville University, Jacksonville, Florida St. Mary's University, San Antonio, Texas C.

It was with regret that Grand Council rejected some invitations from schools of sound scholastic reputation. Loyal and interested Pi Phi local alum= would have been willing to provide their assistance but the current faculty attitudes and restrictionson membership selection rights, precluded further consideration. Other invitations were rejected because the schools do not meet Pi Phi requirements or because our current commitments prevented our involvement. Over a year ago a petition was received from Pi Alpha Theta, a local sorority at Bethany College, Bethany, West Virginia, for active membership in Pi Beta Phi. Also, a very cordial invitation from the President of Bethany College to locate a chapter of Pi Beta Phi on the Bethany campus. Bethany College, established in March 1840, is located near Wheeling, West Virginia and 38 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is a distinguished and fully accredited institution for higher education. Enrollment deliberately limited to about 1100 students, admission is selective. The faculty is composed of 70% doctorates and all professors have their masters degree. Pupil-teacher ratio is 14 to 1. The Director of Extension, the Delta Province President and Alumnae Province President, a delegate from the chapters in Delta province have visited the college and met with Pi Alpha Theta local sorority. No negative votes have been received since the visit. This group of young women in Pi Alpha Theta have put a lot of thought and work into their organization. Their scholastic average is above the all sorority, all women and all college. Pi Beta Phi was selected after studying Baird's Manual because of Pi Phi strong alumnm organization and our well known service to others. They also knew of the local Alumnae Club in Wheeling, West Virginia. Delta Province Alumnae Clubs and chapters have enthusiastically endorsed Pi Alpha Theta for active membership in Pi Beta Phi. There are 4 national sororities at Bethany College Alpha Xi Delta installed in 19013; Zeta Tau Alpha installed in 1905 ; Kappa Delta in-stalled in 1923 and Phi Mu installed in 1939. There will be no expense for housing as the sororities live in sorority suites in the dormitories. The school has offered the counselor a position as assistant head resident of the dormitory where Pi Alpha Theta lives, room and board will be free, her own apartment plus a salary of around $150 per month. She will be allowed to take courses or audit them. The Director of Extension moved that the convention accept the petition of Pi Alpha Theta of Bethany College, at Bethany, West Virginia to be a colony of Pi Beta Phi in the fall of 1967. The motion was seconded by the delegate from West Virginia Alpha. The Delta Province President, Alumnae Province President, delegate from the Wheeling Alumnae Club and the delegate from North Carolina Beta spoke in favor of accepting the petition of Pi Alpha Theta. The convention voted to accept the petition and Pi Beta Phi will have a colony on the Bethany College campus in the fall of 1967. The second invitation came from Dean Betty Cosby and the Panhellenic Council of the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. The invitation reads as follows, "On behalf of the Panhellenic Council of the University of Florida and the office of the Dean of Women, I should like to extend to Pi Beta Phi an invitation tcY colonize at the University at your earliest convenience." For over ten years there has been hope that this invitation would come to Pi Beta Phi. The Director of Extension met with the actives and alumnae from Theta Province, attending the Centennial Convention, to discuss the invitation from the University of Florida. It was the unan 51
