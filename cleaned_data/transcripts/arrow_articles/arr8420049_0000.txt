        Elizabeth Kingman Heads New Project Committee As Pi Beta Phi puts her hand to the task of weaving past achievement into future accomplishment in the field of philanthropic endeavor, it has called on a talented and capable sister to play a key role in that task. She is Elizabeth Yelm Kingman, Colorado Beta Pi Phi, and now an Omaha, Nebraska resident. Mrs. Kingman brings a background of formal training, civic interest and participation and a natural inclination for the decorative arts to her responsibility as chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Governors for Arrow in The Smokies. This is the Pi Phi project that has grown out of its Settlement School University of Tennessee Summer Craft Workshop. Betty, as she is known to friends, family and Pi Phi sisters, majored in anthropology at the University of Denver and has both A.B., and A.M. degrees from that institution. A Pi Phi there, she was one of 20 initiated by Amy Burnham Onken in 1930. Her husband, Eugene Kingman is Director of the Joslyn Art Museum in Nebraska, a post he has held the past 20 years. He is a Yale graduate and was the first director of the Philbrook Art Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where the Kingmans lived before moving to Omaha. While her Pi Phi daughters, Mixie (Kansas Alpha), and Betsy (Colorado Beta), were growing up, Betty was active in civic projects. She was also busy in the Women's Association of the Joslyn and available for assistance in preparing museum exhibits and arranging entertainment there. She is head of the Museum Education Committee, an advisory body which promotes art classes at the Museum. As chairman of this Committee, she is a member of the Joslyn Women's Association Board of Directors. She has also been an active member of the Symphony Guild and the Theater Guild. More recently she has become interested in the promotion of figure skating in Omaha for a very good reason. Her daughter Betsy is an accomplished figure skater. Betty's strong interests in the decorative arts stem from her formal training in archaeological subject in college and from her close association with museum work. Five trips abroad on art tours have whetted Elizabeth Y. Kingman these special interests even more. Three of the trips were Joslyn Art Museum Tours, led by her husband. The others were conducted by the Archives of American Art. Speaking of her new interest in art and design through her sorority she says, "As I become better acquainted with Pi Phi's philanthropy, I am even more convinced that the beauty that can be achieved by creative vision and disciplined craftsmanship is evident in the groundwork laid during the years of Summer Workshops with the University of Tennessee at the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. A wonderfully solid foundation is there. The growth of Arrow in the Smokies into a new "structure" of satisfying lines will need the proper attitude of support from all Pi Phis, the at-traction of good faculty for teaching the attachment of its students of their progress, and satisfaction of achievement in their creations. I am happy to be a part of it all." She Crossed Atlantic to Attend Convention From the song "Ocean to Ocean" comes the idea that no matter where you are, Pi Beta Phi is with you. This is certainly true in the case of Margaret Strum Acheson, national chairman of the Committee on Transfers from 1952 until 1960. Mrs. Acheson, of Florida Beta, came from Purley, Surrey, England, where she has lived for seven years, to attend the Centennial Convention. Mrs. Acheson said that fraternity women from all over England gather together twice a year. At ThankSgivitag there is a Panhellenic Luncheon, and in the spring there is a Panhellenic Evening Party for husbands and wives. Each sorority has a turn in hosting the annual events. Mrs. Acheson said there have been as many as twenty-five Pi Phis in attendance. 48 THE NEW CENTENNIAL PROJECT BUILDING PLANS OF PI BETA PHI THE FUTURE Here our peak is lost in the clouds. How high we go will depend on excellence of Faculty and the support of Pi Phis everywhere. PROJECTED NEXT YEAR on the wonderful foundations. .1 0 ARROW IN THE SMOKES with the UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE The FOUNDATION solid and inspiring a 12-grade school Summer Workshop with the Univ: of Tennessee 1953-1967 Pi Beta Phi's early commitment to establish an educational facility. ~ti 111111 Help from the people of Gatlinburg alm g The BUILDING BLOCKS 49 Centennial Project Reviewed in Dinner Program "Century of Service" was the dinner theme at Monday night's meal gathering of Pi Phis at the Centennial Convention and Pi Beta Phi philanthropy was the dinner-program topic. The emphasis was on the Centennial project story. Evelyn Peters Kyle, Grand Vice President of Philanthropies, was the mistress of ceremonies. In introducing the program she said, "If there is any language that can be understood by people in all parts of the world and throughout all ages it is Art. "It is through the tracings on the walls of caves that we have learned of generations past, and future generations will learn how we feel about the present day world from the art we leave. "The desire to express one's ideas and feelings is felt by almost every person and these ideas and feelings can be put into material form. "The materials of art are the materials of life and the rules of art are the rules of life. The most important rule is harmony. Sometimes harmony is called unity and unity is a familiar word to members of Pi Beta Phi, for each of us realizes that unity is also strength. "Our unity was displayed in our choice of a Centennial project. It is Pi Phi's spirit of creativity for the second 100 years." Later in the program, Mrs. Kyle said, "Pi Phi's pioneering spirit asserts itself again. We are once more blazing a trail with our newest philanthropy. Nothing is truer than the words, `Our influence may fall where we can never be'. Not in person can we each go to Gatlinburg but through our contributions we can help build for a second century." Recognition of Gifts Betty Bailey Hall, chairman of the Centennial Fund Committee, recognized those persons who had given untiring service or made other contributions of self and talent and outstanding financial gifts. She also traced the history of the fund along the theme of constructing a building, saying, "That which is constructed can only be loved after it is constructed. That which is created is loved before it is begun . . . All long lasting buildings start with a foundation. Our Art and Crafts Center started with a foundation, a very firm one. In fact through the years it was a complete entity of its own . . . a, school, dormitories, health center, Arrowcraft and Summer 'Craft Workshop." Mrs. Hall developed the building metaphor theme further by comparing the Centennial Committees to builders of the framework and others who had contributed various ideas or useful projects to "decorators." Contributions were compared to building bricks and time was allowed in the pro-gram for delegates of clubs and chapters to announce new contributions. Helen Moffitt Russell, Centennial Committees Coordinator, presented a bouquet of roses to Maryla Walters, Massachussetts Beta, who had designed the Centennial charm. Project Review Progress from a nebulous idea to a dream on the threshold of realization for the Centennial Project was traced by Mildred Allen Hightower, who had served first as Chairman of the Centennial Projects Committee and for two years as Chairman of the Centennial Development Committee. Mrs. Hightower noted the beginning of the idea in 1954, when it was discussed at the Pi Phi Convention in Miami saying, "We wanted a project for every Pi Phi to share to give something to the world to show our appreciation of having shared a special kind of friendship." She told the convention dinner audience that a total of 34 ideas were considered by the committee in a two year period between 1960-62 and that the 43rd biennial convention in 1962 narrowed these suggestions to four. The 44th Convention at Victoria was the next step in the development. She said, "In the Victorian report, the project committee considering land, buildings, man power and modern needs in the field of philanthropy, recommended the Arts and Crafts Center be established, taking the place of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. It was a unanimous vote to accept this recommendation, by the convention. Today, three years later we have the beginning of ARROW in the Smokies. Many people, many projects and the unselfish desire of Pi Phis everywhere have made this project a reality.
