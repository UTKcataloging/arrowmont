        34 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Your chairman spent several weeks at the Settlement School in November and December, 1919, and again in May, 1920, during which month Kate Miller also visited Gatlinburg, preparatory to beginning work for our Endowment. Fund. Letters every week and sometimes oftener between the chairman and the head resident have been instrumental in making the work run as smoothly as possible. The school opened in August, according to Sevier County custom, with Evelyn Bishop, Emily Burton and Abby Runyan continuing their work. Ruth Sturley, Washington .A, came as principal, and Wilbur Creswell taught manual training and served as boys' leader, The school had a very good year. While the enrollment was no greater than in the years before the war, the attendance improved,and the quality of the work done was excellent. Miss Sturley did much, with the assistance of the other workers, toward systematizing and raising the standard of the work of all the grades. Mr. Creswell awakened great interest in manual training. It was not unusual to see boys busy at their problems in the shop after school, and all day on Saturday. Many of them made large desks, not so well as they can make their next articles of furniture, undoubtedly, but sufficiently well to have awakened an interest in, and liking for, the good Work with the beautiful native woods, and the finer finish which will come with practice. "Aunt Lizzie" Reagan is still holding her position of house-mother and chaperon and general confidant. Her interest in the welfare of the school and in the resident Pi Phis is always paramount. During the summer of 1919, she gathered and canned innumerable quarts of blackberries, made jellies, etc., which helped to balance the fare in a year lacking even the usual native fruits. This summer, with a better harvest of native fruits, she has been just as active in getting an abundance of blackberries, canning the peaches, and any other fruit as it ripened, Mrs. Profit lived in the Stuart Cottage as housekeeper for .Mr. Creswell and the boys who came, after "county school," to stay throughout the week. Miss Runyan, in addition to her school-room work, had charge of the little girls in the old cottage. Harrison Ownby, living with his family in the Whaley cottage on the property adjoining the Pi Phi land, was employed as man-of-all-work. Our baskets have been in greater demand than ever and many have been sold, making returns larger than usual. Miss Bishop constantly is on the lookout for new makers of baskets, Pi Phis sending in orders will get better results if they will try to send them as long before the baskets are needed as possible. On account of distances and difficulties in communication, several weeks are needed for the satisfactory filling of orders, generally. Field work occupies the time of CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 ANNUAL REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL . 35 the women as well as the men until late in the fall, so that they have little time for the basketry until all the fall work is out of the way. Little weaving was done. We still are trying to find some one who can teach the weaving of the more popular small pieces. Mrs. Matheny who has had charge of the school weaving at Berea is helping us in this search. This will necessitate the purchase of two or three small looms, costing $40 each. This size weaves up to two feet in width, and Miss Bishop feels that the school girls will take to this work while they refuse to make the heavy counterpanes woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. The plan is to find a skilled instructor for probably three months, who can impart her knowledge to one of our Pi Phi resident teachers, the latter can then take charge of weaving in the school. Much neighborhood visiting was done during the year. Wherever one goes among the homes of Gatlinburg, one hears affectionate praise for all the Pi Phis who have worked faithfully for the community. The residents do not have all the housework to do that fell to the lot of workers in the early days and so they are free to tramp up and down the "creeks and hollers," after school work is done, whenever weather permits, making friends with the people. A very active part has been taken in the church and in B. Y. P. U. by all the residents. Meetings of B. Y. P. I.T. were held at the request of the young people, in the schoolhouse during the greater part of the year, and Were wonderfully well attended and conducted. Miss Bishop had charge of the music and the other teachers helped in other ways. Mr. Creswell is a good church worker and his influence among the boys and young men is felt. A few parties have been given at the residents' cottage and parties and debates at the schoolhouse, not as many nor as varied, however, as will be possible after we get our electric lights. Some minor improvements have been made, the boys assisting in the work: A stairway was installed, temporarily, in the Stuart Cottage, to make it usable as a boys' dormitory until something more suitable can be provided; the road through the grounds has been gravelled and "stoned" ; the field fence with woven wire and gates put up ; one or two gates made by the manual training boys rustic ones one of which was placed near the 16g bridge the "Leah Stock Bridge." Apple trees and grape vines have been set out ; the schoolhouse painted two coats, and all the windows puttied, every bit of the original putty having come off ; some windows screened and porches either newly screened or the old. screening repaired. A circular saw has been purchased which not only saws a large amount of fuel for our entire plant but also serves as a community asset, when it sometimes is harnessed to the wheelof the family Ford and quickly saws a season's supply of wood. Upon thorough investigation it was found that the factory would 'require too much capital, more than several CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 36 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI years' budgets, to run it as it should be run, so the machinery was sold to a local group, Mr. Creswell and two brothers, Mr. Lawson Reagan, Mr. Ownby, etc., and in this way, the neighborhood has another enter-prise and several young men are given employment locally. At present the company is using the old Ephraim Ogle mill and dam until they can afford a better location, and they have filled several orders for pieces of furniture. Whenever possible to get them in without much, if any, added expense, a number of visits have been made to chapters and clubs. Miss Bishop, en route to Vermont for her month's vacation, which by the way, became greatly shortened thereby, made the following: Columbus chapter and club ; Athens chapter and club; Cleveland, Akron, and Buffalo clubs; Syracuse club and chapter; Rochester club Middlebury and Burlington chapters at their Founders' Day in Middlebury; Boston, New Haven, New York and Baltimore clubs. Your chairman enjoyed meeting with Minneapolis and St. Paul Club at their annual Christmas Luncheon; with Beloit and Detroit at their Founders' Day luncheons; with Franklin chapter and club; with Indianapolis at a chapter meeting and a luncheon with club members; and with both actives and alumnae in Madison at the chapter-house Sunday dinner. En route to Gatlinburg in May, at the invitation of Mr. McBrien, Federal Director of Rural School Extension, a talk was given b'ST' ybur chairman on our Settlement School and much interest was shown by the educators assembled. This was at Berea, Kentucky, and the occasion was a national conference on rural education. At the Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, early in April, the school was represented by Miss Sturley, Miss Bishop having started on her way North at that time. The cordial hospitality extended to the visitors by clubs and chapters was delightful indeed. Everywhere Pi Phis showed the greatest eagerness to do more for the school, and many questions were asked about present conditions and needs. This next year I hope we may be able to make more visits. Clubs and chapters have responded to the call for funds splendidly. We found upon meeting with them that many clubs now have definite working plans operating throughout the year for the raising of funds plans which are carried out well. The Cleveland Club, for instance, sells Royce Goods, has the penny banks for birthdays, etc., sells the Christmas cards, I believe, and employs other means definitely understood and agreed.to by its members generally. Results in 1919 were a contribution of $71 1, an amount exceeded only by Lincoln's $944! Cleveland's slogan is "$1,000 in 1920" and even now a part of this has been raised. Raising funds for the Settlement School is regarded by the Cleveland Club not as a burden but it is done with great jollity and enthusiasm, and one result is a splendidly united and efficient alumnae club. Right here may I suggest that every club + CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 ANNUAL REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 37 have a Settlement School Committee, one member of which could have charge of sending to Miss Reisinger the magazine suhscriptions ; another the pledges, their collection, renewal and soliciting (not over-looking isolated Pi Phis living at some distance, perhaps, but within the state) while the third could have the planning of other methods of raising money? Let us remember to have EVERY magazine subscription made through our own agency. Let us get our friends' subscriptions as well as our own to send to Miss Reisinger. While the amount this year is more than any amount of previous years, it is not anywhere near the sum we can realize through the loyal patronage of ALL Pi Phis. As soon as you receive your October ARROW, if you have not already done so, make out your list, or the chapter list, if that is your charge, and send to Miss Reisinger, the sooner the better, to get the reductions which are offered for acceptance before the early part of November. While reporting funds raised last year, it must not be forgotten that two Pi Phis have offered to give a scholarship, -Mary Anderson, Michigan B, of Detroit, Mich., and Ruth Colby, Illinois E, of Minneapolis. A scholarship covering all expenses of one child for a whole year means practically one hundred dollars. The year of 1920 finds Evelyn Bishop still serving as head resident, much to our satisfaction and that of the people of Gatlinburg. Helen Chew, Ohio A, is principal ; Marie Ditmars, Indiana A, who taught at Gatlinburg in 1914-15, now has the intermediate grades ; Emily Burton begins her fourth year with the "least ones" ; and. Mr. Creswell will teach manual training and agriculture; Mrs. Creswell takes charge of the domestic economy work, both classroom and general, and teaches some of the school subjects, in order that the high school subjects needed may be offered. Mr. and Mrs. Creswell, together, will give the full time of one teacher. His work with the mill demands half his time, so he is working on half pay, as compared with last year, for the present. He may find it necessary after this year to give full time to the mill, in which case we shall need another man to fill his position. If any Pi Phi knows of a man qualified for the place and the work of boys' leader, please communicate with your chairman. It is a difficult position to fill. Mr. Creswell is well fitted for the various phases of the position so we hope we shall not have to lose him. Miss Burton's summer was spent in Italy which delayed her return to the school. Lillian Frantz, New York A, took this occasion to visit the Settlement School and help out in the absence of Miss Burton, during her two weeks' delay. It is a great pleasure to report, after a year's efforts, that a nurse, Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario A, has been engaged for next year or for as long as we can finance this work. We must do it in some wav, for her services are so much needed. She will receive a salary of $75 per month and expenses, which we all recognize is less than she could CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 38 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI get readily in any other than Settlement work. Miss Higinbotham is now at Henry St. Settlement, New York City, in practice work, and will be given two weeks at Hindman Settlement School, Kentucky, also under the Red Cross, before coming to us. We hope to see her launched in her Gatlinburg field by the first of October. The Hospital Fund, of $892.69, has been sent to the treasury by Mrs. Helmick, former chairman of the Committee. We are very grateful to have this beginning toward the accomplishment of a seriously ,needed work. Perhaps before the year is over, we can realize our dream of a simply but well equipped hospital with its three wards, each containing three or four beds, an operating room and nurse's workroom, etc. Local doctors are'eager to cooperate in the campaign against diseased tonsils, adenoids, defective teeth, and in holding clinics for the help and education generally of the people of Gatlinburg. Some other dreams for the futureinclude the following: An Auditorium or Community House, where all neighborhood meetings can be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic home-comings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics and social gatherings, clinics, etc. Ruth Sturley, who decided she could not return to Gatlinburg this year, is greatly interested in getting a moving picture plant for the school and has undertaken to raise the necessary price. She realizes that it would be of great educational value and that through its medium questions of health, child welfare, and sanitation could he presented without giving any offense. We now have meetings, such as can be accommodated, in the three main schoolrooms thrown together. This does not always furnish adequate space. BesideS, the teachers find it difficult to hold school in rooms which are used too much for other meetings, and the people feel that there should be an ample auditorium. Other schools have such a building and it seems a matter of pride to some of our loyal Gatlin-burg friends that Pi Phi School have one. The expense of raising-the roof of the school building and converting the attic space into, an auditorium has been estimated by a Sevierville firm at $5,000. Probably the cost would be considerably more than thiS estimate for the space is not really adapted to rebuilding into one large room, and -the roof would have to be entirely. removed, the chimney rebuilt in the end instead of the center where it now is. A separate building, therefore, would be of much less expense and more generally useful, while the attic space would thus be left for more schoolrooms which will be needed before long. We find it necessary, now, to create more space by giving the manual training separate housing and by another means which I will mention later. Dormitories are needed. We who have experienced the difficulties of transportation realize that some children never can be given our school's benefits without dormitories. CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 ANNUAL REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 39 Land is a necessity. I had hoped we might purchase some adjoining pieces this last year but the wherewithal was not available. Someone has suggested that the Pi Phi husbands be given the opportunity to furnish funds for the purchase of more land! Others have mentioned the thank offering whenever a little new Pi Phi enters the world. Some of the clubs who have expressed the ,desire to do something "individual" perhaps can work up one of these plans or some other. Really, we are hoping for some large contributions, in addition to the club and chapter contributions to the annual budget. There are many generous philanthropists, I am told sometimes, who would be glad to put money into. our school where results, with these loyal, pure-bred American people, will justify its expenditure. If any Pi Phis know of such, why not place before them the opportunity? The basement should be finished. This fall it is the intention to finish excavating, concrete the floor and build in full length windows. This will furnish a place for games on rainy days, for the children to eat their lunches, and for the meetings that cannot be held upstairs in the schoolrooms. Then as finances permit, it may be decided feasible to install the domestic economy equipment, and serve here the hot lunch, or the one nutritious dish to supplement the lunch brought from honie, of which Miss Bishop keenly realizes the need. A lavatory should be installed so that the children can wash hands before the noon lunch is eaten. Later on, as funds permit, another portion Of the basement space can be fitted up with showers to meet another community need. , Sanitation demands a bubble fountain. Is there a Pi Phi who desires to give one? Considerable fencing still is needed a minor need, to be sure, but one which would be appreciated by "Dan," "jerz," and the Pi Phi pigs. Also the meadow below the garden and the lane should be tiled. Mr. Maples has offered to bear a part of this latter expense since his land will be benefited. Electric lighting has been investigated this past year and it is about decided to install the .Delco system. under present prices of the sup-plies it will be expensive, but lights are our most immediate need, and the Tennessee managers of this system assure the school the best in every way. We had hoped that the power at the new factory could be utilized but that seems inadequate. It looks now as though it would be wisest to install the entire plant including the engine. The cost, for all the buildings and grounds, complete, approximates $2,000. The chairman expects to be in Gatlinburg during the month of October for the purpose of supervising this installation. Pi Phis frequently ask for some individual work or gift for the Settlement School, beside the regular contributions to the budget. Perhaps a list given here will not be out of place. There are needed, CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 40 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI as mentioned before, two small looms, a bubble fountain, a school victrola, also, educational records, including the folk games and patriotic songs, blankets, mattress pads, both single and double bed size, sheeting and pillow tubing, towels, table linen and table padding, rags for weaving into rugs, good pictures are needed for the school-room, preferably reproductions of the masterpieces, a bolt of cotton cloth suitable for -making into nightgowns for the little girls who. have to stay over night in had weather. Teachers would appreciate post-cards from the principal cities and historic places. Books always are acceptable. A set of new maps must be bought this year, if new boundaries are sufficiently established. Pi Phis before deciding upon any of these gifts should consult Miss Bishop in order to avoid useless duplication. Christmas boxes sent by clubs or chapters this year will be more certain of reaching the School in time if they are sent parcel post as freight and express are very uncertain and much more likely to go astray and during the first week of December. If in doubt as to what gifts will be best liked by the boys and girls, write Miss Bishop. She will be glad to make suggestions. Reprints of the history published in the June ARROW were made by Banta Co. and can be obtained from the chairman. There are available, also, copies of some of the pictures from the same issue, which clubs and chapters can have for their Settlement School pro-grams if they desire them. Last year's work in school and community was very good. With the retention of four teachers experienced in Gatlinburg work, and the good foundation already existing, next year promises improvement and development. Neighborhood interest and a spirit of cooperation seems on the increase. Good schools are being established in adjoining communities. One, within ten or twelve miles, although just begun this summer, already has a corps of teachers, two hundred acres of land, a nurse, hospital and auditorium under construction, electric lights, etc. Although not far away, it cannot infringe upon our territory to any extent in so mountainous a country, but it can infringe upon our prestige. So, it behooves us, as loyal Pi Phis, jealous of our nation-wide reputation as pioneers among fraternities in this field of settlement work, not to be satisfied with our good but small beginning! We must have land and buildings, equipment, and endowment fund, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children for whom our present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles. Dormitories are the only solution for many of these. Shall wecontributions not try for the big gifts of money this year as well as the usual club ? And shall not each club resolve, as plucky Cleveland has, to make next year's the biggest ever? Also, each chapter pledge to forego, as did our loyal Delta Province, an occa CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 ANNUAL REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 41 sional sundae or afternoon tea and send a substantial contribution, instead, to these brothers and sisters, such likeable, worthwhile, and .responsive ones, in the Smoky Mountains? Melinda Stuart, acting treasurer of the Settlement School, is now a member of the Settlement School Committee and will have charge of finances this year. Mrs. Richardson will continue to assist her as she has this last year, but all money, pledges, etc., should be sent, whether . by Province Vice-presidents or individuals, directly to Miss Stuart rather than to Mrs. Richardson. This greatly facilitates the treasurer's work. May Keller still has charge of teachers' applications and Kate Miller of the Endowment Fund. if any errors appear regarding club or chapter or individual gifts please notify your chairman promptly. We desire that full and proper credit be given for all the generous and loyal support of the past year. Respectfully submitted, ABBIE B. LANGMAID, Chairman of the Settlement School Committee.

        38 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI get readily in any other than Settlement work. Miss Higinbotham is now at Henry St. Settlement, New York City, in practice work, and will be given two weeks at Hindman Settlement School, Kentucky, also under the Red Cross, before coming to us. We hope to see her launched in her Gatlinburg field by the first of October. The Hospital Fund, of $892.69, has been sent to the treasury by Mrs. Helmick, former chairman of the Committee. We are very grateful to have this beginning toward the accomplishment of a seriously ,needed work. Perhaps before the year is over, we can realize our dream of a simply but well equipped hospital with its three wards, each containing three or four beds, an operating room and nurse's workroom, etc. Local doctors are'eager to cooperate in the campaign against diseased tonsils, adenoids, defective teeth, and in holding clinics for the help and education generally of the people of Gatlinburg. Some other dreams for the futureinclude the following: An Auditorium or Community House, where all neighborhood meetings can be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic home-comings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics and social gatherings, clinics, etc. Ruth Sturley, who decided she could not return to Gatlinburg this year, is greatly interested in getting a moving picture plant for the school and has undertaken to raise the necessary price. She realizes that it would be of great educational value and that through its medium questions of health, child welfare, and sanitation could he presented without giving any offense. We now have meetings, such as can be accommodated, in the three main schoolrooms thrown together. This does not always furnish adequate space. BesideS, the teachers find it difficult to hold school in rooms which are used too much for other meetings, and the people feel that there should be an ample auditorium. Other schools have such a building and it seems a matter of pride to some of our loyal Gatlin-burg friends that Pi Phi School have one. The expense of raising-the roof of the school building and converting the attic space into, an auditorium has been estimated by a Sevierville firm at $5,000. Probably the cost would be considerably more than thiS estimate for the space is not really adapted to rebuilding into one large room, and -the roof would have to be entirely. removed, the chimney rebuilt in the end instead of the center where it now is. A separate building, therefore, would be of much less expense and more generally useful, while the attic space would thus be left for more schoolrooms which will be needed before long. We find it necessary, now, to create more space by giving the manual training separate housing and by another means which I will mention later. Dormitories are needed. We who have experienced the difficulties of transportation realize that some children never can be given our school's benefits without dormitories. CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 ANNUAL REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 39 Land is a necessity. I had hoped we might purchase some adjoining pieces this last year but the wherewithal was not available. Someone has suggested that the Pi Phi husbands be given the opportunity to furnish funds for the purchase of more land! Others have mentioned the thank offering whenever a little new Pi Phi enters the world. Some of the clubs who have expressed the ,desire to do something "individual" perhaps can work up one of these plans or some other. Really, we are hoping for some large contributions, in addition to the club and chapter contributions to the annual budget. There are many generous philanthropists, I am told sometimes, who would be glad to put money into. our school where results, with these loyal, pure-bred American people, will justify its expenditure. If any Pi Phis know of such, why not place before them the opportunity? The basement should be finished. This fall it is the intention to finish excavating, concrete the floor and build in full length windows. This will furnish a place for games on rainy days, for the children to eat their lunches, and for the meetings that cannot be held upstairs in the schoolrooms. Then as finances permit, it may be decided feasible to install the domestic economy equipment, and serve here the hot lunch, or the one nutritious dish to supplement the lunch brought from honie, of which Miss Bishop keenly realizes the need. A lavatory should be installed so that the children can wash hands before the noon lunch is eaten. Later on, as funds permit, another portion Of the basement space can be fitted up with showers to meet another community need. , Sanitation demands a bubble fountain. Is there a Pi Phi who desires to give one? Considerable fencing still is needed a minor need, to be sure, but one which would be appreciated by "Dan," "jerz," and the Pi Phi pigs. Also the meadow below the garden and the lane should be tiled. Mr. Maples has offered to bear a part of this latter expense since his land will be benefited. Electric lighting has been investigated this past year and it is about decided to install the .Delco system. under present prices of the sup-plies it will be expensive, but lights are our most immediate need, and the Tennessee managers of this system assure the school the best in every way. We had hoped that the power at the new factory could be utilized but that seems inadequate. It looks now as though it would be wisest to install the entire plant including the engine. The cost, for all the buildings and grounds, complete, approximates $2,000. The chairman expects to be in Gatlinburg during the month of October for the purpose of supervising this installation. Pi Phis frequently ask for some individual work or gift for the Settlement School, beside the regular contributions to the budget. Perhaps a list given here will not be out of place. There are needed, CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 40 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI as mentioned before, two small looms, a bubble fountain, a school victrola, also, educational records, including the folk games and patriotic songs, blankets, mattress pads, both single and double bed size, sheeting and pillow tubing, towels, table linen and table padding, rags for weaving into rugs, good pictures are needed for the school-room, preferably reproductions of the masterpieces, a bolt of cotton cloth suitable for -making into nightgowns for the little girls who. have to stay over night in had weather.

CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 34 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Your chairman spent several weeks at the Settlement School in November and December, 1919, and again in May, 1920, during which month Kate Miller also visited Gatlinburg, preparatory to beginning work for our Endowment. Fund. Letters every week and sometimes oftener between the chairman and the head resident have been instrumental in making the work run as smoothly as possible. The school opened in August, according to Sevier County custom, with Evelyn Bishop, Emily Burton and Abby Runyan continuing their work. Ruth Sturley, Washington .A, came as principal, and Wilbur Creswell taught manual training and served as boys' leader, The school had a very good year. While the enrollment was no greater than in the years before the war, the attendance improved,and the quality of the work done was excellent. Miss Sturley did much, with the assistance of the other workers, toward systematizing and raising the standard of the work of all the grades. Mr. Creswell awakened great interest in manual training. It was not unusual to see boys busy at their problems in the shop after school, and all day on Saturday. Many of them made large desks, not so well as they can make their next articles of furniture, undoubtedly, but sufficiently well to have awakened an interest in, and liking for, the good Work with the beautiful native woods, and the finer finish which will come with practice. "Aunt Lizzie" Reagan is still holding her position of house-mother and chaperon and general confidant. Her interest in the welfare of the school and in the resident Pi Phis is always paramount. During the summer of 1919, she gathered and canned innumerable quarts of blackberries, made jellies, etc., which helped to balance the fare in a year lacking even the usual native fruits. This summer, with a better harvest of native fruits, she has been just as active in getting an abundance of blackberries, canning the peaches, and any other fruit as it ripened, Mrs. Profit lived in the Stuart Cottage as housekeeper for .Mr. Creswell and the boys who came, after "county school," to stay throughout the week. Miss Runyan, in addition to her school-room work, had charge of the little girls in the old cottage. Harrison Ownby, living with his family in the Whaley cottage on the property adjoining the Pi Phi land, was employed as man-of-all-work. Our baskets have been in greater demand than ever and many have been sold, making returns larger than usual. Miss Bishop constantly is on the lookout for new makers of baskets, Pi Phis sending in orders will get better results if they will try to send them as long before the baskets are needed as possible. On account of distances and difficulties in communication, several weeks are needed for the satisfactory filling of orders, generally. Field work occupies the time of CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 ANNUAL REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL . 35 the women as well as the men until late in the fall, so that they have little time for the basketry until all the fall work is out of the way. Little weaving was done. We still are trying to find some one who can teach the weaving of the more popular small pieces. Mrs. Matheny who has had charge of the school weaving at Berea is helping us in this search. This will necessitate the purchase of two or three small looms, costing $40 each. This size weaves up to two feet in width, and Miss Bishop feels that the school girls will take to this work while they refuse to make the heavy counterpanes woven in years past by their mothers and grandmothers. The plan is to find a skilled instructor for probably three months, who can impart her knowledge to one of our Pi Phi resident teachers, the latter can then take charge of weaving in the school. Much neighborhood visiting was done during the year. Wherever one goes among the homes of Gatlinburg, one hears affectionate praise for all the Pi Phis who have worked faithfully for the community. The residents do not have all the housework to do that fell to the lot of workers in the early days and so they are free to tramp up and down the "creeks and hollers," after school work is done, whenever weather permits, making friends with the people. A very active part has been taken in the church and in B. Y. P. U. by all the residents. Meetings of B. Y. P. I.T. were held at the request of the young people, in the schoolhouse during the greater part of the year, and Were wonderfully well attended and conducted. Miss Bishop had charge of the music and the other teachers helped in other ways. Mr. Creswell is a good church worker and his influence among the boys and young men is felt. A few parties have been given at the residents' cottage and parties and debates at the schoolhouse, not as many nor as varied, however, as will be possible after we get our electric lights. Some minor improvements have been made, the boys assisting in the work: A stairway was installed, temporarily, in the Stuart Cottage, to make it usable as a boys' dormitory until something more suitable can be provided; the road through the grounds has been gravelled and "stoned" ; the field fence with woven wire and gates put up ; one or two gates made by the manual training boys rustic ones one of which was placed near the 16g bridge the "Leah Stock Bridge." Apple trees and grape vines have been set out ; the schoolhouse painted two coats, and all the windows puttied, every bit of the original putty having come off ; some windows screened and porches either newly screened or the old. screening repaired. A circular saw has been purchased which not only saws a large amount of fuel for our entire plant but also serves as a community asset, when it sometimes is harnessed to the wheelof the family Ford and quickly saws a season's supply of wood. Upon thorough investigation it was found that the factory would 'require too much capital, more than several CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 36 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI years' budgets, to run it as it should be run, so the machinery was sold to a local group, Mr. Creswell and two brothers, Mr. Lawson Reagan, Mr. Ownby, etc., and in this way, the neighborhood has another enter-prise and several young men are given employment locally. At present the company is using the old Ephraim Ogle mill and dam until they can afford a better location, and they have filled several orders for pieces of furniture. Whenever possible to get them in without much, if any, added expense, a number of visits have been made to chapters and clubs. Miss Bishop, en route to Vermont for her month's vacation, which by the way, became greatly shortened thereby, made the following: Columbus chapter and club ; Athens chapter and club; Cleveland, Akron, and Buffalo clubs; Syracuse club and chapter; Rochester club Middlebury and Burlington chapters at their Founders' Day in Middlebury; Boston, New Haven, New York and Baltimore clubs. Your chairman enjoyed meeting with Minneapolis and St. Paul Club at their annual Christmas Luncheon; with Beloit and Detroit at their Founders' Day luncheons; with Franklin chapter and club; with Indianapolis at a chapter meeting and a luncheon with club members; and with both actives and alumnae in Madison at the chapter-house Sunday dinner. En route to Gatlinburg in May, at the invitation of Mr. McBrien, Federal Director of Rural School Extension, a talk was given b'ST' ybur chairman on our Settlement School and much interest was shown by the educators assembled. This was at Berea, Kentucky, and the occasion was a national conference on rural education. At the Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, early in April, the school was represented by Miss Sturley, Miss Bishop having started on her way North at that time. The cordial hospitality extended to the visitors by clubs and chapters was delightful indeed. Everywhere Pi Phis showed the greatest eagerness to do more for the school, and many questions were asked about present conditions and needs. This next year I hope we may be able to make more visits. Clubs and chapters have responded to the call for funds splendidly. We found upon meeting with them that many clubs now have definite working plans operating throughout the year for the raising of funds plans which are carried out well. The Cleveland Club, for instance, sells Royce Goods, has the penny banks for birthdays, etc., sells the Christmas cards, I believe, and employs other means definitely understood and agreed.to by its members generally. Results in 1919 were a contribution of $71 1, an amount exceeded only by Lincoln's $944! Cleveland's slogan is "$1,000 in 1920" and even now a part of this has been raised. Raising funds for the Settlement School is regarded by the Cleveland Club not as a burden but it is done with great jollity and enthusiasm, and one result is a splendidly united and efficient alumnae club. Right here may I suggest that every club + CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 ANNUAL REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 37 have a Settlement School Committee, one member of which could have charge of sending to Miss Reisinger the magazine suhscriptions ; another the pledges, their collection, renewal and soliciting (not over-looking isolated Pi Phis living at some distance, perhaps, but within the state) while the third could have the planning of other methods of raising money? Let us remember to have EVERY magazine subscription made through our own agency. Let us get our friends' subscriptions as well as our own to send to Miss Reisinger. While the amount this year is more than any amount of previous years, it is not anywhere near the sum we can realize through the loyal patronage of ALL Pi Phis. As soon as you receive your October ARROW, if you have not already done so, make out your list, or the chapter list, if that is your charge, and send to Miss Reisinger, the sooner the better, to get the reductions which are offered for acceptance before the early part of November. While reporting funds raised last year, it must not be forgotten that two Pi Phis have offered to give a scholarship, -Mary Anderson, Michigan B, of Detroit, Mich., and Ruth Colby, Illinois E, of Minneapolis. A scholarship covering all expenses of one child for a whole year means practically one hundred dollars. The year of 1920 finds Evelyn Bishop still serving as head resident, much to our satisfaction and that of the people of Gatlinburg. Helen Chew, Ohio A, is principal ; Marie Ditmars, Indiana A, who taught at Gatlinburg in 1914-15, now has the intermediate grades ; Emily Burton begins her fourth year with the "least ones" ; and. Mr. Creswell will teach manual training and agriculture; Mrs. Creswell takes charge of the domestic economy work, both classroom and general, and teaches some of the school subjects, in order that the high school subjects needed may be offered. Mr. and Mrs. Creswell, together, will give the full time of one teacher. His work with the mill demands half his time, so he is working on half pay, as compared with last year, for the present. He may find it necessary after this year to give full time to the mill, in which case we shall need another man to fill his position. If any Pi Phi knows of a man qualified for the place and the work of boys' leader, please communicate with your chairman. It is a difficult position to fill. Mr. Creswell is well fitted for the various phases of the position so we hope we shall not have to lose him. Miss Burton's summer was spent in Italy which delayed her return to the school. Lillian Frantz, New York A, took this occasion to visit the Settlement School and help out in the absence of Miss Burton, during her two weeks' delay. It is a great pleasure to report, after a year's efforts, that a nurse, Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario A, has been engaged for next year or for as long as we can finance this work. We must do it in some wav, for her services are so much needed. She will receive a salary of $75 per month and expenses, which we all recognize is less than she could CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 38 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI get readily in any other than Settlement work. Miss Higinbotham is now at Henry St. Settlement, New York City, in practice work, and will be given two weeks at Hindman Settlement School, Kentucky, also under the Red Cross, before coming to us. We hope to see her launched in her Gatlinburg field by the first of October. The Hospital Fund, of $892.69, has been sent to the treasury by Mrs. Helmick, former chairman of the Committee. We are very grateful to have this beginning toward the accomplishment of a seriously ,needed work. Perhaps before the year is over, we can realize our dream of a simply but well equipped hospital with its three wards, each containing three or four beds, an operating room and nurse's workroom, etc. Local doctors are'eager to cooperate in the campaign against diseased tonsils, adenoids, defective teeth, and in holding clinics for the help and education generally of the people of Gatlinburg. Some other dreams for the futureinclude the following: An Auditorium or Community House, where all neighborhood meetings can be held farmers' clubs, political meetings, patriotic home-comings, moving pictures, school or neighborhood dramatics and social gatherings, clinics, etc. Ruth Sturley, who decided she could not return to Gatlinburg this year, is greatly interested in getting a moving picture plant for the school and has undertaken to raise the necessary price. She realizes that it would be of great educational value and that through its medium questions of health, child welfare, and sanitation could he presented without giving any offense. We now have meetings, such as can be accommodated, in the three main schoolrooms thrown together. This does not always furnish adequate space. BesideS, the teachers find it difficult to hold school in rooms which are used too much for other meetings, and the people feel that there should be an ample auditorium. Other schools have such a building and it seems a matter of pride to some of our loyal Gatlin-burg friends that Pi Phi School have one. The expense of raising-the roof of the school building and converting the attic space into, an auditorium has been estimated by a Sevierville firm at $5,000. Probably the cost would be considerably more than thiS estimate for the space is not really adapted to rebuilding into one large room, and -the roof would have to be entirely. removed, the chimney rebuilt in the end instead of the center where it now is. A separate building, therefore, would be of much less expense and more generally useful, while the attic space would thus be left for more schoolrooms which will be needed before long. We find it necessary, now, to create more space by giving the manual training separate housing and by another means which I will mention later. Dormitories are needed. We who have experienced the difficulties of transportation realize that some children never can be given our school's benefits without dormitories. CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 ANNUAL REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 39 Land is a necessity. I had hoped we might purchase some adjoining pieces this last year but the wherewithal was not available. Someone has suggested that the Pi Phi husbands be given the opportunity to furnish funds for the purchase of more land! Others have mentioned the thank offering whenever a little new Pi Phi enters the world. Some of the clubs who have expressed the ,desire to do something "individual" perhaps can work up one of these plans or some other. Really, we are hoping for some large contributions, in addition to the club and chapter contributions to the annual budget. There are many generous philanthropists, I am told sometimes, who would be glad to put money into. our school where results, with these loyal, pure-bred American people, will justify its expenditure. If any Pi Phis know of such, why not place before them the opportunity? The basement should be finished. This fall it is the intention to finish excavating, concrete the floor and build in full length windows. This will furnish a place for games on rainy days, for the children to eat their lunches, and for the meetings that cannot be held upstairs in the schoolrooms. Then as finances permit, it may be decided feasible to install the domestic economy equipment, and serve here the hot lunch, or the one nutritious dish to supplement the lunch brought from honie, of which Miss Bishop keenly realizes the need. A lavatory should be installed so that the children can wash hands before the noon lunch is eaten. Later on, as funds permit, another portion Of the basement space can be fitted up with showers to meet another community need. , Sanitation demands a bubble fountain. Is there a Pi Phi who desires to give one? Considerable fencing still is needed a minor need, to be sure, but one which would be appreciated by "Dan," "jerz," and the Pi Phi pigs. Also the meadow below the garden and the lane should be tiled. Mr. Maples has offered to bear a part of this latter expense since his land will be benefited. Electric lighting has been investigated this past year and it is about decided to install the .Delco system. under present prices of the sup-plies it will be expensive, but lights are our most immediate need, and the Tennessee managers of this system assure the school the best in every way. We had hoped that the power at the new factory could be utilized but that seems inadequate. It looks now as though it would be wisest to install the entire plant including the engine. The cost, for all the buildings and grounds, complete, approximates $2,000. The chairman expects to be in Gatlinburg during the month of October for the purpose of supervising this installation. Pi Phis frequently ask for some individual work or gift for the Settlement School, beside the regular contributions to the budget. Perhaps a list given here will not be out of place. There are needed, CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 40 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI as mentioned before, two small looms, a bubble fountain, a school victrola, also, educational records, including the folk games and patriotic songs, blankets, mattress pads, both single and double bed size, sheeting and pillow tubing, towels, table linen and table padding, rags for weaving into rugs, good pictures are needed for the school-room, preferably reproductions of the masterpieces, a bolt of cotton cloth suitable for -making into nightgowns for the little girls who. have to stay over night in had weather. Teachers would appreciate post-cards from the principal cities and historic places. Books always are acceptable. A set of new maps must be bought this year, if new boundaries are sufficiently established. Pi Phis before deciding upon any of these gifts should consult Miss Bishop in order to avoid useless duplication. Christmas boxes sent by clubs or chapters this year will be more certain of reaching the School in time if they are sent parcel post as freight and express are very uncertain and much more likely to go astray and during the first week of December. If in doubt as to what gifts will be best liked by the boys and girls, write Miss Bishop. She will be glad to make suggestions. Reprints of the history published in the June ARROW were made by Banta Co. and can be obtained from the chairman. There are available, also, copies of some of the pictures from the same issue, which clubs and chapters can have for their Settlement School pro-grams if they desire them. Last year's work in school and community was very good. With the retention of four teachers experienced in Gatlinburg work, and the good foundation already existing, next year promises improvement and development. Neighborhood interest and a spirit of cooperation seems on the increase. Good schools are being established in adjoining communities. One, within ten or twelve miles, although just begun this summer, already has a corps of teachers, two hundred acres of land, a nurse, hospital and auditorium under construction, electric lights, etc. Although not far away, it cannot infringe upon our territory to any extent in so mountainous a country, but it can infringe upon our prestige. So, it behooves us, as loyal Pi Phis, jealous of our nation-wide reputation as pioneers among fraternities in this field of settlement work, not to be satisfied with our good but small beginning! We must have land and buildings, equipment, and endowment fund, in order to furnish opportunity not alone to those children for whom our present plant provides, but to those several hundred more living within a radius of a few miles. Dormitories are the only solution for many of these. Shall wecontributions not try for the big gifts of money this year as well as the usual club ? And shall not each club resolve, as plucky Cleveland has, to make next year's the biggest ever? Also, each chapter pledge to forego, as did our loyal Delta Province, an occa CONVENTION Charlevoix, Michigan July 1-6, 1921 ANNUAL REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 41 sional sundae or afternoon tea and send a substantial contribution, instead, to these brothers and sisters, such likeable, worthwhile, and .responsive ones, in the Smoky Mountains? Melinda Stuart, acting treasurer of the Settlement School, is now a member of the Settlement School Committee and will have charge of finances this year. Mrs. Richardson will continue to assist her as she has this last year, but all money, pledges, etc., should be sent, whether . by Province Vice-presidents or individuals, directly to Miss Stuart rather than to Mrs. Richardson. This greatly facilitates the treasurer's work. May Keller still has charge of teachers' applications and Kate Miller of the Endowment Fund. if any errors appear regarding club or chapter or individual gifts please notify your chairman promptly. We desire that full and proper credit be given for all the generous and loyal support of the past year. Respectfully submitted, ABBIE B. LANGMAID, Chairman of the Settlement School Committee.
