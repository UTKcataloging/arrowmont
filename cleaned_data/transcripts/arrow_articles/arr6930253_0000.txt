This was an invitation to the first open house in the new Staff House. Many Pi Phis and especially club chairmen of the Settlement School would have loved to have attended and personally voiced appreciation to Ethel Snow for her years of service to Arrowcraft and the fraternity. When Ethel Snow arrived in Gatlinburg eighteen years ago to assume the duties as Manager of Arrowcraft, we were just creeping out of the depression. It was a struggle for the clubs to have sales and Arrowcraft was barely able to make ends meet. Many times during the first two years, Ethel had to put off paying her-self in order that the weavers might have their money on time. From that time on, there has been a steady growth due to the influx of tourists to Gatlinburg and the splendid work of Pi Beta Phi alumnae clubs sponsoring sales through the years. Those who have been close to the project realize Ethel put Arrowcraft on its feet at a most difficult time in its history and over these eighteen years has built it into a big business. Ethel has seen many changes take place in the community and Settlement School road through Gatlinburg was paved. A m of hotels and attractive motels have erected.
