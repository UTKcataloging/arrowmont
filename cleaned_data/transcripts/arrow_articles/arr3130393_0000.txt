        392 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON BY MARY O. POLLARD, HEAD RESIDENT T HIN GS on the Little Pigeon are prospering. With the opening of school, after the Christmas holidays, when the four teachers went away, we have eighty students enrolled, with others to come later. Our attendance has been much better than at any other time, and the interest and enthusiasm in the work is excel-lent. There is every promise of the best term of school we have ever had. Several of the older pupils are planning to take the teachers' examination in the spring, and we have several pupils from other parts of the country who are boarding here and attending school. The work and result of the Tomato Club were excellent. The first prize was given to Josie Trentham, who put up over four hundred and fifty cans; the second prize went to Mattie Ogle, and the third to Allie Reagan. Seven girls completed the work. The B. Y. P. U., which was organized early in the autumn, has already spread its influence, so that another society has been organized at the Forks of the River, three miles away. These societies are making it possible for the young people to take an active part in the church work. Of course, you understand, there is no church here except the Baptist. Three miles away is a Primitive Baptist, and there are several of that denomination scattered through the neighbor-hood. Four miles away a Methodist "church-house" is being built, and there is a Presbyterian church and school at McCooksville, five miles away. Other than these, practically every one here is a Missionary Baptist. The young people's society was not organized in connection with the 'school, but with the 6-lurch, we acting merely as instigators and helping to start it and keep it going. It has no connection with the school. Under the auspices of the B. Y. U., a song service was held in the school house on Thanksgiving Day, about seventy being present. This was the only recognition of the day around here. Early in November, we had a field day on the school grounds, inviting all the schools we could reach to take part. Many came and we had a most interesting day, with races of all kinds and a baseball game in the afternoon, and a spelling bee in the evening. Two of GOOD NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 393 our young men, one of whom had formerly been in the army and the other in the navy, had charge, and their efficiency made the day~ the success that it was. We are hoping to emphasize the industrial side of our work more and more. One old lady here makes beautiful baskets from willow bark. We are hoping to start basket making in the school, hoping that it will prove a profitable industry. Many of the women make exquisite patchwork quilts, and some still make the hand woven coverlids and blankets. If a sale could be found for these articles, many might undertake the work. We are still occupying the three-room cottage; three of the teachers sleeping in. the school building. Over Saturdays and Sun-days when there is no'. fire in the furnace, to get up and dress in the morning is almost as much of an undertaking as a trip to the Arctic regions. We have had an unusually cold winter, with several nights down to zero and below, with skating on the river. We have had ice all day in our water pitcher in our dining room only ten feet from the fireplace. So when you think of "sunny Tennessee", think also of frigid nights and fireplaces, and think how we are looking forward to a furnace heated house and a bathroom. Perhaps some of you wonder if the school really pays. If you could watch the expanding ideals and the changed expressions on the faces; if you could talk with the people, old and young, you would no longer question. One man said to me that a man from away asked him about the school. He said, "I asked him if he saw a five dollar bill and a one dollar bill in the road, and he could pick up only one, which would he pick up? Why, of course, the five dollar one. And I told him there was as much difference between the school ydu give us and the school we used to have as there is between the five dollar and the one dollar. We are slow to say much, but we know the difference. People who will hardly speak to you on the road, appreciate the school you are teaching.'.' So, Pi Phi sisters, we may not fear for an instant that our efforts are wasted; they are bearing fruits every day in broadening the lives and in higher ideals. SETTLEMENT SCHOOL NOTES Pi Phis wishing to offer their services to the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the coming school year (August 1, to March 31), should communicate with Mrs. E. A. Helmick, Fort Sheridan, ILE394 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI nois. Miss Pollard, our head resident, wishes to take a year off for special study in industrial work, to better equip herself for the growing needs of the school. We shall, therefore, need a head resident, or manager, and probably two teachers. The annual pledges to the Settlement School for 1915-1916 are now 'due to the treasurer, Mrs. E. A. Helmick, Fort Sheridan, Ill. Vermont A has raised among her alumnae the full amount to pay for the furnishings of the new school building. Miss Pollard is a charter member of Vermont A, and this was done to show their appreciation of her. BOOK REVIEWS Efterladte Digte. By Agnes Mathilde Wergeland, Ph.D. Our Pi Beta Phi bookshelf has been enriched by this most interesting volume of poems collected and published by Dr. Grace Hebard in memory of her friend and co-worker. The following review is taken from the Laramie Republican of Nov'ember 25, 1914. The famous Norwegian poet, Henry Wergeland, wrote his grandest verses on his deathbed, and on American soil, his distinguished cousin, the late Dr. Agnes Mathilde Wergeland, of the University of Wyoming, left for friends and admirers a priceless heritage in the work accomplished just prior to and during her last illness. This collection of poems, numbering more than fifty, has just come from the publishers, the attractive volume being entitled Efterlari't Digte and seldom, indeed, is a book invested with such pathetic charm. Breathing the indomitable spirit of a soul unconquerable by the burden of the flesh, these posthumous verses come as the swan song of one of the notable women of her time, a personality which, as instructor, friend and writer, will know not death. "Charons Komme," which closes the collection, was found beneath her pillow, its closing lines being dated but a few hours before her demise, and this wonderful literary gem with its wealth of vivid imagery and pathtic grandeur will soon be published, in translation, in an American magazine. Though written by a dying hand this selection is pronounced perfect in style and diction while the penmanship was. clear and firm, the production in its entirety being thus one of the most remarkable recorded in the history of literature. IN NORWEGIAN TONGUE Dr. Wergeland was a distinguished linguist, but toward the end she turned for fullest expression to her native tongue, and thus these poems are all written in the Norse. Dr. Hebard, who has been instrumental in securing 't6l publication of the verses, gives the volume most fitting dedication as follows: BOOK RE VIE WS 395 "To Norway, in the year of her centenary of freedom, the native land of the author, this book is reverently dedicated by Grace Raymond Hebard." The "Forord" is by Maren Michelet of Minneapolis, Minn., and to this gifted woman from the north Dr. Hebard is indebted for assistance which made the publication of these songs in a tongue unknown to her a possibility. Miss Michelet is the instructor in Norse in the high schools at Minneapolis, and is admirably endowed with the sympathetic ability necessary for the successful carrying out of a task so delicate as that of preparing for publication the works of a countrywoman whom she had never had the privilege of meeting face to face. PATHOS IN THE PICTURES The book is richly illustrated, containing in addition to a fine portrait of Dr. Wergeland many views depicting scenes which were the inspiration for the accompanying verses. Thus her Laramie friends can understand "'Mine Bloomster" with its picture of the wonderful corner at the Doctors' Inn, where her gorgeous geraniums repaid her devotion with a wealth of bloom which rejoiced hundreds of observers, while they can also dwell with her in spirit as she writes on the brink of the Grand Canyon her tender tribute "Rosen" to the tiny desert roses. The ability to understand and to give expression was bestowed in rich measure upon Dr. Wergeland in the last months of her life, and the memorable journey which she took with Dr. Hebard to the Pacific coast is here enshrined in picture and in verse, as well as the incidents connected with the home which they shared and dearly loved. SCHOLARSHIP AT CHRISTIANIA Dr. Hebard assumed the publication of this volume of poems with the intention of devoting the proceeds from its sale to the establishment of an endowment in the department of history at the University at Christiania, Nor-way, this scholarship to serve as a memorial to the gifted author in the land of her nativity, as the scholarship made possible by Dr. Hebard's forethought will permanently recall to mind in the University of Wyoming the service rendered to that institution by the wonderful Norwegian woman, who' chose at last to be near it even in her final resting place. "They do not die who leave their thought Imprinted on some deathless page. Themselves may pass the spell they wrought Endures on earth from age to age !" Agnes Mathilde Wergeland in the flesh has been taken and those who knew and loved her see her, alas, no more, but it is still possible to commune with her through the pages of Efterladte Digte and her other volumes of poetry and prose, and if one could be reconciled to her loss, it might be possible while purguing the pathetic cadences of "Charons Komme" "What do I ask ,of him? Rest! Rest! I am so tired !"
