But are not the only ones passing gh ; others come with eyes and for only the peculiar and spec-Liand glibly pass on to those le the mountains most unfair -es. :linburg is in the country, has country stores and a main passing through. These store es and highway furnish the rig places of people here, take place of the movie, the club, golf course, especially on a day or Sunday afternoon. same porches are occupied by the village loafer and ers. But for every one of with time and inclination to peaceful mornings with their rife and conversation there hundred upstanding, hard ng people; men and women who have been able to make a very creditable showing in their world, even though they have been deprived of education and advantages that to us would seem absolute necessities in meeting either social or business requirements. Burg is Modern To a great many there is a tremendous appeal in the stories of the early days when this section of the country was isolated, few people had had much schooling and the most primitive customs prevailed. And to many there is a keen disappointment in coming here now and seeing houses that are painted, spring hats in the spring and winter hats in the winter, boys and girls dressed much as boys and girls of other places. Some say that this is merely a superficial change but can we expect that the eighteen years the school has been here will bring no changes? Would we be satisfied to keep to all the old customs merely because they picture life new and fascinating for us to see but not to live ourselves? And can we even say everything is changed when we see only those people living on the highway or right in the Burg and never go back up the creeks where conditions are still hard and what we would call primitive? The May ARROW 589 We look with pardonable pride at what has been accomplished in the community in the past eighteen years; better homes, more education for both young and old, wonderfully improved economic conditions, and we have a right to take much credit for the change. But could this have been possible with-out . good .material to work on, bright boys and girls, people who really wanted to respond to advantages offered them? Often we are asked what the boys and girls do when they leave school; do they stay in the hills and hollows? I believe that about the same per cent re-main on the farm as do in most rural communities. Many of our boys and girls have settled down here happy in their own home life. A good many teach in the county, those finishing college usually go into better positions than can be offered near home. New Hotel In our school we go only through two years of high school. It has seemed to us that this is as far as we are justified in taking pupils. Classes are small and to add tvvo more years of work would mean more dormitory room and quite an increased school expense. Of the eight finishing second year high last year seven went on to other schools, even though almost every one had to go where it would be possible to earn the greater part of his expenses. The classes for the past three or four years have been of about the same size and the per cent continuing would run as high. Some have now finished high school and are teaching, some are backhome weaving or doing some other kind of work to help a younger brother or sister through school. Some have their own homes. But school teaching is not all. The daily business is carried by our local people, new buildings put up, road work carried on. To me there has been a big thrill this winter in watching the new hotel go up. Our own school boys of past years have done the wiring, plumbing, finishing of woodwork, in fact everything that has been needed for a hotel of that size and kind. The winter has been a severe one. Many families have had to move once or twice because of the Park purchases, so less crop was raised. As a result we have had more people calling for work than usual. No one has asked for more than the chance to work, For years it has been the policy of the school to help only by finding ways for people to help themselves, never to do any-thing that might be pauperizing. They are a self-respecting people and not in the begging class, and would resent that kind of aid. Come down for a vacation, sit on the store porch, visit the more remote cabins, don't fail to make friends with the whittlers and unique characters. You will enjoy them and their philosophy and they will get a lot of secret enjoyment from spinning yarns to you. But rest assured of one thing, no Pi Phi money is being used to promote the art of either whittling or loafing and those characters are far from being in the majority, even in Gatlinburg. EVELYN BISHOP The May ARROW [o the "World" The following was written by one of the Gatlinburg women in reply to the article on Gatlinburg Whittlers that appeared in the New York. "World" some months ago and which was reprinted in the last ARROW.-EDITOR WHEN I vvas a tiny girl old man passed through our mtain ranges. He was very in-,sting and did a good bit of phesying about our mountains. said there was a great deal of Llth here and would always be, when the woods were no longer d with wild wings, wild game . fur, the streams no longer filled h fish, that we would have a for timber, thus offering us an .est means of living. Then that would pass and mines would n up. He failed to note that be-the mines would come a time "furriners," as we are accused calling people from outside our Intains, would earn a living by ting about us, our queer ways Living, our incorrect use of the language. It is true that it the last few years we had poor cis and seldom visited the cities that was nothing against us. did and do live in log cabins. rsed to be when strangers vend into our homes we welcomed n gladly and gave them our best d. and shelter. We did not know we weren't as good as anybody, our manners were rough and olished nor that they would go .y and write funny stories about mode of living. Now we have ned and are shy and backward use we know what to expect. ple of the cities could bring us h help and in return would be )ly repaid by the beauty of themountains and originality of the people. Some do prove real friends. In 1912 the Pi Beta Phi fraternity established a school here because very few of us ever completed more than the grade work. It was so in-convenient to get in and out over the awful mountain roads and too we had not the financial backing to go away. The school certainly has been a God-send and we all sing the praise of "Pi Phi." Until the school there was no other work than housework and corn hoeing for the women. Now Pi Phi affords an industrial department which helps the women and girls to weave beautiful articles on our old fashioned looms and through the Pi Phi alumnx clubs they sell these for us. Nov we have money to spend for clothes for the family and even to remodel and build homes and to buy cars. Pi Phi did not come here showing its superiority and openly making fun of us and we appreciate their kindness. It isn't fair for people to come here and pick out the only woman that smokes a pipe and write that we all do or pick out the only man who never shaved and write that nobody shaves. Tourists find those folks and give them wide publicity while the real folks are too busy to be seen. Tourists are not likely to find the best people hanging around the hotels putting up hard luck stories of starving wives and twenty-six children. We have a few loafers The May ARROW 591 who whittle while the tourists ride their horses but most of the men work. Nobody hunts any more for a living but some hunt for sport. . . . . Someone wrote that we had heard of Germany. I guess we have for there was scarcely any young people left after the service men were taken away to fight and others went to do war work Folks write about our people making whiskey. Some do and always will, I suppose. I think it is more honor for a man to support a family that way than to loaf or beg. You must remember we can't do every kind of work and that jobs are scarce at times Not many people get married under twenty, from twenty to a hundred and some of us don't marry at all. Most of us do raise large families but children are our riches and it would be too bad to be denied of everything in life that is worth while. just remember, readers, that we are poor, rough and uncouth, our manners unpolished, our homes poorly furnished, but we are original and although we have not swallowed any dictionaries we know a thing or two and have an abundance of old fashioned mountain pride left. MRS. LULA MCCARTER OGLE Nursing Program SINCE I am actually familiar with only one mountain district, I think it will be most practical to give a general picture of the nursing program as it is carried out in this community. In the first place, the nursing service is financed by a private school which undertakes several branches of community teaching within an area of 100 square miles. This school, naving been established a number of years, has the confidence and cooperation of the mountain people whom it serves. As the nurse represents the school staff, her problem of making contacts is materially reduced. She has an opportunity, also, of reaching the people indirectly through the teachers and through the monthly newspaper published by the school. The first requirement for the health program in this district is that it must be flexible. In the first place bedside nursing constitutes arather large share of the work. One can never really count on being able to carry out a special piece of work on a certain day for an emergency call is apt to come any hour. If the patient happens to live several miles away and the trip must be made on horseback several hours may be required. Then, too, it is quite possible that another call may be waiting when I return to the Health Center. Distances are great and many roads are still in poor condition. Some roads open to cars in summer are practically impassable in winter, while others can be travelled only on horseback or on foot the year round. Not infrequently it is necessary to walk or ride as far as three or four miles over a steep, rough trail in order to see a single patient. One baby now under supervision lives about ten miles from the Health Center. Not only the distances are to be considered. Very often the direc92 The May ARROW, ions for reaching a given place are o vague that much time is lost inding the right road. One day last ;simmer I spent two hours before n-eakfast looking for the cabin of a family in which illness had been -eported. I finally had to give up he search until the next day, but lot until I had climbed two ridges nd had waded through a thicket )f briers and weeds shoulder high. another time the directions to find certain house simply stated that I was to follow the creek until I came to a big tree and then was to cross the hill. I made three trips on horseback, each taking nearly half a day, before I was able to locate the special tree and hill. Getting Acquainted The only way I have found to keep in touch with the mothers and babies far "up the creeks" is to take a day now and then for an all-day horseback trip. My saddlebags are filled with a sample assortment of booklets on various subjects, especially those pertaining to child care and feeding. Always I take a large bottle of cod-liver oil and a small spring scale for weighing the smaller babies. Two roads can be covered in one day by riding up one creek, across the ridge, and down another creek. I stop at every house where there is a child or where I have heard of illness. On my first visit to a home I use most of the time just to get acquainted. I learn the children's names and ages and take special pains to make friends with them. Giving a handful of paper dolls or a picture book or spending a few minutes to teach a kindergarten finger play more than once has been the means of over-coming fear in a timid child. Itpays to take time to form genuine friendships with the people for not until they learn to know and trust the nurse is it possible to get their cooperation. On these trips not only the children are observed but other members of the family and the parents advised regarding any unusual conditions. I keep at hand a list of school children who have physical defects and whenever a visit is made in the home of one of these children I try to make definite arrangements for having the corrections. Frequently cases of illness are discovered which would not have been reported to me although there is need of nursing care. Mother meetings are held from time to time whenever an opportunity presents itself. So far we have not been able to organize a special series of classes in child care, but the women can be reached through indirect channels. For instance the weavers of one community have a monthly meeting, partly instructive and partly social in character. One can count on an attendance of from twenty-five to thirty-five women at these meetings, to say nothing of a dozen babies of as-sorted sizes. The weaving program itself is usually brief and the teacher is glad to have somebody fill in the extra time. First of all the babies are weighed and each one given its due share of admiration. various subjects pertaining to child welfare are discussed informally, and literature on health subjects is distributed according to individual needs. In one community there is a home economics teacher who has weekly classes for women of that neighbor-hood. The May ARROW 593 School Nursing School nursing is an important part of public health work. Eleven schools are included in this district, the total number of pupils being approximately 575. My general plan for the year's work is to visit each school three times. The initial visit is made as early as possible after school opens, the more remote being visited first while the roads are in good condition. At this time the children are weighed and measured in those schools where we can transport the scales by car. I inspect the children's teeth and give a brief classroom talk on health habits. When there is time we sometimes have a toothbrush drill. The second visit is in the company of the doctor to assist him in making physical examinations. Later in the school year I make a third visit to weigh the children again and check up on correction of defects. We secure quite a number of dental corrections by sending out mimeographed letters to the parents the day before the dentist comes to the Health Center one Saturday each month. Tonsil cases are taken care of by means of semiannual clinics. A. specialist comes to the Health Center and performs the operations for a nominal fee. It is relatively easy to persuade parents to bring their children to the dentist and to have them receive inoculations against typhoid and diphtheria, but it is quite another problem to have corrections made that require operative treatment. This fact suggests one of the future needs for these people. For many years they had to do without medical care because of the long distance from a physician and the prohibitive fees. Even now the nearest doctor is fourteen miles away, and many persons still feel that medical services are an extravagance except in the most desperate cases of illness. Our important tasks for the future are to teach the wisdom of competent medical and surgical care and the meaning of positive health. FRANCES MOORE Settlement School Nurse An Aetive Committee Member THE alum= club and active chapter members need no introduction to our Rebecca Downey White of the Settlement School Committee, for they already are acquainted through her interesting and very constructive work in her department. So many have said that it was a real pleasure to work on the things pertaining to our school after hearing from Mrs. White for she not only created an inspiration but gave them everything with which to carry it on to others. Itis with pleasure that I am privileged to tell you some of the back-ground which lead to this efficiency as well as many interesting things which you will enjoy knowing. Rebecca Downey White was born February 24, 1878, at Irvington, a suburb of Indianapolis, of which her grandfather,. Judge Jacob B. Julian, was one of the two founders. Her mother gave Irvington its name from her own father's love of Washington Irving. Her father was James Downey ;94 The May ARROW those ancestor came to America rom Belfast, Ireland, about 1740 .nd her mother, Mary Julian, decended from a Huguenot, Rene de taint Julien, a very tall man, who led from France to America after he Edict of Nantes. Another an-:estor was one of the Seven Foot 3odyguard of Frederick the Great. Jnusual height has characterized nany of the family, including the abject of this sketch. There is a trong strain of Quaker ancestry ind one line traces to Andrew :hoover, a great great grandfather )f President Herbert Hoover. Her father was a student in Northwest-!rn College, known as Butler Colege after it was moved from down-.own Indianapolis to Irvington, when he enlisted in the Union army and terminated his college :areer. Her mother was graduated 1-om the Cincinnati Wesleyan colege in 1858 which went out of exstence in the early 80's. The Downey family moved to ?ueblo, Colorado, in 1888 and Re-)ecca graduated from the high thool there and then for one year attended the University of Denver, )f which her father was a trustee. Che family fortunes were largely ost in the panic of 1893 and she tayed out two years to teach in he Pueblo schools, afterwards enering the Univeristy of Michigan or one year and again staying out . year to teach Latin in the Cripple ',reek High School. Another year ollowed at the University of Michi-;an and then marriage terminated [er college career. She was initiated into Pi Beta . 'hi at the University of Denver and ras later affiliated with Michigan Her sister, Martha Downey was aitiated in Michigan B in 1904. Martha is at present in India in the Oxford Mission at Barisal, East Benzel. A cousin, Anna Downey, was one of the chapter which founded Kappa Alpha Theta at De-Pauw University. REBECCA DOWNEY WHITE Mrs. White was the originator of the plan to start a fund for purchasing a chapter house for Michigan B in 1906 and served as secretary-treasurer of the committee until the house was purchased in 1909, when ill health forced her to give up the work. She has been actively connected with the Ann Arbor Alumnae club of Pi Beta Phi ever since it was established. As organizer and first president of the Federation of Parent Teachers' Organizations of Ann Arbor in 1915, she initiated the movement for The May ARROW 595 better school buildings which finally culminated in the almost complete reconstruction of the Ann Arbor school buildings. She is a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, has been an active member of one of the smaller musical clubs of Ann Arbor for over a quarter of a century and has served as chairman of the hospitality committee of the Faculty Women's Club. She is at present a director and secretary of the Community Fund Association of Ann Arbor. In 1903, she married Alfred H. White, an instructor in the University of Michigan, who is still a professor of chemical engineering in that institution, and head of the department. There are two chil-dren, Alfred McLaren White, who graduated from the University of Michigan in 1924, took his M.S. degree at the University of California the following year and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan in 1927. He has been assistant professor of chemical engineering at Georgia School of Technology at Atlanta for the past two years, and has just resigned to become associate professor at the University of North Carolina. A daughter, Mary Julian, is a member of Michigan B of Pi Beta Phi. She is now a fresh-man in the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, New York City. Lois F. STOOLMAN Maintenance of School Vital IN 1910 before a foot of ground had been donated by the in-habitants of Gatlinburg or a penny raised by the fraternity to build the Settlement School, the identical questions were raised that are being asked today, one being, When the work of the Settlement School is completed, what will happeh next ?" Today, after twenty years the same questions are heard in different parts of the country and even the astounding statement that the school is no longer necessary." As a person vitally interested in education, not only in the southern part of the United States, but in the country at large, may I say that in the judgment of educators never at any period in the history of the South was wise leadership in these mountain districts of more vital importance or more necessary than at this moment, when the region isbeing opened up, and exploitation of this people and their natural re-sources is too imminent a danger. The character of the work of the School has changed, from that of dealing with a primitive folk in a backward region, as in the past, to a forward looking program of training them to meet the new conditions of life, which now face them. Industrialism has come to stay, and the labor leaders of the worst type find a fertile field in ignorant minds in which to plan radical doctrines. Also the opening up of the new National Park era will bring the world to the doors of Gatlinburg. The fraternity with its school established, with the confidence of the entire community in the disinterested desire to educate and help them, stands in a unique position, which it cannot and must not fail to utilize to the utmost. 596 The May ARROW The boarding department must be enlarged, the boys and girls must be enabled to train themselves at the School to go back to isolated districts and bring to these less fortunate ones the knowledge they have gained, not only of educational 'methods but of sanitation and the preservation of their own unique industries. Also new centers must be established, parallel to our chain system of stores, organized and controlled by a central system, the Settlement School at Gatlinburg. At a time when Great Britain is organizing women's committees to preserve the industries of lace making, the knitting of Shetland wool shawls, in a word, the home industries, we, as a fraternity, cannot fail to live up to the splendid opportunity which is ours today. As for the state of Tennessee taking over much of this work, sadly and regretfully we admit the poor equipment of rural schools inmany Southern States. The per capita tax should take care of these schools, but school money goes ac-cording to population, and the mountain regions will never be oversupplied with adequate schools from the state tax. In conclusion allow me to add that state money and the state school system can never bring to the mountain regions the type of teacher, director, nurse and house-mother that the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity has through the years been able to provide for the Settlement School through the loyal disinterested work of its members and friends. The work must go forward on a larger scale than ever before, and happily for the fraternity, with the intelligent cooperation of the Gatlinburg community, which through the Settlement School in its midst has come into a consciousness of civic responsibility and pride. MAY L. KELLER Oath of the Young Men of Athens We will never bring disgrace to this our city by any act of dishonesty or cowardice, nor ever desert our suffering comrades in the ranks. We will fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city, both alone and with many; we will revere and obey the city laws and do our best to incite a like respect and reverence in those above us who are prone to annul or to set them at naught; we will strive unceasingly to quicken the public's sense of civic duty. Thus in all these ways we will transmit this city not less but greater, better, and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.

On my first visit to a home I use most of the time just to get acquainted. I learn the children's names and ages and take special pains to make friends with them. Giving a handful of paper dolls or a picture book or spending a few minutes to teach a kindergarten finger play more than once has been the means of over-coming fear in a timid child. Itpays to take time to form genuine friendships with the people for not until they learn to know and trust the nurse is it possible to get their cooperation. On these trips not only the children are observed but other members of the family and the parents advised regarding any unusual conditions. I keep at hand a list of school children who have physical defects and whenever a visit is made in the home of one of these children I try to make definite arrangements for having the corrections. Frequently cases of illness are discovered which would not have been reported to me although there is need of nursing care. Mother meetings are held from time to time whenever an opportunity presents itself. So far we have not been able to organize a special series of classes in child care, but the women can be reached through indirect channels. For instance the weavers of one community have a monthly meeting, partly instructive and partly social in character. One can count on an attendance of from twenty-five to thirty-five women at these meetings, to say nothing of a dozen babies of as-sorted sizes. The weaving program itself is usually brief and the teacher is glad to have somebody fill in the extra time. First of all the babies are weighed and each one given its due share of admiration. various subjects pertaining to child welfare are discussed informally, and literature on health subjects is distributed according to individual needs. In one community there is a home economics teacher who has weekly classes for women of that neighbor-hood. The May ARROW 593 School Nursing School nursing is an important part of public health work. Eleven schools are included in this district, the total number of pupils being approximately 575. My general plan for the year's work is to visit each school three times. The initial visit is made as early as possible after school opens, the more remote being visited first while the roads are in good condition. At this time the children are weighed and measured in those schools where we can transport the scales by car. I inspect the children's teeth and give a brief classroom talk on health habits. When there is time we sometimes have a toothbrush drill. The second visit is in the company of the doctor to assist him in making physical examinations. Later in the school year I make a third visit to weigh the children again and check up on correction of defects. We secure quite a number of dental corrections by sending out mimeographed letters to the parents the day before the dentist comes to the Health Center one Saturday each month. Tonsil cases are taken care of by means of semiannual clinics. A. specialist comes to the Health Center and performs the operations for a nominal fee. It is relatively easy to persuade parents to bring their children to the dentist and to have them receive inoculations against typhoid and diphtheria, but it is quite another problem to have corrections made that require operative treatment. This fact suggests one of the future needs for these people. For many years they had to do without medical care because of the long distance from a physician and the prohibitive fees. Even now the nearest doctor is fourteen miles away, and many persons still feel that medical services are an extravagance except in the most desperate cases of illness. Our important tasks for the future are to teach the wisdom of competent medical and surgical care and the meaning of positive health. FRANCES MOORE Settlement School Nurse An Aetive Committee Member THE alum= club and active chapter members need no introduction to our Rebecca Downey White of the Settlement School Committee, for they already are acquainted through her interesting and very constructive work in her department. So many have said that it was a real pleasure to work on the things pertaining to our school after hearing from Mrs. White for she not only created an inspiration but gave them everything with which to carry it on to others. Itis with pleasure that I am privileged to tell you some of the back-ground which lead to this efficiency as well as many interesting things which you will enjoy knowing. Rebecca Downey White was born February 24, 1878, at Irvington, a suburb of Indianapolis, of which her grandfather,. Judge Jacob B. Julian, was one of the two founders. Her mother gave Irvington its name from her own father's love of Washington Irving.

REBECCA DOWNEY WHITE Mrs. White was the originator of the plan to start a fund for purchasing a chapter house for Michigan B in 1906 and served as secretary-treasurer of the committee until the house was purchased in 1909, when ill health forced her to give up the work. She has been actively connected with the Ann Arbor Alumnae club of Pi Beta Phi ever since it was established. As organizer and first president of the Federation of Parent Teachers' Organizations of Ann Arbor in 1915, she initiated the movement for The May ARROW 595 better school buildings which finally culminated in the almost complete reconstruction of the Ann Arbor school buildings. She is a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, has been an active member of one of the smaller musical clubs of Ann Arbor for over a quarter of a century and has served as chairman of the hospitality committee of the Faculty Women's Club.

STOOLMAN Maintenance of School Vital IN 1910 before a foot of ground had been donated by the in-habitants of Gatlinburg or a penny raised by the fraternity to build the Settlement School, the identical questions were raised that are being asked today, one being, When the work of the Settlement School is completed, what will happeh next ?" Today, after twenty years the same questions are heard in different parts of the country and even the astounding statement that the school is no longer necessary." As a person vitally interested in education, not only in the southern part of the United States, but in the country at large, may I say that in the judgment of educators never at any period in the history of the South was wise leadership in these mountain districts of more vital importance or more necessary than at this moment, when the region isbeing opened up, and exploitation of this people and their natural re-sources is too imminent a danger. The character of the work of the School has changed, from that of dealing with a primitive folk in a backward region, as in the past, to a forward looking program of training them to meet the new conditions of life, which now face them. Industrialism has come to stay, and the labor leaders of the worst type find a fertile field in ignorant minds in which to plan radical doctrines. Also the opening up of the new National Park era will bring the world to the doors of Gatlinburg. The fraternity with its school established, with the confidence of the entire community in the disinterested desire to educate and help them, stands in a unique position, which it cannot and must not fail to utilize to the utmost. 596 The May ARROW The boarding department must be enlarged, the boys and girls must be enabled to train themselves at the School to go back to isolated districts and bring to these less fortunate ones the knowledge they have gained, not only of educational 'methods but of sanitation and the preservation of their own unique industries. Also new centers must be established, parallel to our chain system of stores, organized and controlled by a central system, the Settlement School at Gatlinburg. At a time when Great Britain is organizing women's committees to preserve the industries of lace making, the knitting of Shetland wool shawls, in a word, the home industries, we, as a fraternity, cannot fail to live up to the splendid opportunity which is ours today. As for the state of Tennessee taking over much of this work, sadly and regretfully we admit the poor equipment of rural schools inmany Southern States. The per capita tax should take care of these schools, but school money goes ac-cording to population, and the mountain regions will never be oversupplied with adequate schools from the state tax. In conclusion allow me to add that state money and the state school system can never bring to the mountain regions the type of teacher, director, nurse and house-mother that the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity has through the years been able to provide for the Settlement School through the loyal disinterested work of its members and friends. The work must go forward on a larger scale than ever before, and happily for the fraternity, with the intelligent cooperation of the Gatlinburg community, which through the Settlement School in its midst has come into a consciousness of civic responsibility and pride. MAY L. KELLER Oath of the Young Men of Athens We will never bring disgrace to this our city by any act of dishonesty or cowardice, nor ever desert our suffering comrades in the ranks. We will fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city, both alone and with many; we will revere and obey the city laws and do our best to incite a like respect and reverence in those above us who are prone to annul or to set them at naught; we will strive unceasingly to quicken the public's sense of civic duty.

        92 The May ARROW, ions for reaching a given place are o vague that much time is lost inding the right road. One day last ;simmer I spent two hours before n-eakfast looking for the cabin of a family in which illness had been -eported. I finally had to give up he search until the next day, but lot until I had climbed two ridges nd had waded through a thicket )f briers and weeds shoulder high. another time the directions to find certain house simply stated that I was to follow the creek until I came to a big tree and then was to cross the hill. I made three trips on horseback, each taking nearly half a day, before I was able to locate the special tree and hill. Getting Acquainted The only way I have found to keep in touch with the mothers and babies far "up the creeks" is to take a day now and then for an all-day horseback trip. My saddlebags are filled with a sample assortment of booklets on various subjects, especially those pertaining to child care and feeding. Always I take a large bottle of cod-liver oil and a small spring scale for weighing the smaller babies. Two roads can be covered in one day by riding up one creek, across the ridge, and down another creek. I stop at every house where there is a child or where I have heard of illness. On my first visit to a home I use most of the time just to get acquainted. I learn the children's names and ages and take special pains to make friends with them.

Che family fortunes were largely ost in the panic of 1893 and she tayed out two years to teach in he Pueblo schools, afterwards enering the Univeristy of Michigan or one year and again staying out . year to teach Latin in the Cripple ',reek High School. Another year ollowed at the University of Michi-;an and then marriage terminated [er college career. She was initiated into Pi Beta . 'hi at the University of Denver and ras later affiliated with Michigan Her sister, Martha Downey was aitiated in Michigan B in 1904. Martha is at present in India in the Oxford Mission at Barisal, East Benzel. A cousin, Anna Downey, was one of the chapter which founded Kappa Alpha Theta at De-Pauw University. REBECCA DOWNEY WHITE Mrs. White was the originator of the plan to start a fund for purchasing a chapter house for Michigan B in 1906 and served as secretary-treasurer of the committee until the house was purchased in 1909, when ill health forced her to give up the work. She has been actively connected with the Ann Arbor Alumnae club of Pi Beta Phi ever since it was established. As organizer and first president of the Federation of Parent Teachers' Organizations of Ann Arbor in 1915, she initiated the movement for The May ARROW 595 better school buildings which finally culminated in the almost complete reconstruction of the Ann Arbor school buildings. She is a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, has been an active member of one of the smaller musical clubs of Ann Arbor for over a quarter of a century and has served as chairman of the hospitality committee of the Faculty Women's Club. She is at present a director and secretary of the Community Fund Association of Ann Arbor. In 1903, she married Alfred H. White, an instructor in the University of Michigan, who is still a professor of chemical engineering in that institution, and head of the department. There are two chil-dren, Alfred McLaren White, who graduated from the University of Michigan in 1924, took his M.S. degree at the University of California the following year and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan in 1927. He has been assistant professor of chemical engineering at Georgia School of Technology at Atlanta for the past two years, and has just resigned to become associate professor at the University of North Carolina. A daughter, Mary Julian, is a member of Michigan B of Pi Beta Phi. She is now a fresh-man in the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, New York City. Lois F. STOOLMAN Maintenance of School Vital IN 1910 before a foot of ground had been donated by the in-habitants of Gatlinburg or a penny raised by the fraternity to build the Settlement School, the identical questions were raised that are being asked today, one being, When the work of the Settlement School is completed, what will happeh next ?" Today, after twenty years the same questions are heard in different parts of the country and even the astounding statement that the school is no longer necessary." As a person vitally interested in education, not only in the southern part of the United States, but in the country at large, may I say that in the judgment of educators never at any period in the history of the South was wise leadership in these mountain districts of more vital importance or more necessary than at this moment, when the region isbeing opened up, and exploitation of this people and their natural re-sources is too imminent a danger. The character of the work of the School has changed, from that of dealing with a primitive folk in a backward region, as in the past, to a forward looking program of training them to meet the new conditions of life, which now face them. Industrialism has come to stay, and the labor leaders of the worst type find a fertile field in ignorant minds in which to plan radical doctrines. Also the opening up of the new National Park era will bring the world to the doors of Gatlinburg. The fraternity with its school established, with the confidence of the entire community in the disinterested desire to educate and help them, stands in a unique position, which it cannot and must not fail to utilize to the utmost. 596 The May ARROW The boarding department must be enlarged, the boys and girls must be enabled to train themselves at the School to go back to isolated districts and bring to these less fortunate ones the knowledge they have gained, not only of educational 'methods but of sanitation and the preservation of their own unique industries. Also new centers must be established, parallel to our chain system of stores, organized and controlled by a central system, the Settlement School at Gatlinburg. At a time when Great Britain is organizing women's committees to preserve the industries of lace making, the knitting of Shetland wool shawls, in a word, the home industries, we, as a fraternity, cannot fail to live up to the splendid opportunity which is ours today. As for the state of Tennessee taking over much of this work, sadly and regretfully we admit the poor equipment of rural schools inmany Southern States. The per capita tax should take care of these schools, but school money goes ac-cording to population, and the mountain regions will never be oversupplied with adequate schools from the state tax. In conclusion allow me to add that state money and the state school system can never bring to the mountain regions the type of teacher, director, nurse and house-mother that the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity has through the years been able to provide for the Settlement School through the loyal disinterested work of its members and friends. The work must go forward on a larger scale than ever before, and happily for the fraternity, with the intelligent cooperation of the Gatlinburg community, which through the Settlement School in its midst has come into a consciousness of civic responsibility and pride. MAY L. KELLER Oath of the Young Men of Athens We will never bring disgrace to this our city by any act of dishonesty or cowardice, nor ever desert our suffering comrades in the ranks. We will fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city, both alone and with many; we will revere and obey the city laws and do our best to incite a like respect and reverence in those above us who are prone to annul or to set them at naught; we will strive unceasingly to quicken the public's sense of civic duty.

But are not the only ones passing gh ; others come with eyes and for only the peculiar and spec-Liand glibly pass on to those le the mountains most unfair -es. :linburg is in the country, has country stores and a main passing through. These store es and highway furnish the rig places of people here, take place of the movie, the club, golf course, especially on a day or Sunday afternoon. same porches are occupied by the village loafer and ers. But for every one of with time and inclination to peaceful mornings with their rife and conversation there hundred upstanding, hard ng people; men and women who have been able to make a very creditable showing in their world, even though they have been deprived of education and advantages that to us would seem absolute necessities in meeting either social or business requirements. Burg is Modern To a great many there is a tremendous appeal in the stories of the early days when this section of the country was isolated, few people had had much schooling and the most primitive customs prevailed. And to many there is a keen disappointment in coming here now and seeing houses that are painted, spring hats in the spring and winter hats in the winter, boys and girls dressed much as boys and girls of other places. Some say that this is merely a superficial change but can we expect that the eighteen years the school has been here will bring no changes? Would we be satisfied to keep to all the old customs merely because they picture life new and fascinating for us to see but not to live ourselves? And can we even say everything is changed when we see only those people living on the highway or right in the Burg and never go back up the creeks where conditions are still hard and what we would call primitive? The May ARROW 589 We look with pardonable pride at what has been accomplished in the community in the past eighteen years; better homes, more education for both young and old, wonderfully improved economic conditions, and we have a right to take much credit for the change. But could this have been possible with-out . good .material to work on, bright boys and girls, people who really wanted to respond to advantages offered them? Often we are asked what the boys and girls do when they leave school; do they stay in the hills and hollows? I believe that about the same per cent re-main on the farm as do in most rural communities. Many of our boys and girls have settled down here happy in their own home life. A good many teach in the county, those finishing college usually go into better positions than can be offered near home. New Hotel In our school we go only through two years of high school. It has seemed to us that this is as far as we are justified in taking pupils. Classes are small and to add tvvo more years of work would mean more dormitory room and quite an increased school expense. Of the eight finishing second year high last year seven went on to other schools, even though almost every one had to go where it would be possible to earn the greater part of his expenses. The classes for the past three or four years have been of about the same size and the per cent continuing would run as high. Some have now finished high school and are teaching, some are backhome weaving or doing some other kind of work to help a younger brother or sister through school. Some have their own homes. But school teaching is not all. The daily business is carried by our local people, new buildings put up, road work carried on. To me there has been a big thrill this winter in watching the new hotel go up. Our own school boys of past years have done the wiring, plumbing, finishing of woodwork, in fact everything that has been needed for a hotel of that size and kind. The winter has been a severe one. Many families have had to move once or twice because of the Park purchases, so less crop was raised. As a result we have had more people calling for work than usual. No one has asked for more than the chance to work, For years it has been the policy of the school to help only by finding ways for people to help themselves, never to do any-thing that might be pauperizing. They are a self-respecting people and not in the begging class, and would resent that kind of aid. Come down for a vacation, sit on the store porch, visit the more remote cabins, don't fail to make friends with the whittlers and unique characters. You will enjoy them and their philosophy and they will get a lot of secret enjoyment from spinning yarns to you. But rest assured of one thing, no Pi Phi money is being used to promote the art of either whittling or loafing and those characters are far from being in the majority, even in Gatlinburg. EVELYN BISHOP The May ARROW [o the "World" The following was written by one of the Gatlinburg women in reply to the article on Gatlinburg Whittlers that appeared in the New York. "World" some months ago and which was reprinted in the last ARROW.-EDITOR WHEN I vvas a tiny girl old man passed through our mtain ranges. He was very in-,sting and did a good bit of phesying about our mountains. said there was a great deal of Llth here and would always be, when the woods were no longer d with wild wings, wild game . fur, the streams no longer filled h fish, that we would have a for timber, thus offering us an .est means of living. Then that would pass and mines would n up. He failed to note that be-the mines would come a time "furriners," as we are accused calling people from outside our Intains, would earn a living by ting about us, our queer ways Living, our incorrect use of the language. It is true that it the last few years we had poor cis and seldom visited the cities that was nothing against us. did and do live in log cabins. rsed to be when strangers vend into our homes we welcomed n gladly and gave them our best d. and shelter. We did not know we weren't as good as anybody, our manners were rough and olished nor that they would go .y and write funny stories about mode of living. Now we have ned and are shy and backward use we know what to expect. ple of the cities could bring us h help and in return would be )ly repaid by the beauty of themountains and originality of the people. Some do prove real friends. In 1912 the Pi Beta Phi fraternity established a school here because very few of us ever completed more than the grade work. It was so in-convenient to get in and out over the awful mountain roads and too we had not the financial backing to go away. The school certainly has been a God-send and we all sing the praise of "Pi Phi." Until the school there was no other work than housework and corn hoeing for the women. Now Pi Phi affords an industrial department which helps the women and girls to weave beautiful articles on our old fashioned looms and through the Pi Phi alumnx clubs they sell these for us. Nov we have money to spend for clothes for the family and even to remodel and build homes and to buy cars. Pi Phi did not come here showing its superiority and openly making fun of us and we appreciate their kindness. It isn't fair for people to come here and pick out the only woman that smokes a pipe and write that we all do or pick out the only man who never shaved and write that nobody shaves. Tourists find those folks and give them wide publicity while the real folks are too busy to be seen. Tourists are not likely to find the best people hanging around the hotels putting up hard luck stories of starving wives and twenty-six children. We have a few loafers The May ARROW 591 who whittle while the tourists ride their horses but most of the men work. Nobody hunts any more for a living but some hunt for sport. . . . . Someone wrote that we had heard of Germany. I guess we have for there was scarcely any young people left after the service men were taken away to fight and others went to do war work Folks write about our people making whiskey. Some do and always will, I suppose. I think it is more honor for a man to support a family that way than to loaf or beg. You must remember we can't do every kind of work and that jobs are scarce at times Not many people get married under twenty, from twenty to a hundred and some of us don't marry at all. Most of us do raise large families but children are our riches and it would be too bad to be denied of everything in life that is worth while. just remember, readers, that we are poor, rough and uncouth, our manners unpolished, our homes poorly furnished, but we are original and although we have not swallowed any dictionaries we know a thing or two and have an abundance of old fashioned mountain pride left. MRS. LULA MCCARTER OGLE Nursing Program SINCE I am actually familiar with only one mountain district, I think it will be most practical to give a general picture of the nursing program as it is carried out in this community. In the first place, the nursing service is financed by a private school which undertakes several branches of community teaching within an area of 100 square miles. This school, naving been established a number of years, has the confidence and cooperation of the mountain people whom it serves. As the nurse represents the school staff, her problem of making contacts is materially reduced. She has an opportunity, also, of reaching the people indirectly through the teachers and through the monthly newspaper published by the school. The first requirement for the health program in this district is that it must be flexible. In the first place bedside nursing constitutes arather large share of the work. One can never really count on being able to carry out a special piece of work on a certain day for an emergency call is apt to come any hour. If the patient happens to live several miles away and the trip must be made on horseback several hours may be required. Then, too, it is quite possible that another call may be waiting when I return to the Health Center. Distances are great and many roads are still in poor condition. Some roads open to cars in summer are practically impassable in winter, while others can be travelled only on horseback or on foot the year round. Not infrequently it is necessary to walk or ride as far as three or four miles over a steep, rough trail in order to see a single patient. One baby now under supervision lives about ten miles from the Health Center. Not only the distances are to be considered. Very often the direc92 The May ARROW, ions for reaching a given place are o vague that much time is lost inding the right road. One day last ;simmer I spent two hours before n-eakfast looking for the cabin of a family in which illness had been -eported. I finally had to give up he search until the next day, but lot until I had climbed two ridges nd had waded through a thicket )f briers and weeds shoulder high. another time the directions to find certain house simply stated that I was to follow the creek until I came to a big tree and then was to cross the hill. I made three trips on horseback, each taking nearly half a day, before I was able to locate the special tree and hill. Getting Acquainted The only way I have found to keep in touch with the mothers and babies far "up the creeks" is to take a day now and then for an all-day horseback trip. My saddlebags are filled with a sample assortment of booklets on various subjects, especially those pertaining to child care and feeding. Always I take a large bottle of cod-liver oil and a small spring scale for weighing the smaller babies. Two roads can be covered in one day by riding up one creek, across the ridge, and down another creek. I stop at every house where there is a child or where I have heard of illness. On my first visit to a home I use most of the time just to get acquainted. I learn the children's names and ages and take special pains to make friends with them. Giving a handful of paper dolls or a picture book or spending a few minutes to teach a kindergarten finger play more than once has been the means of over-coming fear in a timid child. Itpays to take time to form genuine friendships with the people for not until they learn to know and trust the nurse is it possible to get their cooperation. On these trips not only the children are observed but other members of the family and the parents advised regarding any unusual conditions. I keep at hand a list of school children who have physical defects and whenever a visit is made in the home of one of these children I try to make definite arrangements for having the corrections. Frequently cases of illness are discovered which would not have been reported to me although there is need of nursing care. Mother meetings are held from time to time whenever an opportunity presents itself. So far we have not been able to organize a special series of classes in child care, but the women can be reached through indirect channels. For instance the weavers of one community have a monthly meeting, partly instructive and partly social in character. One can count on an attendance of from twenty-five to thirty-five women at these meetings, to say nothing of a dozen babies of as-sorted sizes. The weaving program itself is usually brief and the teacher is glad to have somebody fill in the extra time. First of all the babies are weighed and each one given its due share of admiration. various subjects pertaining to child welfare are discussed informally, and literature on health subjects is distributed according to individual needs. In one community there is a home economics teacher who has weekly classes for women of that neighbor-hood. The May ARROW 593 School Nursing School nursing is an important part of public health work. Eleven schools are included in this district, the total number of pupils being approximately 575. My general plan for the year's work is to visit each school three times. The initial visit is made as early as possible after school opens, the more remote being visited first while the roads are in good condition. At this time the children are weighed and measured in those schools where we can transport the scales by car. I inspect the children's teeth and give a brief classroom talk on health habits. When there is time we sometimes have a toothbrush drill. The second visit is in the company of the doctor to assist him in making physical examinations. Later in the school year I make a third visit to weigh the children again and check up on correction of defects. We secure quite a number of dental corrections by sending out mimeographed letters to the parents the day before the dentist comes to the Health Center one Saturday each month. Tonsil cases are taken care of by means of semiannual clinics. A. specialist comes to the Health Center and performs the operations for a nominal fee. It is relatively easy to persuade parents to bring their children to the dentist and to have them receive inoculations against typhoid and diphtheria, but it is quite another problem to have corrections made that require operative treatment. This fact suggests one of the future needs for these people. For many years they had to do without medical care because of the long distance from a physician and the prohibitive fees. Even now the nearest doctor is fourteen miles away, and many persons still feel that medical services are an extravagance except in the most desperate cases of illness. Our important tasks for the future are to teach the wisdom of competent medical and surgical care and the meaning of positive health. FRANCES MOORE Settlement School Nurse An Aetive Committee Member THE alum= club and active chapter members need no introduction to our Rebecca Downey White of the Settlement School Committee, for they already are acquainted through her interesting and very constructive work in her department. So many have said that it was a real pleasure to work on the things pertaining to our school after hearing from Mrs. White for she not only created an inspiration but gave them everything with which to carry it on to others. Itis with pleasure that I am privileged to tell you some of the back-ground which lead to this efficiency as well as many interesting things which you will enjoy knowing. Rebecca Downey White was born February 24, 1878, at Irvington, a suburb of Indianapolis, of which her grandfather,. Judge Jacob B. Julian, was one of the two founders. Her mother gave Irvington its name from her own father's love of Washington Irving. Her father was James Downey ;94 The May ARROW those ancestor came to America rom Belfast, Ireland, about 1740 .nd her mother, Mary Julian, decended from a Huguenot, Rene de taint Julien, a very tall man, who led from France to America after he Edict of Nantes. Another an-:estor was one of the Seven Foot 3odyguard of Frederick the Great. Jnusual height has characterized nany of the family, including the abject of this sketch. There is a trong strain of Quaker ancestry ind one line traces to Andrew :hoover, a great great grandfather )f President Herbert Hoover.

STOOLMAN Maintenance of School Vital IN 1910 before a foot of ground had been donated by the in-habitants of Gatlinburg or a penny raised by the fraternity to build the Settlement School, the identical questions were raised that are being asked today, one being, When the work of the Settlement School is completed, what will happeh next ?" Today, after twenty years the same questions are heard in different parts of the country and even the astounding statement that the school is no longer necessary." As a person vitally interested in education, not only in the southern part of the United States, but in the country at large, may I say that in the judgment of educators never at any period in the history of the South was wise leadership in these mountain districts of more vital importance or more necessary than at this moment, when the region isbeing opened up, and exploitation of this people and their natural re-sources is too imminent a danger. The character of the work of the School has changed, from that of dealing with a primitive folk in a backward region, as in the past, to a forward looking program of training them to meet the new conditions of life, which now face them. Industrialism has come to stay, and the labor leaders of the worst type find a fertile field in ignorant minds in which to plan radical doctrines. Also the opening up of the new National Park era will bring the world to the doors of Gatlinburg. The fraternity with its school established, with the confidence of the entire community in the disinterested desire to educate and help them, stands in a unique position, which it cannot and must not fail to utilize to the utmost. 596 The May ARROW The boarding department must be enlarged, the boys and girls must be enabled to train themselves at the School to go back to isolated districts and bring to these less fortunate ones the knowledge they have gained, not only of educational 'methods but of sanitation and the preservation of their own unique industries. Also new centers must be established, parallel to our chain system of stores, organized and controlled by a central system, the Settlement School at Gatlinburg. At a time when Great Britain is organizing women's committees to preserve the industries of lace making, the knitting of Shetland wool shawls, in a word, the home industries, we, as a fraternity, cannot fail to live up to the splendid opportunity which is ours today. As for the state of Tennessee taking over much of this work, sadly and regretfully we admit the poor equipment of rural schools inmany Southern States. The per capita tax should take care of these schools, but school money goes ac-cording to population, and the mountain regions will never be oversupplied with adequate schools from the state tax. In conclusion allow me to add that state money and the state school system can never bring to the mountain regions the type of teacher, director, nurse and house-mother that the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity has through the years been able to provide for the Settlement School through the loyal disinterested work of its members and friends. The work must go forward on a larger scale than ever before, and happily for the fraternity, with the intelligent cooperation of the Gatlinburg community, which through the Settlement School in its midst has come into a consciousness of civic responsibility and pride. MAY L. KELLER Oath of the Young Men of Athens We will never bring disgrace to this our city by any act of dishonesty or cowardice, nor ever desert our suffering comrades in the ranks. We will fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city, both alone and with many; we will revere and obey the city laws and do our best to incite a like respect and reverence in those above us who are prone to annul or to set them at naught; we will strive unceasingly to quicken the public's sense of civic duty. Thus in all these ways we will transmit this city not less but greater, better, and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.
