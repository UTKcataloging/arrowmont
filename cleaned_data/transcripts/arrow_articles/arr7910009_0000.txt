        50th Anniversary Spotlight on Settlement Smithsonian Exhibit . Golden Anniversary Program Lolita Snell Prouty Memorial The spotlight was on Settlement School and the contribution of Pi Beta Phi in the preservation and development of native arts and crafts at the 43rd Biennial Convention of the Fraternity. The fiftieth anniversary of this remarkable national philanthropy knew some truly golden moments in Washington. Smithsonian Exhibit Surely the most gratifying moment of all came when the Smithsonian Institution opened its exhibit of handloomed household and costume fabrics in traditional, contemporary and creative designs and related craft items from the Settlement School's Arrowcraft weavers and craftsmen. This month-long exhibit was officially opened on Friday, June 22, with a brief program in the Rotunda of the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries Building. Participating on that program were Dr. Kellogg, representing the Smithsonian Board of Governors, Grand President Alice Weber Mans SMITHSONIAN DISPLAY OF ARROW CRAFT-One of the 14 displays of handwoven and hand crafted items from the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Craft center that was in display for a month at the Smithsonian Institution. field and Settlement School Committee Chairman Helen Moffett Russell. Dr. Kellogg paid tribute to Pi Beta Phi's Settlement School program in these words: "Twenty-one years after the establishment in 1846 of the Smithsonian Institution, the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity was founded. Since their origins both this Institution and the Fraternity have devoted themselves to public service; the former on an inter-national scale and the latter on a local but no less rewarding one. "The diversified and multi-hued textiles you see in this special exhibit are the result in part, of the Fraternity's 50-year community development pro-gram in the Appalachian mountains, particularly in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. By encouraging a revival in the art of weaving among the citizens of this town, this farsighted fraternity has not only filled an economic need but has materially assisted in the preservation of one of America's oldest home-crafts." In her response for the Fraternity, Mrs. Russell said, "This is one of those treasured occasions when one does not speak for present generations only. It is a time to remember the contributory efforts of the hundreds of others whose foresight and service have culminated in this tremendous honor-an exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution. "We like to recall, today, that our national philanthropy, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, had its beginning in this city. "We like to recall the name of Miss Emma Harper Turner, once a student at George Washing ton University. It was she who brought the proposal originating in the Washington, D.C., Alumnae Club, to the 1910 Convention to establish a Settlement School in an area lacking educational opportunity. . . . To receive recognition by an institution of the stature of the Smithsonian is an honor we still cannot quite realize; to share in our small way, in School a diffusion of knowledge is most deeply appreciated." The extensive display included 14 separately arranged groupings at spots encircling the Rotunda. Set up at the base of the huge Statue of Freedom in the center of the area was a loom and veteran Arrowcraft weaver, Mrs. Myrtle Conner, gave special weaving demonstrations during the week of Convention. Her presence and work attracted much attention from the thousands of people who passed through the Rotunda during the week. The recognition accorded Pi Beta Phi and the Settlement School by the internationally respected Smithsonian Institution is due to the efforts of Marie Tunstall Lingo, immediate past alumnae president of Delta Province. Mrs. Lingo had spent two years on this project and had given freely of her time and effort in working out arrangements for the exhibit. Another exhibit enjoyed by those attending Convention was the special 50th anniversary display in connection with the usual Settlement School exhibit. It featured posters of albums with accents of gold. The reminder that this philanthropy stands as a memorial to the Fraternity Founders was contained in the groupings of figures representing them above a standing gold and white mobile representing Settlement School today. Dinner and Program A further golden moment for the Settlement School came on Tuesday night with the Settlement School dinner and program. Cleveland East and West Clubs had provided a fitting background for the dinner. Acting as hostesses for the club were Betty Calhoun of East and Barbara Olsen of West and Peg Feistkorn of the East Club presided. Gold accents were used in the reproduction of the Evelyn Prouty Hinkman placemat design and on other favors and miniature wooden spinning wheels centered the tables. A dinner highlight was the recognition of Pi Phis attending who had served in positions directly connected with the School. They included: May L. Keller, President Emeritus and the first Pi Phi to visit Gatlinburg (1910) ; Amy Burnham Onken, Honorary Grand President; Olivia Smith Moore, Grand Treasurer and former SS Committee treasurer; Lolita Snell Prouty, former Committee WEAVING DEMONSTRATIONS were given at the Smithsonian during Convention week by veteran Arrowcraft weaver, Myrtle Conner.

The pattern of her 50th anniversar] program combined the vivid hues of challenge am accomplishment with the warm tones of pride an( appreciation. She used slides presented with effec tive commentary and interwoven with song provide( by Music Chairman Pat Ballard and her chorus tl trace the development of the five areas in the Settle ment School project the school, the dormitory pre gram, the health services, Arrowcraft and the mor recent summer workshop program. 9 10 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI As members left the program they found still another golden anniversary gift, the new Settlement School Booklet prepared by Virginia Brackett Green. The skillfully prepared booklet provides a graphic picture of the development of the School and its related activities from its beginning to the year of its 50th anniversary. Mrs. Prouty Honored A fitting finale for Settlement School's bright moments during Convention week came on Friday night at the Formal Banquet when Grand Treasurer Olivia Smith Moore announced the establishment of a fund for use in expanding the new Weaving Studio the fund is being set up to honor Lolita Snell Prouty, former Settlement School treasurer. Mrs. Moore announced that the fund is to be established through a generous cash gift from Mrs. Prouty's three Pi Phi daughters, Evelyn Hickman, Caroline Shreve and Jane Perrella. It is to eventually finance the construction of a permanent ceramics laboratory at the Weaving Studio. That wing will bear Mrs. Prouty's name. In her remarks Mrs. Moore paid tribute to Mrs. Prouty for her devoted service to Pi Phi since her 1911 initiation and pointed to the invaluable leader-ship that she had provided during her six years as Grand Treasurer (1946-52) and her four years as Counselor for Chapter House Corporations (1952-1956). The announcement came as complete surprise to Mrs. Prouty. Her daughters had consulted with A PI PHI FAMILY Lolita Snell Prouty, who is to be honored with the eventual construction of a Ceramics Wing in the new Weaving Studio, is the second generation of a remarkable Pi Phi family. Her mother, Evalyn Barney Snell was the first initiate of Colorado Alpha, initiated in 1885. Mrs. Prouty was also initiated as a Colorado Alpha member in 1911. She has three Pi Phi daughters, Evelyn Prouty Hickman, Colorado Alpha, Caroline Prouty Shreve, Colorado Alpha, and Jane Prouty Perrella, Colorado Gamma. The fourth generation initiate is Mrs. Hick-man's daughter, Tia, who was initiated into Colorado Gamma in January, 1962, and who attended the Convention with her mother and grandmother. There are six more Prouty granddaughters so there is a strong likelihood that there are more Pi Phis yet to come. various individuals over a period of several months in making a decision about the use of their gift, but had been able to keep any hint of it from their parents. SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE-The 1960-62 Committee poses with a new member. Left to right are Zoe Saunders James, Chairman Helen M. Russell, Eloise Glazner Hensley, Helen Boucher Dix, and Lois Overstreet Summers and the new member, Sally Schneiter. Mrs. Dix was elected Grand Vice President after this picture was made and has been succeeded on the committee by Sally Wild Gordon. From Grand President's Speech Freedom's Privilege and Responsibility Grand President Alice Weber Mansfield called on members of Pi Beta Phi to live in awareness of the privileges that freedom offers them, but urged that they be equally aware of the responsibility that goes with that freedom in her opening address to the 43rd Biennial Convention on Monday, June 25. Excerpts from her speech are printed here. "In all the history of America, there is one under-lying principle the love of freedom freedom to worship as we choose freedom to speak as we wish freedom to enjoy the fruits of our labor and freedom to assemble peaceably as we wish. Yet there is a question today as to whether those of us who have always lived in freedom really appreciate the priceless heritage we possess and the power that is ours. Privilege and responsibility must ever go hand in hand for unless one accepts the responsibility, one is not worthy of the privilege. Therefore, ours is the responsibility of freedom and of membership in an organization that is the result of free-dom. "And it is our responsibility to study and to understand what is behind the pressure of Student Governments and so-called Discrimination Commissions on a number of campuses. "Now fraternities represent on college campuses the last stronghold of four ideals basic to the American way of life sisterhood, individuality, religious values and again, freedom. The forces that would do away with the American way of life, recognizing this, have stepped up their attacks and with all the tremendous resources at their command have continued their campaign to destroy fraternities from within, so that now we find added a new approach which is directed toward destroying the faith of individuals in their national organizations to the extent that certain members have come to feel that the criteria of the individual chapters should be the only standard used in the choice of members. "What they are forgetting is that if a fraternity is to be national or international it cannot be a mere federation of chapters. The chapter is merely the working unit of the national organization which has granted it a charter. In our rapidly moving world, people move from place to place frequently. Thus, each chapter acts as a local membership committee charged with the responsibility to choose members acceptable to the whole fraternity. A Pi Phi does not pledge a local chapter, she pledges Pi Beta Phi. The choice is hers and ours. This is not undemocratic, for it is only in a republic like ours that we have the right of choice. "By standing firmly on our principle we can give courage to other organizations that look to us for leadership. The columnist, George Sokolsky, has said, "the truth is that women have more courage than men." Pi Beta Phi's membership is 73,251 and its chapters and alumnae clubs are well respected and able to wield a strong influence for good. Once alert to danger, it is inconceivable that they will not meet the challenge and fight to retain their basic rights as members of a voluntary social organization operating under the freedom guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. "Unfortunately, in the world of today, our dangers are those of complacency, apathy, expediency and a general line of least resistance attitude. Gradually the self-discipline and firmness of purpose of our forefathers, who braved the wilderness with its hardships and dangers has given way to the in-difference of soft living. Comfort and fun are all important, and the desire to excel for its own sake in any effort is deteriorating into the desire to do merely enough to get by. "From our laxity of standards in dress and manners has developed a tolerance for cheating, stealing, and immorality as too many people exchange a strong moral sense of behavior and concern for standards for a mere desire not to get caught, since no one wants to accept the penalty for misdeeds. "The college fraternity has grown, strengthened and made a high place for itself because it is an intangible of spirit and attitude, of devotion and service, of friendship and ideals. It is our responsibility to keep Pi Beta Phi a true fraternity, to make sure that our influence is for the good that we scorn the cheap and ugly the dangerous customs that appear on college campuses where young men and women should be training for life with self-discipline and standing immovable against pressure for ways of life which bring unhappiness of a most bitter kind. Rather let us uphold those things which result in that noble womanhood for which Pi Beta Phi has been striving for 95 years. "Surely there is no finer goal nor one which will win more respect for our fraternity than one of consciously working toward those ideals which have been Pi Beta Phi's from the time of its founding and using every iota of our tremendous influence in showing the world how well an organization with selection as a basis for membership meets its obligations of friendship, to service to its country, an.c its God. 11
