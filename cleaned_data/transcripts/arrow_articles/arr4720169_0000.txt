What are the brilliants inside? Two days were spent in discovering what the box contained. had come to see weavings and the mountains; I found both on as full of charm as the other. There was the Arrow-craft shop with its profusion of color spread through the weaving array; rioting colors hut with the richness of the lapping ear pendants of a Paris bride. Aly eyes jumped from Afghans blocked in. reds, 1ilues, and oranges to sheer woven shawls that were as delicate in tone and clinging in touch as Zinnia blossoms. There were guest towels of silky sheen and jewel spottings ; sonic had gay colored borders, some were monotoited, while others were of damask texture in the natural linens. I learned of the growing industry, organized by the Pi :Beta Phi Fraternity School to be of help. to the mountain women, to bring new pleasures in their lives, and to provide them, with a means of earning money in. a pleasant way. Then we wandered up Baskins Creek, paying short visits to the weavers intheir homes. The looms were escon; in the front rooms and though ( signed as a means of earning mon they seemed ftting, for in the g colors slipping over them was ( pressed the joyful freedom thl wood contraptions brought to mountain -families.

We wanted to give California B a gift and that room needed something done to it; we also wanted to help out the Settlement School.
