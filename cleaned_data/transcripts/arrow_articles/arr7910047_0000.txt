Of special interest is the attractively decorated entrance room which features a stone fireplace between open floor-to-ceiling shelves. Adding to the warmth of the room are the handwoven hangings. This room is the Evelyn Bishop Memorial Room. It was furnished from contributions given in memory of Miss Bishop, head resident of the school from1918 until 1933, who died last year. A number of Gatlinburg residents joined the Committee and Settlement School personnel in the dedication program. Special tribute was paid to Miss Bishop by Weaving Instructor Gene Redding and Sue Huff Cox of Gatlinburg. The ceremony ended with the presentation of the keys to the house to School Director Marian Mueller by Chairman Russell.
