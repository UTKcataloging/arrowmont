        Nina Harris Allen Nina Harris Allen, former Grand Vice President, and ARROW alumnae editor, passed away on May 13, 1972, in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, at the age of 94. Her death is a great loss, not only nationally, but to the alumnae club which bears her name. Mrs. Allen was originally a member of the Illinois Beta chapter at Lombard College in Galesburg, III. She was initiated into Illinois Beta in October, 1894 at the age of 16. Three years later she was graduated with highest honors from Lombard College, now a part of Knox College. After teaching for three years in the Gales-burg public schools, she traveled extensively in this country and in Europe. Upon her return home, she studied home economics and modern languages at the University of Nebraska, where she acted as chaperone of Nebraska Beta. While in Lincoln she joined the Lincoln Alumnae Club and was sent as a delegate to the Alumnae Conference in Chicago in 1913. The chapter house at Nebraska was the setting for her marriage to Ford J. Allen of Chicago on November 8, 1913. An ardent worker in the Chicago Alumnae Club, Mrs. Allen was a Grand Vice President from 1915 to 1918, and Arrow alumnae editor from 1918 to 1922. She also did excellent work as chairman of the Arrow File Committee. Conventions were also an important part of Mrs. Allen's life. She had stated that she could remember attending at least 15 conventions. Be-cause her husband was a railroad man, she was able to obtain private cars for the delegates to use going to conventions. Upon moving to Glen Ellyn in the early 1920's, she was one of the founders of the Du Page County Alumnae Club, which in 1940 was renamed in her honor. She served as presidentfrom 1944 to 1946. Another interest in Mrs. Allen's life was the Women's Exchange in Glen Ellyn which she started with five other women in 1926. When she became sole owner, she turned her efforts to antiques. It was through this shop and her help to people in need that she became so well-loved throughout Glen Ellyn. Active in community affairs, she was also president of the Glen Ellyn Women's Club. In 1967 at the Centennial Convention in Chicago, Mrs. Allen was honored as the oldest member in attendance both in age and in number of years as a member. She was also honored at the Golden Arrow Luncheon, the Old-Timers Luncheon and the Sisters Breakfast which she attended with her sister, Mrs. Lillian Graves. Mrs. Allen served our Fraternity long and faithfully. As a beloved member for 78 years, she was an inspiration to all and especially to her own alumnx group. Her friendliness and interest in people is well-evidenced by the fact that she became acquainted with eight of the original twelve founders of our Fraternity. A tribute was paid to Mrs. Allen in the 1915 ARROW when she became Grand Vice President which we feel expresses her character through-out her lifetime: "Now as Grand Vice President, we are confident that Mrs. Allen will continue the development of the alumnx department with the same spirit which she has brought to all her work for Pi Phi the spirit of unselfishness, of enthusiasm, and of determination to do her part in advancing the ideals of our Fraternity.

The Great Smoky Mountains Gatlinburg, Tennessee 37738 1 7 A Word Picture of Gatlinburg by BETTY BAILEY HALL Arrowntont Board of Governors So you've never been to Gatlinburg? But you're going soon? Do you know what to expect? If you drive in from Knoxville, you'll see large billboards advertising many varieties of tourist attractions and you'll realize that Gatlin-burg will be full of tourists who have never heard of Pi Beta Phi, Settlement School, Arrowmont, or the Arrowcraft Shop. If you come through the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, you'll suddenly emerge from the beautiful hills to the shops, motels, and restaurants waiting at the edge of the Park for the tourist. None of these facilities for the traveler is available in the Park. Either way, if you've never been to Gatlin-burg, you may be surprised by the concentration of motels and restaurants, shops and shopping malls along the two or three streets winding through the valley. Your first problem will be a place to park. The city has provided parking by the Civic Auditorium on Airport Road and by the Chamber of Commerce building on the Parkway (the main street . The latter property used to be the Pi Phi meadow and for a long time was the only greensward left on the Parkway. But now it, too, is a city-owned, black-top parking lot. If you are staying in Gatlinburg overnight, you'll find it best to leave your car in the motel parking lot to walk the few blocks either way to see the main part of town. Or if you're just in town for a few hours, go to the Arrowcraft Shop parking lot. You'll want to do most of your buying there anyway. We do hope you come during the week; the shop is closed on Sunday. Between the Arrowcraft Shop parking lot and the Parkway is the delightful mall which was the first step of our Centennial project. There are three outdoor exhibit cases filled with handcrafted items from the school, spaces between each case for demonstration of crafts when the crafts classes are in session, and benches for tired tourists. The Mall extends from the Arrowcraft Shop to the Pi Beta Phi Administration Building. Do go into the office and introduce yourself. You'll be directed up Pi Phi Lane to the weaving andceramic wings of the Craft Building and then on to and through the new Emma Harper Turner building. We do hope you're there from June to October while the exhibit hall is on display. The whole building is beautiful, functional, and exciting. Go on out the upper level doors to the conversation circle, to Staff House, through the Red Barn and up the trail in back of the Barn. The trail goes one mile up to the top of Pi Phi Hill, our own special piece of the Great Smokies. Or from the Barn, go back the narrow path along the side of the hill to the cottages . Helmick (teachers), Pollard, and Stuart, which are still used as dormitories during the summer classes. At this point on the hill you can see across the valley to the hills in the distance. It's a beautiful sight. From this part of Pi Phi Lane you can also see the contemporary-style building known as Pi Beta Phi Elementary School. It is built on property once a part of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, but later deeded to the county for $1.00. The playground property is leased from Pi Beta Phi by the county at $1.00 a year on a 99 year lease. By mutual agreement, and delight, the name Pi Beta Phi was retained when the school became part of the county school system. Across the playground you can see two small historical buildings. The first building was one of the early Settlement School buildings, named for Emma Harper Turner and used by the jewelry classes during the Summer Craft Work-shops. It has been remodelled inside and is now occupied by Community Tectonics whose executive director, Mr. Hubert Bebb, was the architect for our new building. The other building, unoccupied at the present, is a log cabin. It was built in 1807 and was part of the Ogle property purchased by Pi Beta Phi for the Settlement School. Our own Elizabeth Waite Rue was re-gent of the Great Smoky Chapter of DAR when that organization placed a historical marker on the log cabin in ceremonies held March 6, 1970. While in Gatlinburg, enjoy the many shops (Continued on page 48) 18 In Lieu o f Scholarships Larger Donations Needed To Supplement Supplies 821 students attended classes at Arrowmont during the 1972 sessions. This was an increase of 721 over last year's enrollment in the three 2-week sessions and the four 1-week sessions. Student interest in Arrowmont is so great that filling classes is no problem. Many, many requests for enrollment must be rejected for lack of space, since sleeping quarters at the school will accommodate only 82 at a time. When the enrollment for a session reaches 134, as it did during the final two weeks last summer, many students have to pay for more expensive housing elsewhere. The Board of Governors would like to suggest, therefore, that alumnae clubs consider making larger donations to Arrowmont in lieu of scholarships. The need for funds for equipment is acute. Students are far more plentiful than supplies! Whig Rose Mats Chosen B y Inn If you're ever around Milwaukee, and you happen into the new Milwaukee Marriott Inn, and the dining room has a vaguely familiar look, it's because, as a Pi Phi, you are thoroughly familiar with the Whig Rose place mats made and sold at Arrowcraft. Donald S. Kennedy, president of Ace Foods, Inc., is responsible for selecting the dark green Whig Rose design place mats to be used in the Inn. The company, developers of the Inn, presently provides food service at almost a dozen colleges, office buildings and plants, and health care facilities throughout the upper-midwest. The Kennedys had used Arrowcraft place mats in their own home over the past years, and they have been highly satisfied with the product. As a result, the contact was made with Helen Anderson Lewis, Administrator. She sent two sample place mats to Mr. Kennedy, and from that point on, things began to move quickly. An initial order of 1500 place mats was placed around the first of August, with the first 1,000 to be delivered by September 15, and the remaining 500 to be delivered no later than November 1. So if you detected a slight wisp of smoke rising gently above the Smoky Mountains back in late summer, now you know it was caused by the looms of Pi Phi working at top speed to produce 1,500 Whig Rose place mats. And if the dining room of the Milwaukee Marriott Inn has a vaguely familiar look, just remember that food always tastes better on a place mat from A rrowcraft! Slides On Tour With Smithsonian Exhibit Pi Beta Phi has been featured a number of ways in and by the renowned Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Now a slide pro-gram has been put together to use with an exhibition on the handcrafts of the Southern High-lands. The program will include a substantial segment on Arrowmont and its activities, since 20 slides are being used. The exhibition, entitled Mountain Crafts-men: The Southern Appalachians, began its tour of Latin America in the fall. Among the many visitors to Arrowmont during the summer were former National Historian Marian Keck Simmons with her husband Oliver. 19 At rrowmont Top left: Dr. Robbie Blakemore (left), head of the Department of Crafts and Interior Design at the University of Tennessee, discusses a textile designed by student Gwen Ostrum.

Her death is a great loss, not only nationally, but to the alumnae club which bears her name. Mrs. Allen was originally a member of the Illinois Beta chapter at Lombard College in Galesburg, III. She was initiated into Illinois Beta in October, 1894 at the age of 16. Three years later she was graduated with highest honors from Lombard College, now a part of Knox College. After teaching for three years in the Gales-burg public schools, she traveled extensively in this country and in Europe. Upon her return home, she studied home economics and modern languages at the University of Nebraska, where she acted as chaperone of Nebraska Beta. While in Lincoln she joined the Lincoln Alumnae Club and was sent as a delegate to the Alumnae Conference in Chicago in 1913. The chapter house at Nebraska was the setting for her marriage to Ford J. Allen of Chicago on November 8, 1913. An ardent worker in the Chicago Alumnae Club, Mrs. Allen was a Grand Vice President from 1915 to 1918, and Arrow alumnae editor from 1918 to 1922. She also did excellent work as chairman of the Arrow File Committee. Conventions were also an important part of Mrs. Allen's life. She had stated that she could remember attending at least 15 conventions. Be-cause her husband was a railroad man, she was able to obtain private cars for the delegates to use going to conventions. Upon moving to Glen Ellyn in the early 1920's, she was one of the founders of the Du Page County Alumnae Club, which in 1940 was renamed in her honor. She served as presidentfrom 1944 to 1946. Another interest in Mrs. Allen's life was the Women's Exchange in Glen Ellyn which she started with five other women in 1926. When she became sole owner, she turned her efforts to antiques. It was through this shop and her help to people in need that she became so well-loved throughout Glen Ellyn. Active in community affairs, she was also president of the Glen Ellyn Women's Club. In 1967 at the Centennial Convention in Chicago, Mrs. Allen was honored as the oldest member in attendance both in age and in number of years as a member. She was also honored at the Golden Arrow Luncheon, the Old-Timers Luncheon and the Sisters Breakfast which she attended with her sister, Mrs. Lillian Graves. Mrs. Allen served our Fraternity long and faithfully. As a beloved member for 78 years, she was an inspiration to all and especially to her own alumnx group. Her friendliness and interest in people is well-evidenced by the fact that she became acquainted with eight of the original twelve founders of our Fraternity. A tribute was paid to Mrs. Allen in the 1915 ARROW when she became Grand Vice President which we feel expresses her character through-out her lifetime: "Now as Grand Vice President, we are confident that Mrs. Allen will continue the development of the alumnx department with the same spirit which she has brought to all her work for Pi Phi the spirit of unselfishness, of enthusiasm, and of determination to do her part in advancing the ideals of our Fraternity.

The Great Smoky Mountains Gatlinburg, Tennessee 37738 1 7 A Word Picture of Gatlinburg by BETTY BAILEY HALL Arrowntont Board of Governors So you've never been to Gatlinburg? But you're going soon? Do you know what to expect? If you drive in from Knoxville, you'll see large billboards advertising many varieties of tourist attractions and you'll realize that Gatlin-burg will be full of tourists who have never heard of Pi Beta Phi, Settlement School, Arrowmont, or the Arrowcraft Shop. If you come through the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, you'll suddenly emerge from the beautiful hills to the shops, motels, and restaurants waiting at the edge of the Park for the tourist. None of these facilities for the traveler is available in the Park. Either way, if you've never been to Gatlin-burg, you may be surprised by the concentration of motels and restaurants, shops and shopping malls along the two or three streets winding through the valley. Your first problem will be a place to park. The city has provided parking by the Civic Auditorium on Airport Road and by the Chamber of Commerce building on the Parkway (the main street . The latter property used to be the Pi Phi meadow and for a long time was the only greensward left on the Parkway. But now it, too, is a city-owned, black-top parking lot. If you are staying in Gatlinburg overnight, you'll find it best to leave your car in the motel parking lot to walk the few blocks either way to see the main part of town. Or if you're just in town for a few hours, go to the Arrowcraft Shop parking lot. You'll want to do most of your buying there anyway. We do hope you come during the week; the shop is closed on Sunday. Between the Arrowcraft Shop parking lot and the Parkway is the delightful mall which was the first step of our Centennial project. There are three outdoor exhibit cases filled with handcrafted items from the school, spaces between each case for demonstration of crafts when the crafts classes are in session, and benches for tired tourists. The Mall extends from the Arrowcraft Shop to the Pi Beta Phi Administration Building. Do go into the office and introduce yourself. You'll be directed up Pi Phi Lane to the weaving andceramic wings of the Craft Building and then on to and through the new Emma Harper Turner building. We do hope you're there from June to October while the exhibit hall is on display. The whole building is beautiful, functional, and exciting. Go on out the upper level doors to the conversation circle, to Staff House, through the Red Barn and up the trail in back of the Barn. The trail goes one mile up to the top of Pi Phi Hill, our own special piece of the Great Smokies. Or from the Barn, go back the narrow path along the side of the hill to the cottages . Helmick (teachers), Pollard, and Stuart, which are still used as dormitories during the summer classes. At this point on the hill you can see across the valley to the hills in the distance. It's a beautiful sight. From this part of Pi Phi Lane you can also see the contemporary-style building known as Pi Beta Phi Elementary School. It is built on property once a part of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, but later deeded to the county for $1.00. The playground property is leased from Pi Beta Phi by the county at $1.00 a year on a 99 year lease. By mutual agreement, and delight, the name Pi Beta Phi was retained when the school became part of the county school system. Across the playground you can see two small historical buildings. The first building was one of the early Settlement School buildings, named for Emma Harper Turner and used by the jewelry classes during the Summer Craft Work-shops. It has been remodelled inside and is now occupied by Community Tectonics whose executive director, Mr. Hubert Bebb, was the architect for our new building. The other building, unoccupied at the present, is a log cabin. It was built in 1807 and was part of the Ogle property purchased by Pi Beta Phi for the Settlement School. Our own Elizabeth Waite Rue was re-gent of the Great Smoky Chapter of DAR when that organization placed a historical marker on the log cabin in ceremonies held March 6, 1970. While in Gatlinburg, enjoy the many shops (Continued on page 48) 18 In Lieu o f Scholarships Larger Donations Needed To Supplement Supplies 821 students attended classes at Arrowmont during the 1972 sessions. This was an increase of 721 over last year's enrollment in the three 2-week sessions and the four 1-week sessions. Student interest in Arrowmont is so great that filling classes is no problem. Many, many requests for enrollment must be rejected for lack of space, since sleeping quarters at the school will accommodate only 82 at a time. When the enrollment for a session reaches 134, as it did during the final two weeks last summer, many students have to pay for more expensive housing elsewhere. The Board of Governors would like to suggest, therefore, that alumnae clubs consider making larger donations to Arrowmont in lieu of scholarships. The need for funds for equipment is acute. Students are far more plentiful than supplies! Whig Rose Mats Chosen B y Inn If you're ever around Milwaukee, and you happen into the new Milwaukee Marriott Inn, and the dining room has a vaguely familiar look, it's because, as a Pi Phi, you are thoroughly familiar with the Whig Rose place mats made and sold at Arrowcraft. Donald S. Kennedy, president of Ace Foods, Inc., is responsible for selecting the dark green Whig Rose design place mats to be used in the Inn. The company, developers of the Inn, presently provides food service at almost a dozen colleges, office buildings and plants, and health care facilities throughout the upper-midwest. The Kennedys had used Arrowcraft place mats in their own home over the past years, and they have been highly satisfied with the product. As a result, the contact was made with Helen Anderson Lewis, Administrator. She sent two sample place mats to Mr. Kennedy, and from that point on, things began to move quickly. An initial order of 1500 place mats was placed around the first of August, with the first 1,000 to be delivered by September 15, and the remaining 500 to be delivered no later than November 1. So if you detected a slight wisp of smoke rising gently above the Smoky Mountains back in late summer, now you know it was caused by the looms of Pi Phi working at top speed to produce 1,500 Whig Rose place mats. And if the dining room of the Milwaukee Marriott Inn has a vaguely familiar look, just remember that food always tastes better on a place mat from A rrowcraft! Slides On Tour With Smithsonian Exhibit Pi Beta Phi has been featured a number of ways in and by the renowned Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Now a slide pro-gram has been put together to use with an exhibition on the handcrafts of the Southern High-lands. The program will include a substantial segment on Arrowmont and its activities, since 20 slides are being used. The exhibition, entitled Mountain Crafts-men: The Southern Appalachians, began its tour of Latin America in the fall. Among the many visitors to Arrowmont during the summer were former National Historian Marian Keck Simmons with her husband Oliver. 19 At rrowmont Top left: Dr. Robbie Blakemore (left), head of the Department of Crafts and Interior Design at the University of Tennessee, discusses a textile designed by student Gwen Ostrum.
