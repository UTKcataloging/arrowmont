A meet ing of Pi Beta Phi members, singing a favorite song? No, the students of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, enthusiastically voicing their loyalty by singing the official school song. "Be thou my messenger Straight to her heart." These students, known throughout an increasingly large area of eastern Tennessee as "the Pi Phis" do send a message to the heart of all Pi Beta Phi fraternity members; and serve to proand anti-fraternity citizens of the outside world as living examples of the finest in fraternity philanthropy. The Settlement School is known also among educators because of its unique division of authority between Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and Sevier County, and because of its emphasis on the training in crafts. The past six years since last convention have seen considerable change in the school system. In 1940, the County was paying the entire salaries of the grade school teachers, $1000 a year rent for the grade school building, and approximately three-fourths toward the salaries of the High School teachers, a total of nearly $12,000.00. The Fraternity advised the County they would expect them to assume complete support of the grade school beginning with the fall of 1943. Following advice secured through two former surveys made by Dean Edwin Holton and Dr. William Taylor, and with excellent legal advice, Ethel Copp, then chair-man, worked through several sessions of the Sevier County Court until, with the aid of loyal Gatlinburg citizens, the lease-agreement presented by the Fraternity was accepted. This has been in operation three years and from all present indications is working remarkably well. Briefly the provisions of the agreement are these: the High School building, equipment, and playground area are leased for a term of 25 years for the sum of $1.00 a year. During that period the County maintains the building in satisfactory repair, replaces and maintains the equipment included in the lease, issues the same supplies as they provide for other schools in the county, and pays the salaries of teachers of a basic educational program including English, mathematics, history and science. By a separate agreement extending until 18 months after it is possible to begin construction, the County also leases our elementary school, paying all costs of maintenance, equipment, and salaries. By the time this lease expires the County is required to build a new grade school on land already purchased by them and adjoining our property. This, as you can see, did not release any great amount of funds formerly contributed by Pi Beta Phi. In reality, Pi Beta Phi exchanged the $1000 received as rental for payment of all maintenance costs of both buildings and the salaries of approximately two high school teachers. This past year the County re-ports expenditures of approximate two Gatlinburg schools. Only $ county school taxes, and the rema funds. With 104 High School and 32E dents, the county funds, even wit cannot adequately care for the a( schools. Pi Beta Phi has furnished supplies each year, has contributed equipment, notably the lovely curt for the auditorium stage partially from Anna De Costello; and has three departments, Arts and Crafts cal Education, The Pi Beta Phi definite school needs amounted to year.

The Music Supervisor, also new this year, and a very evident and splendid addition to our staff, gave regular periods each week to all grade school children, who showed great love and remarkable aptitude for all taught them. The third grade gave a demonstration at a Sevier County Teachers meeting, two grades gave programs for the Weavers meetings, there were numerous appearances at regular school chapel* programs, students from the upper three grades formed an elementary school chorus, and the lower five grades combined to present an operetta, "A Rose Dream," praised by all who saw it as one of the loveliest of its kind. This regular music education experience in the grades, begun first during the second semester of the 1944-45 school year, should, in a few years, eliminate the condition now found in the High School where work with the chorus and glee clubs is severely handicapped because the students lack knowledge in sight-reading. Supervision of art work was given in all grades above the third by the Arts and Crafts teacher. Classes once a week included such fundamental instructions as use of the ruler and compass, with which most of the children had had no previous experience, and concluded with the making of beaver board tiles and coasters. Special grade school projects included the making of a New England village at Thanksgiving time with its log houses, church, and trees; and a creche at Christmas time, their first experience with clay and to many their first knowledge of a creche. As Miss Petrie writes, Baby Jesus slightly resembles the baby sister of its maker, fourth grade Philip Huff, but "to me, who watched these children work, it is beautiful and sweet." Seventh and eighth grade and high school girls were enrolled in regular craft classes meeting in the Emma Harper Turner Craft Center the old Arrow-craft Shop moved and shingled outside and since last ' convention rather considerably improved by new flooring, celotex walls and ceiling, a partition between the weaving and woodworking rooms, and an interior paint job. Here color and design instructions, card weaving, puppetry and all types of four-harness weaving were thoroughly enjoyed. This class combined with the English department to present puppet shows, such as "Haensel and Gretel," and one with the assistance of the Health Center, stressing health habits using the story of the "Three Bears" as a vehicle. High School boys have met with a part-time instructor for regular daily classes in wood-working the last two years, and the 7th and 8th grade boys three times a week the last year. Besides making the puppet stage and several small table looms for the craft classes, the boys made splendid progress in smaller wooden articles. Next year it is hoped another lathe and spraying machine may be added to the equipment and the attic room remodeled to make a finishing-room. Paramount in all work of the Craft Department is the basic consideration that everything taught be of practical value to the children in their own home. This Pi Phi addition to the curriculum seems a wise provision to safeguard the future of handcrafts in this area as well as provide future workers for Arrowcraft. School Future As to the future of our part of the joint county-Pi Phi educational program at ,Gatlinburg, there is every indication that the County will need our assistance for sometime to come, even though they will continue to cooperate to the limit of their ability. Their taxes are already high, but they expect to have to raise them to secure funds for the new grade school building. Even so, the County Superintendent is hopeful they can also secure federal funds, else he fears the amount available will not be adequate to build the type of school desired not only by them but also by Pi Beta Phi, whose approval of the plans is a provision of the lease-agreement. It may well be that in order to insure the building of a school that will be a satisfactory complement to our property, Pi Beta Phi may need to follow Dr. Taylor's advice and either contribute to it ourselves or arouse the Gatlinburg citizens to assist financially with this project. The grade school building returns to Pi Beta Phi when a new building is ready for occupancy, and can then be converted to other needs. A definite decision has not yet been made but the suggestion of Miss Dyer that this be remodeled into a lounge and dining-room for summer Workshop students is worth consideration, as well as its use in the regular Summer Workshop program for additional class-rooms. The County has been ' able to raise salaries considerably during the war period by assistance from Lanham Act funds, made available to them because of their nearness to Oak Ridge and the Alcoa plant. That these will continue even next year is not an established fact, which raises a question as to the County's ability to maintain satisfactory teaching personnel for even the number they are now providing. Any increase in number of teachers provided by them is entirely dependent on comparative needs with other county schools, and the outlook for any immediate increase is extremely doubtful. That they can assume any shareof the three departments Pi Beta Phi is now contributing at any time in the near future is most unlikely, and it is even uncertain they could do so at any time, without assistance from some outside source. Gatlinburg itself may grow because of tourist trade, but the character of the country outside the village limits is such that it is largely dependent upon poor farms for sustenance and handcrafts for income. The Southern Conference of Mountain Workers estimated that the yearly cash income of farmers in the nearby community is as low as $80.00 a year. Gatlinburg support of the school program was the highest it has been this past year. An active PTA furnished, with federal assistance, a fine hot lunch program, even clearing enough to purchase much needed equipment for continued' operation. They aroused the Lions Club to the need for better lighting in the grade school and are raising funds for fluorescent lights to be installed in the present Pi Phi building and removed later to the new county building. This indication of interest in the betterment of the School by local Gatlinburg organizations may bring further contributions of a substantial nature; but the exact extent of regular support is at present very much a question. Gatlinburg has incorporated and is concluding its first full year under a City Manager and Council of three members. Their first project, just completed, was a topographical survey of the town, funds for which were raised by a tax on hotels and tourist courts based on the number of guests they accommodate. Besides the financing of the City Manager's office the present Gatlinburg funds are expended almost entirely for police protection, a vital need in THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 95 a tourist community and one which is even yet poorly met. Their immediate future projects include a city water system and sewage disposal plant. These are to be started this coming summer, it is hoped, financed by bonds soon to be floated. There has been some discussion of a Community Building as the project for consideration after these are completed, but definite plans are dependent upon a variety of conditions including location of a site and the securing of federal funds. Gatlinburg has grown in the period since last Convention. An anticipated drop in tourist visitors due to the war did not materialize, due probably to the nearness of Oak Ridge with its government employees to whom gasoline was furnished for necessary buying in nearby cities, and to others from Knoxville and even farther distances who came and stayed for several weeks because of curtailment of travel. If Gatlinburg is able to build wisely and if contemplated additions to the Smoky Mountain Park and the routing of new highways through other Park entrances does not dissipate their tourist trade, it is altogether probable that Gatlinburg will continue to grow toward a substantial community. For the immediate future there are so many crying needs demanding attention that support of an educational pro-gram does not seem possible of inclusion. Without Pi Beta Phi's continued assistance the schools would suffdr a most severe relapse. Housing A part of our contribution which rightfully belongs with the educational system but which is not an integral part of the school itself is the housing unit. Teachers Cottage houses the office of the Director, a position filled since last convention by Eunice Weaver, who resigned because of ill-health in March, 1941 after seven years with the School; Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, who served two years until family obligations called her to New York; and since then our present capable and delightful Ruth Dyer. This spring a North Carolina recent graduate, Helen Borgstrom, joined the staff as Assistant to the Director. Teachers Cottage also serves as home for most of our resident staff and for those teachers, county paid, whose homes are away from Gatlinburg. Prior to the war members of Pi Beta Phi averaged 50% of the teaching staff. That this has dropped to zero is the fault largely of war wage-levels with which Sevier County could not compete. It is our hope that as conditions adjust (if they do!) we can again interest our own members in this opportunity to serve and gain rich experience, since we are privileged by conditions of the lease-agreement to keep half of the staff Pi Beta Phi's. It is our belief that Pi Beta Phi's can contribute greatly to the school system, though the caliber of teachers maintained through the war period has been extremely fine when we take into consideration their scarcity in rural communities throughout the country. The two dormitories house High School students who could not secure their education without the assistance provided by our arrangement which re-quires payment of $5.00 cash monthly for room and board plus 96 hours of work done by each student. Stuart Dormitory has been built since last convention. Made possible through a bequest from Anne Stuart, former Grand Treasurer, it was completed in 1941 and constitutes a lovely home with its twin living-rooms used for all dormitory student socialaffairs, its first floor suite, and five double and one single room on the second and third floors. Built as a boy's dormitory to replace the former most inadequate building, it has been used for girls the past two years, with the permission of Mary Stuart Kinder. Pollard Cottage now serves as boy's dormitory. One of the oldest buildings on the place, it is in constant need of repair to keep it even presentable. The lower floor houses the kitchen and dining rooms for staff and dormitory students. As second on our list of "musts" for our future program is some re-placement of this building. Now being considered by our architect is a new Staff Residence to house those now living at Teachers Cottage, and including a new modern kitchen and pleasant dining-rooms. Teachers Cottage could then be used as a student dormitory, and Pollard Cottage would serve as housing for some of the staff members. Demonstration Farm Complementary to the housing unit is the Pi Beta Phi demonstration farm. Formerly under the direction of an agricultural teacher, since 1943 it has been in charge of an ex-student of Berea College's agriculture course. During the nine-month school year the dormitory boys work before and after school hours. A small herd of registered jersey cattle, a few pure-bred hogs and a sizeable flock of chickens constitute the live stock on our Pi Phi farm. Begun years ago when Pi Phi gifts brought "Ring Ching Ching" and "Texas" to Gatlinburg, our pure-bred strains have raised the standard of stock in the Gatlinburg community. Vegetables from the garden, milk, cream, butter, eggs and chicken provide the raw materials for the excellent meals served under the guidance of the House Manager; and the surplus is always eagerly purchased by one of the Gatlinburg hotels or stores. 2692/3 dozen eggs were sold during the peak producing month this past year. Additional income is made by the renting of Pi Beta Phi's team of mules, the "horsepower" for plowing, hauling wood and other such farm chores. Health Center The Health Center remains much as it was in 1940 a busy, interesting place with Marjorie Chalmers completing ten years as the competent, kindly nurse in charge. Her reports show an average of 1500 home calls, 2000 office calls and as many surgical dressings a year. The number of inoculations runs over 800 a year, and an average of 2000 school children are given routine physical inspections annually. This year a projector and screen given by Chicago North, and usable with electric current or storage battery, has provided the means for increasing interest in health education talks not only in Gatlinburg but in rural communities as well. Pre-school Round-ups with a Dental Hygienist and Nutritionist from the State Health Department are annual affairs, and this year saw two dental clinics and a promise of longer time for Gatlinburg next year. Special and specific assistance has been given in many types of corrective work, glasses, braces and special shoes being donated by other agencies through our Health Center. Mrs. Chalmers was selected as the recipient of a scholarship given by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis for a special course given last summer at Warm Springs, Ga., and has just completed 6 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW five day refresher course on polio treatment at fonteagle, Tenn. The building now known as the Jennie Nicol [ealth Center is really unsafe for use, due to the wages of time and termites. Preliminary sketches for new Health Center have already been approved and is hoped that work can soon be started on this inch-needed building. It will contain a nurse's office; .inic or first-aid. room; a work-room with cupboards, Ilk, electric oven for sterilization needs; and a large ass-room and adjoining bath for use in the teaching Home Nursing classes as part of the adult educaon program which remains one of the important inctions of the Health Center. A doctor has recently established an office in 4tlinburg, and will considerably reduce the number E' a certain type of demands on our nurse. Her work assistant in the birth of new babies has also lesmed as more and more of the mothers secure doctor's ire for this common occurrence in the area. Howver, the burden of the physical examinations of :udents in our own schools and in the nearby rural :hools not visited by any county nurse or doctor, le regular emergency and first-aid treatments among le students in Gatlinburg and the weavers and thers who still trust only the Pi Phi Nurse, the ioculations, Well-Baby Clinics, and the approxiiately 1500 home calls a year, still means a full :hedule for this member of our staff. !rrowcraft Arrowcraft's year may be summed up in the opening mtence of the report of our excellent Manager, thel Snow: "The year just past should have brought )e alum= clubs and Arrowcraft more closely to-ether than ever before. I am sure we have had the ine thwarted feeling, that opportunity to sell so such more than it was possible to produce." Production levels have been maintained and even icreased each year since last convention. Last year a )tal of 127 weavers were on the Arrowcraft rolls, rith 80 of them working six months or more of aat time, and an average of 80 weavers working at ray one time. Checks totalling $27,647.11 were given weavers for work done from May first of last year May of this. A comparative study showed that last year the [um= clubs received the same percentage of Arrow-raft's output that they had received in 1941, the nal amount increasing from $35,428.18 to 43,701.27, not including an increase in discount from 5 to 20% during that time. Of the remaining suply the 1941 sales showed some $6,000 going to rholesalers. This type of business has been dras-:cally curtailed the last few years, with the con-:nuance only of a limited amount sent to the Southern lighland Handicraft Guild and Southern Highmders shops in Rockefeller Center, Asheville, Nor-[s Dam and Big Meadows. This has been necessary ecause of an understanding with these organizations a which Arrowcraft holds membership. The remaining sales are entered on the books as Cash Sales" but should not be considered entirely s non-Pi Phi tourist sales, since this includes a ansiderable but indeterminable number of sales made Pi Phi's in the Arrowcraft Shop, and all mail rder sales not sent to an alumnae club on consign-lent. One other factor is important in this analysis nd that is that the local Arrowcraft Shop often dislays those items not popular with alumnae clubs andis also used to unload those slightly irregular articles which are good but cannot be sent in alumna club Orders because of variation in size, color, etc. The many problems of distribution for a stock that is unpredictable in amount available at any one time and in total amount, and for which the bulk of the orders arrive at approximately the same time were of real concern to our Arrowcraft staff. Part of this may be removed this coming year by the necessity of a raise in prices on all Arrowcraft articles. This has been needed for some time but OPA regulations to which Arrowcraft strictly adhered prohibited any change except on new items. Now prices may be raised for the same article if cost of production has increased. And you would know, of course, that they have. Not only has the price of threads and yarns been raised by the mills, but effective now is a drop from a former 25% cash discount to a 10% cash discount. Also the weavers are being paid more for their work, as is certainly not out of line with present conditions, especially since one of the primary reasons for Arrow-craft is the financial assistance to women who could not earn in other ways either because of personal attributes or family restrictions. Technically speaking, our weavers are not employees since we require no speed of performance, nor do we dictate any working conditions such as number of hours or date of delivery; they weave at home articles for which we advance the necessary materials and sell the finished product to Arrowcraft. Governmental interpretation of the term "employees" however, indicates a probable inclusion of them under some sort of minimum wage regulations. After an original flurry in 1940, during which some government investigation was made, we were told to continue as previously until further notice. This past fall we were asked to make a survey of a number of our weavers, ascertaining speed of work, and reducing their pay, which is figured by us according to a piece rate, to an average rate per hour. The results showed an average pay of 42 cents an hour for the thirty weavers selected from among those working on various types of weaving and with varying abilities. It is uncertain yet what their application of the Fair Standards Act will be, which as you know is under consideration for a change from the present 40 cent minimum to at least a 55 cent minimum. The results of any necessitated raise in pay to the weavers would automatically include some further raise in selling prices. The outlook for fall, then, would indicate a possible wider variety of articles than last year, many of these lovely new designs of our "Miss Meta," a considerable raise in prices, but no definite promise of a greater over-all quantity than was available last year, since the increasing of production is beyond our control. By staggering club orders over a longer period of time, it might be possible for our Arrowcraft Manager to send a little more on those particular orders which arrived so close together last year that all must be proportionately filled from the same month's de-liveries to the Shop. That she can completely fill any orders if they maintain the same high as last year will be an impossibility that she and Committee regret fully as much, if not more, than the disappointed clubs. Miss Meta Schattschneider, whom we were fortunate enough to secure as Weaving Supervisor upon the resignation last fall of Winogene Redding, who had served so capably for twenty years, has already THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 97 made a very definite contribution through her lovely designs of interesting color combinations, and her ability to work with and for others. She has written three articles to appear in as many issues of Design magazine, the first of which features Arrowcraft and our Summer Workshop. Summer Workshop. The Summer Workshop as such is perhaps a new idea, although the basis for it came out of suggestions made by both Dean Holton and Dr. Taylor when they advised us to develop the Arts and Crafts field of our Settlement School as we gave added responsibility in other educational fields to the County or community. Future possibilities in such a program were outlined by them and enlarged by the former Settlement School Chairman, Ethel Copp, and the Arts and Crafts Advisory Committee inaugurated in her term of office and consisting of Miss Jessie Harris, Head of the Home Economics Department, Miss Ida Anders and Miss Marian Heard, instructors in textiles and crafts at the University of Tennessee. The only immediate practical application of this idea seemed to be the founding of the Summer Work-shop in the summer of 1945 with the University of Tennessee offering graduate and post-graduate credit for courses in weaving, textile decoration, recreational crafts, woodworking, and community recreation taught by a staff selected jointly by the University and Pi Beta Phi. Headed by the well-known originator of the Milwaukee Handicraft Project, Miss Elsa Ulbricht, this group of four excellent craftsmen was enthusiastically followed in a program of classes and laboratory periods which lasted from eight to six and even spilled over into evening hours because of sheer enjoyment in the creation of crafts articles of assorted types and materials. At one of the two open houses marking the end of each three-week period, Miss Onken dedicated the Arts and Crafts Building to Emma Harper Turner in recognition of her efforts toward founding the Settlement School and her continued interest in it through-out her lifetime. The Grand Council and Settlement School Committee and the University of Tennessee Committee in charge were agreed that the first Summer Workshop exceeded all expectations. Students from nineteen states were of unusual caliber, including State Directors of Industrial Arts, Home Demonstration Agents, and Craft Teachers. The program for this summer follows very much the same pattern, as last with Miss Ulbricht and Miss Marian Heard of the University acting as co-directors and with metalcraft added to the curriculum. Four board and room scholarships were offered two to Pi Beta Phis and two to the University of Tennessee students, the recipients to live at the School with another Pi Phi, Carolyn Buck, who will attend classes part-time and take charge of a light luncheon to be prepared and served to the students in the Home Economics room of the High School. Twenty-seven advance registrations to date insure a capacity enrollment this year. There is every indication that if Pi Beta Phi is interested in development of this plan it can be built into a Craft School of considerable prominence. Gatlinburg is an ideal setting, and it is located in the midst of one of the best centers of American handcrafts. Held in the summer it allows use of the High School and Craft Centerbuildings during months when they would otherwise be idle, and makes possible the securing of outstanding craft teachers who hold other positions during winter months. We have land on which summer dormitories and any additional buildings needed could be placed; and the possibilities for broadening the curriculum are numerous, including play production with actual experience before tourist audiences, study and experience in the merchandising of craft articles, and development of the community recreation course to include experience in a well-rounded program of activities using Settlement School facilities. This is an enlargement of our former program of cultivation of the crafts of the Smoky Mountains and specifically the Gatlinburg community, to the furtherance and development of craft education throughout the country by offering excellent instruction in this field to a college-level student body. Through the stimulus and insniration of these Workshops there should result a raising of the quality of craft work in Gatlinburg itself and finally, we hope, the interesting of craft leaders in affiliating themselves with our project in a permanent way that would insure their cooperation with Arrowcraft to open new avenues of income for the handcraft workers of Pi Beta Phi. There is no question but that the immediate needs in Gatlinburg are for continued assistance in the regular school curriculum, for a Health Center pro-gram similar to the present one, for the maintenance of high standards in Arrowcraft production and the marketing of these to insure financial assistance for those who need this means of income ; but as we are able to develop the Summer Workshop project we will be laying the foundation for a future expansion of our enterprise on a basis which should eventually be self-supporting and in a way equally important to Gatlinburg and the future of crafts. If this report has helped to bring to you a picture of the whole project known as the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as it exists at present, with some indication of possible future developments, it has accomplished its purpose. It has been a real privilege and pleasure to serve the past four years on the Settlement School Committee, to work closely with the other members who during that time have included Ethel Copp, Beth Le Roy, Lolita. Prouty, Ann Munn, Emma Woerner and Eugenia Smith, and the new member just beginning her five year term of office, Carlene Holly; to know the understanding and Inspirational assistance of Grand Council and its contact member to our Committee, the Grand President; and to assist to the best of our ability in the many details and constantly changing matters for consideration that make the work at the Settlement School a real task and sometimes a real worry, but always, in spite of this, a real joy also in the knowledge that there Pi Beta Phi is doing such a constructive piece of philanthropy that Edwin Foscue writing of Gatlin-burg in the "Economic Geography" devotes consider-able space to the part played by the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, saying in one instance: "This mountain community, nearly a century and a half old; completely isolated from the rest of the country for more than a century, became known first through the lumbering industry and later through the establishment of a Settlement School" and again: "the Gatlinburg community is certainly indebted to the Fraternity for the work of the school in the community." MILDRED SALE, Chairman 98 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR TIME moves swifter than a weaver's shuttle, even one in the experienced hands of a Pi Phi weaver. The terrible war is over with people everywhere be-ginning to talk of memorials to be erected honoring war heroes. Many agree that the day of statues is past and that living memorials will best express the gratitude flowing from our hearts. Pi Beta Phi had such an idea in mind when the Settlement School was founded, not to honor war heroes but our be-loved founders. Through the years the natural beauty all around us, orderly living, willing service to bodies, minds, and hearts has gone steadily forward enriching the lives of many. Changes come but by constant adjustments we can continue to serve the Gatlinburg Community. Community This year has marked the passing of two good friends of the School. Charlie Ogle died in December of 1945 and Aunt Lizzie Reagan in March of 1946. They are missed, for both filled a place in the life of the village that was a unique one. This summer of 1946 finds Gatlinburg's main street much changed by the addition of a number of new buildings. The Ogle store has been changed into a Super-Market. The drug stock was moved across the street to the old Annex, now the bus depot. The Log Cabin has been razed. On that site construction on a large new structure which is to _house a movie theater, several shops with office rooms above is well started. The Methodist congregation has the foundation laid for a stone chapel. This is to be located on the hill above the Cliff Dwellers Shop on a lot donated to them by Mr. and Mrs. Jones. Mr. Barber is the architect. His design is most attractive in the pictures. Ray Whaley, back from the service, has built a new hotel named Edge Park Inn on land between the Riverside and the New Gatlinburg Inn. It has twenty-five guest rooms and the dining room is to accommodate two hundred. Earl Ogle has erected an office building for the new doctor adjacent to the Ogle Store, Along the river, Mrs. Allen, of Laurel Springs resort, built two attractive shops on the highway side. They do cut off a lovely view of the river, a circumstance that seems a pity. A number of other business places have been enlarged, smaller shops and eating stands have been erected all along the highway! The main street is fast becoming that of a typical resort town. The effects of incorporation of the village which was voted last year are not yet very apparent. A large, detailed map of the area and preliminary surveys for water and sewer lines have been made by the city manager and his staff. The council spent much time formulating various ordinances governing the operation and taxation of different businesses. In this town they are almost exclusively devoted to the tourist trade. Some added police protection has been secured. This is used mostly to control traffic and disturbances due to liquor. School Many problems have come up during the year with changes in personnel in the teaching staff in some grades a major one. Fortunately we had several strong teachers, and were able to manage somehow with substitutes and end the year with the required work completed. It was again necessary to have one room in which we had two grades. The Elementarybuilding was so crowded that the beginners were placed over in the back room at the high school building. In the high school there was a change in the English teacher at the end of the first semester. Miss Fenn wished to go to Columbia for further work in Library Science. We were fortunate in securing Mrs. Ann Lighter for the position. She has recently moved to town, she and her husband own a home here. She has taught English and best of all had charge of all High School libraries in the state of Michigan for two years prior to her marriage. She is a real addition to the staff. She coached the successful senior play, "He Couldn't Marry Five." The work of the three teachers supplied by the fraternity to supplement the County program added much to the enjoyment of the students as well as giving them something of value in Music, Physical Education and Crafts. Mrs. Stanley Armstrong used the old Agriculture room for her class room for the music work. The children responded well to her excellent teaching. The Grade School Operetta, Rose Dream, was one of the best that I have seen here. She trained a chorus from the sixth, seventh and eighth grades that delighted everyone with their singing at the Elementary School graduation program. The Glee Club did very well at the various Commencement events. Mr. Don Spargo, as Phyiscal Education instructor, worked hard with the students in regular classes as well as coaching both a boys and girls team in basket ball. Our victories were not too many for we were pitted against teams of much more experience and from larger schools but the spirit was fine. Through donations from various business houses and individual friends a fund of $351.00, was secured for new warm-up jackets for the boys team. These were ordered last December but to date have not been de-livered due to shortages of materials. When our teams played away from home they reflected credit upon their coach and the school. In the craft department Miss Elizabeth Petrie worked with the grade school children and the girls in the high school craft class while Mr. Carl Huskey devoted two hours in the morning to the boys teaching wood working. The boys made a number of small looms that were used by the girls in the simpler types of weaving. The boys also made the wooden stage for a puppet theater; the girls wove the little curtains and made the , puppets. Several shows were given to very appreciative audiences. One play was the "Three Bears" with health problems woven into the story by one of the girls, "Hansel and Gretel" with music rforn the opera was given at Open House. The weaving done by the girls was of exceptionally good quality both in design and in workmanship. Home Economics instruction included work in nutrition, sewing, and designing of clothes for the girls themselves and work for various relief agencies. One class cleaned and decorated one room at the school to be used as a future rest room for the girls. A course in home nursing resulted in the girls being given the Red Cross awards for completing the regular course. In this work Miss Landrum has a very good opportunity to teach the girls many things in personal grooming, clothing care, suitability of dress, good manners and ways of entertaining. When our Gatlinburg girls go to any other town they are THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 99 always complimented upon their excellent appearance. We graduated a class of sixteen seniors. A number of them expect to go on for more training. The class made their annual trip to Atlanta, had the usual banquet tendered them by the Juniors and gave their class night program before Commencement. The speakers were good at both the Baccalaureate and Commencement programs. We have had good cooperation from the Sevier County authorities but have been hampered all year by the war time shortages of repair materials needed for buildings, furnaces, etc. The county constructed a new brick smoke stack to the large boiler room and paid for half of a new incinerator to take care of waste paper from the school. Mr. Kelley Huskey coached a team of girls in Sevierville for schools of their size. His Eighth Grade basketball class which won the Elementary tournament, was smaller than usual, eleven girls and eleven boys finished the course. All intend to come to high school this fall. Community interest in school affairs has increased. Sometimes the crowds at events such as our Open House and the Operetta were almost more than we could take care of. The P.T.A. has functioned all year and has ambitious plans for the future. They sponsored the hot lunch program, purchased a large electric refrigerator for the lunch room and have started raising money to install better lighting in the elementary building. The T.V.A. are supervising the planning of this improvement. In addition to new lights it calls for new paint in the class rooms of the elementary school building. The county, will pay for the paint but the P.T.A. must put it on. Different things have been done to raise the money. The Lions Club helped materially when they gave two performances of the "Womanless Wedding" for the benefit of the fund. A bow supper, a bingo party, and rummage sales have all been held but there is still much to be raised. Farm We are gradually building up our herd of cattle from the jersey calves born on the place. We have milk for our own use and in these days of butter shortages feel rich in that we can churn our own butter. Carl, the farm man, is good with poultry. We produce all of our own eggs, sell many dozens to the Mountain View Hotel, have chicken for the table and supply the hotel with some fryers in the summer time. During the highest producing month we sold 2692/3 dozen eggs to the hotel. This number dropped to 68 dozen in the lowest producing month. This spring much time has been spent on repairing the fences around the different lots. We used a lot of old wire and for posts the men went to the woods on the hills back of the place. They dragged down fallen chestnut logs and in some cases felled young trees. Our garden supplies us with all sorts of fresh vegetables, potatoes enough to last through the winter, tomatoes and beans for canning and berries in season. We sell some surplus that would otherwise spoil. Dormitory We have had four boys and six girls for Most of the year in residence at the school. Three of the girls graduated this spring. One is already married to a returned soldier, one will go on to school and the third one will possibly go to business college. Again this year most of the money owed to the school hasbeen paid. Last year every account was settled before school started in the fall, sometimes with money the student had earned during the summer. I expect that to be the case this year. Stuart Dormitory has been the scene of a number of parties planned and given by the girls and boys. The town children seem to like to come there for school affairs. Our own young people gain confidence in themselves as they play the part of hostesses. Arrowcraft Changes have also taken place in this department, the chief one of these being that Miss Meta Schattschneider has replaced Miss Gene Redding as de-signer and weaving supervisor. Gene had been such a part of the weaving program for so many years that her successor had to be chosen with care. We feel that Miss Meta has been a very wise choice. She has gained the friendship and confidence of the weavers to a marked degree. Her new designs are distinctive. They are gradually getting into production and are meeting with public approval. Since all threads have gone up in price and living costs are so much higher it has been necessary to raise our prices to meet these costs when that is possible under OPA rulings. The value of our products is unquestioned, the demand almost unlimited while the quantity that can be produced is definitely limited by the very factor that produces their value--"Made By Hand." In February 1946 the weavers' checks amounted to $3,376.09, the highest amount ever written for one month. During that same month the monthly average of weavers working was 83.96 which was only about 3 points under the highest number of weavers working in any one month of the year. Mrs. Snow has tried hard to satisfy the clubs and to keep both of our local shops supplied with at-tractive merchandise. At times this has been almost impossible. By last autumn the shelves in the stock room were almost bare while bouquets of beautiful colored leaves in large containers could not cover up the fact that our stock was very low. Health Center Another year of service to the community has been added to the fine record that Mrs. Chalmers has made as the Pi Phi nurse. Her duties are so varied that it is always difficult to enumerate all of them. Routine inspections of the school children, inoculations, hours devoted to a weekly clinic day, class room talks on home nursing and home visits are just a few of the things that she takes as a matter of course. They all help to make the people of the community healthier and happier. It has helped make the work of the nurse easier to have a young doctor in town. He is just out of the army and is becoming well established. The new projector, gift of Chicago North Alumnae Club, has added interest to class room instruction. The children in the rural schools have especially enjoyed the little movies and health pictures. Sigma Phi Gamma has again contributed to our work. Mrs. Chalmers was asked to attend a Polio re-fresher course at Monteagle, Tennessee this month. Here the latest equipment for fighting this disease was demonstrated and plans for organizing the community, in case of an epidemic, were worked out. This invitation came as the natural result of the school she had attended at Warm Springs, Georgia last year. We at the school have appreciated the many gifts THE SEPTEMBER ARROW by actives, alumnae clubs, and individual Pi Phis. know that a rummage sale in far off Oregon, azine subscriptions solicited by some club chair-. in the middle west, clever benefits arranged by sge girls or alumnae clubs, and the sale of Arrow-t products all represent thought, time and effort :he part of our members. The school benefits and I know that the individuals experience a satisfaction in working for our project. Personally the unselfish devotion of Committee and Grand Council Members to the work of the School is a constant inspiration to me. I thank you for it.

TYPE OF WORK PREFERRED ARROWCRAFT SHOP STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENSES Year Ended June 30, 1946 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Committee Reports COMMITTEE FOR WAR WORK 111 N PRESENTING this report it will be recalled that the report of last year covered all contributions and disbursements of Physical Therapy Scholarships up to August 1, 1945. With V-J Day which followed so soon and the subsequent end to the war emergency, no further solicitation of funds for these scholarships was made. Contributions have come in through the year and additional scholarships have been awarded. Since this report will close with the chairman's recommendation that the committee be dissolved, having served its purpose, it seems altogether fitting that a brief resume of Pi Beta Phi's war work, year by year, should follow: 1. In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.OG to the Red Cross $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed more than fifteen thou sand dollars and up to August 1, 1945, 38 scholar-ships were awarded. 5. With V-J Day, Grand Council agreed with the committee that there should be no further solicitation for funds for this war project, but even so, contributions of nearly $1,400.00 were received this year from clubs and chapters; ten additional girls received scholarships; and three young women who were completing their courses too late to receive commissions in the Army or Navy received supple-mental scholarships to help them through their professional period of readjustment. 6. In addition, Grand Council requested the Committee for War Work of secure a record of Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the war effort this to be reduCed as nearly as possible to the number of working hours spent in war work activities by Pi Phis everywhere in active chapters, alumnae clubs, and those Pi Phis not identified with any group. These reports have been based o'n questionnaires tabulated by Ann McDonald D'Aule for active chapters; Ruth Jane Dunlap Wheeler for alumnae clubs; and Mary Foley for Canadian clubs and chapters. Their reports represent a most significant compilation of facts, and an infinite amount of work. Listed below are the contributions and disbursements of the past year which concern the wind up of Pi Phi's own war project.

        9-4 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Next year, our physical education director will also serve to fill a position vacant throughout the war-period, that of "house-father" for the dormitory boys. The Music Supervisor, also new this year, and a very evident and splendid addition to our staff, gave regular periods each week to all grade school children, who showed great love and remarkable aptitude for all taught them. The third grade gave a demonstration at a Sevier County Teachers meeting, two grades gave programs for the Weavers meetings, there were numerous appearances at regular school chapel* programs, students from the upper three grades formed an elementary school chorus, and the lower five grades combined to present an operetta, "A Rose Dream," praised by all who saw it as one of the loveliest of its kind. This regular music education experience in the grades, begun first during the second semester of the 1944-45 school year, should, in a few years, eliminate the condition now found in the High School where work with the chorus and glee clubs is severely handicapped because the students lack knowledge in sight-reading. Supervision of art work was given in all grades above the third by the Arts and Crafts teacher. Classes once a week included such fundamental instructions as use of the ruler and compass, with which most of the children had had no previous experience, and concluded with the making of beaver board tiles and coasters. Special grade school projects included the making of a New England village at Thanksgiving time with its log houses, church, and trees; and a creche at Christmas time, their first experience with clay and to many their first knowledge of a creche. As Miss Petrie writes, Baby Jesus slightly resembles the baby sister of its maker, fourth grade Philip Huff, but "to me, who watched these children work, it is beautiful and sweet." Seventh and eighth grade and high school girls were enrolled in regular craft classes meeting in the Emma Harper Turner Craft Center the old Arrow-craft Shop moved and shingled outside and since last ' convention rather considerably improved by new flooring, celotex walls and ceiling, a partition between the weaving and woodworking rooms, and an interior paint job. Here color and design instructions, card weaving, puppetry and all types of four-harness weaving were thoroughly enjoyed. This class combined with the English department to present puppet shows, such as "Haensel and Gretel," and one with the assistance of the Health Center, stressing health habits using the story of the "Three Bears" as a vehicle. High School boys have met with a part-time instructor for regular daily classes in wood-working the last two years, and the 7th and 8th grade boys three times a week the last year. Besides making the puppet stage and several small table looms for the craft classes, the boys made splendid progress in smaller wooden articles. Next year it is hoped another lathe and spraying machine may be added to the equipment and the attic room remodeled to make a finishing-room. Paramount in all work of the Craft Department is the basic consideration that everything taught be of practical value to the children in their own home. This Pi Phi addition to the curriculum seems a wise provision to safeguard the future of handcrafts in this area as well as provide future workers for Arrowcraft. School Future As to the future of our part of the joint county-Pi Phi educational program at ,Gatlinburg, there is every indication that the County will need our assistance for sometime to come, even though they will continue to cooperate to the limit of their ability. Their taxes are already high, but they expect to have to raise them to secure funds for the new grade school building. Even so, the County Superintendent is hopeful they can also secure federal funds, else he fears the amount available will not be adequate to build the type of school desired not only by them but also by Pi Beta Phi, whose approval of the plans is a provision of the lease-agreement. It may well be that in order to insure the building of a school that will be a satisfactory complement to our property, Pi Beta Phi may need to follow Dr. Taylor's advice and either contribute to it ourselves or arouse the Gatlinburg citizens to assist financially with this project. The grade school building returns to Pi Beta Phi when a new building is ready for occupancy, and can then be converted to other needs. A definite decision has not yet been made but the suggestion of Miss Dyer that this be remodeled into a lounge and dining-room for summer Workshop students is worth consideration, as well as its use in the regular Summer Workshop program for additional class-rooms. The County has been ' able to raise salaries considerably during the war period by assistance from Lanham Act funds, made available to them because of their nearness to Oak Ridge and the Alcoa plant. That these will continue even next year is not an established fact, which raises a question as to the County's ability to maintain satisfactory teaching personnel for even the number they are now providing. Any increase in number of teachers provided by them is entirely dependent on comparative needs with other county schools, and the outlook for any immediate increase is extremely doubtful. That they can assume any shareof the three departments Pi Beta Phi is now contributing at any time in the near future is most unlikely, and it is even uncertain they could do so at any time, without assistance from some outside source. Gatlinburg itself may grow because of tourist trade, but the character of the country outside the village limits is such that it is largely dependent upon poor farms for sustenance and handcrafts for income. The Southern Conference of Mountain Workers estimated that the yearly cash income of farmers in the nearby community is as low as $80.00 a year. Gatlinburg support of the school program was the highest it has been this past year. An active PTA furnished, with federal assistance, a fine hot lunch program, even clearing enough to purchase much needed equipment for continued' operation. They aroused the Lions Club to the need for better lighting in the grade school and are raising funds for fluorescent lights to be installed in the present Pi Phi building and removed later to the new county building. This indication of interest in the betterment of the School by local Gatlinburg organizations may bring further contributions of a substantial nature; but the exact extent of regular support is at present very much a question. Gatlinburg has incorporated and is concluding its first full year under a City Manager and Council of three members. Their first project, just completed, was a topographical survey of the town, funds for which were raised by a tax on hotels and tourist courts based on the number of guests they accommodate. Besides the financing of the City Manager's office the present Gatlinburg funds are expended almost entirely for police protection, a vital need in THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 95 a tourist community and one which is even yet poorly met. Their immediate future projects include a city water system and sewage disposal plant. These are to be started this coming summer, it is hoped, financed by bonds soon to be floated. There has been some discussion of a Community Building as the project for consideration after these are completed, but definite plans are dependent upon a variety of conditions including location of a site and the securing of federal funds. Gatlinburg has grown in the period since last Convention. An anticipated drop in tourist visitors due to the war did not materialize, due probably to the nearness of Oak Ridge with its government employees to whom gasoline was furnished for necessary buying in nearby cities, and to others from Knoxville and even farther distances who came and stayed for several weeks because of curtailment of travel. If Gatlinburg is able to build wisely and if contemplated additions to the Smoky Mountain Park and the routing of new highways through other Park entrances does not dissipate their tourist trade, it is altogether probable that Gatlinburg will continue to grow toward a substantial community. For the immediate future there are so many crying needs demanding attention that support of an educational pro-gram does not seem possible of inclusion. Without Pi Beta Phi's continued assistance the schools would suffdr a most severe relapse. Housing A part of our contribution which rightfully belongs with the educational system but which is not an integral part of the school itself is the housing unit. Teachers Cottage houses the office of the Director, a position filled since last convention by Eunice Weaver, who resigned because of ill-health in March, 1941 after seven years with the School; Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, who served two years until family obligations called her to New York; and since then our present capable and delightful Ruth Dyer. This spring a North Carolina recent graduate, Helen Borgstrom, joined the staff as Assistant to the Director. Teachers Cottage also serves as home for most of our resident staff and for those teachers, county paid, whose homes are away from Gatlinburg. Prior to the war members of Pi Beta Phi averaged 50% of the teaching staff. That this has dropped to zero is the fault largely of war wage-levels with which Sevier County could not compete. It is our hope that as conditions adjust (if they do!) we can again interest our own members in this opportunity to serve and gain rich experience, since we are privileged by conditions of the lease-agreement to keep half of the staff Pi Beta Phi's. It is our belief that Pi Beta Phi's can contribute greatly to the school system, though the caliber of teachers maintained through the war period has been extremely fine when we take into consideration their scarcity in rural communities throughout the country. The two dormitories house High School students who could not secure their education without the assistance provided by our arrangement which re-quires payment of $5.00 cash monthly for room and board plus 96 hours of work done by each student. Stuart Dormitory has been built since last convention. Made possible through a bequest from Anne Stuart, former Grand Treasurer, it was completed in 1941 and constitutes a lovely home with its twin living-rooms used for all dormitory student socialaffairs, its first floor suite, and five double and one single room on the second and third floors. Built as a boy's dormitory to replace the former most inadequate building, it has been used for girls the past two years, with the permission of Mary Stuart Kinder. Pollard Cottage now serves as boy's dormitory. One of the oldest buildings on the place, it is in constant need of repair to keep it even presentable. The lower floor houses the kitchen and dining rooms for staff and dormitory students. As second on our list of "musts" for our future program is some re-placement of this building. Now being considered by our architect is a new Staff Residence to house those now living at Teachers Cottage, and including a new modern kitchen and pleasant dining-rooms. Teachers Cottage could then be used as a student dormitory, and Pollard Cottage would serve as housing for some of the staff members. Demonstration Farm Complementary to the housing unit is the Pi Beta Phi demonstration farm. Formerly under the direction of an agricultural teacher, since 1943 it has been in charge of an ex-student of Berea College's agriculture course. During the nine-month school year the dormitory boys work before and after school hours. A small herd of registered jersey cattle, a few pure-bred hogs and a sizeable flock of chickens constitute the live stock on our Pi Phi farm. Begun years ago when Pi Phi gifts brought "Ring Ching Ching" and "Texas" to Gatlinburg, our pure-bred strains have raised the standard of stock in the Gatlinburg community. Vegetables from the garden, milk, cream, butter, eggs and chicken provide the raw materials for the excellent meals served under the guidance of the House Manager; and the surplus is always eagerly purchased by one of the Gatlinburg hotels or stores. 2692/3 dozen eggs were sold during the peak producing month this past year. Additional income is made by the renting of Pi Beta Phi's team of mules, the "horsepower" for plowing, hauling wood and other such farm chores. Health Center The Health Center remains much as it was in 1940 a busy, interesting place with Marjorie Chalmers completing ten years as the competent, kindly nurse in charge. Her reports show an average of 1500 home calls, 2000 office calls and as many surgical dressings a year. The number of inoculations runs over 800 a year, and an average of 2000 school children are given routine physical inspections annually. This year a projector and screen given by Chicago North, and usable with electric current or storage battery, has provided the means for increasing interest in health education talks not only in Gatlinburg but in rural communities as well. Pre-school Round-ups with a Dental Hygienist and Nutritionist from the State Health Department are annual affairs, and this year saw two dental clinics and a promise of longer time for Gatlinburg next year. Special and specific assistance has been given in many types of corrective work, glasses, braces and special shoes being donated by other agencies through our Health Center. Mrs. Chalmers was selected as the recipient of a scholarship given by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis for a special course given last summer at Warm Springs, Ga., and has just completed 6 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW five day refresher course on polio treatment at fonteagle, Tenn. The building now known as the Jennie Nicol [ealth Center is really unsafe for use, due to the wages of time and termites. Preliminary sketches for new Health Center have already been approved and is hoped that work can soon be started on this inch-needed building. It will contain a nurse's office; .inic or first-aid. room; a work-room with cupboards, Ilk, electric oven for sterilization needs; and a large ass-room and adjoining bath for use in the teaching Home Nursing classes as part of the adult educaon program which remains one of the important inctions of the Health Center. A doctor has recently established an office in 4tlinburg, and will considerably reduce the number E' a certain type of demands on our nurse. Her work assistant in the birth of new babies has also lesmed as more and more of the mothers secure doctor's ire for this common occurrence in the area. Howver, the burden of the physical examinations of :udents in our own schools and in the nearby rural :hools not visited by any county nurse or doctor, le regular emergency and first-aid treatments among le students in Gatlinburg and the weavers and thers who still trust only the Pi Phi Nurse, the ioculations, Well-Baby Clinics, and the approxiiately 1500 home calls a year, still means a full :hedule for this member of our staff. !rrowcraft Arrowcraft's year may be summed up in the opening mtence of the report of our excellent Manager, thel Snow: "The year just past should have brought )e alum= clubs and Arrowcraft more closely to-ether than ever before. I am sure we have had the ine thwarted feeling, that opportunity to sell so such more than it was possible to produce." Production levels have been maintained and even icreased each year since last convention. Last year a )tal of 127 weavers were on the Arrowcraft rolls, rith 80 of them working six months or more of aat time, and an average of 80 weavers working at ray one time. Checks totalling $27,647.11 were given weavers for work done from May first of last year May of this. A comparative study showed that last year the [um= clubs received the same percentage of Arrow-raft's output that they had received in 1941, the nal amount increasing from $35,428.18 to 43,701.27, not including an increase in discount from 5 to 20% during that time. Of the remaining suply the 1941 sales showed some $6,000 going to rholesalers. This type of business has been dras-:cally curtailed the last few years, with the con-:nuance only of a limited amount sent to the Southern lighland Handicraft Guild and Southern Highmders shops in Rockefeller Center, Asheville, Nor-[s Dam and Big Meadows. This has been necessary ecause of an understanding with these organizations a which Arrowcraft holds membership. The remaining sales are entered on the books as Cash Sales" but should not be considered entirely s non-Pi Phi tourist sales, since this includes a ansiderable but indeterminable number of sales made Pi Phi's in the Arrowcraft Shop, and all mail rder sales not sent to an alumnae club on consign-lent. One other factor is important in this analysis nd that is that the local Arrowcraft Shop often dislays those items not popular with alumnae clubs andis also used to unload those slightly irregular articles which are good but cannot be sent in alumna club Orders because of variation in size, color, etc. The many problems of distribution for a stock that is unpredictable in amount available at any one time and in total amount, and for which the bulk of the orders arrive at approximately the same time were of real concern to our Arrowcraft staff. Part of this may be removed this coming year by the necessity of a raise in prices on all Arrowcraft articles. This has been needed for some time but OPA regulations to which Arrowcraft strictly adhered prohibited any change except on new items. Now prices may be raised for the same article if cost of production has increased. And you would know, of course, that they have. Not only has the price of threads and yarns been raised by the mills, but effective now is a drop from a former 25% cash discount to a 10% cash discount. Also the weavers are being paid more for their work, as is certainly not out of line with present conditions, especially since one of the primary reasons for Arrow-craft is the financial assistance to women who could not earn in other ways either because of personal attributes or family restrictions. Technically speaking, our weavers are not employees since we require no speed of performance, nor do we dictate any working conditions such as number of hours or date of delivery; they weave at home articles for which we advance the necessary materials and sell the finished product to Arrowcraft. Governmental interpretation of the term "employees" however, indicates a probable inclusion of them under some sort of minimum wage regulations. After an original flurry in 1940, during which some government investigation was made, we were told to continue as previously until further notice. This past fall we were asked to make a survey of a number of our weavers, ascertaining speed of work, and reducing their pay, which is figured by us according to a piece rate, to an average rate per hour. The results showed an average pay of 42 cents an hour for the thirty weavers selected from among those working on various types of weaving and with varying abilities. It is uncertain yet what their application of the Fair Standards Act will be, which as you know is under consideration for a change from the present 40 cent minimum to at least a 55 cent minimum. The results of any necessitated raise in pay to the weavers would automatically include some further raise in selling prices. The outlook for fall, then, would indicate a possible wider variety of articles than last year, many of these lovely new designs of our "Miss Meta," a considerable raise in prices, but no definite promise of a greater over-all quantity than was available last year, since the increasing of production is beyond our control. By staggering club orders over a longer period of time, it might be possible for our Arrowcraft Manager to send a little more on those particular orders which arrived so close together last year that all must be proportionately filled from the same month's de-liveries to the Shop. That she can completely fill any orders if they maintain the same high as last year will be an impossibility that she and Committee regret fully as much, if not more, than the disappointed clubs. Miss Meta Schattschneider, whom we were fortunate enough to secure as Weaving Supervisor upon the resignation last fall of Winogene Redding, who had served so capably for twenty years, has already THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 97 made a very definite contribution through her lovely designs of interesting color combinations, and her ability to work with and for others. She has written three articles to appear in as many issues of Design magazine, the first of which features Arrowcraft and our Summer Workshop. Summer Workshop. The Summer Workshop as such is perhaps a new idea, although the basis for it came out of suggestions made by both Dean Holton and Dr. Taylor when they advised us to develop the Arts and Crafts field of our Settlement School as we gave added responsibility in other educational fields to the County or community. Future possibilities in such a program were outlined by them and enlarged by the former Settlement School Chairman, Ethel Copp, and the Arts and Crafts Advisory Committee inaugurated in her term of office and consisting of Miss Jessie Harris, Head of the Home Economics Department, Miss Ida Anders and Miss Marian Heard, instructors in textiles and crafts at the University of Tennessee. The only immediate practical application of this idea seemed to be the founding of the Summer Work-shop in the summer of 1945 with the University of Tennessee offering graduate and post-graduate credit for courses in weaving, textile decoration, recreational crafts, woodworking, and community recreation taught by a staff selected jointly by the University and Pi Beta Phi. Headed by the well-known originator of the Milwaukee Handicraft Project, Miss Elsa Ulbricht, this group of four excellent craftsmen was enthusiastically followed in a program of classes and laboratory periods which lasted from eight to six and even spilled over into evening hours because of sheer enjoyment in the creation of crafts articles of assorted types and materials. At one of the two open houses marking the end of each three-week period, Miss Onken dedicated the Arts and Crafts Building to Emma Harper Turner in recognition of her efforts toward founding the Settlement School and her continued interest in it through-out her lifetime. The Grand Council and Settlement School Committee and the University of Tennessee Committee in charge were agreed that the first Summer Workshop exceeded all expectations. Students from nineteen states were of unusual caliber, including State Directors of Industrial Arts, Home Demonstration Agents, and Craft Teachers. The program for this summer follows very much the same pattern, as last with Miss Ulbricht and Miss Marian Heard of the University acting as co-directors and with metalcraft added to the curriculum. Four board and room scholarships were offered two to Pi Beta Phis and two to the University of Tennessee students, the recipients to live at the School with another Pi Phi, Carolyn Buck, who will attend classes part-time and take charge of a light luncheon to be prepared and served to the students in the Home Economics room of the High School. Twenty-seven advance registrations to date insure a capacity enrollment this year. There is every indication that if Pi Beta Phi is interested in development of this plan it can be built into a Craft School of considerable prominence. Gatlinburg is an ideal setting, and it is located in the midst of one of the best centers of American handcrafts. Held in the summer it allows use of the High School and Craft Centerbuildings during months when they would otherwise be idle, and makes possible the securing of outstanding craft teachers who hold other positions during winter months. We have land on which summer dormitories and any additional buildings needed could be placed; and the possibilities for broadening the curriculum are numerous, including play production with actual experience before tourist audiences, study and experience in the merchandising of craft articles, and development of the community recreation course to include experience in a well-rounded program of activities using Settlement School facilities. This is an enlargement of our former program of cultivation of the crafts of the Smoky Mountains and specifically the Gatlinburg community, to the furtherance and development of craft education throughout the country by offering excellent instruction in this field to a college-level student body. Through the stimulus and insniration of these Workshops there should result a raising of the quality of craft work in Gatlinburg itself and finally, we hope, the interesting of craft leaders in affiliating themselves with our project in a permanent way that would insure their cooperation with Arrowcraft to open new avenues of income for the handcraft workers of Pi Beta Phi. There is no question but that the immediate needs in Gatlinburg are for continued assistance in the regular school curriculum, for a Health Center pro-gram similar to the present one, for the maintenance of high standards in Arrowcraft production and the marketing of these to insure financial assistance for those who need this means of income ; but as we are able to develop the Summer Workshop project we will be laying the foundation for a future expansion of our enterprise on a basis which should eventually be self-supporting and in a way equally important to Gatlinburg and the future of crafts. If this report has helped to bring to you a picture of the whole project known as the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as it exists at present, with some indication of possible future developments, it has accomplished its purpose. It has been a real privilege and pleasure to serve the past four years on the Settlement School Committee, to work closely with the other members who during that time have included Ethel Copp, Beth Le Roy, Lolita. Prouty, Ann Munn, Emma Woerner and Eugenia Smith, and the new member just beginning her five year term of office, Carlene Holly; to know the understanding and Inspirational assistance of Grand Council and its contact member to our Committee, the Grand President; and to assist to the best of our ability in the many details and constantly changing matters for consideration that make the work at the Settlement School a real task and sometimes a real worry, but always, in spite of this, a real joy also in the knowledge that there Pi Beta Phi is doing such a constructive piece of philanthropy that Edwin Foscue writing of Gatlin-burg in the "Economic Geography" devotes consider-able space to the part played by the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, saying in one instance: "This mountain community, nearly a century and a half old; completely isolated from the rest of the country for more than a century, became known first through the lumbering industry and later through the establishment of a Settlement School" and again: "the Gatlinburg community is certainly indebted to the Fraternity for the work of the school in the community." MILDRED SALE, Chairman 98 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR TIME moves swifter than a weaver's shuttle, even one in the experienced hands of a Pi Phi weaver. The terrible war is over with people everywhere be-ginning to talk of memorials to be erected honoring war heroes. Many agree that the day of statues is past and that living memorials will best express the gratitude flowing from our hearts. Pi Beta Phi had such an idea in mind when the Settlement School was founded, not to honor war heroes but our be-loved founders. Through the years the natural beauty all around us, orderly living, willing service to bodies, minds, and hearts has gone steadily forward enriching the lives of many. Changes come but by constant adjustments we can continue to serve the Gatlinburg Community. Community This year has marked the passing of two good friends of the School. Charlie Ogle died in December of 1945 and Aunt Lizzie Reagan in March of 1946. They are missed, for both filled a place in the life of the village that was a unique one. This summer of 1946 finds Gatlinburg's main street much changed by the addition of a number of new buildings. The Ogle store has been changed into a Super-Market. The drug stock was moved across the street to the old Annex, now the bus depot. The Log Cabin has been razed. On that site construction on a large new structure which is to _house a movie theater, several shops with office rooms above is well started. The Methodist congregation has the foundation laid for a stone chapel. This is to be located on the hill above the Cliff Dwellers Shop on a lot donated to them by Mr. and Mrs. Jones. Mr. Barber is the architect. His design is most attractive in the pictures. Ray Whaley, back from the service, has built a new hotel named Edge Park Inn on land between the Riverside and the New Gatlinburg Inn. It has twenty-five guest rooms and the dining room is to accommodate two hundred. Earl Ogle has erected an office building for the new doctor adjacent to the Ogle Store, Along the river, Mrs. Allen, of Laurel Springs resort, built two attractive shops on the highway side. They do cut off a lovely view of the river, a circumstance that seems a pity. A number of other business places have been enlarged, smaller shops and eating stands have been erected all along the highway! The main street is fast becoming that of a typical resort town. The effects of incorporation of the village which was voted last year are not yet very apparent. A large, detailed map of the area and preliminary surveys for water and sewer lines have been made by the city manager and his staff. The council spent much time formulating various ordinances governing the operation and taxation of different businesses. In this town they are almost exclusively devoted to the tourist trade. Some added police protection has been secured. This is used mostly to control traffic and disturbances due to liquor. School Many problems have come up during the year with changes in personnel in the teaching staff in some grades a major one. Fortunately we had several strong teachers, and were able to manage somehow with substitutes and end the year with the required work completed. It was again necessary to have one room in which we had two grades. The Elementarybuilding was so crowded that the beginners were placed over in the back room at the high school building. In the high school there was a change in the English teacher at the end of the first semester. Miss Fenn wished to go to Columbia for further work in Library Science. We were fortunate in securing Mrs. Ann Lighter for the position. She has recently moved to town, she and her husband own a home here. She has taught English and best of all had charge of all High School libraries in the state of Michigan for two years prior to her marriage. She is a real addition to the staff. She coached the successful senior play, "He Couldn't Marry Five." The work of the three teachers supplied by the fraternity to supplement the County program added much to the enjoyment of the students as well as giving them something of value in Music, Physical Education and Crafts. Mrs. Stanley Armstrong used the old Agriculture room for her class room for the music work. The children responded well to her excellent teaching. The Grade School Operetta, Rose Dream, was one of the best that I have seen here. She trained a chorus from the sixth, seventh and eighth grades that delighted everyone with their singing at the Elementary School graduation program. The Glee Club did very well at the various Commencement events. Mr. Don Spargo, as Phyiscal Education instructor, worked hard with the students in regular classes as well as coaching both a boys and girls team in basket ball. Our victories were not too many for we were pitted against teams of much more experience and from larger schools but the spirit was fine. Through donations from various business houses and individual friends a fund of $351.00, was secured for new warm-up jackets for the boys team. These were ordered last December but to date have not been de-livered due to shortages of materials. When our teams played away from home they reflected credit upon their coach and the school. In the craft department Miss Elizabeth Petrie worked with the grade school children and the girls in the high school craft class while Mr. Carl Huskey devoted two hours in the morning to the boys teaching wood working. The boys made a number of small looms that were used by the girls in the simpler types of weaving. The boys also made the wooden stage for a puppet theater; the girls wove the little curtains and made the , puppets. Several shows were given to very appreciative audiences. One play was the "Three Bears" with health problems woven into the story by one of the girls, "Hansel and Gretel" with music rforn the opera was given at Open House. The weaving done by the girls was of exceptionally good quality both in design and in workmanship. Home Economics instruction included work in nutrition, sewing, and designing of clothes for the girls themselves and work for various relief agencies. One class cleaned and decorated one room at the school to be used as a future rest room for the girls. A course in home nursing resulted in the girls being given the Red Cross awards for completing the regular course. In this work Miss Landrum has a very good opportunity to teach the girls many things in personal grooming, clothing care, suitability of dress, good manners and ways of entertaining. When our Gatlinburg girls go to any other town they are THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 99 always complimented upon their excellent appearance. We graduated a class of sixteen seniors. A number of them expect to go on for more training. The class made their annual trip to Atlanta, had the usual banquet tendered them by the Juniors and gave their class night program before Commencement. The speakers were good at both the Baccalaureate and Commencement programs. We have had good cooperation from the Sevier County authorities but have been hampered all year by the war time shortages of repair materials needed for buildings, furnaces, etc. The county constructed a new brick smoke stack to the large boiler room and paid for half of a new incinerator to take care of waste paper from the school. Mr. Kelley Huskey coached a team of girls in Sevierville for schools of their size. His Eighth Grade basketball class which won the Elementary tournament, was smaller than usual, eleven girls and eleven boys finished the course. All intend to come to high school this fall. Community interest in school affairs has increased. Sometimes the crowds at events such as our Open House and the Operetta were almost more than we could take care of. The P.T.A. has functioned all year and has ambitious plans for the future. They sponsored the hot lunch program, purchased a large electric refrigerator for the lunch room and have started raising money to install better lighting in the elementary building. The T.V.A. are supervising the planning of this improvement. In addition to new lights it calls for new paint in the class rooms of the elementary school building. The county, will pay for the paint but the P.T.A. must put it on. Different things have been done to raise the money. The Lions Club helped materially when they gave two performances of the "Womanless Wedding" for the benefit of the fund. A bow supper, a bingo party, and rummage sales have all been held but there is still much to be raised. Farm We are gradually building up our herd of cattle from the jersey calves born on the place. We have milk for our own use and in these days of butter shortages feel rich in that we can churn our own butter. Carl, the farm man, is good with poultry. We produce all of our own eggs, sell many dozens to the Mountain View Hotel, have chicken for the table and supply the hotel with some fryers in the summer time. During the highest producing month we sold 2692/3 dozen eggs to the hotel. This number dropped to 68 dozen in the lowest producing month. This spring much time has been spent on repairing the fences around the different lots. We used a lot of old wire and for posts the men went to the woods on the hills back of the place. They dragged down fallen chestnut logs and in some cases felled young trees. Our garden supplies us with all sorts of fresh vegetables, potatoes enough to last through the winter, tomatoes and beans for canning and berries in season. We sell some surplus that would otherwise spoil. Dormitory We have had four boys and six girls for Most of the year in residence at the school. Three of the girls graduated this spring. One is already married to a returned soldier, one will go on to school and the third one will possibly go to business college. Again this year most of the money owed to the school hasbeen paid. Last year every account was settled before school started in the fall, sometimes with money the student had earned during the summer. I expect that to be the case this year. Stuart Dormitory has been the scene of a number of parties planned and given by the girls and boys. The town children seem to like to come there for school affairs. Our own young people gain confidence in themselves as they play the part of hostesses. Arrowcraft Changes have also taken place in this department, the chief one of these being that Miss Meta Schattschneider has replaced Miss Gene Redding as de-signer and weaving supervisor. Gene had been such a part of the weaving program for so many years that her successor had to be chosen with care. We feel that Miss Meta has been a very wise choice. She has gained the friendship and confidence of the weavers to a marked degree. Her new designs are distinctive. They are gradually getting into production and are meeting with public approval. Since all threads have gone up in price and living costs are so much higher it has been necessary to raise our prices to meet these costs when that is possible under OPA rulings. The value of our products is unquestioned, the demand almost unlimited while the quantity that can be produced is definitely limited by the very factor that produces their value--"Made By Hand." In February 1946 the weavers' checks amounted to $3,376.09, the highest amount ever written for one month. During that same month the monthly average of weavers working was 83.96 which was only about 3 points under the highest number of weavers working in any one month of the year. Mrs. Snow has tried hard to satisfy the clubs and to keep both of our local shops supplied with at-tractive merchandise. At times this has been almost impossible. By last autumn the shelves in the stock room were almost bare while bouquets of beautiful colored leaves in large containers could not cover up the fact that our stock was very low. Health Center Another year of service to the community has been added to the fine record that Mrs. Chalmers has made as the Pi Phi nurse. Her duties are so varied that it is always difficult to enumerate all of them. Routine inspections of the school children, inoculations, hours devoted to a weekly clinic day, class room talks on home nursing and home visits are just a few of the things that she takes as a matter of course. They all help to make the people of the community healthier and happier. It has helped make the work of the nurse easier to have a young doctor in town. He is just out of the army and is becoming well established. The new projector, gift of Chicago North Alumnae Club, has added interest to class room instruction. The children in the rural schools have especially enjoyed the little movies and health pictures. Sigma Phi Gamma has again contributed to our work. Mrs. Chalmers was asked to attend a Polio re-fresher course at Monteagle, Tennessee this month. Here the latest equipment for fighting this disease was demonstrated and plans for organizing the community, in case of an epidemic, were worked out. This invitation came as the natural result of the school she had attended at Warm Springs, Georgia last year. We at the school have appreciated the many gifts THE SEPTEMBER ARROW by actives, alumnae clubs, and individual Pi Phis. know that a rummage sale in far off Oregon, azine subscriptions solicited by some club chair-. in the middle west, clever benefits arranged by sge girls or alumnae clubs, and the sale of Arrow-t products all represent thought, time and effort :he part of our members. The school benefits and I know that the individuals experience a satisfaction in working for our project. Personally the unselfish devotion of Committee and Grand Council Members to the work of the School is a constant inspiration to me. I thank you for it.

TYPE OF WORK PREFERRED ARROWCRAFT SHOP STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENSES Year Ended June 30, 1946 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Committee Reports COMMITTEE FOR WAR WORK 111 N PRESENTING this report it will be recalled that the report of last year covered all contributions and disbursements of Physical Therapy Scholarships up to August 1, 1945. With V-J Day which followed so soon and the subsequent end to the war emergency, no further solicitation of funds for these scholarships was made. Contributions have come in through the year and additional scholarships have been awarded. Since this report will close with the chairman's recommendation that the committee be dissolved, having served its purpose, it seems altogether fitting that a brief resume of Pi Beta Phi's war work, year by year, should follow: 1. In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.OG to the Red Cross $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed more than fifteen thou sand dollars and up to August 1, 1945, 38 scholar-ships were awarded. 5. With V-J Day, Grand Council agreed with the committee that there should be no further solicitation for funds for this war project, but even so, contributions of nearly $1,400.00 were received this year from clubs and chapters; ten additional girls received scholarships; and three young women who were completing their courses too late to receive commissions in the Army or Navy received supple-mental scholarships to help them through their professional period of readjustment. 6. In addition, Grand Council requested the Committee for War Work of secure a record of Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the war effort this to be reduCed as nearly as possible to the number of working hours spent in war work activities by Pi Phis everywhere in active chapters, alumnae clubs, and those Pi Phis not identified with any group. These reports have been based o'n questionnaires tabulated by Ann McDonald D'Aule for active chapters; Ruth Jane Dunlap Wheeler for alumnae clubs; and Mary Foley for Canadian clubs and chapters. Their reports represent a most significant compilation of facts, and an infinite amount of work. Listed below are the contributions and disbursements of the past year which concern the wind up of Pi Phi's own war project.

        6 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW five day refresher course on polio treatment at fonteagle, Tenn. The building now known as the Jennie Nicol [ealth Center is really unsafe for use, due to the wages of time and termites. Preliminary sketches for new Health Center have already been approved and is hoped that work can soon be started on this inch-needed building. It will contain a nurse's office; .inic or first-aid. room; a work-room with cupboards, Ilk, electric oven for sterilization needs; and a large ass-room and adjoining bath for use in the teaching Home Nursing classes as part of the adult educaon program which remains one of the important inctions of the Health Center. A doctor has recently established an office in 4tlinburg, and will considerably reduce the number E' a certain type of demands on our nurse. Her work assistant in the birth of new babies has also lesmed as more and more of the mothers secure doctor's ire for this common occurrence in the area. Howver, the burden of the physical examinations of :udents in our own schools and in the nearby rural :hools not visited by any county nurse or doctor, le regular emergency and first-aid treatments among le students in Gatlinburg and the weavers and thers who still trust only the Pi Phi Nurse, the ioculations, Well-Baby Clinics, and the approxiiately 1500 home calls a year, still means a full :hedule for this member of our staff. !rrowcraft Arrowcraft's year may be summed up in the opening mtence of the report of our excellent Manager, thel Snow: "The year just past should have brought )e alum= clubs and Arrowcraft more closely to-ether than ever before. I am sure we have had the ine thwarted feeling, that opportunity to sell so such more than it was possible to produce." Production levels have been maintained and even icreased each year since last convention. Last year a )tal of 127 weavers were on the Arrowcraft rolls, rith 80 of them working six months or more of aat time, and an average of 80 weavers working at ray one time. Checks totalling $27,647.11 were given weavers for work done from May first of last year May of this. A comparative study showed that last year the [um= clubs received the same percentage of Arrow-raft's output that they had received in 1941, the nal amount increasing from $35,428.18 to 43,701.27, not including an increase in discount from 5 to 20% during that time. Of the remaining suply the 1941 sales showed some $6,000 going to rholesalers. This type of business has been dras-:cally curtailed the last few years, with the con-:nuance only of a limited amount sent to the Southern lighland Handicraft Guild and Southern Highmders shops in Rockefeller Center, Asheville, Nor-[s Dam and Big Meadows. This has been necessary ecause of an understanding with these organizations a which Arrowcraft holds membership. The remaining sales are entered on the books as Cash Sales" but should not be considered entirely s non-Pi Phi tourist sales, since this includes a ansiderable but indeterminable number of sales made Pi Phi's in the Arrowcraft Shop, and all mail rder sales not sent to an alumnae club on consign-lent. One other factor is important in this analysis nd that is that the local Arrowcraft Shop often dislays those items not popular with alumnae clubs andis also used to unload those slightly irregular articles which are good but cannot be sent in alumna club Orders because of variation in size, color, etc. The many problems of distribution for a stock that is unpredictable in amount available at any one time and in total amount, and for which the bulk of the orders arrive at approximately the same time were of real concern to our Arrowcraft staff. Part of this may be removed this coming year by the necessity of a raise in prices on all Arrowcraft articles. This has been needed for some time but OPA regulations to which Arrowcraft strictly adhered prohibited any change except on new items. Now prices may be raised for the same article if cost of production has increased. And you would know, of course, that they have. Not only has the price of threads and yarns been raised by the mills, but effective now is a drop from a former 25% cash discount to a 10% cash discount. Also the weavers are being paid more for their work, as is certainly not out of line with present conditions, especially since one of the primary reasons for Arrow-craft is the financial assistance to women who could not earn in other ways either because of personal attributes or family restrictions. Technically speaking, our weavers are not employees since we require no speed of performance, nor do we dictate any working conditions such as number of hours or date of delivery; they weave at home articles for which we advance the necessary materials and sell the finished product to Arrowcraft. Governmental interpretation of the term "employees" however, indicates a probable inclusion of them under some sort of minimum wage regulations. After an original flurry in 1940, during which some government investigation was made, we were told to continue as previously until further notice. This past fall we were asked to make a survey of a number of our weavers, ascertaining speed of work, and reducing their pay, which is figured by us according to a piece rate, to an average rate per hour. The results showed an average pay of 42 cents an hour for the thirty weavers selected from among those working on various types of weaving and with varying abilities. It is uncertain yet what their application of the Fair Standards Act will be, which as you know is under consideration for a change from the present 40 cent minimum to at least a 55 cent minimum. The results of any necessitated raise in pay to the weavers would automatically include some further raise in selling prices. The outlook for fall, then, would indicate a possible wider variety of articles than last year, many of these lovely new designs of our "Miss Meta," a considerable raise in prices, but no definite promise of a greater over-all quantity than was available last year, since the increasing of production is beyond our control. By staggering club orders over a longer period of time, it might be possible for our Arrowcraft Manager to send a little more on those particular orders which arrived so close together last year that all must be proportionately filled from the same month's de-liveries to the Shop. That she can completely fill any orders if they maintain the same high as last year will be an impossibility that she and Committee regret fully as much, if not more, than the disappointed clubs. Miss Meta Schattschneider, whom we were fortunate enough to secure as Weaving Supervisor upon the resignation last fall of Winogene Redding, who had served so capably for twenty years, has already THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 97 made a very definite contribution through her lovely designs of interesting color combinations, and her ability to work with and for others. She has written three articles to appear in as many issues of Design magazine, the first of which features Arrowcraft and our Summer Workshop. Summer Workshop. The Summer Workshop as such is perhaps a new idea, although the basis for it came out of suggestions made by both Dean Holton and Dr. Taylor when they advised us to develop the Arts and Crafts field of our Settlement School as we gave added responsibility in other educational fields to the County or community. Future possibilities in such a program were outlined by them and enlarged by the former Settlement School Chairman, Ethel Copp, and the Arts and Crafts Advisory Committee inaugurated in her term of office and consisting of Miss Jessie Harris, Head of the Home Economics Department, Miss Ida Anders and Miss Marian Heard, instructors in textiles and crafts at the University of Tennessee. The only immediate practical application of this idea seemed to be the founding of the Summer Work-shop in the summer of 1945 with the University of Tennessee offering graduate and post-graduate credit for courses in weaving, textile decoration, recreational crafts, woodworking, and community recreation taught by a staff selected jointly by the University and Pi Beta Phi. Headed by the well-known originator of the Milwaukee Handicraft Project, Miss Elsa Ulbricht, this group of four excellent craftsmen was enthusiastically followed in a program of classes and laboratory periods which lasted from eight to six and even spilled over into evening hours because of sheer enjoyment in the creation of crafts articles of assorted types and materials. At one of the two open houses marking the end of each three-week period, Miss Onken dedicated the Arts and Crafts Building to Emma Harper Turner in recognition of her efforts toward founding the Settlement School and her continued interest in it through-out her lifetime. The Grand Council and Settlement School Committee and the University of Tennessee Committee in charge were agreed that the first Summer Workshop exceeded all expectations. Students from nineteen states were of unusual caliber, including State Directors of Industrial Arts, Home Demonstration Agents, and Craft Teachers. The program for this summer follows very much the same pattern, as last with Miss Ulbricht and Miss Marian Heard of the University acting as co-directors and with metalcraft added to the curriculum. Four board and room scholarships were offered two to Pi Beta Phis and two to the University of Tennessee students, the recipients to live at the School with another Pi Phi, Carolyn Buck, who will attend classes part-time and take charge of a light luncheon to be prepared and served to the students in the Home Economics room of the High School. Twenty-seven advance registrations to date insure a capacity enrollment this year. There is every indication that if Pi Beta Phi is interested in development of this plan it can be built into a Craft School of considerable prominence. Gatlinburg is an ideal setting, and it is located in the midst of one of the best centers of American handcrafts. Held in the summer it allows use of the High School and Craft Centerbuildings during months when they would otherwise be idle, and makes possible the securing of outstanding craft teachers who hold other positions during winter months. We have land on which summer dormitories and any additional buildings needed could be placed; and the possibilities for broadening the curriculum are numerous, including play production with actual experience before tourist audiences, study and experience in the merchandising of craft articles, and development of the community recreation course to include experience in a well-rounded program of activities using Settlement School facilities. This is an enlargement of our former program of cultivation of the crafts of the Smoky Mountains and specifically the Gatlinburg community, to the furtherance and development of craft education throughout the country by offering excellent instruction in this field to a college-level student body. Through the stimulus and insniration of these Workshops there should result a raising of the quality of craft work in Gatlinburg itself and finally, we hope, the interesting of craft leaders in affiliating themselves with our project in a permanent way that would insure their cooperation with Arrowcraft to open new avenues of income for the handcraft workers of Pi Beta Phi. There is no question but that the immediate needs in Gatlinburg are for continued assistance in the regular school curriculum, for a Health Center pro-gram similar to the present one, for the maintenance of high standards in Arrowcraft production and the marketing of these to insure financial assistance for those who need this means of income ; but as we are able to develop the Summer Workshop project we will be laying the foundation for a future expansion of our enterprise on a basis which should eventually be self-supporting and in a way equally important to Gatlinburg and the future of crafts. If this report has helped to bring to you a picture of the whole project known as the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as it exists at present, with some indication of possible future developments, it has accomplished its purpose. It has been a real privilege and pleasure to serve the past four years on the Settlement School Committee, to work closely with the other members who during that time have included Ethel Copp, Beth Le Roy, Lolita. Prouty, Ann Munn, Emma Woerner and Eugenia Smith, and the new member just beginning her five year term of office, Carlene Holly; to know the understanding and Inspirational assistance of Grand Council and its contact member to our Committee, the Grand President; and to assist to the best of our ability in the many details and constantly changing matters for consideration that make the work at the Settlement School a real task and sometimes a real worry, but always, in spite of this, a real joy also in the knowledge that there Pi Beta Phi is doing such a constructive piece of philanthropy that Edwin Foscue writing of Gatlin-burg in the "Economic Geography" devotes consider-able space to the part played by the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, saying in one instance: "This mountain community, nearly a century and a half old; completely isolated from the rest of the country for more than a century, became known first through the lumbering industry and later through the establishment of a Settlement School" and again: "the Gatlinburg community is certainly indebted to the Fraternity for the work of the school in the community." MILDRED SALE, Chairman 98 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR TIME moves swifter than a weaver's shuttle, even one in the experienced hands of a Pi Phi weaver. The terrible war is over with people everywhere be-ginning to talk of memorials to be erected honoring war heroes. Many agree that the day of statues is past and that living memorials will best express the gratitude flowing from our hearts. Pi Beta Phi had such an idea in mind when the Settlement School was founded, not to honor war heroes but our be-loved founders. Through the years the natural beauty all around us, orderly living, willing service to bodies, minds, and hearts has gone steadily forward enriching the lives of many. Changes come but by constant adjustments we can continue to serve the Gatlinburg Community. Community This year has marked the passing of two good friends of the School. Charlie Ogle died in December of 1945 and Aunt Lizzie Reagan in March of 1946. They are missed, for both filled a place in the life of the village that was a unique one. This summer of 1946 finds Gatlinburg's main street much changed by the addition of a number of new buildings. The Ogle store has been changed into a Super-Market. The drug stock was moved across the street to the old Annex, now the bus depot. The Log Cabin has been razed. On that site construction on a large new structure which is to _house a movie theater, several shops with office rooms above is well started. The Methodist congregation has the foundation laid for a stone chapel. This is to be located on the hill above the Cliff Dwellers Shop on a lot donated to them by Mr. and Mrs. Jones. Mr. Barber is the architect. His design is most attractive in the pictures. Ray Whaley, back from the service, has built a new hotel named Edge Park Inn on land between the Riverside and the New Gatlinburg Inn. It has twenty-five guest rooms and the dining room is to accommodate two hundred. Earl Ogle has erected an office building for the new doctor adjacent to the Ogle Store, Along the river, Mrs. Allen, of Laurel Springs resort, built two attractive shops on the highway side. They do cut off a lovely view of the river, a circumstance that seems a pity. A number of other business places have been enlarged, smaller shops and eating stands have been erected all along the highway! The main street is fast becoming that of a typical resort town. The effects of incorporation of the village which was voted last year are not yet very apparent. A large, detailed map of the area and preliminary surveys for water and sewer lines have been made by the city manager and his staff. The council spent much time formulating various ordinances governing the operation and taxation of different businesses. In this town they are almost exclusively devoted to the tourist trade. Some added police protection has been secured. This is used mostly to control traffic and disturbances due to liquor. School Many problems have come up during the year with changes in personnel in the teaching staff in some grades a major one. Fortunately we had several strong teachers, and were able to manage somehow with substitutes and end the year with the required work completed. It was again necessary to have one room in which we had two grades. The Elementarybuilding was so crowded that the beginners were placed over in the back room at the high school building. In the high school there was a change in the English teacher at the end of the first semester. Miss Fenn wished to go to Columbia for further work in Library Science. We were fortunate in securing Mrs. Ann Lighter for the position. She has recently moved to town, she and her husband own a home here. She has taught English and best of all had charge of all High School libraries in the state of Michigan for two years prior to her marriage. She is a real addition to the staff. She coached the successful senior play, "He Couldn't Marry Five." The work of the three teachers supplied by the fraternity to supplement the County program added much to the enjoyment of the students as well as giving them something of value in Music, Physical Education and Crafts. Mrs. Stanley Armstrong used the old Agriculture room for her class room for the music work. The children responded well to her excellent teaching. The Grade School Operetta, Rose Dream, was one of the best that I have seen here. She trained a chorus from the sixth, seventh and eighth grades that delighted everyone with their singing at the Elementary School graduation program. The Glee Club did very well at the various Commencement events. Mr. Don Spargo, as Phyiscal Education instructor, worked hard with the students in regular classes as well as coaching both a boys and girls team in basket ball. Our victories were not too many for we were pitted against teams of much more experience and from larger schools but the spirit was fine. Through donations from various business houses and individual friends a fund of $351.00, was secured for new warm-up jackets for the boys team. These were ordered last December but to date have not been de-livered due to shortages of materials. When our teams played away from home they reflected credit upon their coach and the school. In the craft department Miss Elizabeth Petrie worked with the grade school children and the girls in the high school craft class while Mr. Carl Huskey devoted two hours in the morning to the boys teaching wood working. The boys made a number of small looms that were used by the girls in the simpler types of weaving. The boys also made the wooden stage for a puppet theater; the girls wove the little curtains and made the , puppets. Several shows were given to very appreciative audiences. One play was the "Three Bears" with health problems woven into the story by one of the girls, "Hansel and Gretel" with music rforn the opera was given at Open House. The weaving done by the girls was of exceptionally good quality both in design and in workmanship. Home Economics instruction included work in nutrition, sewing, and designing of clothes for the girls themselves and work for various relief agencies. One class cleaned and decorated one room at the school to be used as a future rest room for the girls. A course in home nursing resulted in the girls being given the Red Cross awards for completing the regular course. In this work Miss Landrum has a very good opportunity to teach the girls many things in personal grooming, clothing care, suitability of dress, good manners and ways of entertaining. When our Gatlinburg girls go to any other town they are THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 99 always complimented upon their excellent appearance. We graduated a class of sixteen seniors. A number of them expect to go on for more training. The class made their annual trip to Atlanta, had the usual banquet tendered them by the Juniors and gave their class night program before Commencement. The speakers were good at both the Baccalaureate and Commencement programs. We have had good cooperation from the Sevier County authorities but have been hampered all year by the war time shortages of repair materials needed for buildings, furnaces, etc. The county constructed a new brick smoke stack to the large boiler room and paid for half of a new incinerator to take care of waste paper from the school. Mr. Kelley Huskey coached a team of girls in Sevierville for schools of their size. His Eighth Grade basketball class which won the Elementary tournament, was smaller than usual, eleven girls and eleven boys finished the course. All intend to come to high school this fall. Community interest in school affairs has increased. Sometimes the crowds at events such as our Open House and the Operetta were almost more than we could take care of. The P.T.A. has functioned all year and has ambitious plans for the future. They sponsored the hot lunch program, purchased a large electric refrigerator for the lunch room and have started raising money to install better lighting in the elementary building. The T.V.A. are supervising the planning of this improvement. In addition to new lights it calls for new paint in the class rooms of the elementary school building. The county, will pay for the paint but the P.T.A. must put it on. Different things have been done to raise the money. The Lions Club helped materially when they gave two performances of the "Womanless Wedding" for the benefit of the fund. A bow supper, a bingo party, and rummage sales have all been held but there is still much to be raised. Farm We are gradually building up our herd of cattle from the jersey calves born on the place. We have milk for our own use and in these days of butter shortages feel rich in that we can churn our own butter. Carl, the farm man, is good with poultry. We produce all of our own eggs, sell many dozens to the Mountain View Hotel, have chicken for the table and supply the hotel with some fryers in the summer time. During the highest producing month we sold 2692/3 dozen eggs to the hotel. This number dropped to 68 dozen in the lowest producing month. This spring much time has been spent on repairing the fences around the different lots. We used a lot of old wire and for posts the men went to the woods on the hills back of the place. They dragged down fallen chestnut logs and in some cases felled young trees. Our garden supplies us with all sorts of fresh vegetables, potatoes enough to last through the winter, tomatoes and beans for canning and berries in season. We sell some surplus that would otherwise spoil. Dormitory We have had four boys and six girls for Most of the year in residence at the school. Three of the girls graduated this spring. One is already married to a returned soldier, one will go on to school and the third one will possibly go to business college. Again this year most of the money owed to the school hasbeen paid. Last year every account was settled before school started in the fall, sometimes with money the student had earned during the summer. I expect that to be the case this year. Stuart Dormitory has been the scene of a number of parties planned and given by the girls and boys. The town children seem to like to come there for school affairs. Our own young people gain confidence in themselves as they play the part of hostesses. Arrowcraft Changes have also taken place in this department, the chief one of these being that Miss Meta Schattschneider has replaced Miss Gene Redding as de-signer and weaving supervisor. Gene had been such a part of the weaving program for so many years that her successor had to be chosen with care. We feel that Miss Meta has been a very wise choice. She has gained the friendship and confidence of the weavers to a marked degree. Her new designs are distinctive. They are gradually getting into production and are meeting with public approval. Since all threads have gone up in price and living costs are so much higher it has been necessary to raise our prices to meet these costs when that is possible under OPA rulings. The value of our products is unquestioned, the demand almost unlimited while the quantity that can be produced is definitely limited by the very factor that produces their value--"Made By Hand." In February 1946 the weavers' checks amounted to $3,376.09, the highest amount ever written for one month. During that same month the monthly average of weavers working was 83.96 which was only about 3 points under the highest number of weavers working in any one month of the year. Mrs. Snow has tried hard to satisfy the clubs and to keep both of our local shops supplied with at-tractive merchandise. At times this has been almost impossible. By last autumn the shelves in the stock room were almost bare while bouquets of beautiful colored leaves in large containers could not cover up the fact that our stock was very low. Health Center Another year of service to the community has been added to the fine record that Mrs. Chalmers has made as the Pi Phi nurse. Her duties are so varied that it is always difficult to enumerate all of them. Routine inspections of the school children, inoculations, hours devoted to a weekly clinic day, class room talks on home nursing and home visits are just a few of the things that she takes as a matter of course. They all help to make the people of the community healthier and happier. It has helped make the work of the nurse easier to have a young doctor in town. He is just out of the army and is becoming well established. The new projector, gift of Chicago North Alumnae Club, has added interest to class room instruction. The children in the rural schools have especially enjoyed the little movies and health pictures. Sigma Phi Gamma has again contributed to our work. Mrs. Chalmers was asked to attend a Polio re-fresher course at Monteagle, Tennessee this month. Here the latest equipment for fighting this disease was demonstrated and plans for organizing the community, in case of an epidemic, were worked out. This invitation came as the natural result of the school she had attended at Warm Springs, Georgia last year. We at the school have appreciated the many gifts THE SEPTEMBER ARROW by actives, alumnae clubs, and individual Pi Phis. know that a rummage sale in far off Oregon, azine subscriptions solicited by some club chair-. in the middle west, clever benefits arranged by sge girls or alumnae clubs, and the sale of Arrow-t products all represent thought, time and effort :he part of our members. The school benefits and I know that the individuals experience a satisfaction in working for our project. Personally the unselfish devotion of Committee and Grand Council Members to the work of the School is a constant inspiration to me. I thank you for it.

TYPE OF WORK PREFERRED ARROWCRAFT SHOP STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENSES Year Ended June 30, 1946 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Committee Reports COMMITTEE FOR WAR WORK 111 N PRESENTING this report it will be recalled that the report of last year covered all contributions and disbursements of Physical Therapy Scholarships up to August 1, 1945. With V-J Day which followed so soon and the subsequent end to the war emergency, no further solicitation of funds for these scholarships was made. Contributions have come in through the year and additional scholarships have been awarded. Since this report will close with the chairman's recommendation that the committee be dissolved, having served its purpose, it seems altogether fitting that a brief resume of Pi Beta Phi's war work, year by year, should follow: 1. In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.OG to the Red Cross $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed more than fifteen thou sand dollars and up to August 1, 1945, 38 scholar-ships were awarded. 5. With V-J Day, Grand Council agreed with the committee that there should be no further solicitation for funds for this war project, but even so, contributions of nearly $1,400.00 were received this year from clubs and chapters; ten additional girls received scholarships; and three young women who were completing their courses too late to receive commissions in the Army or Navy received supple-mental scholarships to help them through their professional period of readjustment. 6. In addition, Grand Council requested the Committee for War Work of secure a record of Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the war effort this to be reduCed as nearly as possible to the number of working hours spent in war work activities by Pi Phis everywhere in active chapters, alumnae clubs, and those Pi Phis not identified with any group. These reports have been based o'n questionnaires tabulated by Ann McDonald D'Aule for active chapters; Ruth Jane Dunlap Wheeler for alumnae clubs; and Mary Foley for Canadian clubs and chapters. Their reports represent a most significant compilation of facts, and an infinite amount of work. Listed below are the contributions and disbursements of the past year which concern the wind up of Pi Phi's own war project.

        98 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR TIME moves swifter than a weaver's shuttle, even one in the experienced hands of a Pi Phi weaver. The terrible war is over with people everywhere be-ginning to talk of memorials to be erected honoring war heroes. Many agree that the day of statues is past and that living memorials will best express the gratitude flowing from our hearts. Pi Beta Phi had such an idea in mind when the Settlement School was founded, not to honor war heroes but our be-loved founders. Through the years the natural beauty all around us, orderly living, willing service to bodies, minds, and hearts has gone steadily forward enriching the lives of many. Changes come but by constant adjustments we can continue to serve the Gatlinburg Community. Community This year has marked the passing of two good friends of the School. Charlie Ogle died in December of 1945 and Aunt Lizzie Reagan in March of 1946. They are missed, for both filled a place in the life of the village that was a unique one. This summer of 1946 finds Gatlinburg's main street much changed by the addition of a number of new buildings. The Ogle store has been changed into a Super-Market. The drug stock was moved across the street to the old Annex, now the bus depot. The Log Cabin has been razed. On that site construction on a large new structure which is to _house a movie theater, several shops with office rooms above is well started. The Methodist congregation has the foundation laid for a stone chapel. This is to be located on the hill above the Cliff Dwellers Shop on a lot donated to them by Mr. and Mrs. Jones. Mr. Barber is the architect. His design is most attractive in the pictures. Ray Whaley, back from the service, has built a new hotel named Edge Park Inn on land between the Riverside and the New Gatlinburg Inn. It has twenty-five guest rooms and the dining room is to accommodate two hundred. Earl Ogle has erected an office building for the new doctor adjacent to the Ogle Store, Along the river, Mrs. Allen, of Laurel Springs resort, built two attractive shops on the highway side. They do cut off a lovely view of the river, a circumstance that seems a pity. A number of other business places have been enlarged, smaller shops and eating stands have been erected all along the highway! The main street is fast becoming that of a typical resort town. The effects of incorporation of the village which was voted last year are not yet very apparent. A large, detailed map of the area and preliminary surveys for water and sewer lines have been made by the city manager and his staff. The council spent much time formulating various ordinances governing the operation and taxation of different businesses. In this town they are almost exclusively devoted to the tourist trade. Some added police protection has been secured. This is used mostly to control traffic and disturbances due to liquor. School Many problems have come up during the year with changes in personnel in the teaching staff in some grades a major one. Fortunately we had several strong teachers, and were able to manage somehow with substitutes and end the year with the required work completed. It was again necessary to have one room in which we had two grades. The Elementarybuilding was so crowded that the beginners were placed over in the back room at the high school building. In the high school there was a change in the English teacher at the end of the first semester. Miss Fenn wished to go to Columbia for further work in Library Science. We were fortunate in securing Mrs. Ann Lighter for the position. She has recently moved to town, she and her husband own a home here. She has taught English and best of all had charge of all High School libraries in the state of Michigan for two years prior to her marriage. She is a real addition to the staff. She coached the successful senior play, "He Couldn't Marry Five." The work of the three teachers supplied by the fraternity to supplement the County program added much to the enjoyment of the students as well as giving them something of value in Music, Physical Education and Crafts. Mrs. Stanley Armstrong used the old Agriculture room for her class room for the music work. The children responded well to her excellent teaching. The Grade School Operetta, Rose Dream, was one of the best that I have seen here. She trained a chorus from the sixth, seventh and eighth grades that delighted everyone with their singing at the Elementary School graduation program. The Glee Club did very well at the various Commencement events. Mr. Don Spargo, as Phyiscal Education instructor, worked hard with the students in regular classes as well as coaching both a boys and girls team in basket ball. Our victories were not too many for we were pitted against teams of much more experience and from larger schools but the spirit was fine. Through donations from various business houses and individual friends a fund of $351.00, was secured for new warm-up jackets for the boys team. These were ordered last December but to date have not been de-livered due to shortages of materials. When our teams played away from home they reflected credit upon their coach and the school. In the craft department Miss Elizabeth Petrie worked with the grade school children and the girls in the high school craft class while Mr. Carl Huskey devoted two hours in the morning to the boys teaching wood working. The boys made a number of small looms that were used by the girls in the simpler types of weaving. The boys also made the wooden stage for a puppet theater; the girls wove the little curtains and made the , puppets. Several shows were given to very appreciative audiences. One play was the "Three Bears" with health problems woven into the story by one of the girls, "Hansel and Gretel" with music rforn the opera was given at Open House. The weaving done by the girls was of exceptionally good quality both in design and in workmanship. Home Economics instruction included work in nutrition, sewing, and designing of clothes for the girls themselves and work for various relief agencies. One class cleaned and decorated one room at the school to be used as a future rest room for the girls. A course in home nursing resulted in the girls being given the Red Cross awards for completing the regular course. In this work Miss Landrum has a very good opportunity to teach the girls many things in personal grooming, clothing care, suitability of dress, good manners and ways of entertaining. When our Gatlinburg girls go to any other town they are THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 99 always complimented upon their excellent appearance. We graduated a class of sixteen seniors. A number of them expect to go on for more training. The class made their annual trip to Atlanta, had the usual banquet tendered them by the Juniors and gave their class night program before Commencement. The speakers were good at both the Baccalaureate and Commencement programs. We have had good cooperation from the Sevier County authorities but have been hampered all year by the war time shortages of repair materials needed for buildings, furnaces, etc. The county constructed a new brick smoke stack to the large boiler room and paid for half of a new incinerator to take care of waste paper from the school. Mr. Kelley Huskey coached a team of girls in Sevierville for schools of their size. His Eighth Grade basketball class which won the Elementary tournament, was smaller than usual, eleven girls and eleven boys finished the course. All intend to come to high school this fall. Community interest in school affairs has increased. Sometimes the crowds at events such as our Open House and the Operetta were almost more than we could take care of. The P.T.A. has functioned all year and has ambitious plans for the future. They sponsored the hot lunch program, purchased a large electric refrigerator for the lunch room and have started raising money to install better lighting in the elementary building. The T.V.A. are supervising the planning of this improvement. In addition to new lights it calls for new paint in the class rooms of the elementary school building. The county, will pay for the paint but the P.T.A. must put it on. Different things have been done to raise the money. The Lions Club helped materially when they gave two performances of the "Womanless Wedding" for the benefit of the fund. A bow supper, a bingo party, and rummage sales have all been held but there is still much to be raised. Farm We are gradually building up our herd of cattle from the jersey calves born on the place. We have milk for our own use and in these days of butter shortages feel rich in that we can churn our own butter. Carl, the farm man, is good with poultry. We produce all of our own eggs, sell many dozens to the Mountain View Hotel, have chicken for the table and supply the hotel with some fryers in the summer time. During the highest producing month we sold 2692/3 dozen eggs to the hotel. This number dropped to 68 dozen in the lowest producing month. This spring much time has been spent on repairing the fences around the different lots. We used a lot of old wire and for posts the men went to the woods on the hills back of the place. They dragged down fallen chestnut logs and in some cases felled young trees. Our garden supplies us with all sorts of fresh vegetables, potatoes enough to last through the winter, tomatoes and beans for canning and berries in season. We sell some surplus that would otherwise spoil. Dormitory We have had four boys and six girls for Most of the year in residence at the school. Three of the girls graduated this spring. One is already married to a returned soldier, one will go on to school and the third one will possibly go to business college. Again this year most of the money owed to the school hasbeen paid. Last year every account was settled before school started in the fall, sometimes with money the student had earned during the summer. I expect that to be the case this year. Stuart Dormitory has been the scene of a number of parties planned and given by the girls and boys. The town children seem to like to come there for school affairs. Our own young people gain confidence in themselves as they play the part of hostesses. Arrowcraft Changes have also taken place in this department, the chief one of these being that Miss Meta Schattschneider has replaced Miss Gene Redding as de-signer and weaving supervisor. Gene had been such a part of the weaving program for so many years that her successor had to be chosen with care. We feel that Miss Meta has been a very wise choice. She has gained the friendship and confidence of the weavers to a marked degree. Her new designs are distinctive. They are gradually getting into production and are meeting with public approval. Since all threads have gone up in price and living costs are so much higher it has been necessary to raise our prices to meet these costs when that is possible under OPA rulings. The value of our products is unquestioned, the demand almost unlimited while the quantity that can be produced is definitely limited by the very factor that produces their value--"Made By Hand." In February 1946 the weavers' checks amounted to $3,376.09, the highest amount ever written for one month. During that same month the monthly average of weavers working was 83.96 which was only about 3 points under the highest number of weavers working in any one month of the year. Mrs. Snow has tried hard to satisfy the clubs and to keep both of our local shops supplied with at-tractive merchandise. At times this has been almost impossible. By last autumn the shelves in the stock room were almost bare while bouquets of beautiful colored leaves in large containers could not cover up the fact that our stock was very low. Health Center Another year of service to the community has been added to the fine record that Mrs. Chalmers has made as the Pi Phi nurse. Her duties are so varied that it is always difficult to enumerate all of them. Routine inspections of the school children, inoculations, hours devoted to a weekly clinic day, class room talks on home nursing and home visits are just a few of the things that she takes as a matter of course. They all help to make the people of the community healthier and happier. It has helped make the work of the nurse easier to have a young doctor in town. He is just out of the army and is becoming well established. The new projector, gift of Chicago North Alumnae Club, has added interest to class room instruction. The children in the rural schools have especially enjoyed the little movies and health pictures. Sigma Phi Gamma has again contributed to our work. Mrs. Chalmers was asked to attend a Polio re-fresher course at Monteagle, Tennessee this month. Here the latest equipment for fighting this disease was demonstrated and plans for organizing the community, in case of an epidemic, were worked out. This invitation came as the natural result of the school she had attended at Warm Springs, Georgia last year. We at the school have appreciated the many gifts THE SEPTEMBER ARROW by actives, alumnae clubs, and individual Pi Phis. know that a rummage sale in far off Oregon, azine subscriptions solicited by some club chair-. in the middle west, clever benefits arranged by sge girls or alumnae clubs, and the sale of Arrow-t products all represent thought, time and effort :he part of our members. The school benefits and I know that the individuals experience a satisfaction in working for our project. Personally the unselfish devotion of Committee and Grand Council Members to the work of the School is a constant inspiration to me. I thank you for it.

TYPE OF WORK PREFERRED ARROWCRAFT SHOP STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENSES Year Ended June 30, 1946 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Committee Reports COMMITTEE FOR WAR WORK 111 N PRESENTING this report it will be recalled that the report of last year covered all contributions and disbursements of Physical Therapy Scholarships up to August 1, 1945. With V-J Day which followed so soon and the subsequent end to the war emergency, no further solicitation of funds for these scholarships was made. Contributions have come in through the year and additional scholarships have been awarded. Since this report will close with the chairman's recommendation that the committee be dissolved, having served its purpose, it seems altogether fitting that a brief resume of Pi Beta Phi's war work, year by year, should follow: 1. In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.OG to the Red Cross $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed more than fifteen thou sand dollars and up to August 1, 1945, 38 scholar-ships were awarded. 5. With V-J Day, Grand Council agreed with the committee that there should be no further solicitation for funds for this war project, but even so, contributions of nearly $1,400.00 were received this year from clubs and chapters; ten additional girls received scholarships; and three young women who were completing their courses too late to receive commissions in the Army or Navy received supple-mental scholarships to help them through their professional period of readjustment. 6. In addition, Grand Council requested the Committee for War Work of secure a record of Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the war effort this to be reduCed as nearly as possible to the number of working hours spent in war work activities by Pi Phis everywhere in active chapters, alumnae clubs, and those Pi Phis not identified with any group. These reports have been based o'n questionnaires tabulated by Ann McDonald D'Aule for active chapters; Ruth Jane Dunlap Wheeler for alumnae clubs; and Mary Foley for Canadian clubs and chapters. Their reports represent a most significant compilation of facts, and an infinite amount of work. Listed below are the contributions and disbursements of the past year which concern the wind up of Pi Phi's own war project.

        THE SEPTEMBER ARROW by actives, alumnae clubs, and individual Pi Phis. know that a rummage sale in far off Oregon, azine subscriptions solicited by some club chair-. in the middle west, clever benefits arranged by sge girls or alumnae clubs, and the sale of Arrow-t products all represent thought, time and effort :he part of our members. The school benefits and I know that the individuals experience a satisfaction in working for our project. Personally the unselfish devotion of Committee and Grand Council Members to the work of the School is a constant inspiration to me. I thank you for it. Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER I BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL, GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE REPORT ON AUDIT, YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1946 the Settlement School Committee beta Phi Fraternity ce of Settlement School Treasurer ?vet*, Colorado kit MESDAMES: Ve have examined and tested the books of account records of the Treasurer of your 'Committee for Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ed June 30, 1946, to the extent deemed necessary us for an adequate audit for balance sheet and 3t and loss statement purposes. The subsidiary rds of the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at linburg, Tennessee, were not included in our it. The report concerning those records rendered Homer K.

TYPE OF WORK PREFERRED ARROWCRAFT SHOP STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENSES Year Ended June 30, 1946 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Committee Reports COMMITTEE FOR WAR WORK 111 N PRESENTING this report it will be recalled that the report of last year covered all contributions and disbursements of Physical Therapy Scholarships up to August 1, 1945. With V-J Day which followed so soon and the subsequent end to the war emergency, no further solicitation of funds for these scholarships was made. Contributions have come in through the year and additional scholarships have been awarded. Since this report will close with the chairman's recommendation that the committee be dissolved, having served its purpose, it seems altogether fitting that a brief resume of Pi Beta Phi's war work, year by year, should follow: 1. In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.OG to the Red Cross $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed more than fifteen thou sand dollars and up to August 1, 1945, 38 scholar-ships were awarded. 5. With V-J Day, Grand Council agreed with the committee that there should be no further solicitation for funds for this war project, but even so, contributions of nearly $1,400.00 were received this year from clubs and chapters; ten additional girls received scholarships; and three young women who were completing their courses too late to receive commissions in the Army or Navy received supple-mental scholarships to help them through their professional period of readjustment. 6. In addition, Grand Council requested the Committee for War Work of secure a record of Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the war effort this to be reduCed as nearly as possible to the number of working hours spent in war work activities by Pi Phis everywhere in active chapters, alumnae clubs, and those Pi Phis not identified with any group. These reports have been based o'n questionnaires tabulated by Ann McDonald D'Aule for active chapters; Ruth Jane Dunlap Wheeler for alumnae clubs; and Mary Foley for Canadian clubs and chapters. Their reports represent a most significant compilation of facts, and an infinite amount of work. Listed below are the contributions and disbursements of the past year which concern the wind up of Pi Phi's own war project.

TYPE OF WORK PREFERRED ARROWCRAFT SHOP STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENSES Year Ended June 30, 1946 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Committee Reports COMMITTEE FOR WAR WORK 111 N PRESENTING this report it will be recalled that the report of last year covered all contributions and disbursements of Physical Therapy Scholarships up to August 1, 1945. With V-J Day which followed so soon and the subsequent end to the war emergency, no further solicitation of funds for these scholarships was made. Contributions have come in through the year and additional scholarships have been awarded. Since this report will close with the chairman's recommendation that the committee be dissolved, having served its purpose, it seems altogether fitting that a brief resume of Pi Beta Phi's war work, year by year, should follow: 1. In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.OG to the Red Cross $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed more than fifteen thou sand dollars and up to August 1, 1945, 38 scholar-ships were awarded. 5. With V-J Day, Grand Council agreed with the committee that there should be no further solicitation for funds for this war project, but even so, contributions of nearly $1,400.00 were received this year from clubs and chapters; ten additional girls received scholarships; and three young women who were completing their courses too late to receive commissions in the Army or Navy received supple-mental scholarships to help them through their professional period of readjustment. 6. In addition, Grand Council requested the Committee for War Work of secure a record of Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the war effort this to be reduCed as nearly as possible to the number of working hours spent in war work activities by Pi Phis everywhere in active chapters, alumnae clubs, and those Pi Phis not identified with any group. These reports have been based o'n questionnaires tabulated by Ann McDonald D'Aule for active chapters; Ruth Jane Dunlap Wheeler for alumnae clubs; and Mary Foley for Canadian clubs and chapters. Their reports represent a most significant compilation of facts, and an infinite amount of work. Listed below are the contributions and disbursements of the past year which concern the wind up of Pi Phi's own war project.

TYPE OF WORK PREFERRED ARROWCRAFT SHOP STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENSES Year Ended June 30, 1946 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Committee Reports COMMITTEE FOR WAR WORK 111 N PRESENTING this report it will be recalled that the report of last year covered all contributions and disbursements of Physical Therapy Scholarships up to August 1, 1945. With V-J Day which followed so soon and the subsequent end to the war emergency, no further solicitation of funds for these scholarships was made. Contributions have come in through the year and additional scholarships have been awarded. Since this report will close with the chairman's recommendation that the committee be dissolved, having served its purpose, it seems altogether fitting that a brief resume of Pi Beta Phi's war work, year by year, should follow: 1. In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.OG to the Red Cross $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed more than fifteen thou sand dollars and up to August 1, 1945, 38 scholar-ships were awarded. 5. With V-J Day, Grand Council agreed with the committee that there should be no further solicitation for funds for this war project, but even so, contributions of nearly $1,400.00 were received this year from clubs and chapters; ten additional girls received scholarships; and three young women who were completing their courses too late to receive commissions in the Army or Navy received supple-mental scholarships to help them through their professional period of readjustment. 6. In addition, Grand Council requested the Committee for War Work of secure a record of Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the war effort this to be reduCed as nearly as possible to the number of working hours spent in war work activities by Pi Phis everywhere in active chapters, alumnae clubs, and those Pi Phis not identified with any group. These reports have been based o'n questionnaires tabulated by Ann McDonald D'Aule for active chapters; Ruth Jane Dunlap Wheeler for alumnae clubs; and Mary Foley for Canadian clubs and chapters. Their reports represent a most significant compilation of facts, and an infinite amount of work. Listed below are the contributions and disbursements of the past year which concern the wind up of Pi Phi's own war project.

TYPE OF WORK PREFERRED ARROWCRAFT SHOP STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENSES Year Ended June 30, 1946 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Committee Reports COMMITTEE FOR WAR WORK 111 N PRESENTING this report it will be recalled that the report of last year covered all contributions and disbursements of Physical Therapy Scholarships up to August 1, 1945. With V-J Day which followed so soon and the subsequent end to the war emergency, no further solicitation of funds for these scholarships was made. Contributions have come in through the year and additional scholarships have been awarded. Since this report will close with the chairman's recommendation that the committee be dissolved, having served its purpose, it seems altogether fitting that a brief resume of Pi Beta Phi's war work, year by year, should follow: 1. In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.OG to the Red Cross $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed more than fifteen thou sand dollars and up to August 1, 1945, 38 scholar-ships were awarded. 5. With V-J Day, Grand Council agreed with the committee that there should be no further solicitation for funds for this war project, but even so, contributions of nearly $1,400.00 were received this year from clubs and chapters; ten additional girls received scholarships; and three young women who were completing their courses too late to receive commissions in the Army or Navy received supple-mental scholarships to help them through their professional period of readjustment. 6. In addition, Grand Council requested the Committee for War Work of secure a record of Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the war effort this to be reduCed as nearly as possible to the number of working hours spent in war work activities by Pi Phis everywhere in active chapters, alumnae clubs, and those Pi Phis not identified with any group. These reports have been based o'n questionnaires tabulated by Ann McDonald D'Aule for active chapters; Ruth Jane Dunlap Wheeler for alumnae clubs; and Mary Foley for Canadian clubs and chapters. Their reports represent a most significant compilation of facts, and an infinite amount of work. Listed below are the contributions and disbursements of the past year which concern the wind up of Pi Phi's own war project.

With V-J Day which followed so soon and the subsequent end to the war emergency, no further solicitation of funds for these scholarships was made. Contributions have come in through the year and additional scholarships have been awarded. Since this report will close with the chairman's recommendation that the committee be dissolved, having served its purpose, it seems altogether fitting that a brief resume of Pi Beta Phi's war work, year by year, should follow: 1. In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.OG to the Red Cross $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed more than fifteen thou sand dollars and up to August 1, 1945, 38 scholar-ships were awarded. 5. With V-J Day, Grand Council agreed with the committee that there should be no further solicitation for funds for this war project, but even so, contributions of nearly $1,400.00 were received this year from clubs and chapters; ten additional girls received scholarships; and three young women who were completing their courses too late to receive commissions in the Army or Navy received supple-mental scholarships to help them through their professional period of readjustment. 6. In addition, Grand Council requested the Committee for War Work of secure a record of Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the war effort this to be reduCed as nearly as possible to the number of working hours spent in war work activities by Pi Phis everywhere in active chapters, alumnae clubs, and those Pi Phis not identified with any group. These reports have been based o'n questionnaires tabulated by Ann McDonald D'Aule for active chapters; Ruth Jane Dunlap Wheeler for alumnae clubs; and Mary Foley for Canadian clubs and chapters. Their reports represent a most significant compilation of facts, and an infinite amount of work. Listed below are the contributions and disbursements of the past year which concern the wind up of Pi Phi's own war project.

A meet ing of Pi Beta Phi members, singing a favorite song? No, the students of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, enthusiastically voicing their loyalty by singing the official school song. "Be thou my messenger Straight to her heart." These students, known throughout an increasingly large area of eastern Tennessee as "the Pi Phis" do send a message to the heart of all Pi Beta Phi fraternity members; and serve to proand anti-fraternity citizens of the outside world as living examples of the finest in fraternity philanthropy. The Settlement School is known also among educators because of its unique division of authority between Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and Sevier County, and because of its emphasis on the training in crafts. The past six years since last convention have seen considerable change in the school system. In 1940, the County was paying the entire salaries of the grade school teachers, $1000 a year rent for the grade school building, and approximately three-fourths toward the salaries of the High School teachers, a total of nearly $12,000.00. The Fraternity advised the County they would expect them to assume complete support of the grade school beginning with the fall of 1943. Following advice secured through two former surveys made by Dean Edwin Holton and Dr. William Taylor, and with excellent legal advice, Ethel Copp, then chair-man, worked through several sessions of the Sevier County Court until, with the aid of loyal Gatlinburg citizens, the lease-agreement presented by the Fraternity was accepted. This has been in operation three years and from all present indications is working remarkably well. Briefly the provisions of the agreement are these: the High School building, equipment, and playground area are leased for a term of 25 years for the sum of $1.00 a year. During that period the County maintains the building in satisfactory repair, replaces and maintains the equipment included in the lease, issues the same supplies as they provide for other schools in the county, and pays the salaries of teachers of a basic educational program including English, mathematics, history and science. By a separate agreement extending until 18 months after it is possible to begin construction, the County also leases our elementary school, paying all costs of maintenance, equipment, and salaries. By the time this lease expires the County is required to build a new grade school on land already purchased by them and adjoining our property. This, as you can see, did not release any great amount of funds formerly contributed by Pi Beta Phi. In reality, Pi Beta Phi exchanged the $1000 received as rental for payment of all maintenance costs of both buildings and the salaries of approximately two high school teachers. This past year the County re-ports expenditures of approximate two Gatlinburg schools. Only $ county school taxes, and the rema funds. With 104 High School and 32E dents, the county funds, even wit cannot adequately care for the a( schools. Pi Beta Phi has furnished supplies each year, has contributed equipment, notably the lovely curt for the auditorium stage partially from Anna De Costello; and has three departments, Arts and Crafts cal Education, The Pi Beta Phi definite school needs amounted to year.

The Music Supervisor, also new this year, and a very evident and splendid addition to our staff, gave regular periods each week to all grade school children, who showed great love and remarkable aptitude for all taught them. The third grade gave a demonstration at a Sevier County Teachers meeting, two grades gave programs for the Weavers meetings, there were numerous appearances at regular school chapel* programs, students from the upper three grades formed an elementary school chorus, and the lower five grades combined to present an operetta, "A Rose Dream," praised by all who saw it as one of the loveliest of its kind. This regular music education experience in the grades, begun first during the second semester of the 1944-45 school year, should, in a few years, eliminate the condition now found in the High School where work with the chorus and glee clubs is severely handicapped because the students lack knowledge in sight-reading. Supervision of art work was given in all grades above the third by the Arts and Crafts teacher. Classes once a week included such fundamental instructions as use of the ruler and compass, with which most of the children had had no previous experience, and concluded with the making of beaver board tiles and coasters. Special grade school projects included the making of a New England village at Thanksgiving time with its log houses, church, and trees; and a creche at Christmas time, their first experience with clay and to many their first knowledge of a creche. As Miss Petrie writes, Baby Jesus slightly resembles the baby sister of its maker, fourth grade Philip Huff, but "to me, who watched these children work, it is beautiful and sweet." Seventh and eighth grade and high school girls were enrolled in regular craft classes meeting in the Emma Harper Turner Craft Center the old Arrow-craft Shop moved and shingled outside and since last ' convention rather considerably improved by new flooring, celotex walls and ceiling, a partition between the weaving and woodworking rooms, and an interior paint job. Here color and design instructions, card weaving, puppetry and all types of four-harness weaving were thoroughly enjoyed. This class combined with the English department to present puppet shows, such as "Haensel and Gretel," and one with the assistance of the Health Center, stressing health habits using the story of the "Three Bears" as a vehicle. High School boys have met with a part-time instructor for regular daily classes in wood-working the last two years, and the 7th and 8th grade boys three times a week the last year. Besides making the puppet stage and several small table looms for the craft classes, the boys made splendid progress in smaller wooden articles. Next year it is hoped another lathe and spraying machine may be added to the equipment and the attic room remodeled to make a finishing-room. Paramount in all work of the Craft Department is the basic consideration that everything taught be of practical value to the children in their own home. This Pi Phi addition to the curriculum seems a wise provision to safeguard the future of handcrafts in this area as well as provide future workers for Arrowcraft. School Future As to the future of our part of the joint county-Pi Phi educational program at ,Gatlinburg, there is every indication that the County will need our assistance for sometime to come, even though they will continue to cooperate to the limit of their ability. Their taxes are already high, but they expect to have to raise them to secure funds for the new grade school building. Even so, the County Superintendent is hopeful they can also secure federal funds, else he fears the amount available will not be adequate to build the type of school desired not only by them but also by Pi Beta Phi, whose approval of the plans is a provision of the lease-agreement. It may well be that in order to insure the building of a school that will be a satisfactory complement to our property, Pi Beta Phi may need to follow Dr. Taylor's advice and either contribute to it ourselves or arouse the Gatlinburg citizens to assist financially with this project. The grade school building returns to Pi Beta Phi when a new building is ready for occupancy, and can then be converted to other needs. A definite decision has not yet been made but the suggestion of Miss Dyer that this be remodeled into a lounge and dining-room for summer Workshop students is worth consideration, as well as its use in the regular Summer Workshop program for additional class-rooms. The County has been ' able to raise salaries considerably during the war period by assistance from Lanham Act funds, made available to them because of their nearness to Oak Ridge and the Alcoa plant. That these will continue even next year is not an established fact, which raises a question as to the County's ability to maintain satisfactory teaching personnel for even the number they are now providing. Any increase in number of teachers provided by them is entirely dependent on comparative needs with other county schools, and the outlook for any immediate increase is extremely doubtful. That they can assume any shareof the three departments Pi Beta Phi is now contributing at any time in the near future is most unlikely, and it is even uncertain they could do so at any time, without assistance from some outside source. Gatlinburg itself may grow because of tourist trade, but the character of the country outside the village limits is such that it is largely dependent upon poor farms for sustenance and handcrafts for income. The Southern Conference of Mountain Workers estimated that the yearly cash income of farmers in the nearby community is as low as $80.00 a year. Gatlinburg support of the school program was the highest it has been this past year. An active PTA furnished, with federal assistance, a fine hot lunch program, even clearing enough to purchase much needed equipment for continued' operation. They aroused the Lions Club to the need for better lighting in the grade school and are raising funds for fluorescent lights to be installed in the present Pi Phi building and removed later to the new county building. This indication of interest in the betterment of the School by local Gatlinburg organizations may bring further contributions of a substantial nature; but the exact extent of regular support is at present very much a question. Gatlinburg has incorporated and is concluding its first full year under a City Manager and Council of three members. Their first project, just completed, was a topographical survey of the town, funds for which were raised by a tax on hotels and tourist courts based on the number of guests they accommodate. Besides the financing of the City Manager's office the present Gatlinburg funds are expended almost entirely for police protection, a vital need in THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 95 a tourist community and one which is even yet poorly met. Their immediate future projects include a city water system and sewage disposal plant. These are to be started this coming summer, it is hoped, financed by bonds soon to be floated. There has been some discussion of a Community Building as the project for consideration after these are completed, but definite plans are dependent upon a variety of conditions including location of a site and the securing of federal funds. Gatlinburg has grown in the period since last Convention. An anticipated drop in tourist visitors due to the war did not materialize, due probably to the nearness of Oak Ridge with its government employees to whom gasoline was furnished for necessary buying in nearby cities, and to others from Knoxville and even farther distances who came and stayed for several weeks because of curtailment of travel. If Gatlinburg is able to build wisely and if contemplated additions to the Smoky Mountain Park and the routing of new highways through other Park entrances does not dissipate their tourist trade, it is altogether probable that Gatlinburg will continue to grow toward a substantial community. For the immediate future there are so many crying needs demanding attention that support of an educational pro-gram does not seem possible of inclusion. Without Pi Beta Phi's continued assistance the schools would suffdr a most severe relapse. Housing A part of our contribution which rightfully belongs with the educational system but which is not an integral part of the school itself is the housing unit. Teachers Cottage houses the office of the Director, a position filled since last convention by Eunice Weaver, who resigned because of ill-health in March, 1941 after seven years with the School; Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, who served two years until family obligations called her to New York; and since then our present capable and delightful Ruth Dyer. This spring a North Carolina recent graduate, Helen Borgstrom, joined the staff as Assistant to the Director. Teachers Cottage also serves as home for most of our resident staff and for those teachers, county paid, whose homes are away from Gatlinburg. Prior to the war members of Pi Beta Phi averaged 50% of the teaching staff. That this has dropped to zero is the fault largely of war wage-levels with which Sevier County could not compete. It is our hope that as conditions adjust (if they do!) we can again interest our own members in this opportunity to serve and gain rich experience, since we are privileged by conditions of the lease-agreement to keep half of the staff Pi Beta Phi's. It is our belief that Pi Beta Phi's can contribute greatly to the school system, though the caliber of teachers maintained through the war period has been extremely fine when we take into consideration their scarcity in rural communities throughout the country. The two dormitories house High School students who could not secure their education without the assistance provided by our arrangement which re-quires payment of $5.00 cash monthly for room and board plus 96 hours of work done by each student. Stuart Dormitory has been built since last convention. Made possible through a bequest from Anne Stuart, former Grand Treasurer, it was completed in 1941 and constitutes a lovely home with its twin living-rooms used for all dormitory student socialaffairs, its first floor suite, and five double and one single room on the second and third floors. Built as a boy's dormitory to replace the former most inadequate building, it has been used for girls the past two years, with the permission of Mary Stuart Kinder. Pollard Cottage now serves as boy's dormitory. One of the oldest buildings on the place, it is in constant need of repair to keep it even presentable. The lower floor houses the kitchen and dining rooms for staff and dormitory students. As second on our list of "musts" for our future program is some re-placement of this building. Now being considered by our architect is a new Staff Residence to house those now living at Teachers Cottage, and including a new modern kitchen and pleasant dining-rooms. Teachers Cottage could then be used as a student dormitory, and Pollard Cottage would serve as housing for some of the staff members. Demonstration Farm Complementary to the housing unit is the Pi Beta Phi demonstration farm. Formerly under the direction of an agricultural teacher, since 1943 it has been in charge of an ex-student of Berea College's agriculture course. During the nine-month school year the dormitory boys work before and after school hours. A small herd of registered jersey cattle, a few pure-bred hogs and a sizeable flock of chickens constitute the live stock on our Pi Phi farm. Begun years ago when Pi Phi gifts brought "Ring Ching Ching" and "Texas" to Gatlinburg, our pure-bred strains have raised the standard of stock in the Gatlinburg community. Vegetables from the garden, milk, cream, butter, eggs and chicken provide the raw materials for the excellent meals served under the guidance of the House Manager; and the surplus is always eagerly purchased by one of the Gatlinburg hotels or stores. 2692/3 dozen eggs were sold during the peak producing month this past year. Additional income is made by the renting of Pi Beta Phi's team of mules, the "horsepower" for plowing, hauling wood and other such farm chores. Health Center The Health Center remains much as it was in 1940 a busy, interesting place with Marjorie Chalmers completing ten years as the competent, kindly nurse in charge. Her reports show an average of 1500 home calls, 2000 office calls and as many surgical dressings a year. The number of inoculations runs over 800 a year, and an average of 2000 school children are given routine physical inspections annually. This year a projector and screen given by Chicago North, and usable with electric current or storage battery, has provided the means for increasing interest in health education talks not only in Gatlinburg but in rural communities as well. Pre-school Round-ups with a Dental Hygienist and Nutritionist from the State Health Department are annual affairs, and this year saw two dental clinics and a promise of longer time for Gatlinburg next year. Special and specific assistance has been given in many types of corrective work, glasses, braces and special shoes being donated by other agencies through our Health Center. Mrs. Chalmers was selected as the recipient of a scholarship given by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis for a special course given last summer at Warm Springs, Ga., and has just completed 6 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW five day refresher course on polio treatment at fonteagle, Tenn. The building now known as the Jennie Nicol [ealth Center is really unsafe for use, due to the wages of time and termites. Preliminary sketches for new Health Center have already been approved and is hoped that work can soon be started on this inch-needed building. It will contain a nurse's office; .inic or first-aid. room; a work-room with cupboards, Ilk, electric oven for sterilization needs; and a large ass-room and adjoining bath for use in the teaching Home Nursing classes as part of the adult educaon program which remains one of the important inctions of the Health Center. A doctor has recently established an office in 4tlinburg, and will considerably reduce the number E' a certain type of demands on our nurse. Her work assistant in the birth of new babies has also lesmed as more and more of the mothers secure doctor's ire for this common occurrence in the area. Howver, the burden of the physical examinations of :udents in our own schools and in the nearby rural :hools not visited by any county nurse or doctor, le regular emergency and first-aid treatments among le students in Gatlinburg and the weavers and thers who still trust only the Pi Phi Nurse, the ioculations, Well-Baby Clinics, and the approxiiately 1500 home calls a year, still means a full :hedule for this member of our staff. !rrowcraft Arrowcraft's year may be summed up in the opening mtence of the report of our excellent Manager, thel Snow: "The year just past should have brought )e alum= clubs and Arrowcraft more closely to-ether than ever before. I am sure we have had the ine thwarted feeling, that opportunity to sell so such more than it was possible to produce." Production levels have been maintained and even icreased each year since last convention. Last year a )tal of 127 weavers were on the Arrowcraft rolls, rith 80 of them working six months or more of aat time, and an average of 80 weavers working at ray one time. Checks totalling $27,647.11 were given weavers for work done from May first of last year May of this. A comparative study showed that last year the [um= clubs received the same percentage of Arrow-raft's output that they had received in 1941, the nal amount increasing from $35,428.18 to 43,701.27, not including an increase in discount from 5 to 20% during that time. Of the remaining suply the 1941 sales showed some $6,000 going to rholesalers. This type of business has been dras-:cally curtailed the last few years, with the con-:nuance only of a limited amount sent to the Southern lighland Handicraft Guild and Southern Highmders shops in Rockefeller Center, Asheville, Nor-[s Dam and Big Meadows. This has been necessary ecause of an understanding with these organizations a which Arrowcraft holds membership. The remaining sales are entered on the books as Cash Sales" but should not be considered entirely s non-Pi Phi tourist sales, since this includes a ansiderable but indeterminable number of sales made Pi Phi's in the Arrowcraft Shop, and all mail rder sales not sent to an alumnae club on consign-lent. One other factor is important in this analysis nd that is that the local Arrowcraft Shop often dislays those items not popular with alumnae clubs andis also used to unload those slightly irregular articles which are good but cannot be sent in alumna club Orders because of variation in size, color, etc. The many problems of distribution for a stock that is unpredictable in amount available at any one time and in total amount, and for which the bulk of the orders arrive at approximately the same time were of real concern to our Arrowcraft staff. Part of this may be removed this coming year by the necessity of a raise in prices on all Arrowcraft articles. This has been needed for some time but OPA regulations to which Arrowcraft strictly adhered prohibited any change except on new items. Now prices may be raised for the same article if cost of production has increased. And you would know, of course, that they have. Not only has the price of threads and yarns been raised by the mills, but effective now is a drop from a former 25% cash discount to a 10% cash discount. Also the weavers are being paid more for their work, as is certainly not out of line with present conditions, especially since one of the primary reasons for Arrow-craft is the financial assistance to women who could not earn in other ways either because of personal attributes or family restrictions. Technically speaking, our weavers are not employees since we require no speed of performance, nor do we dictate any working conditions such as number of hours or date of delivery; they weave at home articles for which we advance the necessary materials and sell the finished product to Arrowcraft. Governmental interpretation of the term "employees" however, indicates a probable inclusion of them under some sort of minimum wage regulations. After an original flurry in 1940, during which some government investigation was made, we were told to continue as previously until further notice. This past fall we were asked to make a survey of a number of our weavers, ascertaining speed of work, and reducing their pay, which is figured by us according to a piece rate, to an average rate per hour. The results showed an average pay of 42 cents an hour for the thirty weavers selected from among those working on various types of weaving and with varying abilities. It is uncertain yet what their application of the Fair Standards Act will be, which as you know is under consideration for a change from the present 40 cent minimum to at least a 55 cent minimum. The results of any necessitated raise in pay to the weavers would automatically include some further raise in selling prices. The outlook for fall, then, would indicate a possible wider variety of articles than last year, many of these lovely new designs of our "Miss Meta," a considerable raise in prices, but no definite promise of a greater over-all quantity than was available last year, since the increasing of production is beyond our control. By staggering club orders over a longer period of time, it might be possible for our Arrowcraft Manager to send a little more on those particular orders which arrived so close together last year that all must be proportionately filled from the same month's de-liveries to the Shop. That she can completely fill any orders if they maintain the same high as last year will be an impossibility that she and Committee regret fully as much, if not more, than the disappointed clubs. Miss Meta Schattschneider, whom we were fortunate enough to secure as Weaving Supervisor upon the resignation last fall of Winogene Redding, who had served so capably for twenty years, has already THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 97 made a very definite contribution through her lovely designs of interesting color combinations, and her ability to work with and for others. She has written three articles to appear in as many issues of Design magazine, the first of which features Arrowcraft and our Summer Workshop. Summer Workshop. The Summer Workshop as such is perhaps a new idea, although the basis for it came out of suggestions made by both Dean Holton and Dr. Taylor when they advised us to develop the Arts and Crafts field of our Settlement School as we gave added responsibility in other educational fields to the County or community. Future possibilities in such a program were outlined by them and enlarged by the former Settlement School Chairman, Ethel Copp, and the Arts and Crafts Advisory Committee inaugurated in her term of office and consisting of Miss Jessie Harris, Head of the Home Economics Department, Miss Ida Anders and Miss Marian Heard, instructors in textiles and crafts at the University of Tennessee. The only immediate practical application of this idea seemed to be the founding of the Summer Work-shop in the summer of 1945 with the University of Tennessee offering graduate and post-graduate credit for courses in weaving, textile decoration, recreational crafts, woodworking, and community recreation taught by a staff selected jointly by the University and Pi Beta Phi. Headed by the well-known originator of the Milwaukee Handicraft Project, Miss Elsa Ulbricht, this group of four excellent craftsmen was enthusiastically followed in a program of classes and laboratory periods which lasted from eight to six and even spilled over into evening hours because of sheer enjoyment in the creation of crafts articles of assorted types and materials. At one of the two open houses marking the end of each three-week period, Miss Onken dedicated the Arts and Crafts Building to Emma Harper Turner in recognition of her efforts toward founding the Settlement School and her continued interest in it through-out her lifetime. The Grand Council and Settlement School Committee and the University of Tennessee Committee in charge were agreed that the first Summer Workshop exceeded all expectations. Students from nineteen states were of unusual caliber, including State Directors of Industrial Arts, Home Demonstration Agents, and Craft Teachers. The program for this summer follows very much the same pattern, as last with Miss Ulbricht and Miss Marian Heard of the University acting as co-directors and with metalcraft added to the curriculum. Four board and room scholarships were offered two to Pi Beta Phis and two to the University of Tennessee students, the recipients to live at the School with another Pi Phi, Carolyn Buck, who will attend classes part-time and take charge of a light luncheon to be prepared and served to the students in the Home Economics room of the High School. Twenty-seven advance registrations to date insure a capacity enrollment this year. There is every indication that if Pi Beta Phi is interested in development of this plan it can be built into a Craft School of considerable prominence. Gatlinburg is an ideal setting, and it is located in the midst of one of the best centers of American handcrafts. Held in the summer it allows use of the High School and Craft Centerbuildings during months when they would otherwise be idle, and makes possible the securing of outstanding craft teachers who hold other positions during winter months. We have land on which summer dormitories and any additional buildings needed could be placed; and the possibilities for broadening the curriculum are numerous, including play production with actual experience before tourist audiences, study and experience in the merchandising of craft articles, and development of the community recreation course to include experience in a well-rounded program of activities using Settlement School facilities. This is an enlargement of our former program of cultivation of the crafts of the Smoky Mountains and specifically the Gatlinburg community, to the furtherance and development of craft education throughout the country by offering excellent instruction in this field to a college-level student body. Through the stimulus and insniration of these Workshops there should result a raising of the quality of craft work in Gatlinburg itself and finally, we hope, the interesting of craft leaders in affiliating themselves with our project in a permanent way that would insure their cooperation with Arrowcraft to open new avenues of income for the handcraft workers of Pi Beta Phi. There is no question but that the immediate needs in Gatlinburg are for continued assistance in the regular school curriculum, for a Health Center pro-gram similar to the present one, for the maintenance of high standards in Arrowcraft production and the marketing of these to insure financial assistance for those who need this means of income ; but as we are able to develop the Summer Workshop project we will be laying the foundation for a future expansion of our enterprise on a basis which should eventually be self-supporting and in a way equally important to Gatlinburg and the future of crafts. If this report has helped to bring to you a picture of the whole project known as the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as it exists at present, with some indication of possible future developments, it has accomplished its purpose. It has been a real privilege and pleasure to serve the past four years on the Settlement School Committee, to work closely with the other members who during that time have included Ethel Copp, Beth Le Roy, Lolita. Prouty, Ann Munn, Emma Woerner and Eugenia Smith, and the new member just beginning her five year term of office, Carlene Holly; to know the understanding and Inspirational assistance of Grand Council and its contact member to our Committee, the Grand President; and to assist to the best of our ability in the many details and constantly changing matters for consideration that make the work at the Settlement School a real task and sometimes a real worry, but always, in spite of this, a real joy also in the knowledge that there Pi Beta Phi is doing such a constructive piece of philanthropy that Edwin Foscue writing of Gatlin-burg in the "Economic Geography" devotes consider-able space to the part played by the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, saying in one instance: "This mountain community, nearly a century and a half old; completely isolated from the rest of the country for more than a century, became known first through the lumbering industry and later through the establishment of a Settlement School" and again: "the Gatlinburg community is certainly indebted to the Fraternity for the work of the school in the community." MILDRED SALE, Chairman 98 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR TIME moves swifter than a weaver's shuttle, even one in the experienced hands of a Pi Phi weaver. The terrible war is over with people everywhere be-ginning to talk of memorials to be erected honoring war heroes. Many agree that the day of statues is past and that living memorials will best express the gratitude flowing from our hearts. Pi Beta Phi had such an idea in mind when the Settlement School was founded, not to honor war heroes but our be-loved founders. Through the years the natural beauty all around us, orderly living, willing service to bodies, minds, and hearts has gone steadily forward enriching the lives of many. Changes come but by constant adjustments we can continue to serve the Gatlinburg Community. Community This year has marked the passing of two good friends of the School. Charlie Ogle died in December of 1945 and Aunt Lizzie Reagan in March of 1946. They are missed, for both filled a place in the life of the village that was a unique one. This summer of 1946 finds Gatlinburg's main street much changed by the addition of a number of new buildings. The Ogle store has been changed into a Super-Market. The drug stock was moved across the street to the old Annex, now the bus depot. The Log Cabin has been razed. On that site construction on a large new structure which is to _house a movie theater, several shops with office rooms above is well started. The Methodist congregation has the foundation laid for a stone chapel. This is to be located on the hill above the Cliff Dwellers Shop on a lot donated to them by Mr. and Mrs. Jones. Mr. Barber is the architect. His design is most attractive in the pictures. Ray Whaley, back from the service, has built a new hotel named Edge Park Inn on land between the Riverside and the New Gatlinburg Inn. It has twenty-five guest rooms and the dining room is to accommodate two hundred. Earl Ogle has erected an office building for the new doctor adjacent to the Ogle Store, Along the river, Mrs. Allen, of Laurel Springs resort, built two attractive shops on the highway side. They do cut off a lovely view of the river, a circumstance that seems a pity. A number of other business places have been enlarged, smaller shops and eating stands have been erected all along the highway! The main street is fast becoming that of a typical resort town. The effects of incorporation of the village which was voted last year are not yet very apparent. A large, detailed map of the area and preliminary surveys for water and sewer lines have been made by the city manager and his staff. The council spent much time formulating various ordinances governing the operation and taxation of different businesses. In this town they are almost exclusively devoted to the tourist trade. Some added police protection has been secured. This is used mostly to control traffic and disturbances due to liquor. School Many problems have come up during the year with changes in personnel in the teaching staff in some grades a major one. Fortunately we had several strong teachers, and were able to manage somehow with substitutes and end the year with the required work completed. It was again necessary to have one room in which we had two grades. The Elementarybuilding was so crowded that the beginners were placed over in the back room at the high school building. In the high school there was a change in the English teacher at the end of the first semester. Miss Fenn wished to go to Columbia for further work in Library Science. We were fortunate in securing Mrs. Ann Lighter for the position. She has recently moved to town, she and her husband own a home here. She has taught English and best of all had charge of all High School libraries in the state of Michigan for two years prior to her marriage. She is a real addition to the staff. She coached the successful senior play, "He Couldn't Marry Five." The work of the three teachers supplied by the fraternity to supplement the County program added much to the enjoyment of the students as well as giving them something of value in Music, Physical Education and Crafts. Mrs. Stanley Armstrong used the old Agriculture room for her class room for the music work. The children responded well to her excellent teaching. The Grade School Operetta, Rose Dream, was one of the best that I have seen here. She trained a chorus from the sixth, seventh and eighth grades that delighted everyone with their singing at the Elementary School graduation program. The Glee Club did very well at the various Commencement events. Mr. Don Spargo, as Phyiscal Education instructor, worked hard with the students in regular classes as well as coaching both a boys and girls team in basket ball. Our victories were not too many for we were pitted against teams of much more experience and from larger schools but the spirit was fine. Through donations from various business houses and individual friends a fund of $351.00, was secured for new warm-up jackets for the boys team. These were ordered last December but to date have not been de-livered due to shortages of materials. When our teams played away from home they reflected credit upon their coach and the school. In the craft department Miss Elizabeth Petrie worked with the grade school children and the girls in the high school craft class while Mr. Carl Huskey devoted two hours in the morning to the boys teaching wood working. The boys made a number of small looms that were used by the girls in the simpler types of weaving. The boys also made the wooden stage for a puppet theater; the girls wove the little curtains and made the , puppets. Several shows were given to very appreciative audiences. One play was the "Three Bears" with health problems woven into the story by one of the girls, "Hansel and Gretel" with music rforn the opera was given at Open House. The weaving done by the girls was of exceptionally good quality both in design and in workmanship. Home Economics instruction included work in nutrition, sewing, and designing of clothes for the girls themselves and work for various relief agencies. One class cleaned and decorated one room at the school to be used as a future rest room for the girls. A course in home nursing resulted in the girls being given the Red Cross awards for completing the regular course. In this work Miss Landrum has a very good opportunity to teach the girls many things in personal grooming, clothing care, suitability of dress, good manners and ways of entertaining. When our Gatlinburg girls go to any other town they are THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 99 always complimented upon their excellent appearance. We graduated a class of sixteen seniors. A number of them expect to go on for more training. The class made their annual trip to Atlanta, had the usual banquet tendered them by the Juniors and gave their class night program before Commencement. The speakers were good at both the Baccalaureate and Commencement programs. We have had good cooperation from the Sevier County authorities but have been hampered all year by the war time shortages of repair materials needed for buildings, furnaces, etc. The county constructed a new brick smoke stack to the large boiler room and paid for half of a new incinerator to take care of waste paper from the school. Mr. Kelley Huskey coached a team of girls in Sevierville for schools of their size. His Eighth Grade basketball class which won the Elementary tournament, was smaller than usual, eleven girls and eleven boys finished the course. All intend to come to high school this fall. Community interest in school affairs has increased. Sometimes the crowds at events such as our Open House and the Operetta were almost more than we could take care of. The P.T.A. has functioned all year and has ambitious plans for the future. They sponsored the hot lunch program, purchased a large electric refrigerator for the lunch room and have started raising money to install better lighting in the elementary building. The T.V.A. are supervising the planning of this improvement. In addition to new lights it calls for new paint in the class rooms of the elementary school building. The county, will pay for the paint but the P.T.A. must put it on. Different things have been done to raise the money. The Lions Club helped materially when they gave two performances of the "Womanless Wedding" for the benefit of the fund. A bow supper, a bingo party, and rummage sales have all been held but there is still much to be raised. Farm We are gradually building up our herd of cattle from the jersey calves born on the place. We have milk for our own use and in these days of butter shortages feel rich in that we can churn our own butter. Carl, the farm man, is good with poultry. We produce all of our own eggs, sell many dozens to the Mountain View Hotel, have chicken for the table and supply the hotel with some fryers in the summer time. During the highest producing month we sold 2692/3 dozen eggs to the hotel. This number dropped to 68 dozen in the lowest producing month. This spring much time has been spent on repairing the fences around the different lots. We used a lot of old wire and for posts the men went to the woods on the hills back of the place. They dragged down fallen chestnut logs and in some cases felled young trees. Our garden supplies us with all sorts of fresh vegetables, potatoes enough to last through the winter, tomatoes and beans for canning and berries in season. We sell some surplus that would otherwise spoil. Dormitory We have had four boys and six girls for Most of the year in residence at the school. Three of the girls graduated this spring. One is already married to a returned soldier, one will go on to school and the third one will possibly go to business college. Again this year most of the money owed to the school hasbeen paid. Last year every account was settled before school started in the fall, sometimes with money the student had earned during the summer. I expect that to be the case this year. Stuart Dormitory has been the scene of a number of parties planned and given by the girls and boys. The town children seem to like to come there for school affairs. Our own young people gain confidence in themselves as they play the part of hostesses. Arrowcraft Changes have also taken place in this department, the chief one of these being that Miss Meta Schattschneider has replaced Miss Gene Redding as de-signer and weaving supervisor. Gene had been such a part of the weaving program for so many years that her successor had to be chosen with care. We feel that Miss Meta has been a very wise choice. She has gained the friendship and confidence of the weavers to a marked degree. Her new designs are distinctive. They are gradually getting into production and are meeting with public approval. Since all threads have gone up in price and living costs are so much higher it has been necessary to raise our prices to meet these costs when that is possible under OPA rulings. The value of our products is unquestioned, the demand almost unlimited while the quantity that can be produced is definitely limited by the very factor that produces their value--"Made By Hand." In February 1946 the weavers' checks amounted to $3,376.09, the highest amount ever written for one month. During that same month the monthly average of weavers working was 83.96 which was only about 3 points under the highest number of weavers working in any one month of the year. Mrs. Snow has tried hard to satisfy the clubs and to keep both of our local shops supplied with at-tractive merchandise. At times this has been almost impossible. By last autumn the shelves in the stock room were almost bare while bouquets of beautiful colored leaves in large containers could not cover up the fact that our stock was very low. Health Center Another year of service to the community has been added to the fine record that Mrs. Chalmers has made as the Pi Phi nurse. Her duties are so varied that it is always difficult to enumerate all of them. Routine inspections of the school children, inoculations, hours devoted to a weekly clinic day, class room talks on home nursing and home visits are just a few of the things that she takes as a matter of course. They all help to make the people of the community healthier and happier. It has helped make the work of the nurse easier to have a young doctor in town. He is just out of the army and is becoming well established. The new projector, gift of Chicago North Alumnae Club, has added interest to class room instruction. The children in the rural schools have especially enjoyed the little movies and health pictures. Sigma Phi Gamma has again contributed to our work. Mrs. Chalmers was asked to attend a Polio re-fresher course at Monteagle, Tennessee this month. Here the latest equipment for fighting this disease was demonstrated and plans for organizing the community, in case of an epidemic, were worked out. This invitation came as the natural result of the school she had attended at Warm Springs, Georgia last year. We at the school have appreciated the many gifts THE SEPTEMBER ARROW by actives, alumnae clubs, and individual Pi Phis. know that a rummage sale in far off Oregon, azine subscriptions solicited by some club chair-. in the middle west, clever benefits arranged by sge girls or alumnae clubs, and the sale of Arrow-t products all represent thought, time and effort :he part of our members. The school benefits and I know that the individuals experience a satisfaction in working for our project. Personally the unselfish devotion of Committee and Grand Council Members to the work of the School is a constant inspiration to me. I thank you for it.

TYPE OF WORK PREFERRED ARROWCRAFT SHOP STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENSES Year Ended June 30, 1946 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW Committee Reports COMMITTEE FOR WAR WORK 111 N PRESENTING this report it will be recalled that the report of last year covered all contributions and disbursements of Physical Therapy Scholarships up to August 1, 1945. With V-J Day which followed so soon and the subsequent end to the war emergency, no further solicitation of funds for these scholarships was made. Contributions have come in through the year and additional scholarships have been awarded. Since this report will close with the chairman's recommendation that the committee be dissolved, having served its purpose, it seems altogether fitting that a brief resume of Pi Beta Phi's war work, year by year, should follow: 1. In August, 1940, Pi Beta Phi contributed $5,000.OG to the Red Cross $4,000.00 was given to the American Red Cross and $1,000.00 to the Canadian Red Cross. 2. During the year 1942-1943, the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund was chosen as the NUMBER ONE War Project of the fraternity; Grand Council transferred $4,000.00 from the Contingent Fund to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 11 scholarships were immediately awarded. 3. During the year 1943-1944, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed nearly ten thousand dollars to the Physiotherapy Scholarship Fund, and 20 scholarships were awarded during that year. 4. During the year 1944-1945, active chapters and alumnae clubs contributed more than fifteen thou sand dollars and up to August 1, 1945, 38 scholar-ships were awarded. 5. With V-J Day, Grand Council agreed with the committee that there should be no further solicitation for funds for this war project, but even so, contributions of nearly $1,400.00 were received this year from clubs and chapters; ten additional girls received scholarships; and three young women who were completing their courses too late to receive commissions in the Army or Navy received supple-mental scholarships to help them through their professional period of readjustment. 6. In addition, Grand Council requested the Committee for War Work of secure a record of Pi Beta Phi's contribution to the war effort this to be reduCed as nearly as possible to the number of working hours spent in war work activities by Pi Phis everywhere in active chapters, alumnae clubs, and those Pi Phis not identified with any group. These reports have been based o'n questionnaires tabulated by Ann McDonald D'Aule for active chapters; Ruth Jane Dunlap Wheeler for alumnae clubs; and Mary Foley for Canadian clubs and chapters. Their reports represent a most significant compilation of facts, and an infinite amount of work. Listed below are the contributions and disbursements of the past year which concern the wind up of Pi Phi's own war project.
