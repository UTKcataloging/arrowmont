        Settlement School It eports REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE DURING the recent anti-fraternity flare which has been receiving undue publicity in magazines and newspapers throughout the land there have been numerous comments, also, in justification of fraternities, their ideals and their values. Of this latter point, Julia Fuqua Ober has said, "Only in proportion to the services we render to a world in need do we justify our right to existence." While I am sure Mrs. Ober would include as part of these services the values a fraternity gives to its own membership in such fields as leadership training, nevertheless those services which go beyond these limits are certainly the most tangible, the most noticeable evidences to the world at large of the ideals and standards for which that fraternity stands. That is one reason Pi Beta Phi has received such a tremendous ovation from those who understand the purposes and values of our Settlement School project. With the endorsement of the Pi Beta Phi Convention held at Swampscott, the Settlement School has continued this past year along the lines established by the lease-agreement with Sevier County, and those recommended by Dr. Holton and Dr. Taylor in their surveys for the future development of our project in the Smokies. With 120 High School and 330 grade school pupils this past year, it is hoped that the average attendance maintained a sufficient figure to insure the county providing at least an additional grade teacher for the coming year. A state sales tax begun June 1, 1947, is to finance a flat three hundred dollar a year raise for all teachers, and this should make it possible for Gatlinburg to have adequate instructors from county and state funds up to the number of teachers they provide. This year the county provided 9 grade and 5 High School teachers. Pi Beta Phi has again assisted materially by adding three full-time and one part-time instructors: a music supervisor, a physical education instructor and coach, a supervisor in Arts and Crafts, and a woodworking instructor. These departments have shown considerable development and have been greatly appreciated by the Gatlinburg citizens. Returning to us was Mr. William King, formerly of our school staff, who served this year as Superintendent during the leave of absence granted to former Superintendent Ben Fleming. Ben has decided to enter the field of mathematics teaching without administrative responsibilities and so will not be returning to Gatlinburg, which loses to Pi Beta Phi a loyal friend and fine superintendent, as well as an excellent first grade teacher since his wife, Josephine, will accompany him to his new position. Mr. King reports an unusually high standard of teaching this past year, as once again, after the war-time period which forced the acceptance of teachers without degrees, all High School teachers were graduates of standard colleges. The Iowa High School Content Examinations were given the students and the resulting scores rated most favorably with the national average. The Physical Education instructor, Mr. Joe B. Johnson, met the High School students three times a week and the sixth, seventh and eighth grade students twice a week for forty-five minute periods. Ten minutes of each period were spent in exercises, the rest in sports of various kinds with basketball remain-ing the major event. The boys' team played two tournament games, and the girls' team three, being defeated only in the final game and thereby winning, as a finalist, the first basketball trophy for Gatlinburg. Equipment costing $238 was purchased from game receipts and much-needed bleachers were built around the edge of the gymnasium floor to accommodate partially the large crowds that witness all home games. Musically the school has continued to develop under the expert guidance of Mrs. Aletha Armstrong, Music Supervisor. Each grade sang numbers at Assembly periods, the lower six grades presented "The Mad-caps," operetta, and an elementary school chorus sang at the Promotion Day exercises. A one-hundred voice High School Chorus was most enthusiastic and developed a considerable appreciation for better music, aided greatly by the playing of records on the new phonograph. Three part songs were introduced for the first time in programs given by the High School Glee Club. In the Arts 'and Crafts Department a varied pro-gram was followed by Miss Elizabeth Petrie, and Mr. Carl Huskey. This included a variety of wood-working for the boys, and for the girls the weaving, which began with table-loom work in the sixth grade and progressed to lovely material for blouses made by the High School girls, and beginning pottery, leather work and textile decoration, in which the seventh and eighth grade girls painted stencils on cloth. Field trips to weavers, nearby craftspeople, and a new pottery at Pigeon Forge were enjoyed. Pi Beta Phi made several contributions and gifts to the regular school equipment this past year, aside from those given by individual members and clubs. To the P.T.A. fund for fluorescent lights in the grade school, the Settlement School treasury contributed $200.00 ; to the Music Department a lovely phonograph and the start of a record library were given from the Memorial Fund, and four dozen chairs for use in the music classes were supplied from regular funds; to the library was added the World Book Encyclopedia; and most expensive and definitely most appreciated was the addition of indoor bathroom facilities at the grade school building. These included four showers so that the building can be used as a dormitory for the Summer Workshop students. The County purchased a power lawn-mower for the playground area, and an additional sump-pump for removing flood waters from around heating equipment. Besides the fluorescent lights mentioned above, the P.T.A. repainted the grade school in attractive pastel shades, and purchased new shades for many of the class-rooms and a merry-go-round for the children (Its first day brought emergency calls for the nurse to look after youngsters who didn't know whirling round and round would upset those not accustomed to it!) The dormitories` have been about back to pre-war levels, and it was indeed a satisfaction to know that a "house-father" was in residence in the boy's dormitory, this year once again housed in Pollard Cottage with the girls remaining in Stuart. Under the director of the house-father, Joe B. Johnson, and Helen Borgstrom, Assistant to the Di-rector, several social affairs and supervised play periods have been inaugurated for the dormitory 72 THE SEPTEMBER ARRO`Xw 73 students. Ping-pong on the porch at Pollard was enjoyed most of the year except when aA Y -Teen forced the players to warmer play-rooms. group sponsored by Helen completed its first year with some degree of success. The time has now come for the building of Pnew hi grade school. According to the County-Pi Agreement of 1943, the County is supposed to build this on property bought by them adjoining Pi Beta Phi's land. This plot is now considered inadequate by the State School Building Planning Commission who surveyed the Sevier County system this spring. The Court of Sevier County, which has the authority in all such county school matters, is now w a studying tac ceptable various possibilities for the securing to the state, since they are desirous of receiv ing financial assistance from the state sales tax, a part of which has been allocated for school building. By committee and Grand Council approval, Mr. Philip Elwood, Head of the Landscape Architecture Department of Iowa State College, was engaged to make a survey of the Pi Beta Phi property and pre-pare for our consideration a plan for the future development of the grounds and buildings. This has grown into a many-sided service since in his studies he had occasion to consult with a newly-organized Gatlinburg City Planning Commission and has worked with them to a very considerable degree on the location of water and sewer lines and other civic improvements planned by Gatlinburg even though their limited budget and the failure to date of securing bids they could , accept have so far prevented the beginning of even the most necessary of these: the water and sewer systems. Health Center Health Center has maintained its steady program of clinics, calls, and examinations, albeit there have been requests from time to time for assistance from the maintenance department to insure a continued safe flooring for the building. It is with great anticipation that we await the spading of the first shovelful of dirt for the new Health Center for which the con-tract has now been let, after plans and specifications were approved by the nurse, Grand Council and Committee, to be erected probably on the highway near Arrowcraft, in accordance with Mr. Elwood's plan.' Fifty-one new babies were added to the Health Center rolls, and ten extra Well Baby Clinics were held last summer these in addition to the regular Friday afternoons held regularly each week throughout the year. Two Pre-School Clinics again brought the assistance of State Dentists and Nutritionists. It would seem that with these, and the regular school examinations, plus the corrective work in dentistry, eye examinations and glasses, tonsillectomies, and extra milk that Nurse Marjorie has been able to supply from gifts to the Health Center work, the children of Gatlinburg and the nearby community are indeed being served by Pi Beta Phi in a most satisfactory manner. The purchase of eight dark-blue full-length curtains has made it possible to use the projector during day-time visits to schools, and thereby give health instruction in an interesting mariner, much enjoyed by the audience. Pi Beta Phi's service to Gatlinburg is most personal, undoubtedly, in the relationships between "Miz Chalmers" and her "children" and Miss Meta and her weavers, who call her "Boss Lady." As Marjorie has said, "It is through the work of the Health Center that one feels the pulse of the community." Arrowcraft Arrowcraft reached an all-time high with the payment of almost $5,000.00 to 120 weavers in November, 1946. Shelves were well-filled for the summer tourist season and it is expected that the alumnm club orders may be more adequately filled this fall than in several recent years. Though concerned for a time by the return of considerable quantities of articles by some alumnm clubs after a few years of "no returns," Mrs. Ethel Snow, as Arrowcraft's capable Manager, with Laura remaining even after her marriage this year, Mrs. Cole still serving as book-keeper, adequate assistants and a new cash-register and refinished floors in the sales rooms, is ready for the strenuous days ahead which they will meet in the same efficient manner as in the past. Miss Meta has been plagued with another Wage and Hour Survey, which seems to be "forever with us," but even so has produced a number of new designs which have been enthusiastically received as a general rule. Among these is the lovely Queen Anne luncheon set made of linen imported from Ireland. Cotton boucle in warm colors was used in the design of new curtains, woven by Arrowcraft for the Mountain View Hotel lobby. A promise of more thread and even cashmere and necktie warp, indicates that soon most of the items which had to be discontinued during the war will again be in production. The Weavers' Guild has had an interesting year, the highlight being the Christmas meeting held in the main sales room at Arrowcraft, where the high-beamed ceiling, the lovely Christmas angels made by Miss Meta, burning logs in the fireplace and the sweet sound of Christmas carols played on the new phonograph gave many of the seventy weavers attending the nicest party of their experience. Summer Workshop The year 1946-47 brought to completion the three year period of experimentation which was originally outlined for the project now known as the Summer Workshop in Crafts and Community Recreation, con-ducted by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee. This summer our staff included as Director, Miss Marion Heard of the University of Tennessee craft department, who was co-Director last summer, instructor in Jewelry and Metalcraft; Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Starr Sullivan, Pi Beta Phi member, formerly at the University of Washington and of Oregon, weaving instructor; June Glass, also from the University of Tennessee, teaching recreational crafts and leatherwork ; Mary Katherine Overholt, Pi Phi from Ames, assistant in crafts. Mrs. Josephine Bakke, with us for the past two summers as Instructor in Community Recreation served this summer in a dual capacity, continuing her class teaching on a laboratory basis and serving as Dean of Women and Social Director. She organized the student body for such routine procedures as the "line" in the dining-room, the clearing of tables, and for their play times together. Under her guidance a very gratifying school-spirit developed, especially among those living at the School, with a sort of undesignated student government which eliminated the need for many rules in black and white and still maintained well-regulated dormitories. Mr. Allen Eaton, outstanding authority on American Crafts and author of the excellent book "Handicrafts of the Southern Highlands," was special lecturer for a three-week period, overlapping the two sessions of the Summer Workshop. In charge of the dining-room and kitchen were four Institutional Man74 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW agement Majors selected by Miss Jessie Harris, of the University of Tennessee, two graduate students from her department dividing the planning and business duties, with another University of Tennessee student and one from Iowa State College assisting. This gave them excellent training and provided the students with well-balanced and nicely varied meals. Ninety-five students, including several Pi Phis, were enrolled during the six-week period, from thirty-three states and Hawaii. Refunds of pre-registration deposits had to be returned to an additional twenty-seven because of lack of housing facilities. For the first time this year Pi Beta Phi undertook to house a large majority of the students. With the assistance of the University of Tennessee the grade school building was converted into an unbelievably delightful dormitory, with the entrance hall an attractive lounge with easy chairs, couches, lamps and coffee table. The University was able to allocate to the Summer Workshop some of the materials furnished to them by the Government from surplus commodities and this allowed the furnishing of this dormitory with folding cots, mattresses, mattress covers, blankets, sheets, pillow cases, towels, chests of drawers, and mirrors sufficient to house thirty students, or more. They also furnished folding tables and chairs for class room use. Pi Beta Phi provided pillows, lamps, chairs, screens, and the other necessary items to make housing possible, as well as additional dishes and silver for the dining-room. Other Summer Workshop students were housed in Stuart Dormitory (a total of ten, with two in a room) and two in single rooms at Health Center. While some of the students, such as Mrs. O. W. Bahl, who drove from Cosby each day to attend classes, were taking the courses in order to produce beautiful articles for their own home or personal use, others such as the two owners of a tea-room and gift shop in the Ozark Mountains, hope to introduce their own handiwork into commercial avenues. The large majority, however, are expecting to use the knowledge gained in teaching: one, for example, to the veterans in an Iowa City hospital; another, who will soon join her radiobiologist husband abroad, to children in Japan ; and many to rural communities all over the United States where the people need the same sort of economic assistance that Pi Beta Phi has given so adequately to Gatlinburg through Arrow-craft. Of the Open House at the close of the Workshop, "Miss Georgie" (our weaver of lovely afghans) wrote: "The work was exquisite and the display arrangement very, very artistic.. . . We had a very large crowd and some very surprised people at the variety and splendid workmanship." While everyone has cooperated beautifully to make this Workshop a success, I wish particularly to mention the inspirational guidance given this project by Miss Jessie W. Harris, without whose vision and ability it could not have been accomplished, and the great contribution made by Miss Ruth Dyer, Director, upon whose capable shoulders were necessarily placed the endless details of preparation in converting the grade school into a dormitory and making ready the entire Settlement School facilities for the sizeable influx of Summer Workshop students, forty-two of whom were housed at the same time and some sixty-seven fed at the School. My very deepest thanks to them and to those who have contributed in other ways to make this venture possible: Miss Meta, who designed the cover for the attractive announcements, Helen Borgstrom, Miss Hodgens, Arlie and Elvin, and others of our regular school staff ; Miss Ruth Buckley, Mr. William Bevis, and those from the University of Tennessee who have consistently worked with Pi Phi on Workshop plans. Dr. William Taylor, of the University of Kentucky, who made the extensive survey for the Pi Phi Settlement School in 1941, said of the Workshop in a letter sent me recently: "I was greatly pleased to re. ceive information concerning your summer workshop. This is an excellent service that should result in wide-spread interest in your program and in large learning in the arts and crafts field. I am delighted that the University of Tennessee is cooperating with you so helpfully." It is my own personal hope that Pi Beta Phi can continue in some form the idea which gave the Summer Workshop birth, since it benefits not only Gatlin-burg but many parts of the United States by increasing knowledge of the crafts and their place in child and adult education. Surely we might well continue this particular phase of our project when it reaches out over such a large area and brings heart-warming words of appreciation from those interested in the beneficial influence of craft education. It was my privilege to close my term of office as Settlement School Chairman with a visit to Gatlin-burg to assist with the opening of this year's Summer Workshop. I also had the pleasure of attending the opening night of the Gateway Stock Company, a group of graduates of the American Academy. of Dramatic Art under the guidance of Mr. John Richards, who leased the High School Auditorium for a nine-weeks period this summer and 4ve been presenting exceptionally well-produced plays to Gatlinburg and its tourists. The timing of this visit was such that I was able to assist with the hostessing when the Grand Council, Province Presidents, and Vice Presidents arrived for their meeting this June. A trip of the School was arranged for them, starting at the Mountain View Hotel through the pasture to Health Center where Marjorie Chalmers showed her excellent system of records ; to Stuart Cottage, Pollard and Teachers Cottages to see where and how our staff and dormitory students live; through the converted Grade School Dormitory; to Arrowcraft where Mrs. Snow and Miss Meta explained their respective parts of this fine establishment; through the Arts and Crafts and High School buildings where classes of the Workshop were in process and where the visiting officers heard the new phonograph and met Mrs. Armstrong and Mrs. Ann Lighter, librarian. It was indeed a real joy to meet these fine leaders of our Fraternity and to help show them as much as could be "walked and talked" about the Settlement School "on the ground" in the time which could be allocated for this in their full and interesting program. It has been a real privilege to serve on the Committee that has, for a relatively short time, concerned itself with the shaping of those "most realistic, prac. tical, motivating forces in the world" the ideals of Pi Beta Phi as exemplified in our Settlement School project. "The joys of knowing you" have been great, and the experience gained will be a never-ending source of satisfaction. To those who have served with me, my deepest thanks for unfailing cooperation and thoughtful consideration of all matters presented to us for action; to those just now entering their term of office, may you know the same joy and happiness we have known as you work together for Pi Beta Phi's "demonstration of practical idealism." Respectfully submitted, MrLDRED SALE THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR 75 H ERE at the Settlement School, each day is filled with duties and problems. To pause and review the past year is to reca 11 happy associations with staff members, students, townspeople, and visiting Pi Phis paying both official and casual visits to the School. Some of the problems that loomed so large at the time they occurred are minimized by the later view point. The whole picture adds up to just another year of service to the community where in past years Pi Beta Phi has contributed so much of value. My work has been much easier by having Helen Borgstrom, North Carolina A, as my able assistant. The growth of the Summer Workshop has meant a great deal of added work in the way of correspondence, registration and bookkeeping which was capably handled by Helen. Community The year has seen many changes in the village. Some were good others detracted from the charm of the place. Two new buildings have been built that are decided additions to the town. The new Methodist Church, built of native stone, on the hill above the Cliff Dwellers Shop, is one of these. Since the fall conference that congregation has had a full time minister. While the church is not yet complete the congregation is holding services there. Another building is the large structure that Rellie Maples erected on the main street. It is in the same type of architecture as the New Gatlinburg Inn and is most attractive. It houses the second movie theater in town, a number of shops with offices on the second floor. Other cheap and poorly constructed buildings, housing various forms of entertainment and shops are to be deplored. The water and sewer systems so badly needed exist only on paper. The lowest bid for them was over a million dollars which is too much for the village to finance. We do have a new fire truck that pumps water from streams when manned by volunteers. Community social life has been much more active with many organizations again functioning after war time slumps. The Little Pigeon Alumnie Club became active again and enjoyed several fine meetings. Founders' Day was celebrated with the newly organized Knoxville Club at the Gatlinburg home of Miss Jessie Harris and Miss Ida Anders of the University of Tennessee. The American Legion and Legion Auxiliary were both active. The Legion held volley ball games in the school gymnasium during the winter. They celebrated Navy Day with a big banquet at one of the hotels. The Auxiliary held a number of functions also in the gymnasium; a Christmas party for their children and covered dish suppers for their families. In the spring they entertained the boys and girls of the school basketball teams at a lovely banquet at the Inn. The Ladies Bridge Club sponsored a Polio Fund benefit and the Village Library Board held their usual benefit to meet their yearly budget. In the name of the Fraternity, the Director entertained the ladies of the three church societies at meetings at Teacher's Cottage and the February meeting of the Garden Club was also held here. The first peace time Christmas was marked by having the loveiy_ tree across from the Arrowcraft shop F rightly lighted during the holiday week. The Baptist and Methodist churches held a union service the evening of Christmas Sunday which was followed by carol singing around the lighted tree. Union serviceswere also held at Thanksgiving time. Mrs. Armstrong, our music teacher, was in charge of the music both times. Miss Meta arranged a very lovely Christmas party for her Weavers. It was held in the beautifully decorated Arrowcraft shop. She had Christmas records played on the new school record player. Refreshments in holiday colors and a gift exchange made it a very happy affair. School Less trouble with changing personnel in the teaching staff was experienced this year than for several years. In the high school where we had 116 students registered, Mr. Wm. King replaced Ben Fleming as Principal. Ben spent the year at Columbia working on an advanced degree. Mrs. Estel Owenby and Mr. King divided the classes in science and mathematics. Mrs. Ann Lighter taught English and was in charge of the library. Mrs. Reba Hood was the teacher of history and social science. The other County teacher was Miss Sue Landrum, the vocational teacher of home-economics. The special teachers hired by the Fraternity were Mr. J. B. Johnson, physical education, Mrs. Stanley Armstrong, music, Miss Elizabeth Petrie, crafts and weaving and Mr. Carl Huskey, wood-working. The work of this faculty resulted in a well rounded program. The senior class was small, only eleven graduating at the Commencement exercises in May. Many extracurricular activities interested the students during the year. Under Mr. Johnson basketball enjoyed a great popularity. The teams played many games both at home and away. In the County Tournament at Sevierville the Girl's team won the Runner-up trophy. A branch of the National Beta Club was organized for the students having the higher averages. Three of the girls attended the state convention of the society in Nashville. Miss Landrum sponsored a club of her home economics girls called Future Home Makers of America and Helen worked with a Y-Teen group of girls. During the year the three upper classes all presented plays. The seniors made their trip to Myrtle Beach in Carolina. Parties for the different classes were held at intervals the most elaborate being the Junior banquet to the Seniors and Faculty at the Riverside Hotel. Following the .Class night program we entertained the seniors and faculty at a party at Teachers' Cottage. Nine teachers taught in the Elementary grades, two of them having two grades in a room. Mrs. Armstrong worked with the grade school children to give two very fine programs. The first one was the good pro-gram called Carols of Many Lands, given for the entire school at Christmas time.. Later in the year she presented ,tie annual play or operetta called Madcaps. The costumes were colorful and the singing of high quality. An Open House held one evening gave the teachers opportunity to show the parents the work being done by the children. Miss Petrie's classes made a good, showing with added interest in the exhibits of craft work done in the different grades. There were twenty four graduates of the eighth grade, all of whom expect to enter high school in the fall. The P. T. A. was very active all year, contributing much to the school program. Bingo games during the summer, rummage sales and suppers were all used to earn money for their projects. The most ambitious one of these was to install fluorescent lights in the 76 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW old grade school building. They also paid for painting the interior of this building with paint furnished by the county. They operated the school hot lunch pro-gram for the children of the Elementary School. Some needed ,shades and playground equipment were also purchased with their funds. Pi Beta Phi installed new indoor toilets and showers in the same building. The county purchased a new sump pump for the large furnace room. We hope that this will eliminate having a flooded basement the next time there is a flood in the village. Committee purchased a fine record player from the Memorial Fund and forty eight folding chairs for the music room. Clubs and friends have helped with gifts of records that are enjoyed by the whole school. Dormitory Improvements made during the past year include refinishing the floors in the downstairs at Pollard and upstairs at Stuart. Some new linens, dishes and silver, available for the first time since the war, were secured for the house, The help situation was a difficult one all year. Miss Hodgen, in charge of the housekeeping, has trained four cooks and two laundresses besides doing the work herself when it was necessary. Dormitory life has been pleasant for the twelve children living at the school. Mr. Johnson was in charge of the four boys at Pollard. He was generous with his time and his car taking the boys on a number of interesting trips and hikes. A ping pong table on the porch provided a great deal of entertainment when the weather was suitable. Of the eight girls living at Stuart, five were freshmen. Miss Hodgen supervises their duties in the dining room and kitchen and serves as their housemother. Helen helped the dormitory students in a social way with the planning of parties and picnics for the group and their friends. All have settled their cash obligations in full and with the exception of the two girls who graduated, all expect to return next fall. Farm Carl Ogle, farm manager, has carried on the work of the farm through the usual trials and difficulties. The power has a way of going off just when we have baby chicks in the brooder houses, a fox or possum will get in the chicken yards, rain wets the hay etc. The dormitory boys, with their regular assigned jobs, help with the farm work. When there is nothing else to do they attack the wood pile of fallen timbers from our own place, cutting logs for the fires we burn in the fireplaces in spring and fall. The registered Jersey cattle in our herd were tested for T. B. and Bang's Disease by competent veterinarians. The results were negative in both cases. Another improvement was to have the apple orchard pruned by a class of Veterans from Sevierville. These men were students of a former agriculture teacher at the school, Mr. Willie Coe. Our cows furnish milk and cream for our table. When the family is small we make butter and sell surplus milk. Other supplies to the kitchen from the farm such as eggs, chickens, vegetables and honey are used on the table with any surplus sold to the Mountain View Hotel. We raise the yearly supply of potatoes and can many beans, tomatoes, spinach, etc. Arrowcraft This year has been marked by increased production, sales, and economic help to the community as is evidenced by the largest monthly pay roll ever recorded. Around Christmas time 120 weavers received almost$5000.00 for one month's work. Beginning with the first of the year, the poorer weavers have been weeded out and production somewhat curtailed. A number of new craft shops have opened in Gatlinburg and vicinity since last year. With business divided among more establishments and with less ready money in circulation many shops have reported poorer business than last year. Our shop, carrying only quality merchandise, with large sales to 141 alurnnm clubs, 15 active chapters and the four Guild shops enjoyed an increased volume of sales, and income. This was partly due to the necessary raise in our prices. Increased costs all along the line made this step absolutely imperative and one that could no longer be delayed. An innovation much appreciated at the shop has been the new cash register. It is especially useful since the state sales tax of 2% on the dollar went into effect June first. Clubs can expect their orders to be more nearly filled this coming year but it is well to remember that there will never be enough of certain articles to fill the demand. Mrs. Snow will still have to divide that supply as impartially as possible. Neckties will be available in limited quantities and added to the old favorites you will find some new designs from Miss Meta's creative loom. Health Center Another evidence of the changing conditions in Gatlinburg is the fact that there are now two dentists well established in town. After many years of teaching and preaching dental hygiene it is very gratifying to the Pi Phi nurse to have people putting her advice into practice. Mrs. Chalmers has been able to aid those not able to help themselves through extra funds contributed by friends and 2 (I) r International Sorority. Last summer, two state dentists and two nutritionists with the help of our nurse, held two Pre-School Clinics in the district. The one at the Glades school was especially well attended and the one held at our Health Center resulted in some good corrective measures being taken on the part of the parents. Mrs. Chalmers held ten Well-Baby Clinics during the summer in addition to her regular Friday after-noon Clinics which go on all through the year. Other corrective measures such as glasses and eye examinations, tonsillectomies, medicines, and milk have been ' furnished when needed. The local doctors and the small hospitals in Sevierville and Maryville have co-operated to make gift money help as many children as possible. Fifty two babies were added to the _rolls during the year. The regular inoculations, examinations and inspections were made at Pi Phi School, the Banner School, Cartertown, and Glades SchOols. New film has added to the effectiveness of the projector used to teach lessons in health throughout the district. We are looking forward to the new building where we hope to continue our contribution to the health and well being of Gatlinburg and surrounding areas. The generous $100.00 gift of the Cincinnati Alum= Club will be used for equipment there. Gifts to the school have been most generous from alumni clubs and active chapters. Christmas was made merrier for the children of the first five grades and others by the gifts we received. The students in the English classes profited from the speech records sent to the school. At Teacher's Cottage we have a new door bell and I have a much needed light over my desk. It is impossible to enumerate all of the things sent to the school during the year but we remember THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 77 that each gift is prompted by a loving thought and never failed to show deep understanding and interest are grateful for them all. in the School.

        74 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW agement Majors selected by Miss Jessie Harris, of the University of Tennessee, two graduate students from her department dividing the planning and business duties, with another University of Tennessee student and one from Iowa State College assisting. This gave them excellent training and provided the students with well-balanced and nicely varied meals. Ninety-five students, including several Pi Phis, were enrolled during the six-week period, from thirty-three states and Hawaii. Refunds of pre-registration deposits had to be returned to an additional twenty-seven because of lack of housing facilities. For the first time this year Pi Beta Phi undertook to house a large majority of the students. With the assistance of the University of Tennessee the grade school building was converted into an unbelievably delightful dormitory, with the entrance hall an attractive lounge with easy chairs, couches, lamps and coffee table. The University was able to allocate to the Summer Workshop some of the materials furnished to them by the Government from surplus commodities and this allowed the furnishing of this dormitory with folding cots, mattresses, mattress covers, blankets, sheets, pillow cases, towels, chests of drawers, and mirrors sufficient to house thirty students, or more. They also furnished folding tables and chairs for class room use. Pi Beta Phi provided pillows, lamps, chairs, screens, and the other necessary items to make housing possible, as well as additional dishes and silver for the dining-room. Other Summer Workshop students were housed in Stuart Dormitory (a total of ten, with two in a room) and two in single rooms at Health Center. While some of the students, such as Mrs. O. W. Bahl, who drove from Cosby each day to attend classes, were taking the courses in order to produce beautiful articles for their own home or personal use, others such as the two owners of a tea-room and gift shop in the Ozark Mountains, hope to introduce their own handiwork into commercial avenues. The large majority, however, are expecting to use the knowledge gained in teaching: one, for example, to the veterans in an Iowa City hospital; another, who will soon join her radiobiologist husband abroad, to children in Japan ; and many to rural communities all over the United States where the people need the same sort of economic assistance that Pi Beta Phi has given so adequately to Gatlinburg through Arrow-craft. Of the Open House at the close of the Workshop, "Miss Georgie" (our weaver of lovely afghans) wrote: "The work was exquisite and the display arrangement very, very artistic.. . . We had a very large crowd and some very surprised people at the variety and splendid workmanship." While everyone has cooperated beautifully to make this Workshop a success, I wish particularly to mention the inspirational guidance given this project by Miss Jessie W. Harris, without whose vision and ability it could not have been accomplished, and the great contribution made by Miss Ruth Dyer, Director, upon whose capable shoulders were necessarily placed the endless details of preparation in converting the grade school into a dormitory and making ready the entire Settlement School facilities for the sizeable influx of Summer Workshop students, forty-two of whom were housed at the same time and some sixty-seven fed at the School. My very deepest thanks to them and to those who have contributed in other ways to make this venture possible: Miss Meta, who designed the cover for the attractive announcements, Helen Borgstrom, Miss Hodgens, Arlie and Elvin, and others of our regular school staff ; Miss Ruth Buckley, Mr. William Bevis, and those from the University of Tennessee who have consistently worked with Pi Phi on Workshop plans. Dr. William Taylor, of the University of Kentucky, who made the extensive survey for the Pi Phi Settlement School in 1941, said of the Workshop in a letter sent me recently: "I was greatly pleased to re. ceive information concerning your summer workshop. This is an excellent service that should result in wide-spread interest in your program and in large learning in the arts and crafts field. I am delighted that the University of Tennessee is cooperating with you so helpfully." It is my own personal hope that Pi Beta Phi can continue in some form the idea which gave the Summer Workshop birth, since it benefits not only Gatlin-burg but many parts of the United States by increasing knowledge of the crafts and their place in child and adult education. Surely we might well continue this particular phase of our project when it reaches out over such a large area and brings heart-warming words of appreciation from those interested in the beneficial influence of craft education. It was my privilege to close my term of office as Settlement School Chairman with a visit to Gatlin-burg to assist with the opening of this year's Summer Workshop. I also had the pleasure of attending the opening night of the Gateway Stock Company, a group of graduates of the American Academy. of Dramatic Art under the guidance of Mr. John Richards, who leased the High School Auditorium for a nine-weeks period this summer and 4ve been presenting exceptionally well-produced plays to Gatlinburg and its tourists. The timing of this visit was such that I was able to assist with the hostessing when the Grand Council, Province Presidents, and Vice Presidents arrived for their meeting this June. A trip of the School was arranged for them, starting at the Mountain View Hotel through the pasture to Health Center where Marjorie Chalmers showed her excellent system of records ; to Stuart Cottage, Pollard and Teachers Cottages to see where and how our staff and dormitory students live; through the converted Grade School Dormitory; to Arrowcraft where Mrs. Snow and Miss Meta explained their respective parts of this fine establishment; through the Arts and Crafts and High School buildings where classes of the Workshop were in process and where the visiting officers heard the new phonograph and met Mrs. Armstrong and Mrs. Ann Lighter, librarian. It was indeed a real joy to meet these fine leaders of our Fraternity and to help show them as much as could be "walked and talked" about the Settlement School "on the ground" in the time which could be allocated for this in their full and interesting program. It has been a real privilege to serve on the Committee that has, for a relatively short time, concerned itself with the shaping of those "most realistic, prac. tical, motivating forces in the world" the ideals of Pi Beta Phi as exemplified in our Settlement School project. "The joys of knowing you" have been great, and the experience gained will be a never-ending source of satisfaction. To those who have served with me, my deepest thanks for unfailing cooperation and thoughtful consideration of all matters presented to us for action; to those just now entering their term of office, may you know the same joy and happiness we have known as you work together for Pi Beta Phi's "demonstration of practical idealism." Respectfully submitted, MrLDRED SALE THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR 75 H ERE at the Settlement School, each day is filled with duties and problems. To pause and review the past year is to reca 11 happy associations with staff members, students, townspeople, and visiting Pi Phis paying both official and casual visits to the School. Some of the problems that loomed so large at the time they occurred are minimized by the later view point. The whole picture adds up to just another year of service to the community where in past years Pi Beta Phi has contributed so much of value. My work has been much easier by having Helen Borgstrom, North Carolina A, as my able assistant. The growth of the Summer Workshop has meant a great deal of added work in the way of correspondence, registration and bookkeeping which was capably handled by Helen. Community The year has seen many changes in the village. Some were good others detracted from the charm of the place. Two new buildings have been built that are decided additions to the town. The new Methodist Church, built of native stone, on the hill above the Cliff Dwellers Shop, is one of these. Since the fall conference that congregation has had a full time minister. While the church is not yet complete the congregation is holding services there. Another building is the large structure that Rellie Maples erected on the main street. It is in the same type of architecture as the New Gatlinburg Inn and is most attractive. It houses the second movie theater in town, a number of shops with offices on the second floor. Other cheap and poorly constructed buildings, housing various forms of entertainment and shops are to be deplored. The water and sewer systems so badly needed exist only on paper. The lowest bid for them was over a million dollars which is too much for the village to finance. We do have a new fire truck that pumps water from streams when manned by volunteers. Community social life has been much more active with many organizations again functioning after war time slumps. The Little Pigeon Alumnie Club became active again and enjoyed several fine meetings. Founders' Day was celebrated with the newly organized Knoxville Club at the Gatlinburg home of Miss Jessie Harris and Miss Ida Anders of the University of Tennessee. The American Legion and Legion Auxiliary were both active. The Legion held volley ball games in the school gymnasium during the winter. They celebrated Navy Day with a big banquet at one of the hotels. The Auxiliary held a number of functions also in the gymnasium; a Christmas party for their children and covered dish suppers for their families. In the spring they entertained the boys and girls of the school basketball teams at a lovely banquet at the Inn. The Ladies Bridge Club sponsored a Polio Fund benefit and the Village Library Board held their usual benefit to meet their yearly budget. In the name of the Fraternity, the Director entertained the ladies of the three church societies at meetings at Teacher's Cottage and the February meeting of the Garden Club was also held here. The first peace time Christmas was marked by having the loveiy_ tree across from the Arrowcraft shop F rightly lighted during the holiday week. The Baptist and Methodist churches held a union service the evening of Christmas Sunday which was followed by carol singing around the lighted tree. Union serviceswere also held at Thanksgiving time. Mrs. Armstrong, our music teacher, was in charge of the music both times. Miss Meta arranged a very lovely Christmas party for her Weavers. It was held in the beautifully decorated Arrowcraft shop. She had Christmas records played on the new school record player. Refreshments in holiday colors and a gift exchange made it a very happy affair. School Less trouble with changing personnel in the teaching staff was experienced this year than for several years. In the high school where we had 116 students registered, Mr. Wm. King replaced Ben Fleming as Principal. Ben spent the year at Columbia working on an advanced degree. Mrs. Estel Owenby and Mr. King divided the classes in science and mathematics. Mrs. Ann Lighter taught English and was in charge of the library. Mrs. Reba Hood was the teacher of history and social science. The other County teacher was Miss Sue Landrum, the vocational teacher of home-economics. The special teachers hired by the Fraternity were Mr. J. B. Johnson, physical education, Mrs. Stanley Armstrong, music, Miss Elizabeth Petrie, crafts and weaving and Mr. Carl Huskey, wood-working. The work of this faculty resulted in a well rounded program. The senior class was small, only eleven graduating at the Commencement exercises in May. Many extracurricular activities interested the students during the year. Under Mr. Johnson basketball enjoyed a great popularity. The teams played many games both at home and away. In the County Tournament at Sevierville the Girl's team won the Runner-up trophy. A branch of the National Beta Club was organized for the students having the higher averages. Three of the girls attended the state convention of the society in Nashville. Miss Landrum sponsored a club of her home economics girls called Future Home Makers of America and Helen worked with a Y-Teen group of girls. During the year the three upper classes all presented plays. The seniors made their trip to Myrtle Beach in Carolina. Parties for the different classes were held at intervals the most elaborate being the Junior banquet to the Seniors and Faculty at the Riverside Hotel. Following the .Class night program we entertained the seniors and faculty at a party at Teachers' Cottage. Nine teachers taught in the Elementary grades, two of them having two grades in a room. Mrs. Armstrong worked with the grade school children to give two very fine programs. The first one was the good pro-gram called Carols of Many Lands, given for the entire school at Christmas time.. Later in the year she presented ,tie annual play or operetta called Madcaps. The costumes were colorful and the singing of high quality. An Open House held one evening gave the teachers opportunity to show the parents the work being done by the children. Miss Petrie's classes made a good, showing with added interest in the exhibits of craft work done in the different grades. There were twenty four graduates of the eighth grade, all of whom expect to enter high school in the fall. The P. T. A. was very active all year, contributing much to the school program. Bingo games during the summer, rummage sales and suppers were all used to earn money for their projects. The most ambitious one of these was to install fluorescent lights in the 76 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW old grade school building. They also paid for painting the interior of this building with paint furnished by the county. They operated the school hot lunch pro-gram for the children of the Elementary School. Some needed ,shades and playground equipment were also purchased with their funds. Pi Beta Phi installed new indoor toilets and showers in the same building. The county purchased a new sump pump for the large furnace room. We hope that this will eliminate having a flooded basement the next time there is a flood in the village. Committee purchased a fine record player from the Memorial Fund and forty eight folding chairs for the music room. Clubs and friends have helped with gifts of records that are enjoyed by the whole school. Dormitory Improvements made during the past year include refinishing the floors in the downstairs at Pollard and upstairs at Stuart. Some new linens, dishes and silver, available for the first time since the war, were secured for the house, The help situation was a difficult one all year. Miss Hodgen, in charge of the housekeeping, has trained four cooks and two laundresses besides doing the work herself when it was necessary. Dormitory life has been pleasant for the twelve children living at the school. Mr. Johnson was in charge of the four boys at Pollard. He was generous with his time and his car taking the boys on a number of interesting trips and hikes. A ping pong table on the porch provided a great deal of entertainment when the weather was suitable. Of the eight girls living at Stuart, five were freshmen. Miss Hodgen supervises their duties in the dining room and kitchen and serves as their housemother. Helen helped the dormitory students in a social way with the planning of parties and picnics for the group and their friends. All have settled their cash obligations in full and with the exception of the two girls who graduated, all expect to return next fall. Farm Carl Ogle, farm manager, has carried on the work of the farm through the usual trials and difficulties. The power has a way of going off just when we have baby chicks in the brooder houses, a fox or possum will get in the chicken yards, rain wets the hay etc. The dormitory boys, with their regular assigned jobs, help with the farm work. When there is nothing else to do they attack the wood pile of fallen timbers from our own place, cutting logs for the fires we burn in the fireplaces in spring and fall. The registered Jersey cattle in our herd were tested for T. B. and Bang's Disease by competent veterinarians. The results were negative in both cases. Another improvement was to have the apple orchard pruned by a class of Veterans from Sevierville. These men were students of a former agriculture teacher at the school, Mr. Willie Coe. Our cows furnish milk and cream for our table. When the family is small we make butter and sell surplus milk. Other supplies to the kitchen from the farm such as eggs, chickens, vegetables and honey are used on the table with any surplus sold to the Mountain View Hotel. We raise the yearly supply of potatoes and can many beans, tomatoes, spinach, etc. Arrowcraft This year has been marked by increased production, sales, and economic help to the community as is evidenced by the largest monthly pay roll ever recorded. Around Christmas time 120 weavers received almost$5000.00 for one month's work. Beginning with the first of the year, the poorer weavers have been weeded out and production somewhat curtailed. A number of new craft shops have opened in Gatlinburg and vicinity since last year. With business divided among more establishments and with less ready money in circulation many shops have reported poorer business than last year. Our shop, carrying only quality merchandise, with large sales to 141 alurnnm clubs, 15 active chapters and the four Guild shops enjoyed an increased volume of sales, and income. This was partly due to the necessary raise in our prices. Increased costs all along the line made this step absolutely imperative and one that could no longer be delayed. An innovation much appreciated at the shop has been the new cash register. It is especially useful since the state sales tax of 2% on the dollar went into effect June first. Clubs can expect their orders to be more nearly filled this coming year but it is well to remember that there will never be enough of certain articles to fill the demand. Mrs. Snow will still have to divide that supply as impartially as possible. Neckties will be available in limited quantities and added to the old favorites you will find some new designs from Miss Meta's creative loom. Health Center Another evidence of the changing conditions in Gatlinburg is the fact that there are now two dentists well established in town. After many years of teaching and preaching dental hygiene it is very gratifying to the Pi Phi nurse to have people putting her advice into practice. Mrs. Chalmers has been able to aid those not able to help themselves through extra funds contributed by friends and 2 (I) r International Sorority. Last summer, two state dentists and two nutritionists with the help of our nurse, held two Pre-School Clinics in the district. The one at the Glades school was especially well attended and the one held at our Health Center resulted in some good corrective measures being taken on the part of the parents. Mrs. Chalmers held ten Well-Baby Clinics during the summer in addition to her regular Friday after-noon Clinics which go on all through the year. Other corrective measures such as glasses and eye examinations, tonsillectomies, medicines, and milk have been ' furnished when needed. The local doctors and the small hospitals in Sevierville and Maryville have co-operated to make gift money help as many children as possible. Fifty two babies were added to the _rolls during the year. The regular inoculations, examinations and inspections were made at Pi Phi School, the Banner School, Cartertown, and Glades SchOols. New film has added to the effectiveness of the projector used to teach lessons in health throughout the district. We are looking forward to the new building where we hope to continue our contribution to the health and well being of Gatlinburg and surrounding areas. The generous $100.00 gift of the Cincinnati Alum= Club will be used for equipment there. Gifts to the school have been most generous from alumni clubs and active chapters. Christmas was made merrier for the children of the first five grades and others by the gifts we received. The students in the English classes profited from the speech records sent to the school. At Teacher's Cottage we have a new door bell and I have a much needed light over my desk. It is impossible to enumerate all of the things sent to the school during the year but we remember THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 77 that each gift is prompted by a loving thought and never failed to show deep understanding and interest are grateful for them all. in the School. It has been a privilege to work with the Settlement Respectfully submitted, School Committee and Grand Council.

They operated the school hot lunch pro-gram for the children of the Elementary School. Some needed ,shades and playground equipment were also purchased with their funds.

Clubs and friends have helped with gifts of records that are enjoyed by the whole school. Dormitory Improvements made during the past year include refinishing the floors in the downstairs at Pollard and upstairs at Stuart. Some new linens, dishes and silver, available for the first time since the war, were secured for the house, The help situation was a difficult one all year. Miss Hodgen, in charge of the housekeeping, has trained four cooks and two laundresses besides doing the work herself when it was necessary. Dormitory life has been pleasant for the twelve children living at the school. Mr. Johnson was in charge of the four boys at Pollard. He was generous with his time and his car taking the boys on a number of interesting trips and hikes. A ping pong table on the porch provided a great deal of entertainment when the weather was suitable. Of the eight girls living at Stuart, five were freshmen. Miss Hodgen supervises their duties in the dining room and kitchen and serves as their housemother. Helen helped the dormitory students in a social way with the planning of parties and picnics for the group and their friends. All have settled their cash obligations in full and with the exception of the two girls who graduated, all expect to return next fall. Farm Carl Ogle, farm manager, has carried on the work of the farm through the usual trials and difficulties. The power has a way of going off just when we have baby chicks in the brooder houses, a fox or possum will get in the chicken yards, rain wets the hay etc. The dormitory boys, with their regular assigned jobs, help with the farm work. When there is nothing else to do they attack the wood pile of fallen timbers from our own place, cutting logs for the fires we burn in the fireplaces in spring and fall. The registered Jersey cattle in our herd were tested for T. B. and Bang's Disease by competent veterinarians. The results were negative in both cases. Another improvement was to have the apple orchard pruned by a class of Veterans from Sevierville. These men were students of a former agriculture teacher at the school, Mr. Willie Coe. Our cows furnish milk and cream for our table. When the family is small we make butter and sell surplus milk. Other supplies to the kitchen from the farm such as eggs, chickens, vegetables and honey are used on the table with any surplus sold to the Mountain View Hotel. We raise the yearly supply of potatoes and can many beans, tomatoes, spinach, etc. Arrowcraft This year has been marked by increased production, sales, and economic help to the community as is evidenced by the largest monthly pay roll ever recorded. Around Christmas time 120 weavers received almost$5000.00 for one month's work. Beginning with the first of the year, the poorer weavers have been weeded out and production somewhat curtailed. A number of new craft shops have opened in Gatlinburg and vicinity since last year. With business divided among more establishments and with less ready money in circulation many shops have reported poorer business than last year. Our shop, carrying only quality merchandise, with large sales to 141 alurnnm clubs, 15 active chapters and the four Guild shops enjoyed an increased volume of sales, and income. This was partly due to the necessary raise in our prices. Increased costs all along the line made this step absolutely imperative and one that could no longer be delayed. An innovation much appreciated at the shop has been the new cash register. It is especially useful since the state sales tax of 2% on the dollar went into effect June first. Clubs can expect their orders to be more nearly filled this coming year but it is well to remember that there will never be enough of certain articles to fill the demand. Mrs. Snow will still have to divide that supply as impartially as possible. Neckties will be available in limited quantities and added to the old favorites you will find some new designs from Miss Meta's creative loom. Health Center Another evidence of the changing conditions in Gatlinburg is the fact that there are now two dentists well established in town. After many years of teaching and preaching dental hygiene it is very gratifying to the Pi Phi nurse to have people putting her advice into practice. Mrs. Chalmers has been able to aid those not able to help themselves through extra funds contributed by friends and 2 (I) r International Sorority. Last summer, two state dentists and two nutritionists with the help of our nurse, held two Pre-School Clinics in the district. The one at the Glades school was especially well attended and the one held at our Health Center resulted in some good corrective measures being taken on the part of the parents. Mrs. Chalmers held ten Well-Baby Clinics during the summer in addition to her regular Friday after-noon Clinics which go on all through the year. Other corrective measures such as glasses and eye examinations, tonsillectomies, medicines, and milk have been ' furnished when needed. The local doctors and the small hospitals in Sevierville and Maryville have co-operated to make gift money help as many children as possible. Fifty two babies were added to the _rolls during the year. The regular inoculations, examinations and inspections were made at Pi Phi School, the Banner School, Cartertown, and Glades SchOols. New film has added to the effectiveness of the projector used to teach lessons in health throughout the district. We are looking forward to the new building where we hope to continue our contribution to the health and well being of Gatlinburg and surrounding areas. The generous $100.00 gift of the Cincinnati Alum= Club will be used for equipment there. Gifts to the school have been most generous from alumni clubs and active chapters. Christmas was made merrier for the children of the first five grades and others by the gifts we received. The students in the English classes profited from the speech records sent to the school. At Teacher's Cottage we have a new door bell and I have a much needed light over my desk. It is impossible to enumerate all of the things sent to the school during the year but we remember THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 77 that each gift is prompted by a loving thought and never failed to show deep understanding and interest are grateful for them all. in the School.

Of this latter point, Julia Fuqua Ober has said, "Only in proportion to the services we render to a world in need do we justify our right to existence." While I am sure Mrs. Ober would include as part of these services the values a fraternity gives to its own membership in such fields as leadership training, nevertheless those services which go beyond these limits are certainly the most tangible, the most noticeable evidences to the world at large of the ideals and standards for which that fraternity stands. That is one reason Pi Beta Phi has received such a tremendous ovation from those who understand the purposes and values of our Settlement School project. With the endorsement of the Pi Beta Phi Convention held at Swampscott, the Settlement School has continued this past year along the lines established by the lease-agreement with Sevier County, and those recommended by Dr. Holton and Dr. Taylor in their surveys for the future development of our project in the Smokies. With 120 High School and 330 grade school pupils this past year, it is hoped that the average attendance maintained a sufficient figure to insure the county providing at least an additional grade teacher for the coming year. A state sales tax begun June 1, 1947, is to finance a flat three hundred dollar a year raise for all teachers, and this should make it possible for Gatlinburg to have adequate instructors from county and state funds up to the number of teachers they provide. This year the county provided 9 grade and 5 High School teachers. Pi Beta Phi has again assisted materially by adding three full-time and one part-time instructors: a music supervisor, a physical education instructor and coach, a supervisor in Arts and Crafts, and a woodworking instructor. These departments have shown considerable development and have been greatly appreciated by the Gatlinburg citizens. Returning to us was Mr. William King, formerly of our school staff, who served this year as Superintendent during the leave of absence granted to former Superintendent Ben Fleming. Ben has decided to enter the field of mathematics teaching without administrative responsibilities and so will not be returning to Gatlinburg, which loses to Pi Beta Phi a loyal friend and fine superintendent, as well as an excellent first grade teacher since his wife, Josephine, will accompany him to his new position. Mr. King reports an unusually high standard of teaching this past year, as once again, after the war-time period which forced the acceptance of teachers without degrees, all High School teachers were graduates of standard colleges. The Iowa High School Content Examinations were given the students and the resulting scores rated most favorably with the national average. The Physical Education instructor, Mr. Joe B. Johnson, met the High School students three times a week and the sixth, seventh and eighth grade students twice a week for forty-five minute periods. Ten minutes of each period were spent in exercises, the rest in sports of various kinds with basketball remain-ing the major event. The boys' team played two tournament games, and the girls' team three, being defeated only in the final game and thereby winning, as a finalist, the first basketball trophy for Gatlinburg. Equipment costing $238 was purchased from game receipts and much-needed bleachers were built around the edge of the gymnasium floor to accommodate partially the large crowds that witness all home games. Musically the school has continued to develop under the expert guidance of Mrs. Aletha Armstrong, Music Supervisor. Each grade sang numbers at Assembly periods, the lower six grades presented "The Mad-caps," operetta, and an elementary school chorus sang at the Promotion Day exercises. A one-hundred voice High School Chorus was most enthusiastic and developed a considerable appreciation for better music, aided greatly by the playing of records on the new phonograph. Three part songs were introduced for the first time in programs given by the High School Glee Club. In the Arts 'and Crafts Department a varied pro-gram was followed by Miss Elizabeth Petrie, and Mr. Carl Huskey. This included a variety of wood-working for the boys, and for the girls the weaving, which began with table-loom work in the sixth grade and progressed to lovely material for blouses made by the High School girls, and beginning pottery, leather work and textile decoration, in which the seventh and eighth grade girls painted stencils on cloth. Field trips to weavers, nearby craftspeople, and a new pottery at Pigeon Forge were enjoyed. Pi Beta Phi made several contributions and gifts to the regular school equipment this past year, aside from those given by individual members and clubs. To the P.T.A. fund for fluorescent lights in the grade school, the Settlement School treasury contributed $200.00 ; to the Music Department a lovely phonograph and the start of a record library were given from the Memorial Fund, and four dozen chairs for use in the music classes were supplied from regular funds; to the library was added the World Book Encyclopedia; and most expensive and definitely most appreciated was the addition of indoor bathroom facilities at the grade school building. These included four showers so that the building can be used as a dormitory for the Summer Workshop students. The County purchased a power lawn-mower for the playground area, and an additional sump-pump for removing flood waters from around heating equipment. Besides the fluorescent lights mentioned above, the P.T.A. repainted the grade school in attractive pastel shades, and purchased new shades for many of the class-rooms and a merry-go-round for the children (Its first day brought emergency calls for the nurse to look after youngsters who didn't know whirling round and round would upset those not accustomed to it!) The dormitories` have been about back to pre-war levels, and it was indeed a satisfaction to know that a "house-father" was in residence in the boy's dormitory, this year once again housed in Pollard Cottage with the girls remaining in Stuart. Under the director of the house-father, Joe B. Johnson, and Helen Borgstrom, Assistant to the Di-rector, several social affairs and supervised play periods have been inaugurated for the dormitory 72 THE SEPTEMBER ARRO`Xw 73 students. Ping-pong on the porch at Pollard was enjoyed most of the year except when aA Y -Teen forced the players to warmer play-rooms. group sponsored by Helen completed its first year with some degree of success. The time has now come for the building of Pnew hi grade school. According to the County-Pi Agreement of 1943, the County is supposed to build this on property bought by them adjoining Pi Beta Phi's land. This plot is now considered inadequate by the State School Building Planning Commission who surveyed the Sevier County system this spring. The Court of Sevier County, which has the authority in all such county school matters, is now w a studying tac ceptable various possibilities for the securing to the state, since they are desirous of receiv ing financial assistance from the state sales tax, a part of which has been allocated for school building. By committee and Grand Council approval, Mr. Philip Elwood, Head of the Landscape Architecture Department of Iowa State College, was engaged to make a survey of the Pi Beta Phi property and pre-pare for our consideration a plan for the future development of the grounds and buildings. This has grown into a many-sided service since in his studies he had occasion to consult with a newly-organized Gatlinburg City Planning Commission and has worked with them to a very considerable degree on the location of water and sewer lines and other civic improvements planned by Gatlinburg even though their limited budget and the failure to date of securing bids they could , accept have so far prevented the beginning of even the most necessary of these: the water and sewer systems. Health Center Health Center has maintained its steady program of clinics, calls, and examinations, albeit there have been requests from time to time for assistance from the maintenance department to insure a continued safe flooring for the building. It is with great anticipation that we await the spading of the first shovelful of dirt for the new Health Center for which the con-tract has now been let, after plans and specifications were approved by the nurse, Grand Council and Committee, to be erected probably on the highway near Arrowcraft, in accordance with Mr. Elwood's plan.' Fifty-one new babies were added to the Health Center rolls, and ten extra Well Baby Clinics were held last summer these in addition to the regular Friday afternoons held regularly each week throughout the year. Two Pre-School Clinics again brought the assistance of State Dentists and Nutritionists. It would seem that with these, and the regular school examinations, plus the corrective work in dentistry, eye examinations and glasses, tonsillectomies, and extra milk that Nurse Marjorie has been able to supply from gifts to the Health Center work, the children of Gatlinburg and the nearby community are indeed being served by Pi Beta Phi in a most satisfactory manner. The purchase of eight dark-blue full-length curtains has made it possible to use the projector during day-time visits to schools, and thereby give health instruction in an interesting mariner, much enjoyed by the audience. Pi Beta Phi's service to Gatlinburg is most personal, undoubtedly, in the relationships between "Miz Chalmers" and her "children" and Miss Meta and her weavers, who call her "Boss Lady." As Marjorie has said, "It is through the work of the Health Center that one feels the pulse of the community." Arrowcraft Arrowcraft reached an all-time high with the payment of almost $5,000.00 to 120 weavers in November, 1946. Shelves were well-filled for the summer tourist season and it is expected that the alumnm club orders may be more adequately filled this fall than in several recent years. Though concerned for a time by the return of considerable quantities of articles by some alumnm clubs after a few years of "no returns," Mrs. Ethel Snow, as Arrowcraft's capable Manager, with Laura remaining even after her marriage this year, Mrs. Cole still serving as book-keeper, adequate assistants and a new cash-register and refinished floors in the sales rooms, is ready for the strenuous days ahead which they will meet in the same efficient manner as in the past. Miss Meta has been plagued with another Wage and Hour Survey, which seems to be "forever with us," but even so has produced a number of new designs which have been enthusiastically received as a general rule. Among these is the lovely Queen Anne luncheon set made of linen imported from Ireland. Cotton boucle in warm colors was used in the design of new curtains, woven by Arrowcraft for the Mountain View Hotel lobby. A promise of more thread and even cashmere and necktie warp, indicates that soon most of the items which had to be discontinued during the war will again be in production. The Weavers' Guild has had an interesting year, the highlight being the Christmas meeting held in the main sales room at Arrowcraft, where the high-beamed ceiling, the lovely Christmas angels made by Miss Meta, burning logs in the fireplace and the sweet sound of Christmas carols played on the new phonograph gave many of the seventy weavers attending the nicest party of their experience. Summer Workshop The year 1946-47 brought to completion the three year period of experimentation which was originally outlined for the project now known as the Summer Workshop in Crafts and Community Recreation, con-ducted by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee. This summer our staff included as Director, Miss Marion Heard of the University of Tennessee craft department, who was co-Director last summer, instructor in Jewelry and Metalcraft; Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Starr Sullivan, Pi Beta Phi member, formerly at the University of Washington and of Oregon, weaving instructor; June Glass, also from the University of Tennessee, teaching recreational crafts and leatherwork ; Mary Katherine Overholt, Pi Phi from Ames, assistant in crafts. Mrs. Josephine Bakke, with us for the past two summers as Instructor in Community Recreation served this summer in a dual capacity, continuing her class teaching on a laboratory basis and serving as Dean of Women and Social Director. She organized the student body for such routine procedures as the "line" in the dining-room, the clearing of tables, and for their play times together. Under her guidance a very gratifying school-spirit developed, especially among those living at the School, with a sort of undesignated student government which eliminated the need for many rules in black and white and still maintained well-regulated dormitories. Mr. Allen Eaton, outstanding authority on American Crafts and author of the excellent book "Handicrafts of the Southern Highlands," was special lecturer for a three-week period, overlapping the two sessions of the Summer Workshop. In charge of the dining-room and kitchen were four Institutional Man74 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW agement Majors selected by Miss Jessie Harris, of the University of Tennessee, two graduate students from her department dividing the planning and business duties, with another University of Tennessee student and one from Iowa State College assisting. This gave them excellent training and provided the students with well-balanced and nicely varied meals. Ninety-five students, including several Pi Phis, were enrolled during the six-week period, from thirty-three states and Hawaii. Refunds of pre-registration deposits had to be returned to an additional twenty-seven because of lack of housing facilities. For the first time this year Pi Beta Phi undertook to house a large majority of the students. With the assistance of the University of Tennessee the grade school building was converted into an unbelievably delightful dormitory, with the entrance hall an attractive lounge with easy chairs, couches, lamps and coffee table. The University was able to allocate to the Summer Workshop some of the materials furnished to them by the Government from surplus commodities and this allowed the furnishing of this dormitory with folding cots, mattresses, mattress covers, blankets, sheets, pillow cases, towels, chests of drawers, and mirrors sufficient to house thirty students, or more. They also furnished folding tables and chairs for class room use. Pi Beta Phi provided pillows, lamps, chairs, screens, and the other necessary items to make housing possible, as well as additional dishes and silver for the dining-room. Other Summer Workshop students were housed in Stuart Dormitory (a total of ten, with two in a room) and two in single rooms at Health Center. While some of the students, such as Mrs. O. W. Bahl, who drove from Cosby each day to attend classes, were taking the courses in order to produce beautiful articles for their own home or personal use, others such as the two owners of a tea-room and gift shop in the Ozark Mountains, hope to introduce their own handiwork into commercial avenues. The large majority, however, are expecting to use the knowledge gained in teaching: one, for example, to the veterans in an Iowa City hospital; another, who will soon join her radiobiologist husband abroad, to children in Japan ; and many to rural communities all over the United States where the people need the same sort of economic assistance that Pi Beta Phi has given so adequately to Gatlinburg through Arrow-craft. Of the Open House at the close of the Workshop, "Miss Georgie" (our weaver of lovely afghans) wrote: "The work was exquisite and the display arrangement very, very artistic.. . . We had a very large crowd and some very surprised people at the variety and splendid workmanship." While everyone has cooperated beautifully to make this Workshop a success, I wish particularly to mention the inspirational guidance given this project by Miss Jessie W. Harris, without whose vision and ability it could not have been accomplished, and the great contribution made by Miss Ruth Dyer, Director, upon whose capable shoulders were necessarily placed the endless details of preparation in converting the grade school into a dormitory and making ready the entire Settlement School facilities for the sizeable influx of Summer Workshop students, forty-two of whom were housed at the same time and some sixty-seven fed at the School. My very deepest thanks to them and to those who have contributed in other ways to make this venture possible: Miss Meta, who designed the cover for the attractive announcements, Helen Borgstrom, Miss Hodgens, Arlie and Elvin, and others of our regular school staff ; Miss Ruth Buckley, Mr. William Bevis, and those from the University of Tennessee who have consistently worked with Pi Phi on Workshop plans. Dr. William Taylor, of the University of Kentucky, who made the extensive survey for the Pi Phi Settlement School in 1941, said of the Workshop in a letter sent me recently: "I was greatly pleased to re. ceive information concerning your summer workshop. This is an excellent service that should result in wide-spread interest in your program and in large learning in the arts and crafts field. I am delighted that the University of Tennessee is cooperating with you so helpfully." It is my own personal hope that Pi Beta Phi can continue in some form the idea which gave the Summer Workshop birth, since it benefits not only Gatlin-burg but many parts of the United States by increasing knowledge of the crafts and their place in child and adult education. Surely we might well continue this particular phase of our project when it reaches out over such a large area and brings heart-warming words of appreciation from those interested in the beneficial influence of craft education. It was my privilege to close my term of office as Settlement School Chairman with a visit to Gatlin-burg to assist with the opening of this year's Summer Workshop. I also had the pleasure of attending the opening night of the Gateway Stock Company, a group of graduates of the American Academy. of Dramatic Art under the guidance of Mr. John Richards, who leased the High School Auditorium for a nine-weeks period this summer and 4ve been presenting exceptionally well-produced plays to Gatlinburg and its tourists. The timing of this visit was such that I was able to assist with the hostessing when the Grand Council, Province Presidents, and Vice Presidents arrived for their meeting this June. A trip of the School was arranged for them, starting at the Mountain View Hotel through the pasture to Health Center where Marjorie Chalmers showed her excellent system of records ; to Stuart Cottage, Pollard and Teachers Cottages to see where and how our staff and dormitory students live; through the converted Grade School Dormitory; to Arrowcraft where Mrs. Snow and Miss Meta explained their respective parts of this fine establishment; through the Arts and Crafts and High School buildings where classes of the Workshop were in process and where the visiting officers heard the new phonograph and met Mrs. Armstrong and Mrs. Ann Lighter, librarian. It was indeed a real joy to meet these fine leaders of our Fraternity and to help show them as much as could be "walked and talked" about the Settlement School "on the ground" in the time which could be allocated for this in their full and interesting program. It has been a real privilege to serve on the Committee that has, for a relatively short time, concerned itself with the shaping of those "most realistic, prac. tical, motivating forces in the world" the ideals of Pi Beta Phi as exemplified in our Settlement School project. "The joys of knowing you" have been great, and the experience gained will be a never-ending source of satisfaction. To those who have served with me, my deepest thanks for unfailing cooperation and thoughtful consideration of all matters presented to us for action; to those just now entering their term of office, may you know the same joy and happiness we have known as you work together for Pi Beta Phi's "demonstration of practical idealism." Respectfully submitted, MrLDRED SALE THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR 75 H ERE at the Settlement School, each day is filled with duties and problems. To pause and review the past year is to reca 11 happy associations with staff members, students, townspeople, and visiting Pi Phis paying both official and casual visits to the School. Some of the problems that loomed so large at the time they occurred are minimized by the later view point. The whole picture adds up to just another year of service to the community where in past years Pi Beta Phi has contributed so much of value. My work has been much easier by having Helen Borgstrom, North Carolina A, as my able assistant. The growth of the Summer Workshop has meant a great deal of added work in the way of correspondence, registration and bookkeeping which was capably handled by Helen. Community The year has seen many changes in the village. Some were good others detracted from the charm of the place. Two new buildings have been built that are decided additions to the town. The new Methodist Church, built of native stone, on the hill above the Cliff Dwellers Shop, is one of these. Since the fall conference that congregation has had a full time minister. While the church is not yet complete the congregation is holding services there. Another building is the large structure that Rellie Maples erected on the main street. It is in the same type of architecture as the New Gatlinburg Inn and is most attractive. It houses the second movie theater in town, a number of shops with offices on the second floor. Other cheap and poorly constructed buildings, housing various forms of entertainment and shops are to be deplored. The water and sewer systems so badly needed exist only on paper. The lowest bid for them was over a million dollars which is too much for the village to finance. We do have a new fire truck that pumps water from streams when manned by volunteers. Community social life has been much more active with many organizations again functioning after war time slumps. The Little Pigeon Alumnie Club became active again and enjoyed several fine meetings. Founders' Day was celebrated with the newly organized Knoxville Club at the Gatlinburg home of Miss Jessie Harris and Miss Ida Anders of the University of Tennessee. The American Legion and Legion Auxiliary were both active. The Legion held volley ball games in the school gymnasium during the winter. They celebrated Navy Day with a big banquet at one of the hotels. The Auxiliary held a number of functions also in the gymnasium; a Christmas party for their children and covered dish suppers for their families. In the spring they entertained the boys and girls of the school basketball teams at a lovely banquet at the Inn. The Ladies Bridge Club sponsored a Polio Fund benefit and the Village Library Board held their usual benefit to meet their yearly budget. In the name of the Fraternity, the Director entertained the ladies of the three church societies at meetings at Teacher's Cottage and the February meeting of the Garden Club was also held here. The first peace time Christmas was marked by having the loveiy_ tree across from the Arrowcraft shop F rightly lighted during the holiday week. The Baptist and Methodist churches held a union service the evening of Christmas Sunday which was followed by carol singing around the lighted tree. Union serviceswere also held at Thanksgiving time. Mrs. Armstrong, our music teacher, was in charge of the music both times. Miss Meta arranged a very lovely Christmas party for her Weavers. It was held in the beautifully decorated Arrowcraft shop. She had Christmas records played on the new school record player. Refreshments in holiday colors and a gift exchange made it a very happy affair. School Less trouble with changing personnel in the teaching staff was experienced this year than for several years. In the high school where we had 116 students registered, Mr. Wm. King replaced Ben Fleming as Principal. Ben spent the year at Columbia working on an advanced degree. Mrs. Estel Owenby and Mr. King divided the classes in science and mathematics. Mrs. Ann Lighter taught English and was in charge of the library. Mrs. Reba Hood was the teacher of history and social science. The other County teacher was Miss Sue Landrum, the vocational teacher of home-economics. The special teachers hired by the Fraternity were Mr. J. B. Johnson, physical education, Mrs. Stanley Armstrong, music, Miss Elizabeth Petrie, crafts and weaving and Mr. Carl Huskey, wood-working. The work of this faculty resulted in a well rounded program. The senior class was small, only eleven graduating at the Commencement exercises in May. Many extracurricular activities interested the students during the year. Under Mr. Johnson basketball enjoyed a great popularity. The teams played many games both at home and away. In the County Tournament at Sevierville the Girl's team won the Runner-up trophy. A branch of the National Beta Club was organized for the students having the higher averages. Three of the girls attended the state convention of the society in Nashville. Miss Landrum sponsored a club of her home economics girls called Future Home Makers of America and Helen worked with a Y-Teen group of girls. During the year the three upper classes all presented plays. The seniors made their trip to Myrtle Beach in Carolina. Parties for the different classes were held at intervals the most elaborate being the Junior banquet to the Seniors and Faculty at the Riverside Hotel. Following the .Class night program we entertained the seniors and faculty at a party at Teachers' Cottage. Nine teachers taught in the Elementary grades, two of them having two grades in a room. Mrs. Armstrong worked with the grade school children to give two very fine programs. The first one was the good pro-gram called Carols of Many Lands, given for the entire school at Christmas time.. Later in the year she presented ,tie annual play or operetta called Madcaps. The costumes were colorful and the singing of high quality. An Open House held one evening gave the teachers opportunity to show the parents the work being done by the children. Miss Petrie's classes made a good, showing with added interest in the exhibits of craft work done in the different grades. There were twenty four graduates of the eighth grade, all of whom expect to enter high school in the fall. The P. T. A. was very active all year, contributing much to the school program. Bingo games during the summer, rummage sales and suppers were all used to earn money for their projects. The most ambitious one of these was to install fluorescent lights in the 76 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW old grade school building. They also paid for painting the interior of this building with paint furnished by the county. They operated the school hot lunch pro-gram for the children of the Elementary School. Some needed ,shades and playground equipment were also purchased with their funds. Pi Beta Phi installed new indoor toilets and showers in the same building. The county purchased a new sump pump for the large furnace room. We hope that this will eliminate having a flooded basement the next time there is a flood in the village. Committee purchased a fine record player from the Memorial Fund and forty eight folding chairs for the music room. Clubs and friends have helped with gifts of records that are enjoyed by the whole school. Dormitory Improvements made during the past year include refinishing the floors in the downstairs at Pollard and upstairs at Stuart. Some new linens, dishes and silver, available for the first time since the war, were secured for the house, The help situation was a difficult one all year. Miss Hodgen, in charge of the housekeeping, has trained four cooks and two laundresses besides doing the work herself when it was necessary. Dormitory life has been pleasant for the twelve children living at the school. Mr. Johnson was in charge of the four boys at Pollard. He was generous with his time and his car taking the boys on a number of interesting trips and hikes. A ping pong table on the porch provided a great deal of entertainment when the weather was suitable. Of the eight girls living at Stuart, five were freshmen. Miss Hodgen supervises their duties in the dining room and kitchen and serves as their housemother. Helen helped the dormitory students in a social way with the planning of parties and picnics for the group and their friends. All have settled their cash obligations in full and with the exception of the two girls who graduated, all expect to return next fall. Farm Carl Ogle, farm manager, has carried on the work of the farm through the usual trials and difficulties. The power has a way of going off just when we have baby chicks in the brooder houses, a fox or possum will get in the chicken yards, rain wets the hay etc. The dormitory boys, with their regular assigned jobs, help with the farm work. When there is nothing else to do they attack the wood pile of fallen timbers from our own place, cutting logs for the fires we burn in the fireplaces in spring and fall. The registered Jersey cattle in our herd were tested for T. B. and Bang's Disease by competent veterinarians. The results were negative in both cases. Another improvement was to have the apple orchard pruned by a class of Veterans from Sevierville. These men were students of a former agriculture teacher at the school, Mr. Willie Coe. Our cows furnish milk and cream for our table. When the family is small we make butter and sell surplus milk. Other supplies to the kitchen from the farm such as eggs, chickens, vegetables and honey are used on the table with any surplus sold to the Mountain View Hotel. We raise the yearly supply of potatoes and can many beans, tomatoes, spinach, etc. Arrowcraft This year has been marked by increased production, sales, and economic help to the community as is evidenced by the largest monthly pay roll ever recorded. Around Christmas time 120 weavers received almost$5000.00 for one month's work. Beginning with the first of the year, the poorer weavers have been weeded out and production somewhat curtailed. A number of new craft shops have opened in Gatlinburg and vicinity since last year. With business divided among more establishments and with less ready money in circulation many shops have reported poorer business than last year. Our shop, carrying only quality merchandise, with large sales to 141 alurnnm clubs, 15 active chapters and the four Guild shops enjoyed an increased volume of sales, and income. This was partly due to the necessary raise in our prices. Increased costs all along the line made this step absolutely imperative and one that could no longer be delayed. An innovation much appreciated at the shop has been the new cash register. It is especially useful since the state sales tax of 2% on the dollar went into effect June first. Clubs can expect their orders to be more nearly filled this coming year but it is well to remember that there will never be enough of certain articles to fill the demand. Mrs. Snow will still have to divide that supply as impartially as possible. Neckties will be available in limited quantities and added to the old favorites you will find some new designs from Miss Meta's creative loom. Health Center Another evidence of the changing conditions in Gatlinburg is the fact that there are now two dentists well established in town. After many years of teaching and preaching dental hygiene it is very gratifying to the Pi Phi nurse to have people putting her advice into practice. Mrs. Chalmers has been able to aid those not able to help themselves through extra funds contributed by friends and 2 (I) r International Sorority. Last summer, two state dentists and two nutritionists with the help of our nurse, held two Pre-School Clinics in the district. The one at the Glades school was especially well attended and the one held at our Health Center resulted in some good corrective measures being taken on the part of the parents. Mrs. Chalmers held ten Well-Baby Clinics during the summer in addition to her regular Friday after-noon Clinics which go on all through the year. Other corrective measures such as glasses and eye examinations, tonsillectomies, medicines, and milk have been ' furnished when needed. The local doctors and the small hospitals in Sevierville and Maryville have co-operated to make gift money help as many children as possible. Fifty two babies were added to the _rolls during the year. The regular inoculations, examinations and inspections were made at Pi Phi School, the Banner School, Cartertown, and Glades SchOols. New film has added to the effectiveness of the projector used to teach lessons in health throughout the district. We are looking forward to the new building where we hope to continue our contribution to the health and well being of Gatlinburg and surrounding areas. The generous $100.00 gift of the Cincinnati Alum= Club will be used for equipment there. Gifts to the school have been most generous from alumni clubs and active chapters. Christmas was made merrier for the children of the first five grades and others by the gifts we received. The students in the English classes profited from the speech records sent to the school. At Teacher's Cottage we have a new door bell and I have a much needed light over my desk. It is impossible to enumerate all of the things sent to the school during the year but we remember THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 77 that each gift is prompted by a loving thought and never failed to show deep understanding and interest are grateful for them all. in the School. It has been a privilege to work with the Settlement Respectfully submitted, School Committee and Grand Council.
