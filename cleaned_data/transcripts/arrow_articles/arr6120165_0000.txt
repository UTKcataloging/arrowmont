N "Committee" at Gatlinburg Each summer as various members of the Settlement School Committee start on their journey to Gatlinburg, they are envied by their friends who always exclaim, "What a grand vacation !" but if these same friends could sit day after day in the living-room at Helmick House and work with Committee as it receives and analyzes the reports for the past year, studies the present conditions and bends its energies to outline the program for the ensuing year, trying to keep expenses within the budget when there are so many places for expansion, they would soon realize that the Settlement School as it now functions is the result of conscientious planning of many members of the Committee over the year with the fine co-operation of every chapter and club in the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. Just as it is hard work to earn in the chapters and clubs the contributions for our School, so is it hard work to disburse the finances with an eye to the best results to be obtained for our mountain people. This year there were several high-lights which were unusually interesting. First, we have completed one year with the educational department of the School run by the County. In an interview with Mr. Theron Hodges, our County superintendent of Schools, an expression of mutual trust and pleasure was ex-changed. The basic program which is provided by the County, was augmented by courses in Crafts and in Physical Education, sponsored by the Fraternity, both of which courses are much needed. Coal for the coming year was being delivered and land had already been bought by the County for the new elementary school building when lumber and other materials are available. Repairs to both elementary and high school buildings were under way for the fall sessions. One dollar rent was collected from the County. A full staff of teachers was being placed under contract and this fall on account ANDY HUFF'S MOUNTAIN VIEW HOTEL, one of four modern hotels which entertains thousands of .tourists each year. At right, farm buildings of Pi Beta Phi School. At left, Roaring Fork Road with group of homes and small shops half mile away. Foreground, highway from Sevierville to Smoky Mountain Park, New Found Gap and on to Asheville over the border. of crowded conditions in the lower grades a new teacher was added to the staff. The number of teachers depends upon the enrollment. It has always been the aim of Pi Beta Phi to preserve an even balance of half Pi Beta Phi teachers and half County selected teachers approved by Pi Beta Phi. This year for the first time in its history the Pi Beta Phi School opened with no Pi Beta Phi teacher on its staff, a condition caused by wartime emergencies. When the Great Smoky Mountain Park was opened several years ago and Sugarlands School was of necessity dismantled, many fraternity women felt that we should do more for the children further away from the Burg. These families, however, were moved closer to the Burg and still enjoyed the benefits of our School, or their families moved entirely away from the section. This year a group of children from Elkmont were without educational opportunity unless transportation to our school was provided. For this year, only, until a satisfactory arrangement can be evolved, Pi Beta Phi is paying for this transportation. This satisfies in a small measure a feeling that we are still reaching out to those isolated children who need us most. Another highlight this summer was "walking the boundaries." The rapid growth of the Burg and the inadequate markers on parts of our property were reasons for a new survey, adjustments and permanent markers. A survey had been made last spring by Mr. Jack Arthur and the Committee approved his work as follows. THAT MEMORABLE TRIP June 21, 1944 Listen, Pi Phis, and you shall hear The tale of Grand Council you revere Who, with Committee on this June day Walked the boundaries and approved the survey; Permanent markers, leaving nothing to chance, Was the aim of Committee, mapped out in advance. At eight in the morning at Health Center gate The group met as suggested (no one was late) ; Amy, Ruth, Lois, Mildred, Lolita, Emma, Ann, Beth and Mr. Jack Arthur, Equipped with stout sticks and good walking shoes And precautionary measures from which to choose, Citronella for mosquitoes, sulphur for "chiggers," Even Jack Arthur's, machete (He "figgers" Some branches to cut, a pathway to clear As the whole party goes into high gear.) 165 THE DECEMBER ARROW A collie attracted by the unusual commotion Augmented the party and proved his devotion By following on (a canine at play) Faithful and loyal throughout the survey. A "drean," iron pipe, 10 links from a gunawood, Wire through a beech tree, five poles from a dogwood, Two marks on a poplar and three for a corner Were some of the guides from here to "up yonder Steep was the ascent from the spring to the ridge With many an obstacle for them to bridge, Barbed wire entangled, old fence rails rotted, (Disintegrating signs of a survey long plotted) A fallen tree crossed a telephone wire All these to surmount and others prior To reaching the top and straddling the rim Of Pi Phi Hill, reached with vigor and vim. Some of the group arrived running and laughing But most of them came a hutfin' and puffin'. On Huckleberry Ridge, a long level stretch With granite rocks, berries and flowers within reach Of all as they gazed both this way and that At boundaries and fences Mr. Arthur pointed at ! Some moved o'er the years (the line surely wavers) As neighbors and Pi Phi exchange special favors. Permanent markers this survey has slated At corners and places which might be debated That now and forever our boundaries may be From dispute and court action forever "scot free." The descent from the hill was made in ,good time, One after another still in single line; Stout canes for support, small trees to hang on to, Slipping, sliding and sitting down, also! Holding back, resisting, groping and falling, Too fast they came clown the side of the mountain, With glimpses of beauty, a white rhododendron, A flame azalea, then a grove to sit down in. Back to Helmick House they came quite elated, "We have walked the boundaries," together they stated. "No casualties, no first aid," they defended. "Walking the boundaries for this year is ended." As an aftermath each member of the group insisted that it had been a wonderful experience which she would not have missed for a great deal, but one which she would not choose to repeat. One of the lovely "finds" in the little grove near the fireplace on Pi Phi Hill is the Stewartia, mountain camelia. It is a rare bloom even in the Smokies and is more beautiful than the flowering dogwood which abounds in this section. MARY L. OWENBY weaves the white bags which are so popular. No matter how fast she wearies, orders for more bags keep piling up at Arrowcraft. Cora Martin ttands, awaiting her turn with W'hig Rose doilies. The rural mailbox brings letters from sons and husbands all over the world and this particular mailbox is no exception. Countries well-known now were only a few years ago, unheard of and unknown. Alaska is "where my son is" or "Yes, my husband is in New Zealand." An old cabin is in the background while a clapboarded home of a later period is in the right foreground. Wartime Weaving Problems This summer the Settlement School Corn mittee thought "it would be kinder nice ef' they could go with Miss Redding when sh( collected the weaving. ("Kinder nice ef" mean "we want to very much.") In peace times th( weavers start from their homes very early it the morning and ride or walk to Arroweraf Shop, bringing in their piles of lovely wovel goods, but in war times everything has changed and the weaving supervisor meets small group of her weavers at the bend of the river in th, Glades, at the end of the mountain path a Powder Hill road, or even at some of th, cabins. All able-bodied men are in service, TIT women care for their families and children' families, weave, tend the garden, cook an( can, feed the pig, milk the cow, pick berries chop wood and there just are not hours enougl in the day for them to go to the Burg with th, products woven in their leisure (?) time. The problems of weaving in wartime as, increasing. It is becoming more difficult t, secure materials ; some of the older weaver have no time to weave with the added cares o home; some who receive adequate allotmen checks do not feel the need of weaving fo economic independence; others are havin babies and for months before and after a bah is born, the supervisor allows none of he weavers to work, and there is a larger crop o wartime babies than usual this year. Thus, Mis Redding has to go farther back into the hills tl get new weavers and train them to the standar( that Arrowcraft desires. The afternoon that Committee drove to th Glades with Miss Redding was clear, bright an( sunny, and on account of the dry weather i was very dusty. There by the riverside were group of four women some of whom ha, already walked a long distance to the meeting place. Gordy McCarter, mother of ten children Mary L. Owenby, who went to Boston for th Handicraft Show two years ago, Lura Profit sister of Arlie Watson, and Cora Martin, wh, has woven for Arrowcraft for eighteen year These women are all expert weavers. Cora doe more weaving than most. She also has tea children. One of her sons is in New Guiner Last year he sent home to his mother for seed to plant a Victory Garden there. Later he sera home for a camera. The pictures of his garde are precious to Cora and are shown with sh mountain pride. Miss Redding, "the writin'est woman, THE DECEMBER ARROW 169 marks down the number of Whig Rose doilies that Cora has brought, then goes on to the others, counting each white bag and butterfly doily as she talks with her weavers about their homes and families. Committee left this group reluctantly as Miss Redding drove way back into the Powder Hill Road, farther back in the ridges than she had ever gone before in search of new young weavers. Here a group of young children had brought boxes of weaving to the edge of the road. Hot and dusty! It was terrifically hot as Committee talked with the shy, reserved children in the open space by the road where there was no shade. Gatlinburg is just as green a field for service as in 1912. In the Burg itself the needs are entirely different, but the more isolated the section the more primitive the conditions and the more poverty and ignorance. The door which Pi Beta Phi has opened to life and education in the Great Smokies must be pushed wider and wider as the mountain people with intelligence far above the average, take full measure of the advantages offered to them. Memorial Fund The Memorial Fund is being used for the Health Centre. It is appropriate that gifts in memory of loved ones should be used in life-giving service, and a sterilizer is being purchased with the accumulated gifts. Please remember to use the Memorial Fund and send gifts to Mrs. Frank Prouty, 1760 Locust Street, Denver, Colorado, who in turn will send you a card in acknowledgment of the gift and a card to the relatives of the person for whom the gift is a memorial. Old Timers' Day The last day of the Committee's stay in Gatlinburg was the Old Timers' Day. This re-union day of all the older residents for miles around was started the second year Phyllis Higginbotham was nurse of the school. "Miz" Phyllis had come from the west where CORA MARTIN is a fine example of mountain woman. Her refined face shows patience, endurance and strong beauty. Her grey hair, once golden, forms a halo as she stands in the sunshine while Miss Redding counts the TVhig Rose doilies Cora has woven. Settlers' Day was well known and popular and she based the recognition of our Old Timers' on personal experience with the Old Settlers. From its innovation until now it has been anticipated for weeks ahead and referred to months after with pride. Five hundred citizens were present in the auditorium when Amos Reagan, President of Old Timers' Day and Master of ceremonies, opened the program, and as many more were milling around on the football grounds outside where Arlie Watson presided at the "Pop" stand which he has capably managed on this day for the last nineteen years. Mr. Reagan's remarks were pertinent to the occasion and one line echoes and re-echoes in our consciousness, "There will never be peace in this world until each nation gets down on its knees. Don't stand up to pray! We must all get down on our knees." Judge Paine, now seventy-seven years old, a friend of the School since its inception, gave the main address of the day and was shown great affection by the austere mountain people. Harp-singing was a stately measure and to watch the faces of these fine men as they sang the notes and then the words of the rugged hymns, audibly keeping time with their feet, was unforgettable. The small boys entered the dog-calling con-test and it was a wise boy who brought his own "claque." Calls "Help, boy, Help" and "Doggo, come out from under" brought the dogs as quickly as Uncle George Ogle's casual, "I'm goin' fox-huntin' ." The baby contest, married couples' contest for the largest number of years of happily married life, were all eagerly entered by hearty participants and the call to lunch was an interruption which was welcomed only as an opportunity to talk things over with friends whom the Old Timers see only once a year. The afternoon was given over to matches of skill in music, corn-shucking, hog-rifle shooting, board splitting, horse shoe pitching, archery for the men and indoor contests for the women in weaving, carding, spinning and sewing. And what are some of the needs of our mountain people? They need a full-time doctor, a dentist and a dental unit, Pi Beta Phi teachers who understand the scope of Pi Phi work and aims, a full time recreational leader (funds are included in the budget for this), a music teacher, typewriters. There are many wartime babies and layettes are welcome, also any other warm clothing for small folk. This winter materials are scarce in the Burg.

N "Committee" at Gatlinburg Each summer as various members of the Settlement School Committee start on their journey to Gatlinburg, they are envied by their friends who always exclaim, "What a grand vacation !" but if these same friends could sit day after day in the living-room at Helmick House and work with Committee as it receives and analyzes the reports for the past year, studies the present conditions and bends its energies to outline the program for the ensuing year, trying to keep expenses within the budget when there are so many places for expansion, they would soon realize that the Settlement School as it now functions is the result of conscientious planning of many members of the Committee over the year with the fine co-operation of every chapter and club in the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. Just as it is hard work to earn in the chapters and clubs the contributions for our School, so is it hard work to disburse the finances with an eye to the best results to be obtained for our mountain people. This year there were several high-lights which were unusually interesting. First, we have completed one year with the educational department of the School run by the County. In an interview with Mr. Theron Hodges, our County superintendent of Schools, an expression of mutual trust and pleasure was ex-changed. The basic program which is provided by the County, was augmented by courses in Crafts and in Physical Education, sponsored by the Fraternity, both of which courses are much needed. Coal for the coming year was being delivered and land had already been bought by the County for the new elementary school building when lumber and other materials are available. Repairs to both elementary and high school buildings were under way for the fall sessions. One dollar rent was collected from the County. A full staff of teachers was being placed under contract and this fall on account ANDY HUFF'S MOUNTAIN VIEW HOTEL, one of four modern hotels which entertains thousands of .tourists each year. At right, farm buildings of Pi Beta Phi School. At left, Roaring Fork Road with group of homes and small shops half mile away. Foreground, highway from Sevierville to Smoky Mountain Park, New Found Gap and on to Asheville over the border. of crowded conditions in the lower grades a new teacher was added to the staff. The number of teachers depends upon the enrollment. It has always been the aim of Pi Beta Phi to preserve an even balance of half Pi Beta Phi teachers and half County selected teachers approved by Pi Beta Phi. This year for the first time in its history the Pi Beta Phi School opened with no Pi Beta Phi teacher on its staff, a condition caused by wartime emergencies. When the Great Smoky Mountain Park was opened several years ago and Sugarlands School was of necessity dismantled, many fraternity women felt that we should do more for the children further away from the Burg. These families, however, were moved closer to the Burg and still enjoyed the benefits of our School, or their families moved entirely away from the section. This year a group of children from Elkmont were without educational opportunity unless transportation to our school was provided. For this year, only, until a satisfactory arrangement can be evolved, Pi Beta Phi is paying for this transportation. This satisfies in a small measure a feeling that we are still reaching out to those isolated children who need us most. Another highlight this summer was "walking the boundaries." The rapid growth of the Burg and the inadequate markers on parts of our property were reasons for a new survey, adjustments and permanent markers. A survey had been made last spring by Mr. Jack Arthur and the Committee approved his work as follows. THAT MEMORABLE TRIP June 21, 1944 Listen, Pi Phis, and you shall hear The tale of Grand Council you revere Who, with Committee on this June day Walked the boundaries and approved the survey; Permanent markers, leaving nothing to chance, Was the aim of Committee, mapped out in advance. At eight in the morning at Health Center gate The group met as suggested (no one was late) ; Amy, Ruth, Lois, Mildred, Lolita, Emma, Ann, Beth and Mr. Jack Arthur, Equipped with stout sticks and good walking shoes And precautionary measures from which to choose, Citronella for mosquitoes, sulphur for "chiggers," Even Jack Arthur's, machete (He "figgers" Some branches to cut, a pathway to clear As the whole party goes into high gear.) 165 THE DECEMBER ARROW A collie attracted by the unusual commotion Augmented the party and proved his devotion By following on (a canine at play) Faithful and loyal throughout the survey. A "drean," iron pipe, 10 links from a gunawood, Wire through a beech tree, five poles from a dogwood, Two marks on a poplar and three for a corner Were some of the guides from here to "up yonder Steep was the ascent from the spring to the ridge With many an obstacle for them to bridge, Barbed wire entangled, old fence rails rotted, (Disintegrating signs of a survey long plotted) A fallen tree crossed a telephone wire All these to surmount and others prior To reaching the top and straddling the rim Of Pi Phi Hill, reached with vigor and vim. Some of the group arrived running and laughing But most of them came a hutfin' and puffin'. On Huckleberry Ridge, a long level stretch With granite rocks, berries and flowers within reach Of all as they gazed both this way and that At boundaries and fences Mr. Arthur pointed at ! Some moved o'er the years (the line surely wavers) As neighbors and Pi Phi exchange special favors. Permanent markers this survey has slated At corners and places which might be debated That now and forever our boundaries may be From dispute and court action forever "scot free." The descent from the hill was made in ,good time, One after another still in single line; Stout canes for support, small trees to hang on to, Slipping, sliding and sitting down, also! Holding back, resisting, groping and falling, Too fast they came clown the side of the mountain, With glimpses of beauty, a white rhododendron, A flame azalea, then a grove to sit down in. Back to Helmick House they came quite elated, "We have walked the boundaries," together they stated. "No casualties, no first aid," they defended. "Walking the boundaries for this year is ended." As an aftermath each member of the group insisted that it had been a wonderful experience which she would not have missed for a great deal, but one which she would not choose to repeat. One of the lovely "finds" in the little grove near the fireplace on Pi Phi Hill is the Stewartia, mountain camelia. It is a rare bloom even in the Smokies and is more beautiful than the flowering dogwood which abounds in this section. MARY L. OWENBY weaves the white bags which are so popular. No matter how fast she wearies, orders for more bags keep piling up at Arrowcraft. Cora Martin ttands, awaiting her turn with W'hig Rose doilies. The rural mailbox brings letters from sons and husbands all over the world and this particular mailbox is no exception. Countries well-known now were only a few years ago, unheard of and unknown. Alaska is "where my son is" or "Yes, my husband is in New Zealand." An old cabin is in the background while a clapboarded home of a later period is in the right foreground. Wartime Weaving Problems This summer the Settlement School Corn mittee thought "it would be kinder nice ef' they could go with Miss Redding when sh( collected the weaving. ("Kinder nice ef" mean "we want to very much.") In peace times th( weavers start from their homes very early it the morning and ride or walk to Arroweraf Shop, bringing in their piles of lovely wovel goods, but in war times everything has changed and the weaving supervisor meets small group of her weavers at the bend of the river in th, Glades, at the end of the mountain path a Powder Hill road, or even at some of th, cabins. All able-bodied men are in service, TIT women care for their families and children' families, weave, tend the garden, cook an( can, feed the pig, milk the cow, pick berries chop wood and there just are not hours enougl in the day for them to go to the Burg with th, products woven in their leisure (?) time. The problems of weaving in wartime as, increasing. It is becoming more difficult t, secure materials ; some of the older weaver have no time to weave with the added cares o home; some who receive adequate allotmen checks do not feel the need of weaving fo economic independence; others are havin babies and for months before and after a bah is born, the supervisor allows none of he weavers to work, and there is a larger crop o wartime babies than usual this year. Thus, Mis Redding has to go farther back into the hills tl get new weavers and train them to the standar( that Arrowcraft desires. The afternoon that Committee drove to th Glades with Miss Redding was clear, bright an( sunny, and on account of the dry weather i was very dusty. There by the riverside were group of four women some of whom ha, already walked a long distance to the meeting place. Gordy McCarter, mother of ten children Mary L. Owenby, who went to Boston for th Handicraft Show two years ago, Lura Profit sister of Arlie Watson, and Cora Martin, wh, has woven for Arrowcraft for eighteen year These women are all expert weavers. Cora doe more weaving than most. She also has tea children. One of her sons is in New Guiner Last year he sent home to his mother for seed to plant a Victory Garden there. Later he sera home for a camera. The pictures of his garde are precious to Cora and are shown with sh mountain pride. Miss Redding, "the writin'est woman, THE DECEMBER ARROW 169 marks down the number of Whig Rose doilies that Cora has brought, then goes on to the others, counting each white bag and butterfly doily as she talks with her weavers about their homes and families. Committee left this group reluctantly as Miss Redding drove way back into the Powder Hill Road, farther back in the ridges than she had ever gone before in search of new young weavers. Here a group of young children had brought boxes of weaving to the edge of the road. Hot and dusty! It was terrifically hot as Committee talked with the shy, reserved children in the open space by the road where there was no shade. Gatlinburg is just as green a field for service as in 1912. In the Burg itself the needs are entirely different, but the more isolated the section the more primitive the conditions and the more poverty and ignorance. The door which Pi Beta Phi has opened to life and education in the Great Smokies must be pushed wider and wider as the mountain people with intelligence far above the average, take full measure of the advantages offered to them. Memorial Fund The Memorial Fund is being used for the Health Centre. It is appropriate that gifts in memory of loved ones should be used in life-giving service, and a sterilizer is being purchased with the accumulated gifts. Please remember to use the Memorial Fund and send gifts to Mrs. Frank Prouty, 1760 Locust Street, Denver, Colorado, who in turn will send you a card in acknowledgment of the gift and a card to the relatives of the person for whom the gift is a memorial. Old Timers' Day The last day of the Committee's stay in Gatlinburg was the Old Timers' Day. This re-union day of all the older residents for miles around was started the second year Phyllis Higginbotham was nurse of the school. "Miz" Phyllis had come from the west where CORA MARTIN is a fine example of mountain woman. Her refined face shows patience, endurance and strong beauty. Her grey hair, once golden, forms a halo as she stands in the sunshine while Miss Redding counts the TVhig Rose doilies Cora has woven. Settlers' Day was well known and popular and she based the recognition of our Old Timers' on personal experience with the Old Settlers. From its innovation until now it has been anticipated for weeks ahead and referred to months after with pride. Five hundred citizens were present in the auditorium when Amos Reagan, President of Old Timers' Day and Master of ceremonies, opened the program, and as many more were milling around on the football grounds outside where Arlie Watson presided at the "Pop" stand which he has capably managed on this day for the last nineteen years. Mr. Reagan's remarks were pertinent to the occasion and one line echoes and re-echoes in our consciousness, "There will never be peace in this world until each nation gets down on its knees. Don't stand up to pray! We must all get down on our knees." Judge Paine, now seventy-seven years old, a friend of the School since its inception, gave the main address of the day and was shown great affection by the austere mountain people. Harp-singing was a stately measure and to watch the faces of these fine men as they sang the notes and then the words of the rugged hymns, audibly keeping time with their feet, was unforgettable. The small boys entered the dog-calling con-test and it was a wise boy who brought his own "claque." Calls "Help, boy, Help" and "Doggo, come out from under" brought the dogs as quickly as Uncle George Ogle's casual, "I'm goin' fox-huntin' ." The baby contest, married couples' contest for the largest number of years of happily married life, were all eagerly entered by hearty participants and the call to lunch was an interruption which was welcomed only as an opportunity to talk things over with friends whom the Old Timers see only once a year. The afternoon was given over to matches of skill in music, corn-shucking, hog-rifle shooting, board splitting, horse shoe pitching, archery for the men and indoor contests for the women in weaving, carding, spinning and sewing. And what are some of the needs of our mountain people? They need a full-time doctor, a dentist and a dental unit, Pi Beta Phi teachers who understand the scope of Pi Phi work and aims, a full time recreational leader (funds are included in the budget for this), a music teacher, typewriters. There are many wartime babies and layettes are welcome, also any other warm clothing for small folk. This winter materials are scarce in the Burg. Let's make the "quality of our contact" with the Settlement School this year benefit our mountain people and in so doing enrich our own lives !
