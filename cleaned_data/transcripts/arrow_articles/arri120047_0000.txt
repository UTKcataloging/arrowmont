        SUL/lent School 19124962 FIFTIETH YEAR REPORT-SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE Fifty years of Settlement School are an achievement and a challenge. It would be impossible to compile a complete roster of every Pi Phi who, during these years, ever gave of her resources at the Settlement School, or, to the same end, in her chapter or alumna club. Working together through five decades of service and voluntary contributions, the members of the fraternity have built a remarkable, nationally recognized, living Memorial to the Founders of Pi Beta Phi. The fact that the fraternity's national philanthropic efforts have not been dispersed is undoubtedly one factor. The fact of a tangible place is another. The fact of building, layer by layer and year by year, upon the original intent and investment is a third. And finally, there is the fact of changing services to met changing needs a policy that has prevailed through the years. This fiftieth year report will first review the several ways the Golden Anniversary of the Settlement school was celebrated. The usual report of the year just pas$will follow. Lastly, from a comprehensive range of concerns, there will be an attempt to identify some of the immediate needs and challenges pertaining to our national philanthropy. Fiftieth Anniversary Highlights As was proper, commemoration festivities began at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg on March 6. First on the agenda was a chapel program in the school auditorium where the resident staff, dormitory students and several townspeople presented a narration with tableaux depicting the 50-year story. Fraternity representatives were Alice Mansfield, Grand President; Olivia Moore, Grand Treasurer; Marianne Wild, NPC Delegate; Pat Akers, Eta Province President; and Zoe James, Settlement School Treasurer, who wrote the splendid story of the celebration for last summer's ARROW. Also at the school, Margaret Struble, Iowa Gamma art teacher, arranged an eye-catching bulletin board display of old pictures which created much interest among the student body. Though a deep snow and icy roads unexpectedly cut attendance at the Staff House anniversary dinner, several members of the early classes at the school were able to attend, and the evening abounded with reminiscent conversation beginning with "Do you remember?" A very nice surprise occurred next when the high school annual, The Mountaineer, was dedicated as follows: "We, the Senior Class of 1962, are honored to dedicate this issue of The Mountaineer to the members of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, whose courage and foresight have, for fifty years, demonstrated the finest attributes of a democratic nation. We salute you !" Pictures of the five Grand Presidents of the fraternity from 1912 to 1962 and several early school scenes added dignity and interest to the dedication pages. The Smithsonian Institution Exhibition in Washing-ton from June 22 to July 22 was probably the highlight of the anniversary year! Those fortunate to be present for the opening reception in the famous Rotunda of the Arts and Industries Building will never forget our pride in the Settlement School when Dr. Kellogg coupled our endeavors with those of the Smithsonian ! To have our efforts, especially those in the Arts and Crafts field, recognized and praised by an institution of the stature of the Smithsonian, The United States National Museum, is surely a unique experience in the fraternity world, and it is one all Pi Phis will treasure. It was thrilling to see our familiar Arrowcraft handweaving and the creative weaving of several Craft Workshop students combined with otheraccent crafts in such a beautiful and extensive exhibit. Mrs. Myrtle Conner, Arrowcraft weaver for over 30 years, demonstrated weaving for six days in the shadow of the enormous Statue of Freedom in the Rotunda, causing many interested pauses and comments among the thousands who passed her loom each day. In connection with the Smithsonian Exhibit and the 1962 Convention, Marie Lingo, Delta PVP, and Helen Russell, Committee Chairman, participated in a radio interview on the Patty Cavan Show at station WX'RC-NBC in Washington, and later in the week, Marion Mueller, Director, and Myrtle Conner, weaver, were interviewed on television by the well known Inga of the same station. Many Pi Phis were able to see the exhibit during convention week, and for others pictures will be forthcoming. The latest news is a wonderful sequel to the month-long summer exhibit a permanent collection of Arrowcraft weaving at the Smithsonian and the promise of those pieces being used in another exhibit in 1967 when Pi Beta Phi is 100 years old! Details of this further development will be told in a future issue of the ARROW. The fraternity owes a great debt of gratitude to Marie Lingo for her personal contacts over a two-year period on behalf of a Smithsonian Exhibit to commemorate the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Settlement School. At Convention, a special 50-year Settlement School Exhibit was set up in a corner of the Historical Room. Prepared by the committee and under the leadership of Helen Dix, now Grand Vice President, a display of posters with old and new albums was carried out in gold. On a separate table, honor and tribute were paid to the twelve Founders who appeared to be looking down from a cloud in Pi Phi heaven upon a standing mobile in gold and white, representing the Settlement School today. Across the room, in the regular Historical Exhibit, was an autographed picture of Grace Coolidge, sent for convention display by Sarah Pomeroy Rugg who designated it to go to the School, after Convention, to replace the picture destroyed in tLe recent fire. The committee is very gratefulio Mrs. Rugg for id t1iioughtfulness in providing this replacement. Needless to say, an important accession to the Grace Coolidge Library at the Settlement School this year is the new book, "Grace Coolidge and Her Era" by Ishbel Ross, which received so much attention at the 1962 Convention. The Arrowcraft Shop at Convention, under the splendid leadership of Acting Manager Marion Mueller, helped celebrate the anniversary by being the largest and best financially of any known. Several golden items had been designed to commemorate fifty years, while other new items held the attention of delegates thinking ahead to coming Arrowcraft sales. Valued assistance was given all week long by Dorothy Hopkins and other members of the Baltimore Alumna Club, by Elizabeth Rue Manager of the Gatlinburg Mt. View Hotel shop, by Virginia Brackett Green former Committee Chairman, and by Lois Summers of the current committee. The Convention Report was given informally, high-lights of the past year being quickly reviewed. That time was mainly given to presentation of Little Pigeon Awards to province heads for 100% contributions, to clubs and chapters for outstanding support, plus Magazine Agency award checks. Special to the year were Soaring Pigeon Awards given to the chapters contributing the most individual members together with number of service years in direct Settlement School work during fifty years as teachers, resident staff, members of committee, teachers or 46 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 47 students at Craft Workshop, and the like. These special awards were won by Iowa Gamma first, Illinois Beta-Delta second, and Indiana Gamma third. In addition and amid grateful and warm applause, Marie Lingo received a Soaring Pigeon, the first ever awarded to an individual, for her outstanding liaison leading to the Smithsonian Exhibit. The Convention Settlement School Dinner was beautifully presented by the Cleveland East and West Alumna' Clubs, with Betty Calhoun of East and Barbara Olsen of West hostessing for the clubs, and Peg Feistkorn of East presiding at the head table. The Evelyn Prouty Hickman placemat design was reproduced in gold on white for the occasion; souvenirs were Pi Beta Phi ash-trays and gold and white printed napkins and decorated napkin clips. Table centerpieces were miniature wooden spinning wheels (two of which found their way to the Settlement School), with gold and white flowers artistically added. During the dinner hour, Rose Dressler, rep-resenting the Kansas City Alumnw Club's post-convention Tour-to-New York, presented to the Settlement School a generous profit-sharing check which was most gratefully accepted. With the aid of Eloise Hensley, committee member identifying those at convention with direct Settlement School experience, "Chairman Peg" recognized and honored: May L. Keller President Emeritus, first Pi Phi to visit Gatlin-burg (1910) Amy B. Onken----Honorary Grand President, 32 years leadership in school growth Olivia S. Moore Grand Treasurer, former Committee Treasurer, present adviser Lolita S. Prouty Fortner Grand Treasurer, former Committee Treasurer Lillian B. Holton Former Committee Chairman Virginia B. Green Former Committee Chairman Emily M. White D.C. club president when Miss Turner took school idea to 1910 convention Nancy Jo Henry Former Assistant to Director, delegate from Little Pigeon club Henrietta McC, Huff Former teacher, alternate from Little Pigeon club Nancy A. Smetts Gamma Province President Kitty B. Massenburg Delta Province President Marion W. Mueller Director of Settlement School Elizabeth W. Rue Former Arrowcraft Manager, He, View Hotel Shop Manager Helen M. Russell Chairman Settlement School Committee The Settlement School Anniversary Program following dinner opened with the lovely voices of Pat Ballard and her chorus leading the audience in three songs: Old Smoky as sung at the school, A Paper of Pins with humorous boy-girl aspects, and IJ7eaving a reminder of our own Arrowcraft. The chorus alone then sang Pi Beta Phi T'o Thee, the beautiful Alma Mater at the school and different from the fraternity song. The program itself consisted of slides with a running commentary on the people and developments as the five areas of the school grew during fifty years. Periodically chorus voices came in with quotes, or emphasized points to remember. The actives helping so effectively with this part of the pro-gram were Susie Garretson of Oklahoma Beta, Nola Hague of Alberta Alpha, and Jeannie Norris of California Delta. Slides of pictures from old ARROWS and photo-graph albums were combined with current slides to give a sweeping history in an atmosphere of "You Were There." The able assistance of Zoe James in correlating slides with script was deeply appreciated. The program closed with the exquisitely beautiful voice of Pat Bal-Iard singing I IY'bnder As I Wander. Virginia Green's excellent new booklet bringing the Settlement School story up-to-date for initiates was a convention favor presented to everyone immediately after the program. The grateful appreciation of the fraternity goes to Virginia for her hours of research and writing, to Dor Burns of Central Office who had charge of the printing, and to Grand Council for joint cooperation to complete this needed revision in time for introduction at the 1962 Convention. Banquet highlights for the Settlement School werethree-fold. As guests entered the impressive State Room for that last dinner and evening together, the first thing they saw were envelope purses from Arrowcraft as dinner favors. Next came Olivia Moore's announcement of the generous cash gift to Settlement School by the three Prouty daughters to honor their mother, Lolita Snell Prouty, and to be held as a nucleus for a sorely-needed, permanent ceramics laboratory. Lastly came the presentation of the May L. Keller Award for the best chapter Settlement School program to Dianne Bushell and Nancy Hughes of Ontario Alpha; we believe this to be the first time a Canadian chapter has been so honored. The final highlight of the anniversary year occurred in Gatlinburg where the committee adjourned to conclude its annual meeting. There we saw, for the first time, the newly complete Weaving Studio, a structure long planned for and needed. The studio part is a spacious room well-suited for instruction, display, proper placing of thirty-six looms, and storage of supplies. The en-trance room is particularly attractive. It is dominated by a lovely stone fireplace, flanked on one side by open floor-to-ceiling shelves. Handwoven hangings enhance the walls, and a few tables and chairs complete the charm of this entrance room. This, The Evelyn Bishop Memorial Room, was furnished from contributions given in memory of Miss Evelyn, head resident at the school from 1918-1933, who passed on last year. Numerous Gatlin-burg residents who had known and loved Miss Evelyn attended the dedication on July 5th. The ceremony opened with a moving prayer by Lois Summers, followed by group singing of a favorite hymn of Miss Evelyn's led by Marjorie Chalmers and Dorothy Manley. Gene Red-ding and Sue Huff Cox then told some of their memories of Miss Evelyn, recalling the endearing qualities she had for all who knew her. The ceremony ended as Helen Russell presented and entrusted the keys of the building to Director Marion Mueller. During the reception hour, it was a privilege for committee members to met and converse with townspeople, many of whom had been well-known names only, prior to this day. It was a memorable occasion for all who came together to pay tribute to the lovely lady who gave so much of herself in planting strong roots for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Thus, the Golden Anniversary commemoration was concluded in Gatlinburg where it all began fifty years ago. It was appropriate that several features of the celebration took place in our nation's capital where the idea for the school was first conceived. Now, in retrospect, the activities at both Washington and Gatlinburg have seemed to fuse into a whole, and our concern for a dignified, appropriate and memorable Golden Anniversary for the Settlement School comes to an end. It has been a rare privilege and honor to participate intimately in the commemorative proceedings. The Past Year: 1961-62 The 1962 Summer Craft Workshop, jointly sponsored by the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School and the University of Tennessee for 18 increasingly successful years, attained a new high of 136 students enrolled for both sessions. There were 96 individuals, just two less than the all-time high of the year before. They came from 23 states, and two came from Pakistan. These facts alone should indicate the excellent reputation of our Craft Workshop and the wide appeal it continues to have. The fraternity owes a sixteen year debt to Marion Heard, Professor of Craft Design at UT, for the outstanding and selfless leadership she has given to the Workshop. Excel-lent instructors have also played a major role. The age range among students is wide and occupations are diversified. Some come for credit with graduate students pre-dominating, while others come just for the satisfactions found in handcrafts. Courses were offered this year in jewelry, silk screen, pottery, weaving design, recreational crafts and enameling. These courses are tough and in48 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI tensive, as the writer can testify! Instructors give personal attention to each student and all are "master teachers" in somehow drawing out the best in each pupil. Final exhibits, open to the public, give amazing evidence of the high standards of skill and artistry which are the backbone of the Workshop's fine reputation at home and abroad. More Pi Phis should come and see, or better still, come and attend! The new Leaving Studio is a joy to work in, committee was told, and a pleasure to look at both inside and out, as we saw! It is good that our looms now have a permanent home. Further, we now have a place where additional workshops may be held throughout the year. This is a step forward, as we think ahead to the future. When the pottery wing is added to this building to complete the original plan, firm foundations will have been laid for year-around training in two art and craft fields. The Virginia Alpha Scholarship to the Craft Work-shop this year was won by Nancy Van Schreeven of Virginia Gamma. The Albuquerque Alum= Club scholarship was won by Bette Casteel who came from Alameda. Graduate Assistants were jean Carroll of South Carolina Alpha and Margaret Struble of Iowa Gamma. Pi Phis attending as students were Connie Cox, Tennessee Gamma, Miriam Herron, Illinois Eta, and Lucy Glazner Matkin, Oklahoma Beta. Gale Ann McDonald came all the way from Michigan Delta to assist Mrs. Mueller during the weeks of Workshop. There really ought to be more Pi Phis at our Craft Workshops. Would more local scholarships within the provinces help? The Craft Workshop is an exciting, going concern now; its pioneering days are over! Its outreach extends from ocean to ocean, and from gulf to across the Canadian border. And it has drawn 27 foreign students from a dozen different countries ! The teenager and senior citizen work side by side, for age is no barrier in creativity. It teaches those who teach others children, youth or adults, the physically able and the handicapped, the normal and the subor above normal. Those who come to learn take back to their local communities their new skills and appreciations for application at home. Would that more Pi Phis knew and understood this particular asset of the Settlement School! Now, Arrowcraft is an asset (and a trademark) long familiar to Pi Phis, especially in those loyal clubs and chapters where annual or biennial Arrowcraft sales are a tradition. This, too, serves an arts and crafts area, our own special one handweaving, and we realize anew its quality and worth due to the Smithsonian Exhibition. It is disappointing that weaving sales to clubs and chapters dropped a bit, but other craft sales climbed so that the year ended with an overall increased total. Especially encouraging and noteworthy is the new and splendid record attained when 36 clubs paid over $1000 to Arrow-craft last year. Those clubs, of which the first five received Soaring Pigeon Awards at convention, are: Champaign-Urbana $4,288.24 Philadelphia $1,276.82 Oklahoma City 3,190.66 Milwaukee 1,256.09 Houston 2,294.58 Toledo 1,217.42 Arlington Heights 2,140.62 Fayetteville 1,215.34 Akron 2,055.65 Ann Arbor 1,197.06 Pittsburgh 2,040.68 Western Kansas 1,109.19 Lincoln 1,968.72 Chicago W. Suburban 1,159.79 Pasadana 1,902.98 Madison 1,129.17 Indianapolis ....... 1,843.67 Charleston 1,127.96 Schenectady ........ 1,797.32 Phoenix 1,112.44 Denver ........ 1,774.79 North Shore 1,103.62 South Bend ........ 1,697.92 Everett 1,102.76 Northern New Jersey 1,608.77 Dallas 1,091.24 Columbus, Ohio 1,437.66 Cleveland East 1,068.58 Miami 1,433.11 Galesburg 1,052.27 Kansas 'City, Mo. 1,348.84 Des Moines 1,035.76 Columbia, Mo 1,348.58 Baltimore 1,018.41 Cleveland West 1,303.98 Southern New Jersey 1,011.35 The club chairmen and other Arrowcraft devotees who made this list possible, are most warmly commended and thanked. Many smaller clubs had excellent sales for their size, with Arrowcraft remittances just under the figure for honorable mention. Arrowcraft had two efficiency boosts this year. One was the addition to the shop of a shipping room which has greatly alleviated former cramped quarters. The second need was for a new truck to replace the old one that was beginning to cost in maintenance and repairs. This is the only truck the school has and it gets much hard use on the grounds and as it carries express Arrowcraft shipments to Sevierville during busy club shipping seasons. Marion Mueller has continued to serve as Arrowcraft Manager since November, 1961 when Nevada Christian resigned. This has added greatly to her responsibilities, and it is hoped that a new manager can be found soon. A second replacement at the shop will be necessary next January when the resignation of Gene Redding, Weaving Designer, takes effect. Gene has capably served Arrow-craft, during four different employment periods, since 1925 when she first came to the school as a weaving teacher. She will be greatly missed. However, she is building a retirement home in the area so contact with her will not be lost. Most of the designs in the Smithsonian Exhibit were Gene's, a splendid tribute to her years of work with the school and to her personally during her last year. Eunice Cole will continue to serve as bookkeeper, as will Nella Hill, Faye Cook, Gene Hembree, Shirley Roberts, and June Cook, all of whom are very able, loyal employees. Orlie, Neal and Zanley Watson, who share the heavy work at the shop, fit that description too; they con-tribute cheerfulness to the shop scene as well as strong muscles! While we are on the subject of Watson men at the Settlement School, we greatly appreciate the fine day-by-day maintenance service given by all four of them, including Richard who does some grounds work, tends the chickens (soon to be stopped), and works the gardens. Neal is Orlie's son; Zanley is Orlie's nephew; Richard is no known kin, though if one went back far enough, he just might be found to be kin "close to far off !" Orlie attained 35 years of Settlement School service last summer. He was honored at a Staff House dinner on September 1, 1961 at which time he started part-time work, with Zanley coming in for full time employment. Much of Orlie's time last spring was spent in construction supervision of the new Weaving Studio. We are very grateful to all the Watson men for their excellent care of the Pi Phi Settlement School property; it is their work, supervised by the Director, which makes visiting Pi Phis so proud of the appearance of the grounds and buildings. The school situation, in regard to proposed plans for consolidating Pi Beta Phi High School with Pitman Center, awaits a financing vote from the Sevier County Court. (County-wide raises for teachers await a similar action.) For the 1962-63 school year, present arrangements are concluded for the fraternity to provide the Arts and Crafts teacher who will be Miss Betty Burchfiel of Sevierville. We regret the resignation of Margaret Struble, Iowa Gamma, the able instructor of last year. Increased popularity of Mr. Carl Huskey's classes in Woodworking among high school boys will raise his daily classes to three. If it is possible to secure a Music teacher before school opens, those classes will again be provided. Mrs. Leona Enloe, after several years on our staff, has retired from teaching. The Art and Woodworking classes are taught in the Emma Harper Turner Arts and Crafts Center. Other than the old Log Cabin, this building is the oldest on our property. It is worth preserving because part of that building was our first school ! However, when those rooms are viewed in the light of modern classrooms, they leave much to be desired in surroundings and in equipment. It is hoped that additional, special contributions for this purpose will make renovation possible in the near future. It is important to train the young of this area in appreciations in the Arts and Crafts field; this can and should be done well. The Jennie Nicol Health Center, with Nurse Marjorie Chalmers again in charge, had another excellent, service-able year. Marjorie came to the Settlement School in December of 1935, was honored for 25 years continuous THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 49 service at the "Little Convention" banquet in June of 1961, and she has decided that the time has come for her to retire (in the area also, which does have a tremendous charm) as soon as a replacement can be secured. Marjorie's personalized program in Maternal and Infant Welfare has paid great dividends to the entire community; her work in this area alone has spanned three generations. She has been a friend indeed to the children of the Pi Beta Phi School, to those at nearby rural schools (de-creased to one at present), to the summer Craft Work-shop students, to the general community and to anyone in need who comes to her door. Naturally her work today is more preventative, therapeutic, corrective and advisory than it was in those earlier days, but she has been no less busy this past year, as this record of service indicates: Field visits 544 Office calls 3856 Service given 3223 Smallpox vaccinations 276 Typhoid inoculations 341 Triple vaccine 225 Salk vaccine 330 Tetanus toxoid 36 Therapeutic inoculations 177 Tuberculin tests 37 Chest X-rays ... . 1047 Physical exams and inspections 3170 Audiometer tests 163 Teacher-nurse conferences 197 Family conferences 294 Health talks 74 Newspaper articles 18 Sigma Phi Gamma contributions to the Health Center this year totaled $225. These donations are grate-fully received each year and used for children in medically indigent families needing correction of orthopedic weaknesses, speech and hearing defects, dental troubles, and the purchase or replacement of glasses. Adjustments to a new nurse will not be easy for Marjorie has been the Health Center for so long, but we are counting on both Marjorie and the new person to make the change as smooth as possible. Our sincere thanks are again extended to Marjorie for her many years of splendid service. The Dormitory Program, in spite of the January to May housing interruption, had a very rewarding year in retrospect, with several students attaining leadership positions and various school awards. Senior Ruby Wright received the North Shore Alumnx Club scholarship for further education, while Randy Trentham, another dorm student, and Charles Moore, Jr., received Alspaugh Fund scholarships. Ruth Spelman completed her fourth excel-lent year as Stuart housemother for the girls, while Marion Mueller capably shared supervision of the boys with Lela Adams. The January 11th fire at the Boys' Dorm (also called Teachers Cottage and Helmick House) could have been tragic, but fortunately and thankfully, it was not! Fast warning by Mrs. Adams and prompt reactions by Mr. Carnes, a teacher in residence, and the boys, resulted in prompt evacuation of the building. Members of the Gatlinburg Volunteer Fire Department responded quickly to the siren that cold, cold night and were able to confine blaze damage to the first floor, though contents of the second floor were a major loss as well, due to smoke and water damage. Two facts were prominent in regard to rebuilding: one, that the timber in this building was originally so 'sturdy and sound, and two, that committee had converted to a replacement-cost type of insurance just the summer before. The appeal to the fraternity for emergency donations brought a most welcome response of $918.41, all of which was used to restitute personal losses and (with additional funds from the General Account) to make several needed improvements. To make a long, tedious adjustment and rebuilding story short, Teachers Cottage was rebuilt, refurnished, and ready for occupancy by summer Craft Workshop students on June 11th! Much credit goes to Marion Mueller and the maintenance men for the local planning and hard work necessary to meet that deadline. Teachers Cottage is clean and freshnow, and actually more attractive than ever belying its age of 46 years ! Annual contributions from both clubs and chapters were higher than the prior year, with those from chapters increasing over 25 percent! What a nice way to recognize the anniversary year ! 100% provinces in contributions for the concluding fiscal year were: Clubs Charters Gamma Alpha Kappa Epsilon Beta Mu Zeta Gamma Nu Eta Delta Omicron Iota Epsilon Pi Lambda Zeta Mu Eta Pi North Theta Pi South Iota Officers for the above provinces received Little Pigeon Awards at Convention to wear for their provinces. It is hoped that some year it will be possible to thus recognize every club and every chapter in the fraternity. It has not happened yet! Soaring Pigeon Awards for highest percent increases in contributions were awarded to Salinas, California (1700%) and to Nevada Alpha (1400%). Similar awards for highest dollar increases went to St. Louis, Missouri ($400) and to Nevada Alpha ($140). These evidences of renewed confidence and support are appreciated. For many years it has been a custom in annual Settlement School reports to give honorable mention to clubs contributing $150 or more, and to chapters giving $100 or more. This year, after considerable research, we would like to include the number of years since 1949 that a listed club has continuously been given such honorable mention. Total club contributions, including fire donations, received by the Settlement School Treasurer were $11,539.53. Of this amount, a slight increase, the following 17 clubs contributed over 48 percent of total alumnx club support this past year: (continuous honorable mention years are in parentheses) St. Louis (13) Kansas City (13) Pasadena (5) North Shore (5) Miami (2) Indianapolis (13) Cleveland East North Shore Jr. (4) Columbus Houston .. . Philadelphia (4) Westchester Co. (3) Arlington Heights (3) Champaign-Urbana (2) Everett (6) Northern N. Jersey (2) Sacramento (3) Total $5,579.50 We take this opportunity to say a heart-felt thank you to all clubs that give substantial support to our national philanthropy year in and year out. Many other clubs not named this year have given similar support though not continuously. Still others give to the limit of their annual in-come and we are grateful to them. It is distressing to those of us who must fight the annual "battle of the budget" that some do not carry their fair share; because some don't, others must, and we are eternally grateful for that kind of loyalty. Chapter contributions increased an amazing 25% this year! The total was a fine new high of $3,406.76. The increase of $717.67 is most welcome, as is the convention vote to permit half of the annual chapter contributions to be used for operating expenses. Chapters giving $100 and over, together with continuous years each has given this kind of support since 1949, are: Texas Alpha $ 300.00 South Dakota Alpha (2) 165.00 Nevada Alpha 150.00 $1,200.00 1,000.00 380.00 350.00 300.00 270.00 264.50 250.00 200.00 200.00 200.00 200.00 165.00 150.00 150.00 150.00 150.00 50 Texas Gamma (7) ................................ 150.00 Alabama Beta (3) . . . ............................ 100.00 Missouri Beta (12) 100.00 Nebraska Beta 100.00 Total S1,065.00 The drop in Magazine Agency Commissions, a major source of annual income, was very disheartening both at Central Office and at Settlement School, especially since the trend had been consistently upward in the prior several years. A loss of expected income in the amount of $2,150 is serious for the Settlement School, and it is most earnestly hoped that magazine sales in the current year will provide commissions which more than make up for the discouraging drop this year. Many individuals, clubs, Mothers' clubs, and chapters donated cash for special purposes and goods of various kinds to the school. These include Christmas and other holiday remembrances, clothing and various household articles, Fire Relief donations already mentioned, and special goods to the Health Center. Memorial Fund gifts came to exactly $100 this year. Many thanks are extended to each donor. Many "free purchases" were permitted through gifts of SH and TV stamps. These are always wanted and appreciated. Please continue to send them to the Director. The dollar has shrunk as much in Gatlinburg as any-where else in the country, and it is sometimes wondered if new budgets using last year's contribution figures are automatic year after year. Please let no one misunderstand. Every dollar sent is gratefully received and put to good use, but we do need more of them! In an endeavor to increase contributions, the Settlement School Commit-tee at its last meeting adopted a new contribution credit plan which will make more bookkeeping for the Treasurer but which we believe will have appeal for many individual Pi Phis. Henceforth, individual Pi Phis may make personal contributions to the Settlement School (many do!), assigning contribution credit to a favorite club or chap-ter, providing this is done at the time a check is sent. It is hoped that such two-way benefit will appeal to many members of the fraternity as they plan their personal contribution programs for the year. Many of us give automatically each year to the United Fund, the Red Cross, and many other personal favorite philanthropies. Why not consider a similar tax-deductible contribution to the Settlement School each year too? With a second benefit added (contribution credit for an alumnae club or an active chapter), we hope for increased interest in personal Pi Phi donations. Such checks should be made out to "Pi Beta Phi Settlement School" and they may be sent direct to the Settlement School Treasurer or through a club or chapter Treasurer. Contribution credit will be given only if a designation note is received with a check. The concluding Settlement School year was a very busy one for the resident staff and for the Settlement School Committee. The gratitude of the fraternity is due Director Marion Mueller for her capable handling of so many musts, all of which seemed to run concurrently for most of the year! Committee members have given marvelous cooperation to the chairman all through the year too, and all appreciate the good help and advice given so generously by our Grand Council contact member Olivia Smith Moore. We regret the conclusion of close working relationships with our excellent retiring treasurer, Zoe Saunders James; at the same time we welcome Sally Bozman Schneiter of Muncie, Indiana who has already indicated a knowledgeable and able handling of our financial concerns. We were both sad and happy for Helen Boucher Dix to be so suddenly "snatched" from our committee and so wholeheartedly "seated" in Grand Council as Grand Vice President; our best wishes go with her. We are very happy to have Sally Wild Gordon, former Pi Province President, join us in the capacity of publicity work for the committee. Lois Overstreet Summers and Eloise Glazner Hensley add desirable, capable con THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI tinuity even though they have switched jobs Lois to Secretary and Eloise to Slides Programs! It is again comforting to the chairman to have loyal, analytic Pi Phis sharing in the deliberations of this fraternity committee. Needs and Challenges The need for more dollars to balance their shrinking value has already been stated. Salaries must be paid, equipment replaced, the monthly bills met, leaks re-paired and danger spots eliminated. We must keep our several educational endeavors going for we are that kind of institution, and teachers and even minimum supplies and tools of work do cost. This dorm boy needs to earn extra money to make the senior trip with his class, and that girl needs to get her teeth fixed. At Arrowcraft, threads must be bought, and the weavers paid when they bring in their weaving. The Settlement School is a big place. Five dollars help, of course, but they don't go far. Contributions without strings are preferred, for then they may be used where the need is greatest. When a donation is over and above the needed annual income, the Director or Chairman is always happy to advise on a designated use. We see a need for more thoughtful understanding and education concerning our Settlement School. Too many Pi Phis are misinformed; too many expect the settlement, the people and the area to be the same as 25 years ago. This is one reason why committee has been so eager for a new Settlement School booklet to be placed in the hands of initiates. The pioneering days are over; they should be in fifty years! The early days were colorful and fascinating, but it is wrong to depict those days as if they existed today. A good educational program will balance the historical and the contemporary, and both kinds of presentations should be correct. Creativity in programs is fine, but not so fine when it tampers with facts or omits so much of the whole story that the result is one-sided. Above all, our own fraternity membership should be thoroughly and correctly informed. We recommend periodic use of the Settlement School Slides Programs in chapters and clubs. These are revised each year to bring information and pictures up to date. Our challenges are immediate and long-range, and both bring successes and sometimes failures. Thus it has ever been for any supervising Settlement School Committee. No one year is the same as the year before, and some planning for future growth and development is always part of every year. Unexpected bequests and out-right gifts of large sums have smoothed the way, over the years, to fulfillment of a need, a dream. They have made possible the large steps forward, and perhaps the fact that we have no reserves of this kind now is a challenge. We have a challenge at Arrowcraft to not fail our weavers in their dependency on us. We have similar charges with regard to our classes at the school, the dorm children, the Health Center, and the expanding Craft Workshop. The newest challenge of all involves possible use of the Centennial Fund for the development and expansion of Arts and Crafts training at the Settlement School. This challenge is one most definitely before the fraternity as a whole. The role of the Settlement School Committee is not yet charted and, frankly, we do not know our responsibility to the fraternity in regard to this. Until committee's part in ensuing fraternity discussions is somehow clarified, we can only "advise and consent" to a 100th year infusion of new life for the 50 year Memorial to the Founders of the Fraternity, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. The roots of this tree were planted deeply and in good soil. Its limbs, branches and foliage are sturdy and healthy. It has had fifty years of nourishment and care. How will it be tended in the next fifty years, and how can the present caretakers serve the members of the fraternity in making this decision? HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 51 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S' REPORT Settlement School has been so very busy celebrating a special birthday yes, a golden anniversary. First recognition was given in February by the local Pi Phi Little Pigeon Alumnx Club. In March our own Alice Mansfield, Olivia Moore, Marianne Wild, Zoe James, and Eta Province president, Pat Akers, came for the Chapel Program in Pi Beta Phi High School. This consisted of a series of seven tableaux depicting phases of the school Early School, Health Center, Arrowcraft Weaver and Designer, Dormitory Students' Introduction, Introduction of Descendants of the first two classes--1912-1913, Arts and Crafts, Music and Workshop. Immediately following the Chapel Program our national officers were guests at a Little Pigeon Alumnm Club luncheon. At Staff House honored dinner guests were members of the first two classes in 1912-1913. Even though a snowstorm caused a few last minute cancellations there was much fun reminiscing. Simultaneously to our celebration construction of a weaving studio was started. What a nice birthday present! This was a dream come true in June when Workshop opened its doors and thirty-six looms were in readiness. This building will be available throughout the year for the teaching of weaving (or other crafts) preferably by classes, sometimes individually. Dedication of the Evelyn Bishop Room the entrance lounge was well attended by old-time local citizens. Our Settlement School Committee was also here for the event. At Convention in the Mayflower Hotel Arrowcraft displayed and sold all-gold purses and bookmarks along with many other crafts. A good response was shown by Pi Phis from everywhere. This is a mutual opportunity for Club personnel, Arrowcraft and Settlement School representatives to become acquainted. The exhibit of early and contemporary Arrowcraft and Workshop weaving at the Smithsonian was a high-light indeed. Admittedly a thrill to me! Having been at the Smithsonian years ago I never dreamed of participating in any way with that institution. The exhibit was in the Rotunda in the Textile Division and not far from the corridor with the presidents' wives in their array Mrs. Calvin Coolidge wearing her Arrow and Mrs. Harry Truman with her Mother's pin. It has been a privilege to participate in such a prolonged birthday celebration, and to see another project anchored at Settlement School. Publicity continues, so many more are becoming aware of our growth. Just before our celebration started there was a very unfortunate event a fire doing damage January 11th to the extent that our boys' dormitory and office building had to be vacated. Fortunately we were able to rebuild and refurnish due to insurance. The response of Pi Phis to the emergency appeal was deeply appreciated. Insurance did not cover the losses of the boys, nor all of Mrs. Adams' who is our boys' chaperon and cook. Perhaps the golden anniversary was timely because it certainly helped us through the horrors of the fire that cold, below-zero January 11th. That is something to forget as much as possible. Our dormitory program had its share of honors students in junior and senior plays, two members of Beta Club, president of Student Council, the outstanding basketball player on boys' and girls' teams (as chosen by the Boosters' Club), and girls' basketball captain. Graduation night Ruby Wright not only received the cup for the best player on the girls' team (chosen by faculty), but the $100-scholarship (for higher education) given by the Beta Club as well as $200 for higher education by Pi Beta Phi. Ruby was a four-year dormitory girl. Two boys were nominees for the Citizenship Award. Melvin Ogle received the award as chosen by the faculty for the sophomore showing the most improvement. MO was given to Randy Trentham for higher educa Lion (tuition and/or fees) by Pi Beta Phi. Proud? Frankly yes. This is one small way of "seeing" improvement and development in our dormitory program. The senior class dedicated its yearbook, The Mountaineer, to Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. Another birthday present! Craft Workshop with the University of Tennessee has grown and this year the eighteenth summer had the largest enrollment ever. Twenty-three states were represented among our personnel. There were also two students from Pakistan. Staff agreed the spirit was very good. Each year I marvel at the beautiful crafts displayed the last night at Open House. Yes, it's really worth the effort to "come see." Two students were on Pi Phi scholarships. At Arrowcraft one realizes the important part our Clubs have in this Memorial to our Pi Beta Phi Founders. Shipping was good last year. The Little Pigeon awards at Convention are a small token of appreciation, and in reality represent the loyalty shown by many Pi Phi groups. We are mighty proud of the thirty Alumna Clubs who paid Arrowcraft more than a thousand dollars. Not to be neglected are the small Clubs. Each article sold is helping a craftsman somewhere. A heritage of talent is aptly displayed by these mountaineers. As groups learn of our Barn/Dorm (Red Barn) avail-able for workshops, religious groups, retreats, or Pi Phi chapters, more come each year. Reservations should be made far in advance for spring vacations. The Health Center has continued with a preventive program under Marjorie Chalmer's watchful eye. Each year we think will be the last for the only one-room school at the Glades in our area. Surely its days are numbered. Marjorie's resignation from Health Center is regrettable yet with twenty-seven years at Settlement School we certainly should and do wish her well in her retirement which will take effect when a replacement is made. Gene Redding, designer at Arrowcraft, is retiring when there is a replacement for her. Gene claims over twenty years at Settlement School. Yes, best wishes to Gene. Nevada Christian's resignation as Arrowcraft manager after a mere one-and-a-half years at Settlement School was untimely (comparatively speaking). Nevada's destination was her former home in California. Best wishes to Nevada and Sutton. Arlie Watson's thirty-six years as maintenance man at Settlement School certainly contributes to our high total of years of service on our staff. Arlie seemed to enjoy his first year in semi-retirement. Retirement folks from any walk of life might well apply his "psychology of living." Zanley Watson has filled in for Arlie admirably always having his tools in readiness to repair anything. Zanley also cooperates with Neal in his chores, ship-ping, at Arrowcraft, and maintenance. Quite a capable pair! Discontinuing the raising of chickens will affect Richard Watson's schedule. However, with each new building maintenance problems increase; so far, there is always plenty to do. Richard's recent encounter with a copperhead ended with first-aid, snake serum, and a stay in the hospital. Mrs. Adams' narrow escape in the January fire has not seemed to affect her noticeably. She continues planning for those boys' and girls' appetites next winter. Gallons and bushels! Gallons of jelly, bushels of beans, corn, etc., are being prepared for their inevitable consummation. Ruth Spelman's many activities as housemother belie her being a Pi Phi over fifty years. In semi-retirement, she practices a healthy philosophy. Elizabeth Rue's semi-retirement has given an opportunity for her to participate in community and social 52 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI activities. She still enjoys sellin' (and she does lots of it) at the Mountain View Hotel Arrowcraft Shop. June Cook, the youngest and last of four sisters who have been employed at Arrowcraft came after her high school graduation in May '61. Faye Cook has been at Arrowcraft four years, Nella nine, jean Hembree three years, Shirley Roberts two years. These girls compose our sales and shipping staff, Nella assisting our de-signer part time. Nadine Grooms Whitted, a descendant of one of our earliest weavers, Mary L. Owenby, has served as secretary to the director for two years quite capably. As director and part time manager of Arrowcraft Shop my year has been a full one. It is a constant struggle to be in readiness for the next project. Serving as chairman of the October Southern Highland Guild Craftsmen's Fair in Gatlinburg again in '62 leaves few idle moments. The Southern Highland Handicrafts Guild is a large organization formed in 1928 to help craftsmen find an outlet for their crafts and to raise the standards of the work. Pi Phi works with the Guild, mutually and advantageously in the craft field. I am looking forward to serving as a member of the Board of Trustees, having been elected for a three-year term. A big "thank you" is extended to all donors to Settlement School. The Christmas list is an impressive one. Pi Phis again met a challenge with the Fire Emergency Fund. A constant stream of merchandise stamps also provides blankets and even some lamps for dormitory rooms. You have not forgotten us. Thank you again. The area and town surprisingly are still developing. A County Hospital and consolidation of our high school are imminent. Financing and details are still in the embryo stage. Pi Phi provided an Arts and Crafts teacher again a Pi Phi, Margaret Struble, from Ames, Iowa. The wood-craft instruction probably will be expanded from two to three classes. A music teacher is not assigned as yet. If one is obtained music will be taught again this year. If and when the high school moves, all available guidance, I am sure, will be used in directing our paths. It is my wish that every Pi Phi could visit Settlement School at some time. An invitation is extended to each of you to come for a tour of Settlement School. In June 1961 delegates from every Chapter came for our so-called Little Convention. That made Settlement School a reality to a nucleus of our actives and alumni. Mutually the delegates were a reality to us folks at Settlement School. "The years of man are the looms of God, Let down from the place of the sun, Wherein we all are weaving, 'til the Mystic web is done." Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER Little Rock, Arkansas August 1, 1962 Mrs. Richard E. James Treasurer Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Gatlinburg, Tennessee DEAR MRS. JAMES: We have audited the books and records of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the year ended May 31, 1962.

Pi Beta Phi has been growing too. At age 95 we are 108 chapters tall. As we put a period to the activities for 1961-62 we added five marks to our growth record for the five new chapters added to our roll since the last Convention, three of them during the current year. They are Oregon Delta, Mississippi Alpha and Beta, Tennessee Delta and Kentucky Beta. Each will add strength to the fraternity in their accomplishments on their own campuses, and will increase our membership representation throughout the United States and Canada. We claim each of them with pride. With our new chapters in Mississippi only three states remains in the continental United States without representation. They are New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New Jersey. Increased enrollments make it desirable for Administrations to invite additional fraternities to establish chapters on their campuses, and new campuses are continually being opened to national fraternities. Some in this latter category offer promise for the future. However, at the present time no commitments have been made for new chapters for the coming year. This does not mean any reduction in the number of inquiries which have come to Pi Beta Phi about its interest in extension. To be exact there have been letters from thirty-four different campuses, and in some in-stances more than one inquiry from a given campus. Of this number, twenty are from campuses which have not previously been in contact with us. In the case of some inquiries which have come late in the year they have been asked to supply more information in order that the Grand Council could fairly evaluate the opportunity for extension. Many things are taken into consideration in such evaluations, not the least of which is opinion of officers, chapters and alumna' clubs in the province. With the growth in educational facilities, and changing populations, the colleges themselves change. Pi Beta Phi must consider these changes so that decisions are made in thebest interest of the fraternity. Other fraternities are placing new chapters each year. There have been 59 new women's chapters this year, 81 last year for a total of 140. since our last convention. We make no attempt to "keep up with the Joneses" but we must keep in mind the fact that each new chapter helps the older chapters by its coverage in membership in communities in which they also have an interest. Those thirty-four campuses interested in affiliation with Pi Beta Phi are as follows: Ferris Institute, Big Rapids, Michigan; University of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri; University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island; Lenoir Rhyne College, Hickory, North Carolina; Moorhead State College, Moorhead, Minnesota; Bryant College, Johnston, Rhode Island; Norfolk College of William and Mary, Norfolk, Virginia; Florence Branch, University of South Carolina, Florence, South Carolina; Alma College, Alma, Michigan; Eastern New Mexico University, Portales, New Mexico; Los Angeles State College, Los Angeles, California; Wittenberg University, Spring-field, Ohio; Stephen F. Austin St. College, Nacogdoches, Texas; Arizona State College, Flagstaff, Arizona; University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Transylvania College, Lexington, Kentucky; Southeast-ern Louisiana College, Hammond, Louisiana; Pennsylvania State College, East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania; College of Steubenville, Steubenville, Ohio; C. W. Post College of L.I. University, Brookville, New York; Alfred University, Alfred, New York and Rochester, New York; Illinois Wesleyan, Bloomington, Illinois; New Bedford Tech., Fairhaven, Massachusetts; San Fernando Valley State College, Northridge, California; Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Mankato State College, Mankato, Minnesota; University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida; Georgia State College, Atlanta, Georgia; Little Rock University, Little Rock, Arkansas; Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois. MARIANNE REID WILD NPC Delegate and Chairman of Extension HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE In 1960-61 only eight chapters and twenty-seven clubs failed to contribute to Holt House. We've never had 100%, but we're hoping this may be the year ! At this writing it's too soon to know, but Jo Boydstun, our treasurer reports that contributions are ahead of last year, and May is always the biggest month, so we're keeping cur fingers crossed. We don't have as impressive a list of accomplishments this year as we did last, but sometimes after a big "splurge" you have to "coast" a bit. We had hoped to have a long range plan of redecorating and restoration set up and begun, but due to personal and family illness of our key member in this, Eleanor Miller, interior decorator with L. S. Ayres in Indianapolis, we were not able to get underway. We had set 1967, our centennial year as the year to have Holt House completely refurbished, so there is still time. Just keep those contributions coming. In August the house received two coats of white paint. Fresh paint does so much in the way of "face lifting." The powder room has a new vinyl floor and sparkling new curtains. The kitchen is proving its worth in added space and efficiency. A new formica topped table with matching chairs is a big improvement overthe old white porcelain table and worn chairs that had given us yeoman's service for so long. We hope to add to our supply of dishes, but had had difficulty in obtaining the present "Rose Point" pattern. If we can't get it, it will be necessary to start with another pattern. We are pleased that Holt House continues to be such an integral part of the "goings on" in Monmouth. It was used for 132 functions from May 1961 through April 1962, of which only twenty-five were Pi Phi. Several clubs use it for all their meetings and most months show a goodly number of showers, teas, and receptions. We have purposely kept the fees low, as we feel Holt House rep-resents the fraternity, and by making it available to the community for a small fee, we are spreading good will for Pi Phi. Through its warmth and charm one gets the feel of being in a lovely old home which is truly the case. Shirley Mann reports the slides were viewed by 37 groups. This is more than a 100% increase over last year. We are very pleased with the added interest, as we feel the best means of getting acquainted with Holt House is through the slides. A Holt House program is most interesting and informative, so why not schedule one for 55

        48 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI tensive, as the writer can testify! Instructors give personal attention to each student and all are "master teachers" in somehow drawing out the best in each pupil. Final exhibits, open to the public, give amazing evidence of the high standards of skill and artistry which are the backbone of the Workshop's fine reputation at home and abroad. More Pi Phis should come and see, or better still, come and attend! The new Leaving Studio is a joy to work in, committee was told, and a pleasure to look at both inside and out, as we saw! It is good that our looms now have a permanent home. Further, we now have a place where additional workshops may be held throughout the year. This is a step forward, as we think ahead to the future. When the pottery wing is added to this building to complete the original plan, firm foundations will have been laid for year-around training in two art and craft fields. The Virginia Alpha Scholarship to the Craft Work-shop this year was won by Nancy Van Schreeven of Virginia Gamma. The Albuquerque Alum= Club scholarship was won by Bette Casteel who came from Alameda. Graduate Assistants were jean Carroll of South Carolina Alpha and Margaret Struble of Iowa Gamma. Pi Phis attending as students were Connie Cox, Tennessee Gamma, Miriam Herron, Illinois Eta, and Lucy Glazner Matkin, Oklahoma Beta. Gale Ann McDonald came all the way from Michigan Delta to assist Mrs. Mueller during the weeks of Workshop. There really ought to be more Pi Phis at our Craft Workshops. Would more local scholarships within the provinces help? The Craft Workshop is an exciting, going concern now; its pioneering days are over! Its outreach extends from ocean to ocean, and from gulf to across the Canadian border. And it has drawn 27 foreign students from a dozen different countries ! The teenager and senior citizen work side by side, for age is no barrier in creativity. It teaches those who teach others children, youth or adults, the physically able and the handicapped, the normal and the subor above normal. Those who come to learn take back to their local communities their new skills and appreciations for application at home. Would that more Pi Phis knew and understood this particular asset of the Settlement School! Now, Arrowcraft is an asset (and a trademark) long familiar to Pi Phis, especially in those loyal clubs and chapters where annual or biennial Arrowcraft sales are a tradition. This, too, serves an arts and crafts area, our own special one handweaving, and we realize anew its quality and worth due to the Smithsonian Exhibition. It is disappointing that weaving sales to clubs and chapters dropped a bit, but other craft sales climbed so that the year ended with an overall increased total. Especially encouraging and noteworthy is the new and splendid record attained when 36 clubs paid over $1000 to Arrow-craft last year. Those clubs, of which the first five received Soaring Pigeon Awards at convention, are: Champaign-Urbana $4,288.24 Philadelphia $1,276.82 Oklahoma City 3,190.66 Milwaukee 1,256.09 Houston 2,294.58 Toledo 1,217.42 Arlington Heights 2,140.62 Fayetteville 1,215.34 Akron 2,055.65 Ann Arbor 1,197.06 Pittsburgh 2,040.68 Western Kansas 1,109.19 Lincoln 1,968.72 Chicago W. Suburban 1,159.79 Pasadana 1,902.98 Madison 1,129.17 Indianapolis ....... 1,843.67 Charleston 1,127.96 Schenectady ........ 1,797.32 Phoenix 1,112.44 Denver ........ 1,774.79 North Shore 1,103.62 South Bend ........ 1,697.92 Everett 1,102.76 Northern New Jersey 1,608.77 Dallas 1,091.24 Columbus, Ohio 1,437.66 Cleveland East 1,068.58 Miami 1,433.11 Galesburg 1,052.27 Kansas 'City, Mo. 1,348.84 Des Moines 1,035.76 Columbia, Mo 1,348.58 Baltimore 1,018.41 Cleveland West 1,303.98 Southern New Jersey 1,011.35 The club chairmen and other Arrowcraft devotees who made this list possible, are most warmly commended and thanked. Many smaller clubs had excellent sales for their size, with Arrowcraft remittances just under the figure for honorable mention. Arrowcraft had two efficiency boosts this year. One was the addition to the shop of a shipping room which has greatly alleviated former cramped quarters. The second need was for a new truck to replace the old one that was beginning to cost in maintenance and repairs. This is the only truck the school has and it gets much hard use on the grounds and as it carries express Arrowcraft shipments to Sevierville during busy club shipping seasons. Marion Mueller has continued to serve as Arrowcraft Manager since November, 1961 when Nevada Christian resigned. This has added greatly to her responsibilities, and it is hoped that a new manager can be found soon. A second replacement at the shop will be necessary next January when the resignation of Gene Redding, Weaving Designer, takes effect. Gene has capably served Arrow-craft, during four different employment periods, since 1925 when she first came to the school as a weaving teacher. She will be greatly missed. However, she is building a retirement home in the area so contact with her will not be lost. Most of the designs in the Smithsonian Exhibit were Gene's, a splendid tribute to her years of work with the school and to her personally during her last year. Eunice Cole will continue to serve as bookkeeper, as will Nella Hill, Faye Cook, Gene Hembree, Shirley Roberts, and June Cook, all of whom are very able, loyal employees. Orlie, Neal and Zanley Watson, who share the heavy work at the shop, fit that description too; they con-tribute cheerfulness to the shop scene as well as strong muscles! While we are on the subject of Watson men at the Settlement School, we greatly appreciate the fine day-by-day maintenance service given by all four of them, including Richard who does some grounds work, tends the chickens (soon to be stopped), and works the gardens. Neal is Orlie's son; Zanley is Orlie's nephew; Richard is no known kin, though if one went back far enough, he just might be found to be kin "close to far off !" Orlie attained 35 years of Settlement School service last summer. He was honored at a Staff House dinner on September 1, 1961 at which time he started part-time work, with Zanley coming in for full time employment. Much of Orlie's time last spring was spent in construction supervision of the new Weaving Studio. We are very grateful to all the Watson men for their excellent care of the Pi Phi Settlement School property; it is their work, supervised by the Director, which makes visiting Pi Phis so proud of the appearance of the grounds and buildings. The school situation, in regard to proposed plans for consolidating Pi Beta Phi High School with Pitman Center, awaits a financing vote from the Sevier County Court. (County-wide raises for teachers await a similar action.) For the 1962-63 school year, present arrangements are concluded for the fraternity to provide the Arts and Crafts teacher who will be Miss Betty Burchfiel of Sevierville. We regret the resignation of Margaret Struble, Iowa Gamma, the able instructor of last year. Increased popularity of Mr. Carl Huskey's classes in Woodworking among high school boys will raise his daily classes to three. If it is possible to secure a Music teacher before school opens, those classes will again be provided. Mrs. Leona Enloe, after several years on our staff, has retired from teaching. The Art and Woodworking classes are taught in the Emma Harper Turner Arts and Crafts Center. Other than the old Log Cabin, this building is the oldest on our property. It is worth preserving because part of that building was our first school ! However, when those rooms are viewed in the light of modern classrooms, they leave much to be desired in surroundings and in equipment. It is hoped that additional, special contributions for this purpose will make renovation possible in the near future. It is important to train the young of this area in appreciations in the Arts and Crafts field; this can and should be done well. The Jennie Nicol Health Center, with Nurse Marjorie Chalmers again in charge, had another excellent, service-able year. Marjorie came to the Settlement School in December of 1935, was honored for 25 years continuous THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 49 service at the "Little Convention" banquet in June of 1961, and she has decided that the time has come for her to retire (in the area also, which does have a tremendous charm) as soon as a replacement can be secured. Marjorie's personalized program in Maternal and Infant Welfare has paid great dividends to the entire community; her work in this area alone has spanned three generations. She has been a friend indeed to the children of the Pi Beta Phi School, to those at nearby rural schools (de-creased to one at present), to the summer Craft Work-shop students, to the general community and to anyone in need who comes to her door. Naturally her work today is more preventative, therapeutic, corrective and advisory than it was in those earlier days, but she has been no less busy this past year, as this record of service indicates: Field visits 544 Office calls 3856 Service given 3223 Smallpox vaccinations 276 Typhoid inoculations 341 Triple vaccine 225 Salk vaccine 330 Tetanus toxoid 36 Therapeutic inoculations 177 Tuberculin tests 37 Chest X-rays ... . 1047 Physical exams and inspections 3170 Audiometer tests 163 Teacher-nurse conferences 197 Family conferences 294 Health talks 74 Newspaper articles 18 Sigma Phi Gamma contributions to the Health Center this year totaled $225. These donations are grate-fully received each year and used for children in medically indigent families needing correction of orthopedic weaknesses, speech and hearing defects, dental troubles, and the purchase or replacement of glasses. Adjustments to a new nurse will not be easy for Marjorie has been the Health Center for so long, but we are counting on both Marjorie and the new person to make the change as smooth as possible. Our sincere thanks are again extended to Marjorie for her many years of splendid service. The Dormitory Program, in spite of the January to May housing interruption, had a very rewarding year in retrospect, with several students attaining leadership positions and various school awards. Senior Ruby Wright received the North Shore Alumnx Club scholarship for further education, while Randy Trentham, another dorm student, and Charles Moore, Jr., received Alspaugh Fund scholarships. Ruth Spelman completed her fourth excel-lent year as Stuart housemother for the girls, while Marion Mueller capably shared supervision of the boys with Lela Adams. The January 11th fire at the Boys' Dorm (also called Teachers Cottage and Helmick House) could have been tragic, but fortunately and thankfully, it was not! Fast warning by Mrs. Adams and prompt reactions by Mr. Carnes, a teacher in residence, and the boys, resulted in prompt evacuation of the building. Members of the Gatlinburg Volunteer Fire Department responded quickly to the siren that cold, cold night and were able to confine blaze damage to the first floor, though contents of the second floor were a major loss as well, due to smoke and water damage. Two facts were prominent in regard to rebuilding: one, that the timber in this building was originally so 'sturdy and sound, and two, that committee had converted to a replacement-cost type of insurance just the summer before. The appeal to the fraternity for emergency donations brought a most welcome response of $918.41, all of which was used to restitute personal losses and (with additional funds from the General Account) to make several needed improvements. To make a long, tedious adjustment and rebuilding story short, Teachers Cottage was rebuilt, refurnished, and ready for occupancy by summer Craft Workshop students on June 11th! Much credit goes to Marion Mueller and the maintenance men for the local planning and hard work necessary to meet that deadline. Teachers Cottage is clean and freshnow, and actually more attractive than ever belying its age of 46 years ! Annual contributions from both clubs and chapters were higher than the prior year, with those from chapters increasing over 25 percent! What a nice way to recognize the anniversary year ! 100% provinces in contributions for the concluding fiscal year were: Clubs Charters Gamma Alpha Kappa Epsilon Beta Mu Zeta Gamma Nu Eta Delta Omicron Iota Epsilon Pi Lambda Zeta Mu Eta Pi North Theta Pi South Iota Officers for the above provinces received Little Pigeon Awards at Convention to wear for their provinces. It is hoped that some year it will be possible to thus recognize every club and every chapter in the fraternity. It has not happened yet! Soaring Pigeon Awards for highest percent increases in contributions were awarded to Salinas, California (1700%) and to Nevada Alpha (1400%). Similar awards for highest dollar increases went to St. Louis, Missouri ($400) and to Nevada Alpha ($140). These evidences of renewed confidence and support are appreciated. For many years it has been a custom in annual Settlement School reports to give honorable mention to clubs contributing $150 or more, and to chapters giving $100 or more. This year, after considerable research, we would like to include the number of years since 1949 that a listed club has continuously been given such honorable mention. Total club contributions, including fire donations, received by the Settlement School Treasurer were $11,539.53. Of this amount, a slight increase, the following 17 clubs contributed over 48 percent of total alumnx club support this past year: (continuous honorable mention years are in parentheses) St. Louis (13) Kansas City (13) Pasadena (5) North Shore (5) Miami (2) Indianapolis (13) Cleveland East North Shore Jr. (4) Columbus Houston .. . Philadelphia (4) Westchester Co. (3) Arlington Heights (3) Champaign-Urbana (2) Everett (6) Northern N. Jersey (2) Sacramento (3) Total $5,579.50 We take this opportunity to say a heart-felt thank you to all clubs that give substantial support to our national philanthropy year in and year out. Many other clubs not named this year have given similar support though not continuously. Still others give to the limit of their annual in-come and we are grateful to them. It is distressing to those of us who must fight the annual "battle of the budget" that some do not carry their fair share; because some don't, others must, and we are eternally grateful for that kind of loyalty. Chapter contributions increased an amazing 25% this year! The total was a fine new high of $3,406.76. The increase of $717.67 is most welcome, as is the convention vote to permit half of the annual chapter contributions to be used for operating expenses. Chapters giving $100 and over, together with continuous years each has given this kind of support since 1949, are: Texas Alpha $ 300.00 South Dakota Alpha (2) 165.00 Nevada Alpha 150.00 $1,200.00 1,000.00 380.00 350.00 300.00 270.00 264.50 250.00 200.00 200.00 200.00 200.00 165.00 150.00 150.00 150.00 150.00 50 Texas Gamma (7) ................................ 150.00 Alabama Beta (3) . . . ............................ 100.00 Missouri Beta (12) 100.00 Nebraska Beta 100.00 Total S1,065.00 The drop in Magazine Agency Commissions, a major source of annual income, was very disheartening both at Central Office and at Settlement School, especially since the trend had been consistently upward in the prior several years. A loss of expected income in the amount of $2,150 is serious for the Settlement School, and it is most earnestly hoped that magazine sales in the current year will provide commissions which more than make up for the discouraging drop this year. Many individuals, clubs, Mothers' clubs, and chapters donated cash for special purposes and goods of various kinds to the school. These include Christmas and other holiday remembrances, clothing and various household articles, Fire Relief donations already mentioned, and special goods to the Health Center. Memorial Fund gifts came to exactly $100 this year. Many thanks are extended to each donor. Many "free purchases" were permitted through gifts of SH and TV stamps. These are always wanted and appreciated. Please continue to send them to the Director. The dollar has shrunk as much in Gatlinburg as any-where else in the country, and it is sometimes wondered if new budgets using last year's contribution figures are automatic year after year. Please let no one misunderstand. Every dollar sent is gratefully received and put to good use, but we do need more of them! In an endeavor to increase contributions, the Settlement School Commit-tee at its last meeting adopted a new contribution credit plan which will make more bookkeeping for the Treasurer but which we believe will have appeal for many individual Pi Phis. Henceforth, individual Pi Phis may make personal contributions to the Settlement School (many do!), assigning contribution credit to a favorite club or chap-ter, providing this is done at the time a check is sent. It is hoped that such two-way benefit will appeal to many members of the fraternity as they plan their personal contribution programs for the year. Many of us give automatically each year to the United Fund, the Red Cross, and many other personal favorite philanthropies. Why not consider a similar tax-deductible contribution to the Settlement School each year too? With a second benefit added (contribution credit for an alumnae club or an active chapter), we hope for increased interest in personal Pi Phi donations. Such checks should be made out to "Pi Beta Phi Settlement School" and they may be sent direct to the Settlement School Treasurer or through a club or chapter Treasurer. Contribution credit will be given only if a designation note is received with a check. The concluding Settlement School year was a very busy one for the resident staff and for the Settlement School Committee. The gratitude of the fraternity is due Director Marion Mueller for her capable handling of so many musts, all of which seemed to run concurrently for most of the year! Committee members have given marvelous cooperation to the chairman all through the year too, and all appreciate the good help and advice given so generously by our Grand Council contact member Olivia Smith Moore. We regret the conclusion of close working relationships with our excellent retiring treasurer, Zoe Saunders James; at the same time we welcome Sally Bozman Schneiter of Muncie, Indiana who has already indicated a knowledgeable and able handling of our financial concerns. We were both sad and happy for Helen Boucher Dix to be so suddenly "snatched" from our committee and so wholeheartedly "seated" in Grand Council as Grand Vice President; our best wishes go with her. We are very happy to have Sally Wild Gordon, former Pi Province President, join us in the capacity of publicity work for the committee. Lois Overstreet Summers and Eloise Glazner Hensley add desirable, capable con THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI tinuity even though they have switched jobs Lois to Secretary and Eloise to Slides Programs! It is again comforting to the chairman to have loyal, analytic Pi Phis sharing in the deliberations of this fraternity committee. Needs and Challenges The need for more dollars to balance their shrinking value has already been stated. Salaries must be paid, equipment replaced, the monthly bills met, leaks re-paired and danger spots eliminated. We must keep our several educational endeavors going for we are that kind of institution, and teachers and even minimum supplies and tools of work do cost. This dorm boy needs to earn extra money to make the senior trip with his class, and that girl needs to get her teeth fixed. At Arrowcraft, threads must be bought, and the weavers paid when they bring in their weaving. The Settlement School is a big place. Five dollars help, of course, but they don't go far. Contributions without strings are preferred, for then they may be used where the need is greatest. When a donation is over and above the needed annual income, the Director or Chairman is always happy to advise on a designated use. We see a need for more thoughtful understanding and education concerning our Settlement School. Too many Pi Phis are misinformed; too many expect the settlement, the people and the area to be the same as 25 years ago. This is one reason why committee has been so eager for a new Settlement School booklet to be placed in the hands of initiates. The pioneering days are over; they should be in fifty years! The early days were colorful and fascinating, but it is wrong to depict those days as if they existed today. A good educational program will balance the historical and the contemporary, and both kinds of presentations should be correct. Creativity in programs is fine, but not so fine when it tampers with facts or omits so much of the whole story that the result is one-sided. Above all, our own fraternity membership should be thoroughly and correctly informed. We recommend periodic use of the Settlement School Slides Programs in chapters and clubs. These are revised each year to bring information and pictures up to date. Our challenges are immediate and long-range, and both bring successes and sometimes failures. Thus it has ever been for any supervising Settlement School Committee. No one year is the same as the year before, and some planning for future growth and development is always part of every year. Unexpected bequests and out-right gifts of large sums have smoothed the way, over the years, to fulfillment of a need, a dream. They have made possible the large steps forward, and perhaps the fact that we have no reserves of this kind now is a challenge. We have a challenge at Arrowcraft to not fail our weavers in their dependency on us. We have similar charges with regard to our classes at the school, the dorm children, the Health Center, and the expanding Craft Workshop. The newest challenge of all involves possible use of the Centennial Fund for the development and expansion of Arts and Crafts training at the Settlement School. This challenge is one most definitely before the fraternity as a whole. The role of the Settlement School Committee is not yet charted and, frankly, we do not know our responsibility to the fraternity in regard to this. Until committee's part in ensuing fraternity discussions is somehow clarified, we can only "advise and consent" to a 100th year infusion of new life for the 50 year Memorial to the Founders of the Fraternity, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. The roots of this tree were planted deeply and in good soil. Its limbs, branches and foliage are sturdy and healthy. It has had fifty years of nourishment and care. How will it be tended in the next fifty years, and how can the present caretakers serve the members of the fraternity in making this decision? HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 51 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S' REPORT Settlement School has been so very busy celebrating a special birthday yes, a golden anniversary. First recognition was given in February by the local Pi Phi Little Pigeon Alumnx Club. In March our own Alice Mansfield, Olivia Moore, Marianne Wild, Zoe James, and Eta Province president, Pat Akers, came for the Chapel Program in Pi Beta Phi High School. This consisted of a series of seven tableaux depicting phases of the school Early School, Health Center, Arrowcraft Weaver and Designer, Dormitory Students' Introduction, Introduction of Descendants of the first two classes--1912-1913, Arts and Crafts, Music and Workshop. Immediately following the Chapel Program our national officers were guests at a Little Pigeon Alumnm Club luncheon. At Staff House honored dinner guests were members of the first two classes in 1912-1913. Even though a snowstorm caused a few last minute cancellations there was much fun reminiscing. Simultaneously to our celebration construction of a weaving studio was started. What a nice birthday present! This was a dream come true in June when Workshop opened its doors and thirty-six looms were in readiness. This building will be available throughout the year for the teaching of weaving (or other crafts) preferably by classes, sometimes individually. Dedication of the Evelyn Bishop Room the entrance lounge was well attended by old-time local citizens. Our Settlement School Committee was also here for the event. At Convention in the Mayflower Hotel Arrowcraft displayed and sold all-gold purses and bookmarks along with many other crafts. A good response was shown by Pi Phis from everywhere. This is a mutual opportunity for Club personnel, Arrowcraft and Settlement School representatives to become acquainted. The exhibit of early and contemporary Arrowcraft and Workshop weaving at the Smithsonian was a high-light indeed. Admittedly a thrill to me! Having been at the Smithsonian years ago I never dreamed of participating in any way with that institution. The exhibit was in the Rotunda in the Textile Division and not far from the corridor with the presidents' wives in their array Mrs. Calvin Coolidge wearing her Arrow and Mrs. Harry Truman with her Mother's pin. It has been a privilege to participate in such a prolonged birthday celebration, and to see another project anchored at Settlement School. Publicity continues, so many more are becoming aware of our growth. Just before our celebration started there was a very unfortunate event a fire doing damage January 11th to the extent that our boys' dormitory and office building had to be vacated. Fortunately we were able to rebuild and refurnish due to insurance. The response of Pi Phis to the emergency appeal was deeply appreciated. Insurance did not cover the losses of the boys, nor all of Mrs. Adams' who is our boys' chaperon and cook. Perhaps the golden anniversary was timely because it certainly helped us through the horrors of the fire that cold, below-zero January 11th. That is something to forget as much as possible. Our dormitory program had its share of honors students in junior and senior plays, two members of Beta Club, president of Student Council, the outstanding basketball player on boys' and girls' teams (as chosen by the Boosters' Club), and girls' basketball captain. Graduation night Ruby Wright not only received the cup for the best player on the girls' team (chosen by faculty), but the $100-scholarship (for higher education) given by the Beta Club as well as $200 for higher education by Pi Beta Phi. Ruby was a four-year dormitory girl. Two boys were nominees for the Citizenship Award. Melvin Ogle received the award as chosen by the faculty for the sophomore showing the most improvement. MO was given to Randy Trentham for higher educa Lion (tuition and/or fees) by Pi Beta Phi. Proud? Frankly yes. This is one small way of "seeing" improvement and development in our dormitory program. The senior class dedicated its yearbook, The Mountaineer, to Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. Another birthday present! Craft Workshop with the University of Tennessee has grown and this year the eighteenth summer had the largest enrollment ever. Twenty-three states were represented among our personnel. There were also two students from Pakistan. Staff agreed the spirit was very good. Each year I marvel at the beautiful crafts displayed the last night at Open House. Yes, it's really worth the effort to "come see." Two students were on Pi Phi scholarships. At Arrowcraft one realizes the important part our Clubs have in this Memorial to our Pi Beta Phi Founders. Shipping was good last year. The Little Pigeon awards at Convention are a small token of appreciation, and in reality represent the loyalty shown by many Pi Phi groups. We are mighty proud of the thirty Alumna Clubs who paid Arrowcraft more than a thousand dollars. Not to be neglected are the small Clubs. Each article sold is helping a craftsman somewhere. A heritage of talent is aptly displayed by these mountaineers. As groups learn of our Barn/Dorm (Red Barn) avail-able for workshops, religious groups, retreats, or Pi Phi chapters, more come each year. Reservations should be made far in advance for spring vacations. The Health Center has continued with a preventive program under Marjorie Chalmer's watchful eye. Each year we think will be the last for the only one-room school at the Glades in our area. Surely its days are numbered. Marjorie's resignation from Health Center is regrettable yet with twenty-seven years at Settlement School we certainly should and do wish her well in her retirement which will take effect when a replacement is made. Gene Redding, designer at Arrowcraft, is retiring when there is a replacement for her. Gene claims over twenty years at Settlement School. Yes, best wishes to Gene. Nevada Christian's resignation as Arrowcraft manager after a mere one-and-a-half years at Settlement School was untimely (comparatively speaking). Nevada's destination was her former home in California. Best wishes to Nevada and Sutton. Arlie Watson's thirty-six years as maintenance man at Settlement School certainly contributes to our high total of years of service on our staff. Arlie seemed to enjoy his first year in semi-retirement. Retirement folks from any walk of life might well apply his "psychology of living." Zanley Watson has filled in for Arlie admirably always having his tools in readiness to repair anything. Zanley also cooperates with Neal in his chores, ship-ping, at Arrowcraft, and maintenance. Quite a capable pair! Discontinuing the raising of chickens will affect Richard Watson's schedule. However, with each new building maintenance problems increase; so far, there is always plenty to do. Richard's recent encounter with a copperhead ended with first-aid, snake serum, and a stay in the hospital. Mrs. Adams' narrow escape in the January fire has not seemed to affect her noticeably. She continues planning for those boys' and girls' appetites next winter. Gallons and bushels! Gallons of jelly, bushels of beans, corn, etc., are being prepared for their inevitable consummation. Ruth Spelman's many activities as housemother belie her being a Pi Phi over fifty years. In semi-retirement, she practices a healthy philosophy. Elizabeth Rue's semi-retirement has given an opportunity for her to participate in community and social 52 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI activities. She still enjoys sellin' (and she does lots of it) at the Mountain View Hotel Arrowcraft Shop. June Cook, the youngest and last of four sisters who have been employed at Arrowcraft came after her high school graduation in May '61. Faye Cook has been at Arrowcraft four years, Nella nine, jean Hembree three years, Shirley Roberts two years. These girls compose our sales and shipping staff, Nella assisting our de-signer part time. Nadine Grooms Whitted, a descendant of one of our earliest weavers, Mary L. Owenby, has served as secretary to the director for two years quite capably. As director and part time manager of Arrowcraft Shop my year has been a full one. It is a constant struggle to be in readiness for the next project. Serving as chairman of the October Southern Highland Guild Craftsmen's Fair in Gatlinburg again in '62 leaves few idle moments. The Southern Highland Handicrafts Guild is a large organization formed in 1928 to help craftsmen find an outlet for their crafts and to raise the standards of the work. Pi Phi works with the Guild, mutually and advantageously in the craft field. I am looking forward to serving as a member of the Board of Trustees, having been elected for a three-year term. A big "thank you" is extended to all donors to Settlement School. The Christmas list is an impressive one. Pi Phis again met a challenge with the Fire Emergency Fund. A constant stream of merchandise stamps also provides blankets and even some lamps for dormitory rooms. You have not forgotten us. Thank you again. The area and town surprisingly are still developing. A County Hospital and consolidation of our high school are imminent. Financing and details are still in the embryo stage. Pi Phi provided an Arts and Crafts teacher again a Pi Phi, Margaret Struble, from Ames, Iowa. The wood-craft instruction probably will be expanded from two to three classes. A music teacher is not assigned as yet. If one is obtained music will be taught again this year. If and when the high school moves, all available guidance, I am sure, will be used in directing our paths. It is my wish that every Pi Phi could visit Settlement School at some time. An invitation is extended to each of you to come for a tour of Settlement School. In June 1961 delegates from every Chapter came for our so-called Little Convention. That made Settlement School a reality to a nucleus of our actives and alumni. Mutually the delegates were a reality to us folks at Settlement School. "The years of man are the looms of God, Let down from the place of the sun, Wherein we all are weaving, 'til the Mystic web is done." Respectfully submitted, MARION W.

Pi Beta Phi has been growing too. At age 95 we are 108 chapters tall. As we put a period to the activities for 1961-62 we added five marks to our growth record for the five new chapters added to our roll since the last Convention, three of them during the current year. They are Oregon Delta, Mississippi Alpha and Beta, Tennessee Delta and Kentucky Beta. Each will add strength to the fraternity in their accomplishments on their own campuses, and will increase our membership representation throughout the United States and Canada. We claim each of them with pride. With our new chapters in Mississippi only three states remains in the continental United States without representation. They are New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New Jersey. Increased enrollments make it desirable for Administrations to invite additional fraternities to establish chapters on their campuses, and new campuses are continually being opened to national fraternities. Some in this latter category offer promise for the future. However, at the present time no commitments have been made for new chapters for the coming year. This does not mean any reduction in the number of inquiries which have come to Pi Beta Phi about its interest in extension. To be exact there have been letters from thirty-four different campuses, and in some in-stances more than one inquiry from a given campus. Of this number, twenty are from campuses which have not previously been in contact with us. In the case of some inquiries which have come late in the year they have been asked to supply more information in order that the Grand Council could fairly evaluate the opportunity for extension. Many things are taken into consideration in such evaluations, not the least of which is opinion of officers, chapters and alumna' clubs in the province. With the growth in educational facilities, and changing populations, the colleges themselves change. Pi Beta Phi must consider these changes so that decisions are made in thebest interest of the fraternity. Other fraternities are placing new chapters each year. There have been 59 new women's chapters this year, 81 last year for a total of 140. since our last convention. We make no attempt to "keep up with the Joneses" but we must keep in mind the fact that each new chapter helps the older chapters by its coverage in membership in communities in which they also have an interest. Those thirty-four campuses interested in affiliation with Pi Beta Phi are as follows: Ferris Institute, Big Rapids, Michigan; University of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri; University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island; Lenoir Rhyne College, Hickory, North Carolina; Moorhead State College, Moorhead, Minnesota; Bryant College, Johnston, Rhode Island; Norfolk College of William and Mary, Norfolk, Virginia; Florence Branch, University of South Carolina, Florence, South Carolina; Alma College, Alma, Michigan; Eastern New Mexico University, Portales, New Mexico; Los Angeles State College, Los Angeles, California; Wittenberg University, Spring-field, Ohio; Stephen F. Austin St. College, Nacogdoches, Texas; Arizona State College, Flagstaff, Arizona; University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Transylvania College, Lexington, Kentucky; Southeast-ern Louisiana College, Hammond, Louisiana; Pennsylvania State College, East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania; College of Steubenville, Steubenville, Ohio; C. W. Post College of L.I. University, Brookville, New York; Alfred University, Alfred, New York and Rochester, New York; Illinois Wesleyan, Bloomington, Illinois; New Bedford Tech., Fairhaven, Massachusetts; San Fernando Valley State College, Northridge, California; Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Mankato State College, Mankato, Minnesota; University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida; Georgia State College, Atlanta, Georgia; Little Rock University, Little Rock, Arkansas; Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois. MARIANNE REID WILD NPC Delegate and Chairman of Extension HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE In 1960-61 only eight chapters and twenty-seven clubs failed to contribute to Holt House. We've never had 100%, but we're hoping this may be the year ! At this writing it's too soon to know, but Jo Boydstun, our treasurer reports that contributions are ahead of last year, and May is always the biggest month, so we're keeping cur fingers crossed. We don't have as impressive a list of accomplishments this year as we did last, but sometimes after a big "splurge" you have to "coast" a bit. We had hoped to have a long range plan of redecorating and restoration set up and begun, but due to personal and family illness of our key member in this, Eleanor Miller, interior decorator with L. S. Ayres in Indianapolis, we were not able to get underway. We had set 1967, our centennial year as the year to have Holt House completely refurbished, so there is still time. Just keep those contributions coming. In August the house received two coats of white paint. Fresh paint does so much in the way of "face lifting." The powder room has a new vinyl floor and sparkling new curtains. The kitchen is proving its worth in added space and efficiency. A new formica topped table with matching chairs is a big improvement overthe old white porcelain table and worn chairs that had given us yeoman's service for so long. We hope to add to our supply of dishes, but had had difficulty in obtaining the present "Rose Point" pattern. If we can't get it, it will be necessary to start with another pattern. We are pleased that Holt House continues to be such an integral part of the "goings on" in Monmouth. It was used for 132 functions from May 1961 through April 1962, of which only twenty-five were Pi Phi. Several clubs use it for all their meetings and most months show a goodly number of showers, teas, and receptions. We have purposely kept the fees low, as we feel Holt House rep-resents the fraternity, and by making it available to the community for a small fee, we are spreading good will for Pi Phi. Through its warmth and charm one gets the feel of being in a lovely old home which is truly the case. Shirley Mann reports the slides were viewed by 37 groups. This is more than a 100% increase over last year. We are very pleased with the added interest, as we feel the best means of getting acquainted with Holt House is through the slides. A Holt House program is most interesting and informative, so why not schedule one for 55

        50 Texas Gamma (7) ................................ 150.00 Alabama Beta (3) . . . ............................ 100.00 Missouri Beta (12) 100.00 Nebraska Beta 100.00 Total S1,065.00 The drop in Magazine Agency Commissions, a major source of annual income, was very disheartening both at Central Office and at Settlement School, especially since the trend had been consistently upward in the prior several years. A loss of expected income in the amount of $2,150 is serious for the Settlement School, and it is most earnestly hoped that magazine sales in the current year will provide commissions which more than make up for the discouraging drop this year. Many individuals, clubs, Mothers' clubs, and chapters donated cash for special purposes and goods of various kinds to the school. These include Christmas and other holiday remembrances, clothing and various household articles, Fire Relief donations already mentioned, and special goods to the Health Center. Memorial Fund gifts came to exactly $100 this year. Many thanks are extended to each donor. Many "free purchases" were permitted through gifts of SH and TV stamps. These are always wanted and appreciated. Please continue to send them to the Director. The dollar has shrunk as much in Gatlinburg as any-where else in the country, and it is sometimes wondered if new budgets using last year's contribution figures are automatic year after year. Please let no one misunderstand. Every dollar sent is gratefully received and put to good use, but we do need more of them! In an endeavor to increase contributions, the Settlement School Commit-tee at its last meeting adopted a new contribution credit plan which will make more bookkeeping for the Treasurer but which we believe will have appeal for many individual Pi Phis. Henceforth, individual Pi Phis may make personal contributions to the Settlement School (many do!), assigning contribution credit to a favorite club or chap-ter, providing this is done at the time a check is sent. It is hoped that such two-way benefit will appeal to many members of the fraternity as they plan their personal contribution programs for the year. Many of us give automatically each year to the United Fund, the Red Cross, and many other personal favorite philanthropies. Why not consider a similar tax-deductible contribution to the Settlement School each year too? With a second benefit added (contribution credit for an alumnae club or an active chapter), we hope for increased interest in personal Pi Phi donations. Such checks should be made out to "Pi Beta Phi Settlement School" and they may be sent direct to the Settlement School Treasurer or through a club or chapter Treasurer. Contribution credit will be given only if a designation note is received with a check. The concluding Settlement School year was a very busy one for the resident staff and for the Settlement School Committee. The gratitude of the fraternity is due Director Marion Mueller for her capable handling of so many musts, all of which seemed to run concurrently for most of the year! Committee members have given marvelous cooperation to the chairman all through the year too, and all appreciate the good help and advice given so generously by our Grand Council contact member Olivia Smith Moore. We regret the conclusion of close working relationships with our excellent retiring treasurer, Zoe Saunders James; at the same time we welcome Sally Bozman Schneiter of Muncie, Indiana who has already indicated a knowledgeable and able handling of our financial concerns. We were both sad and happy for Helen Boucher Dix to be so suddenly "snatched" from our committee and so wholeheartedly "seated" in Grand Council as Grand Vice President; our best wishes go with her. We are very happy to have Sally Wild Gordon, former Pi Province President, join us in the capacity of publicity work for the committee. Lois Overstreet Summers and Eloise Glazner Hensley add desirable, capable con THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI tinuity even though they have switched jobs Lois to Secretary and Eloise to Slides Programs! It is again comforting to the chairman to have loyal, analytic Pi Phis sharing in the deliberations of this fraternity committee. Needs and Challenges The need for more dollars to balance their shrinking value has already been stated. Salaries must be paid, equipment replaced, the monthly bills met, leaks re-paired and danger spots eliminated. We must keep our several educational endeavors going for we are that kind of institution, and teachers and even minimum supplies and tools of work do cost. This dorm boy needs to earn extra money to make the senior trip with his class, and that girl needs to get her teeth fixed. At Arrowcraft, threads must be bought, and the weavers paid when they bring in their weaving. The Settlement School is a big place. Five dollars help, of course, but they don't go far. Contributions without strings are preferred, for then they may be used where the need is greatest. When a donation is over and above the needed annual income, the Director or Chairman is always happy to advise on a designated use. We see a need for more thoughtful understanding and education concerning our Settlement School. Too many Pi Phis are misinformed; too many expect the settlement, the people and the area to be the same as 25 years ago. This is one reason why committee has been so eager for a new Settlement School booklet to be placed in the hands of initiates. The pioneering days are over; they should be in fifty years! The early days were colorful and fascinating, but it is wrong to depict those days as if they existed today. A good educational program will balance the historical and the contemporary, and both kinds of presentations should be correct. Creativity in programs is fine, but not so fine when it tampers with facts or omits so much of the whole story that the result is one-sided. Above all, our own fraternity membership should be thoroughly and correctly informed. We recommend periodic use of the Settlement School Slides Programs in chapters and clubs. These are revised each year to bring information and pictures up to date. Our challenges are immediate and long-range, and both bring successes and sometimes failures. Thus it has ever been for any supervising Settlement School Committee. No one year is the same as the year before, and some planning for future growth and development is always part of every year. Unexpected bequests and out-right gifts of large sums have smoothed the way, over the years, to fulfillment of a need, a dream. They have made possible the large steps forward, and perhaps the fact that we have no reserves of this kind now is a challenge. We have a challenge at Arrowcraft to not fail our weavers in their dependency on us. We have similar charges with regard to our classes at the school, the dorm children, the Health Center, and the expanding Craft Workshop. The newest challenge of all involves possible use of the Centennial Fund for the development and expansion of Arts and Crafts training at the Settlement School. This challenge is one most definitely before the fraternity as a whole. The role of the Settlement School Committee is not yet charted and, frankly, we do not know our responsibility to the fraternity in regard to this. Until committee's part in ensuing fraternity discussions is somehow clarified, we can only "advise and consent" to a 100th year infusion of new life for the 50 year Memorial to the Founders of the Fraternity, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. The roots of this tree were planted deeply and in good soil. Its limbs, branches and foliage are sturdy and healthy. It has had fifty years of nourishment and care. How will it be tended in the next fifty years, and how can the present caretakers serve the members of the fraternity in making this decision? HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 51 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S' REPORT Settlement School has been so very busy celebrating a special birthday yes, a golden anniversary. First recognition was given in February by the local Pi Phi Little Pigeon Alumnx Club. In March our own Alice Mansfield, Olivia Moore, Marianne Wild, Zoe James, and Eta Province president, Pat Akers, came for the Chapel Program in Pi Beta Phi High School. This consisted of a series of seven tableaux depicting phases of the school Early School, Health Center, Arrowcraft Weaver and Designer, Dormitory Students' Introduction, Introduction of Descendants of the first two classes--1912-1913, Arts and Crafts, Music and Workshop. Immediately following the Chapel Program our national officers were guests at a Little Pigeon Alumnm Club luncheon. At Staff House honored dinner guests were members of the first two classes in 1912-1913. Even though a snowstorm caused a few last minute cancellations there was much fun reminiscing. Simultaneously to our celebration construction of a weaving studio was started. What a nice birthday present! This was a dream come true in June when Workshop opened its doors and thirty-six looms were in readiness. This building will be available throughout the year for the teaching of weaving (or other crafts) preferably by classes, sometimes individually. Dedication of the Evelyn Bishop Room the entrance lounge was well attended by old-time local citizens. Our Settlement School Committee was also here for the event. At Convention in the Mayflower Hotel Arrowcraft displayed and sold all-gold purses and bookmarks along with many other crafts. A good response was shown by Pi Phis from everywhere. This is a mutual opportunity for Club personnel, Arrowcraft and Settlement School representatives to become acquainted. The exhibit of early and contemporary Arrowcraft and Workshop weaving at the Smithsonian was a high-light indeed. Admittedly a thrill to me! Having been at the Smithsonian years ago I never dreamed of participating in any way with that institution. The exhibit was in the Rotunda in the Textile Division and not far from the corridor with the presidents' wives in their array Mrs. Calvin Coolidge wearing her Arrow and Mrs. Harry Truman with her Mother's pin. It has been a privilege to participate in such a prolonged birthday celebration, and to see another project anchored at Settlement School. Publicity continues, so many more are becoming aware of our growth. Just before our celebration started there was a very unfortunate event a fire doing damage January 11th to the extent that our boys' dormitory and office building had to be vacated. Fortunately we were able to rebuild and refurnish due to insurance. The response of Pi Phis to the emergency appeal was deeply appreciated. Insurance did not cover the losses of the boys, nor all of Mrs. Adams' who is our boys' chaperon and cook. Perhaps the golden anniversary was timely because it certainly helped us through the horrors of the fire that cold, below-zero January 11th. That is something to forget as much as possible. Our dormitory program had its share of honors students in junior and senior plays, two members of Beta Club, president of Student Council, the outstanding basketball player on boys' and girls' teams (as chosen by the Boosters' Club), and girls' basketball captain. Graduation night Ruby Wright not only received the cup for the best player on the girls' team (chosen by faculty), but the $100-scholarship (for higher education) given by the Beta Club as well as $200 for higher education by Pi Beta Phi. Ruby was a four-year dormitory girl. Two boys were nominees for the Citizenship Award. Melvin Ogle received the award as chosen by the faculty for the sophomore showing the most improvement. MO was given to Randy Trentham for higher educa Lion (tuition and/or fees) by Pi Beta Phi. Proud? Frankly yes. This is one small way of "seeing" improvement and development in our dormitory program. The senior class dedicated its yearbook, The Mountaineer, to Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. Another birthday present! Craft Workshop with the University of Tennessee has grown and this year the eighteenth summer had the largest enrollment ever. Twenty-three states were represented among our personnel. There were also two students from Pakistan. Staff agreed the spirit was very good. Each year I marvel at the beautiful crafts displayed the last night at Open House. Yes, it's really worth the effort to "come see." Two students were on Pi Phi scholarships. At Arrowcraft one realizes the important part our Clubs have in this Memorial to our Pi Beta Phi Founders. Shipping was good last year. The Little Pigeon awards at Convention are a small token of appreciation, and in reality represent the loyalty shown by many Pi Phi groups. We are mighty proud of the thirty Alumna Clubs who paid Arrowcraft more than a thousand dollars. Not to be neglected are the small Clubs. Each article sold is helping a craftsman somewhere. A heritage of talent is aptly displayed by these mountaineers. As groups learn of our Barn/Dorm (Red Barn) avail-able for workshops, religious groups, retreats, or Pi Phi chapters, more come each year. Reservations should be made far in advance for spring vacations. The Health Center has continued with a preventive program under Marjorie Chalmer's watchful eye. Each year we think will be the last for the only one-room school at the Glades in our area. Surely its days are numbered. Marjorie's resignation from Health Center is regrettable yet with twenty-seven years at Settlement School we certainly should and do wish her well in her retirement which will take effect when a replacement is made. Gene Redding, designer at Arrowcraft, is retiring when there is a replacement for her. Gene claims over twenty years at Settlement School. Yes, best wishes to Gene. Nevada Christian's resignation as Arrowcraft manager after a mere one-and-a-half years at Settlement School was untimely (comparatively speaking). Nevada's destination was her former home in California. Best wishes to Nevada and Sutton. Arlie Watson's thirty-six years as maintenance man at Settlement School certainly contributes to our high total of years of service on our staff. Arlie seemed to enjoy his first year in semi-retirement. Retirement folks from any walk of life might well apply his "psychology of living." Zanley Watson has filled in for Arlie admirably always having his tools in readiness to repair anything. Zanley also cooperates with Neal in his chores, ship-ping, at Arrowcraft, and maintenance. Quite a capable pair! Discontinuing the raising of chickens will affect Richard Watson's schedule. However, with each new building maintenance problems increase; so far, there is always plenty to do. Richard's recent encounter with a copperhead ended with first-aid, snake serum, and a stay in the hospital. Mrs. Adams' narrow escape in the January fire has not seemed to affect her noticeably. She continues planning for those boys' and girls' appetites next winter. Gallons and bushels! Gallons of jelly, bushels of beans, corn, etc., are being prepared for their inevitable consummation. Ruth Spelman's many activities as housemother belie her being a Pi Phi over fifty years. In semi-retirement, she practices a healthy philosophy. Elizabeth Rue's semi-retirement has given an opportunity for her to participate in community and social 52 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI activities. She still enjoys sellin' (and she does lots of it) at the Mountain View Hotel Arrowcraft Shop. June Cook, the youngest and last of four sisters who have been employed at Arrowcraft came after her high school graduation in May '61. Faye Cook has been at Arrowcraft four years, Nella nine, jean Hembree three years, Shirley Roberts two years. These girls compose our sales and shipping staff, Nella assisting our de-signer part time. Nadine Grooms Whitted, a descendant of one of our earliest weavers, Mary L. Owenby, has served as secretary to the director for two years quite capably. As director and part time manager of Arrowcraft Shop my year has been a full one. It is a constant struggle to be in readiness for the next project. Serving as chairman of the October Southern Highland Guild Craftsmen's Fair in Gatlinburg again in '62 leaves few idle moments. The Southern Highland Handicrafts Guild is a large organization formed in 1928 to help craftsmen find an outlet for their crafts and to raise the standards of the work. Pi Phi works with the Guild, mutually and advantageously in the craft field. I am looking forward to serving as a member of the Board of Trustees, having been elected for a three-year term. A big "thank you" is extended to all donors to Settlement School. The Christmas list is an impressive one. Pi Phis again met a challenge with the Fire Emergency Fund. A constant stream of merchandise stamps also provides blankets and even some lamps for dormitory rooms. You have not forgotten us. Thank you again. The area and town surprisingly are still developing. A County Hospital and consolidation of our high school are imminent. Financing and details are still in the embryo stage. Pi Phi provided an Arts and Crafts teacher again a Pi Phi, Margaret Struble, from Ames, Iowa. The wood-craft instruction probably will be expanded from two to three classes. A music teacher is not assigned as yet. If one is obtained music will be taught again this year. If and when the high school moves, all available guidance, I am sure, will be used in directing our paths. It is my wish that every Pi Phi could visit Settlement School at some time. An invitation is extended to each of you to come for a tour of Settlement School. In June 1961 delegates from every Chapter came for our so-called Little Convention. That made Settlement School a reality to a nucleus of our actives and alumni. Mutually the delegates were a reality to us folks at Settlement School. "The years of man are the looms of God, Let down from the place of the sun, Wherein we all are weaving, 'til the Mystic web is done." Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER Little Rock, Arkansas August 1, 1962 Mrs. Richard E. James Treasurer Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Gatlinburg, Tennessee DEAR MRS. JAMES: We have audited the books and records of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the year ended May 31, 1962.

Pi Beta Phi has been growing too. At age 95 we are 108 chapters tall. As we put a period to the activities for 1961-62 we added five marks to our growth record for the five new chapters added to our roll since the last Convention, three of them during the current year. They are Oregon Delta, Mississippi Alpha and Beta, Tennessee Delta and Kentucky Beta. Each will add strength to the fraternity in their accomplishments on their own campuses, and will increase our membership representation throughout the United States and Canada. We claim each of them with pride. With our new chapters in Mississippi only three states remains in the continental United States without representation. They are New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New Jersey. Increased enrollments make it desirable for Administrations to invite additional fraternities to establish chapters on their campuses, and new campuses are continually being opened to national fraternities. Some in this latter category offer promise for the future. However, at the present time no commitments have been made for new chapters for the coming year. This does not mean any reduction in the number of inquiries which have come to Pi Beta Phi about its interest in extension. To be exact there have been letters from thirty-four different campuses, and in some in-stances more than one inquiry from a given campus. Of this number, twenty are from campuses which have not previously been in contact with us. In the case of some inquiries which have come late in the year they have been asked to supply more information in order that the Grand Council could fairly evaluate the opportunity for extension. Many things are taken into consideration in such evaluations, not the least of which is opinion of officers, chapters and alumna' clubs in the province. With the growth in educational facilities, and changing populations, the colleges themselves change. Pi Beta Phi must consider these changes so that decisions are made in thebest interest of the fraternity. Other fraternities are placing new chapters each year. There have been 59 new women's chapters this year, 81 last year for a total of 140. since our last convention. We make no attempt to "keep up with the Joneses" but we must keep in mind the fact that each new chapter helps the older chapters by its coverage in membership in communities in which they also have an interest. Those thirty-four campuses interested in affiliation with Pi Beta Phi are as follows: Ferris Institute, Big Rapids, Michigan; University of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri; University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island; Lenoir Rhyne College, Hickory, North Carolina; Moorhead State College, Moorhead, Minnesota; Bryant College, Johnston, Rhode Island; Norfolk College of William and Mary, Norfolk, Virginia; Florence Branch, University of South Carolina, Florence, South Carolina; Alma College, Alma, Michigan; Eastern New Mexico University, Portales, New Mexico; Los Angeles State College, Los Angeles, California; Wittenberg University, Spring-field, Ohio; Stephen F. Austin St. College, Nacogdoches, Texas; Arizona State College, Flagstaff, Arizona; University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Transylvania College, Lexington, Kentucky; Southeast-ern Louisiana College, Hammond, Louisiana; Pennsylvania State College, East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania; College of Steubenville, Steubenville, Ohio; C. W. Post College of L.I. University, Brookville, New York; Alfred University, Alfred, New York and Rochester, New York; Illinois Wesleyan, Bloomington, Illinois; New Bedford Tech., Fairhaven, Massachusetts; San Fernando Valley State College, Northridge, California; Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Mankato State College, Mankato, Minnesota; University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida; Georgia State College, Atlanta, Georgia; Little Rock University, Little Rock, Arkansas; Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois. MARIANNE REID WILD NPC Delegate and Chairman of Extension HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE In 1960-61 only eight chapters and twenty-seven clubs failed to contribute to Holt House. We've never had 100%, but we're hoping this may be the year ! At this writing it's too soon to know, but Jo Boydstun, our treasurer reports that contributions are ahead of last year, and May is always the biggest month, so we're keeping cur fingers crossed. We don't have as impressive a list of accomplishments this year as we did last, but sometimes after a big "splurge" you have to "coast" a bit. We had hoped to have a long range plan of redecorating and restoration set up and begun, but due to personal and family illness of our key member in this, Eleanor Miller, interior decorator with L. S. Ayres in Indianapolis, we were not able to get underway. We had set 1967, our centennial year as the year to have Holt House completely refurbished, so there is still time. Just keep those contributions coming. In August the house received two coats of white paint. Fresh paint does so much in the way of "face lifting." The powder room has a new vinyl floor and sparkling new curtains. The kitchen is proving its worth in added space and efficiency. A new formica topped table with matching chairs is a big improvement overthe old white porcelain table and worn chairs that had given us yeoman's service for so long. We hope to add to our supply of dishes, but had had difficulty in obtaining the present "Rose Point" pattern. If we can't get it, it will be necessary to start with another pattern. We are pleased that Holt House continues to be such an integral part of the "goings on" in Monmouth. It was used for 132 functions from May 1961 through April 1962, of which only twenty-five were Pi Phi. Several clubs use it for all their meetings and most months show a goodly number of showers, teas, and receptions. We have purposely kept the fees low, as we feel Holt House rep-resents the fraternity, and by making it available to the community for a small fee, we are spreading good will for Pi Phi. Through its warmth and charm one gets the feel of being in a lovely old home which is truly the case. Shirley Mann reports the slides were viewed by 37 groups. This is more than a 100% increase over last year. We are very pleased with the added interest, as we feel the best means of getting acquainted with Holt House is through the slides. A Holt House program is most interesting and informative, so why not schedule one for 55

        52 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI activities. She still enjoys sellin' (and she does lots of it) at the Mountain View Hotel Arrowcraft Shop. June Cook, the youngest and last of four sisters who have been employed at Arrowcraft came after her high school graduation in May '61. Faye Cook has been at Arrowcraft four years, Nella nine, jean Hembree three years, Shirley Roberts two years. These girls compose our sales and shipping staff, Nella assisting our de-signer part time. Nadine Grooms Whitted, a descendant of one of our earliest weavers, Mary L. Owenby, has served as secretary to the director for two years quite capably. As director and part time manager of Arrowcraft Shop my year has been a full one. It is a constant struggle to be in readiness for the next project. Serving as chairman of the October Southern Highland Guild Craftsmen's Fair in Gatlinburg again in '62 leaves few idle moments. The Southern Highland Handicrafts Guild is a large organization formed in 1928 to help craftsmen find an outlet for their crafts and to raise the standards of the work. Pi Phi works with the Guild, mutually and advantageously in the craft field. I am looking forward to serving as a member of the Board of Trustees, having been elected for a three-year term. A big "thank you" is extended to all donors to Settlement School. The Christmas list is an impressive one. Pi Phis again met a challenge with the Fire Emergency Fund. A constant stream of merchandise stamps also provides blankets and even some lamps for dormitory rooms. You have not forgotten us. Thank you again. The area and town surprisingly are still developing. A County Hospital and consolidation of our high school are imminent. Financing and details are still in the embryo stage. Pi Phi provided an Arts and Crafts teacher again a Pi Phi, Margaret Struble, from Ames, Iowa. The wood-craft instruction probably will be expanded from two to three classes. A music teacher is not assigned as yet. If one is obtained music will be taught again this year. If and when the high school moves, all available guidance, I am sure, will be used in directing our paths. It is my wish that every Pi Phi could visit Settlement School at some time. An invitation is extended to each of you to come for a tour of Settlement School. In June 1961 delegates from every Chapter came for our so-called Little Convention. That made Settlement School a reality to a nucleus of our actives and alumni. Mutually the delegates were a reality to us folks at Settlement School. "The years of man are the looms of God, Let down from the place of the sun, Wherein we all are weaving, 'til the Mystic web is done." Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER Little Rock, Arkansas August 1, 1962 Mrs. Richard E. James Treasurer Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Gatlinburg, Tennessee DEAR MRS.

MARIANNE REID WILD NPC Delegate and Chairman of Extension HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE In 1960-61 only eight chapters and twenty-seven clubs failed to contribute to Holt House. We've never had 100%, but we're hoping this may be the year ! At this writing it's too soon to know, but Jo Boydstun, our treasurer reports that contributions are ahead of last year, and May is always the biggest month, so we're keeping cur fingers crossed. We don't have as impressive a list of accomplishments this year as we did last, but sometimes after a big "splurge" you have to "coast" a bit. We had hoped to have a long range plan of redecorating and restoration set up and begun, but due to personal and family illness of our key member in this, Eleanor Miller, interior decorator with L. S. Ayres in Indianapolis, we were not able to get underway. We had set 1967, our centennial year as the year to have Holt House completely refurbished, so there is still time. Just keep those contributions coming. In August the house received two coats of white paint. Fresh paint does so much in the way of "face lifting." The powder room has a new vinyl floor and sparkling new curtains. The kitchen is proving its worth in added space and efficiency. A new formica topped table with matching chairs is a big improvement overthe old white porcelain table and worn chairs that had given us yeoman's service for so long. We hope to add to our supply of dishes, but had had difficulty in obtaining the present "Rose Point" pattern. If we can't get it, it will be necessary to start with another pattern. We are pleased that Holt House continues to be such an integral part of the "goings on" in Monmouth. It was used for 132 functions from May 1961 through April 1962, of which only twenty-five were Pi Phi. Several clubs use it for all their meetings and most months show a goodly number of showers, teas, and receptions. We have purposely kept the fees low, as we feel Holt House rep-resents the fraternity, and by making it available to the community for a small fee, we are spreading good will for Pi Phi. Through its warmth and charm one gets the feel of being in a lovely old home which is truly the case. Shirley Mann reports the slides were viewed by 37 groups. This is more than a 100% increase over last year. We are very pleased with the added interest, as we feel the best means of getting acquainted with Holt House is through the slides. A Holt House program is most interesting and informative, so why not schedule one for 55

Pi Beta Phi has been growing too. At age 95 we are 108 chapters tall. As we put a period to the activities for 1961-62 we added five marks to our growth record for the five new chapters added to our roll since the last Convention, three of them during the current year. They are Oregon Delta, Mississippi Alpha and Beta, Tennessee Delta and Kentucky Beta. Each will add strength to the fraternity in their accomplishments on their own campuses, and will increase our membership representation throughout the United States and Canada. We claim each of them with pride. With our new chapters in Mississippi only three states remains in the continental United States without representation. They are New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New Jersey. Increased enrollments make it desirable for Administrations to invite additional fraternities to establish chapters on their campuses, and new campuses are continually being opened to national fraternities. Some in this latter category offer promise for the future. However, at the present time no commitments have been made for new chapters for the coming year. This does not mean any reduction in the number of inquiries which have come to Pi Beta Phi about its interest in extension. To be exact there have been letters from thirty-four different campuses, and in some in-stances more than one inquiry from a given campus. Of this number, twenty are from campuses which have not previously been in contact with us. In the case of some inquiries which have come late in the year they have been asked to supply more information in order that the Grand Council could fairly evaluate the opportunity for extension. Many things are taken into consideration in such evaluations, not the least of which is opinion of officers, chapters and alumna' clubs in the province. With the growth in educational facilities, and changing populations, the colleges themselves change. Pi Beta Phi must consider these changes so that decisions are made in thebest interest of the fraternity. Other fraternities are placing new chapters each year. There have been 59 new women's chapters this year, 81 last year for a total of 140. since our last convention. We make no attempt to "keep up with the Joneses" but we must keep in mind the fact that each new chapter helps the older chapters by its coverage in membership in communities in which they also have an interest. Those thirty-four campuses interested in affiliation with Pi Beta Phi are as follows: Ferris Institute, Big Rapids, Michigan; University of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri; University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island; Lenoir Rhyne College, Hickory, North Carolina; Moorhead State College, Moorhead, Minnesota; Bryant College, Johnston, Rhode Island; Norfolk College of William and Mary, Norfolk, Virginia; Florence Branch, University of South Carolina, Florence, South Carolina; Alma College, Alma, Michigan; Eastern New Mexico University, Portales, New Mexico; Los Angeles State College, Los Angeles, California; Wittenberg University, Spring-field, Ohio; Stephen F.

A Holt House program is most interesting and informative, so why not schedule one for 55 SUL/lent School 19124962 FIFTIETH YEAR REPORT-SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE Fifty years of Settlement School are an achievement and a challenge. It would be impossible to compile a complete roster of every Pi Phi who, during these years, ever gave of her resources at the Settlement School, or, to the same end, in her chapter or alumna club. Working together through five decades of service and voluntary contributions, the members of the fraternity have built a remarkable, nationally recognized, living Memorial to the Founders of Pi Beta Phi. The fact that the fraternity's national philanthropic efforts have not been dispersed is undoubtedly one factor. The fact of a tangible place is another. The fact of building, layer by layer and year by year, upon the original intent and investment is a third. And finally, there is the fact of changing services to met changing needs a policy that has prevailed through the years. This fiftieth year report will first review the several ways the Golden Anniversary of the Settlement school was celebrated. The usual report of the year just pas$will follow. Lastly, from a comprehensive range of concerns, there will be an attempt to identify some of the immediate needs and challenges pertaining to our national philanthropy. Fiftieth Anniversary Highlights As was proper, commemoration festivities began at the Settlement School in Gatlinburg on March 6. First on the agenda was a chapel program in the school auditorium where the resident staff, dormitory students and several townspeople presented a narration with tableaux depicting the 50-year story. Fraternity representatives were Alice Mansfield, Grand President; Olivia Moore, Grand Treasurer; Marianne Wild, NPC Delegate; Pat Akers, Eta Province President; and Zoe James, Settlement School Treasurer, who wrote the splendid story of the celebration for last summer's ARROW. Also at the school, Margaret Struble, Iowa Gamma art teacher, arranged an eye-catching bulletin board display of old pictures which created much interest among the student body. Though a deep snow and icy roads unexpectedly cut attendance at the Staff House anniversary dinner, several members of the early classes at the school were able to attend, and the evening abounded with reminiscent conversation beginning with "Do you remember?" A very nice surprise occurred next when the high school annual, The Mountaineer, was dedicated as follows: "We, the Senior Class of 1962, are honored to dedicate this issue of The Mountaineer to the members of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, whose courage and foresight have, for fifty years, demonstrated the finest attributes of a democratic nation. We salute you !" Pictures of the five Grand Presidents of the fraternity from 1912 to 1962 and several early school scenes added dignity and interest to the dedication pages. The Smithsonian Institution Exhibition in Washing-ton from June 22 to July 22 was probably the highlight of the anniversary year! Those fortunate to be present for the opening reception in the famous Rotunda of the Arts and Industries Building will never forget our pride in the Settlement School when Dr. Kellogg coupled our endeavors with those of the Smithsonian ! To have our efforts, especially those in the Arts and Crafts field, recognized and praised by an institution of the stature of the Smithsonian, The United States National Museum, is surely a unique experience in the fraternity world, and it is one all Pi Phis will treasure. It was thrilling to see our familiar Arrowcraft handweaving and the creative weaving of several Craft Workshop students combined with otheraccent crafts in such a beautiful and extensive exhibit. Mrs. Myrtle Conner, Arrowcraft weaver for over 30 years, demonstrated weaving for six days in the shadow of the enormous Statue of Freedom in the Rotunda, causing many interested pauses and comments among the thousands who passed her loom each day. In connection with the Smithsonian Exhibit and the 1962 Convention, Marie Lingo, Delta PVP, and Helen Russell, Committee Chairman, participated in a radio interview on the Patty Cavan Show at station WX'RC-NBC in Washington, and later in the week, Marion Mueller, Director, and Myrtle Conner, weaver, were interviewed on television by the well known Inga of the same station. Many Pi Phis were able to see the exhibit during convention week, and for others pictures will be forthcoming. The latest news is a wonderful sequel to the month-long summer exhibit a permanent collection of Arrowcraft weaving at the Smithsonian and the promise of those pieces being used in another exhibit in 1967 when Pi Beta Phi is 100 years old! Details of this further development will be told in a future issue of the ARROW. The fraternity owes a great debt of gratitude to Marie Lingo for her personal contacts over a two-year period on behalf of a Smithsonian Exhibit to commemorate the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Settlement School. At Convention, a special 50-year Settlement School Exhibit was set up in a corner of the Historical Room. Prepared by the committee and under the leadership of Helen Dix, now Grand Vice President, a display of posters with old and new albums was carried out in gold. On a separate table, honor and tribute were paid to the twelve Founders who appeared to be looking down from a cloud in Pi Phi heaven upon a standing mobile in gold and white, representing the Settlement School today. Across the room, in the regular Historical Exhibit, was an autographed picture of Grace Coolidge, sent for convention display by Sarah Pomeroy Rugg who designated it to go to the School, after Convention, to replace the picture destroyed in tLe recent fire. The committee is very gratefulio Mrs. Rugg for id t1iioughtfulness in providing this replacement. Needless to say, an important accession to the Grace Coolidge Library at the Settlement School this year is the new book, "Grace Coolidge and Her Era" by Ishbel Ross, which received so much attention at the 1962 Convention. The Arrowcraft Shop at Convention, under the splendid leadership of Acting Manager Marion Mueller, helped celebrate the anniversary by being the largest and best financially of any known. Several golden items had been designed to commemorate fifty years, while other new items held the attention of delegates thinking ahead to coming Arrowcraft sales. Valued assistance was given all week long by Dorothy Hopkins and other members of the Baltimore Alumna Club, by Elizabeth Rue Manager of the Gatlinburg Mt. View Hotel shop, by Virginia Brackett Green former Committee Chairman, and by Lois Summers of the current committee. The Convention Report was given informally, high-lights of the past year being quickly reviewed. That time was mainly given to presentation of Little Pigeon Awards to province heads for 100% contributions, to clubs and chapters for outstanding support, plus Magazine Agency award checks. Special to the year were Soaring Pigeon Awards given to the chapters contributing the most individual members together with number of service years in direct Settlement School work during fifty years as teachers, resident staff, members of committee, teachers or 46 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 47 students at Craft Workshop, and the like. These special awards were won by Iowa Gamma first, Illinois Beta-Delta second, and Indiana Gamma third. In addition and amid grateful and warm applause, Marie Lingo received a Soaring Pigeon, the first ever awarded to an individual, for her outstanding liaison leading to the Smithsonian Exhibit. The Convention Settlement School Dinner was beautifully presented by the Cleveland East and West Alumna' Clubs, with Betty Calhoun of East and Barbara Olsen of West hostessing for the clubs, and Peg Feistkorn of East presiding at the head table. The Evelyn Prouty Hickman placemat design was reproduced in gold on white for the occasion; souvenirs were Pi Beta Phi ash-trays and gold and white printed napkins and decorated napkin clips. Table centerpieces were miniature wooden spinning wheels (two of which found their way to the Settlement School), with gold and white flowers artistically added. During the dinner hour, Rose Dressler, rep-resenting the Kansas City Alumnw Club's post-convention Tour-to-New York, presented to the Settlement School a generous profit-sharing check which was most gratefully accepted. With the aid of Eloise Hensley, committee member identifying those at convention with direct Settlement School experience, "Chairman Peg" recognized and honored: May L. Keller President Emeritus, first Pi Phi to visit Gatlin-burg (1910) Amy B. Onken----Honorary Grand President, 32 years leadership in school growth Olivia S.

Rue Former Arrowcraft Manager, He, View Hotel Shop Manager Helen M. Russell Chairman Settlement School Committee The Settlement School Anniversary Program following dinner opened with the lovely voices of Pat Ballard and her chorus leading the audience in three songs: Old Smoky as sung at the school, A Paper of Pins with humorous boy-girl aspects, and IJ7eaving a reminder of our own Arrowcraft. The chorus alone then sang Pi Beta Phi T'o Thee, the beautiful Alma Mater at the school and different from the fraternity song. The program itself consisted of slides with a running commentary on the people and developments as the five areas of the school grew during fifty years. Periodically chorus voices came in with quotes, or emphasized points to remember. The actives helping so effectively with this part of the pro-gram were Susie Garretson of Oklahoma Beta, Nola Hague of Alberta Alpha, and Jeannie Norris of California Delta. Slides of pictures from old ARROWS and photo-graph albums were combined with current slides to give a sweeping history in an atmosphere of "You Were There." The able assistance of Zoe James in correlating slides with script was deeply appreciated. The program closed with the exquisitely beautiful voice of Pat Bal-Iard singing I IY'bnder As I Wander. Virginia Green's excellent new booklet bringing the Settlement School story up-to-date for initiates was a convention favor presented to everyone immediately after the program. The grateful appreciation of the fraternity goes to Virginia for her hours of research and writing, to Dor Burns of Central Office who had charge of the printing, and to Grand Council for joint cooperation to complete this needed revision in time for introduction at the 1962 Convention. Banquet highlights for the Settlement School werethree-fold. As guests entered the impressive State Room for that last dinner and evening together, the first thing they saw were envelope purses from Arrowcraft as dinner favors. Next came Olivia Moore's announcement of the generous cash gift to Settlement School by the three Prouty daughters to honor their mother, Lolita Snell Prouty, and to be held as a nucleus for a sorely-needed, permanent ceramics laboratory. Lastly came the presentation of the May L. Keller Award for the best chapter Settlement School program to Dianne Bushell and Nancy Hughes of Ontario Alpha; we believe this to be the first time a Canadian chapter has been so honored. The final highlight of the anniversary year occurred in Gatlinburg where the committee adjourned to conclude its annual meeting. There we saw, for the first time, the newly complete Weaving Studio, a structure long planned for and needed. The studio part is a spacious room well-suited for instruction, display, proper placing of thirty-six looms, and storage of supplies. The en-trance room is particularly attractive. It is dominated by a lovely stone fireplace, flanked on one side by open floor-to-ceiling shelves. Handwoven hangings enhance the walls, and a few tables and chairs complete the charm of this entrance room. This, The Evelyn Bishop Memorial Room, was furnished from contributions given in memory of Miss Evelyn, head resident at the school from 1918-1933, who passed on last year. Numerous Gatlin-burg residents who had known and loved Miss Evelyn attended the dedication on July 5th. The ceremony opened with a moving prayer by Lois Summers, followed by group singing of a favorite hymn of Miss Evelyn's led by Marjorie Chalmers and Dorothy Manley. Gene Red-ding and Sue Huff Cox then told some of their memories of Miss Evelyn, recalling the endearing qualities she had for all who knew her. The ceremony ended as Helen Russell presented and entrusted the keys of the building to Director Marion Mueller. During the reception hour, it was a privilege for committee members to met and converse with townspeople, many of whom had been well-known names only, prior to this day. It was a memorable occasion for all who came together to pay tribute to the lovely lady who gave so much of herself in planting strong roots for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. Thus, the Golden Anniversary commemoration was concluded in Gatlinburg where it all began fifty years ago. It was appropriate that several features of the celebration took place in our nation's capital where the idea for the school was first conceived. Now, in retrospect, the activities at both Washington and Gatlinburg have seemed to fuse into a whole, and our concern for a dignified, appropriate and memorable Golden Anniversary for the Settlement School comes to an end. It has been a rare privilege and honor to participate intimately in the commemorative proceedings. The Past Year: 1961-62 The 1962 Summer Craft Workshop, jointly sponsored by the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School and the University of Tennessee for 18 increasingly successful years, attained a new high of 136 students enrolled for both sessions. There were 96 individuals, just two less than the all-time high of the year before. They came from 23 states, and two came from Pakistan. These facts alone should indicate the excellent reputation of our Craft Workshop and the wide appeal it continues to have. The fraternity owes a sixteen year debt to Marion Heard, Professor of Craft Design at UT, for the outstanding and selfless leadership she has given to the Workshop. Excel-lent instructors have also played a major role. The age range among students is wide and occupations are diversified. Some come for credit with graduate students pre-dominating, while others come just for the satisfactions found in handcrafts. Courses were offered this year in jewelry, silk screen, pottery, weaving design, recreational crafts and enameling. These courses are tough and in48 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI tensive, as the writer can testify! Instructors give personal attention to each student and all are "master teachers" in somehow drawing out the best in each pupil. Final exhibits, open to the public, give amazing evidence of the high standards of skill and artistry which are the backbone of the Workshop's fine reputation at home and abroad. More Pi Phis should come and see, or better still, come and attend! The new Leaving Studio is a joy to work in, committee was told, and a pleasure to look at both inside and out, as we saw! It is good that our looms now have a permanent home. Further, we now have a place where additional workshops may be held throughout the year. This is a step forward, as we think ahead to the future. When the pottery wing is added to this building to complete the original plan, firm foundations will have been laid for year-around training in two art and craft fields. The Virginia Alpha Scholarship to the Craft Work-shop this year was won by Nancy Van Schreeven of Virginia Gamma. The Albuquerque Alum= Club scholarship was won by Bette Casteel who came from Alameda. Graduate Assistants were jean Carroll of South Carolina Alpha and Margaret Struble of Iowa Gamma. Pi Phis attending as students were Connie Cox, Tennessee Gamma, Miriam Herron, Illinois Eta, and Lucy Glazner Matkin, Oklahoma Beta. Gale Ann McDonald came all the way from Michigan Delta to assist Mrs. Mueller during the weeks of Workshop. There really ought to be more Pi Phis at our Craft Workshops. Would more local scholarships within the provinces help? The Craft Workshop is an exciting, going concern now; its pioneering days are over! Its outreach extends from ocean to ocean, and from gulf to across the Canadian border. And it has drawn 27 foreign students from a dozen different countries ! The teenager and senior citizen work side by side, for age is no barrier in creativity. It teaches those who teach others children, youth or adults, the physically able and the handicapped, the normal and the subor above normal. Those who come to learn take back to their local communities their new skills and appreciations for application at home. Would that more Pi Phis knew and understood this particular asset of the Settlement School! Now, Arrowcraft is an asset (and a trademark) long familiar to Pi Phis, especially in those loyal clubs and chapters where annual or biennial Arrowcraft sales are a tradition. This, too, serves an arts and crafts area, our own special one handweaving, and we realize anew its quality and worth due to the Smithsonian Exhibition. It is disappointing that weaving sales to clubs and chapters dropped a bit, but other craft sales climbed so that the year ended with an overall increased total. Especially encouraging and noteworthy is the new and splendid record attained when 36 clubs paid over $1000 to Arrow-craft last year. Those clubs, of which the first five received Soaring Pigeon Awards at convention, are: Champaign-Urbana $4,288.24 Philadelphia $1,276.82 Oklahoma City 3,190.66 Milwaukee 1,256.09 Houston 2,294.58 Toledo 1,217.42 Arlington Heights 2,140.62 Fayetteville 1,215.34 Akron 2,055.65 Ann Arbor 1,197.06 Pittsburgh 2,040.68 Western Kansas 1,109.19 Lincoln 1,968.72 Chicago W. Suburban 1,159.79 Pasadana 1,902.98 Madison 1,129.17 Indianapolis ....... 1,843.67 Charleston 1,127.96 Schenectady ........ 1,797.32 Phoenix 1,112.44 Denver ........ 1,774.79 North Shore 1,103.62 South Bend ........ 1,697.92 Everett 1,102.76 Northern New Jersey 1,608.77 Dallas 1,091.24 Columbus, Ohio 1,437.66 Cleveland East 1,068.58 Miami 1,433.11 Galesburg 1,052.27 Kansas 'City, Mo. 1,348.84 Des Moines 1,035.76 Columbia, Mo 1,348.58 Baltimore 1,018.41 Cleveland West 1,303.98 Southern New Jersey 1,011.35 The club chairmen and other Arrowcraft devotees who made this list possible, are most warmly commended and thanked. Many smaller clubs had excellent sales for their size, with Arrowcraft remittances just under the figure for honorable mention. Arrowcraft had two efficiency boosts this year. One was the addition to the shop of a shipping room which has greatly alleviated former cramped quarters. The second need was for a new truck to replace the old one that was beginning to cost in maintenance and repairs. This is the only truck the school has and it gets much hard use on the grounds and as it carries express Arrowcraft shipments to Sevierville during busy club shipping seasons. Marion Mueller has continued to serve as Arrowcraft Manager since November, 1961 when Nevada Christian resigned. This has added greatly to her responsibilities, and it is hoped that a new manager can be found soon. A second replacement at the shop will be necessary next January when the resignation of Gene Redding, Weaving Designer, takes effect. Gene has capably served Arrow-craft, during four different employment periods, since 1925 when she first came to the school as a weaving teacher. She will be greatly missed. However, she is building a retirement home in the area so contact with her will not be lost. Most of the designs in the Smithsonian Exhibit were Gene's, a splendid tribute to her years of work with the school and to her personally during her last year. Eunice Cole will continue to serve as bookkeeper, as will Nella Hill, Faye Cook, Gene Hembree, Shirley Roberts, and June Cook, all of whom are very able, loyal employees. Orlie, Neal and Zanley Watson, who share the heavy work at the shop, fit that description too; they con-tribute cheerfulness to the shop scene as well as strong muscles! While we are on the subject of Watson men at the Settlement School, we greatly appreciate the fine day-by-day maintenance service given by all four of them, including Richard who does some grounds work, tends the chickens (soon to be stopped), and works the gardens. Neal is Orlie's son; Zanley is Orlie's nephew; Richard is no known kin, though if one went back far enough, he just might be found to be kin "close to far off !" Orlie attained 35 years of Settlement School service last summer. He was honored at a Staff House dinner on September 1, 1961 at which time he started part-time work, with Zanley coming in for full time employment. Much of Orlie's time last spring was spent in construction supervision of the new Weaving Studio. We are very grateful to all the Watson men for their excellent care of the Pi Phi Settlement School property; it is their work, supervised by the Director, which makes visiting Pi Phis so proud of the appearance of the grounds and buildings. The school situation, in regard to proposed plans for consolidating Pi Beta Phi High School with Pitman Center, awaits a financing vote from the Sevier County Court. (County-wide raises for teachers await a similar action.) For the 1962-63 school year, present arrangements are concluded for the fraternity to provide the Arts and Crafts teacher who will be Miss Betty Burchfiel of Sevierville. We regret the resignation of Margaret Struble, Iowa Gamma, the able instructor of last year. Increased popularity of Mr. Carl Huskey's classes in Woodworking among high school boys will raise his daily classes to three. If it is possible to secure a Music teacher before school opens, those classes will again be provided. Mrs. Leona Enloe, after several years on our staff, has retired from teaching. The Art and Woodworking classes are taught in the Emma Harper Turner Arts and Crafts Center. Other than the old Log Cabin, this building is the oldest on our property. It is worth preserving because part of that building was our first school ! However, when those rooms are viewed in the light of modern classrooms, they leave much to be desired in surroundings and in equipment. It is hoped that additional, special contributions for this purpose will make renovation possible in the near future. It is important to train the young of this area in appreciations in the Arts and Crafts field; this can and should be done well. The Jennie Nicol Health Center, with Nurse Marjorie Chalmers again in charge, had another excellent, service-able year. Marjorie came to the Settlement School in December of 1935, was honored for 25 years continuous THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 49 service at the "Little Convention" banquet in June of 1961, and she has decided that the time has come for her to retire (in the area also, which does have a tremendous charm) as soon as a replacement can be secured. Marjorie's personalized program in Maternal and Infant Welfare has paid great dividends to the entire community; her work in this area alone has spanned three generations. She has been a friend indeed to the children of the Pi Beta Phi School, to those at nearby rural schools (de-creased to one at present), to the summer Craft Work-shop students, to the general community and to anyone in need who comes to her door. Naturally her work today is more preventative, therapeutic, corrective and advisory than it was in those earlier days, but she has been no less busy this past year, as this record of service indicates: Field visits 544 Office calls 3856 Service given 3223 Smallpox vaccinations 276 Typhoid inoculations 341 Triple vaccine 225 Salk vaccine 330 Tetanus toxoid 36 Therapeutic inoculations 177 Tuberculin tests 37 Chest X-rays ... . 1047 Physical exams and inspections 3170 Audiometer tests 163 Teacher-nurse conferences 197 Family conferences 294 Health talks 74 Newspaper articles 18 Sigma Phi Gamma contributions to the Health Center this year totaled $225. These donations are grate-fully received each year and used for children in medically indigent families needing correction of orthopedic weaknesses, speech and hearing defects, dental troubles, and the purchase or replacement of glasses. Adjustments to a new nurse will not be easy for Marjorie has been the Health Center for so long, but we are counting on both Marjorie and the new person to make the change as smooth as possible. Our sincere thanks are again extended to Marjorie for her many years of splendid service. The Dormitory Program, in spite of the January to May housing interruption, had a very rewarding year in retrospect, with several students attaining leadership positions and various school awards. Senior Ruby Wright received the North Shore Alumnx Club scholarship for further education, while Randy Trentham, another dorm student, and Charles Moore, Jr., received Alspaugh Fund scholarships. Ruth Spelman completed her fourth excel-lent year as Stuart housemother for the girls, while Marion Mueller capably shared supervision of the boys with Lela Adams. The January 11th fire at the Boys' Dorm (also called Teachers Cottage and Helmick House) could have been tragic, but fortunately and thankfully, it was not! Fast warning by Mrs. Adams and prompt reactions by Mr. Carnes, a teacher in residence, and the boys, resulted in prompt evacuation of the building. Members of the Gatlinburg Volunteer Fire Department responded quickly to the siren that cold, cold night and were able to confine blaze damage to the first floor, though contents of the second floor were a major loss as well, due to smoke and water damage. Two facts were prominent in regard to rebuilding: one, that the timber in this building was originally so 'sturdy and sound, and two, that committee had converted to a replacement-cost type of insurance just the summer before. The appeal to the fraternity for emergency donations brought a most welcome response of $918.41, all of which was used to restitute personal losses and (with additional funds from the General Account) to make several needed improvements. To make a long, tedious adjustment and rebuilding story short, Teachers Cottage was rebuilt, refurnished, and ready for occupancy by summer Craft Workshop students on June 11th! Much credit goes to Marion Mueller and the maintenance men for the local planning and hard work necessary to meet that deadline. Teachers Cottage is clean and freshnow, and actually more attractive than ever belying its age of 46 years ! Annual contributions from both clubs and chapters were higher than the prior year, with those from chapters increasing over 25 percent! What a nice way to recognize the anniversary year ! 100% provinces in contributions for the concluding fiscal year were: Clubs Charters Gamma Alpha Kappa Epsilon Beta Mu Zeta Gamma Nu Eta Delta Omicron Iota Epsilon Pi Lambda Zeta Mu Eta Pi North Theta Pi South Iota Officers for the above provinces received Little Pigeon Awards at Convention to wear for their provinces. It is hoped that some year it will be possible to thus recognize every club and every chapter in the fraternity. It has not happened yet! Soaring Pigeon Awards for highest percent increases in contributions were awarded to Salinas, California (1700%) and to Nevada Alpha (1400%). Similar awards for highest dollar increases went to St. Louis, Missouri ($400) and to Nevada Alpha ($140). These evidences of renewed confidence and support are appreciated. For many years it has been a custom in annual Settlement School reports to give honorable mention to clubs contributing $150 or more, and to chapters giving $100 or more. This year, after considerable research, we would like to include the number of years since 1949 that a listed club has continuously been given such honorable mention. Total club contributions, including fire donations, received by the Settlement School Treasurer were $11,539.53. Of this amount, a slight increase, the following 17 clubs contributed over 48 percent of total alumnx club support this past year: (continuous honorable mention years are in parentheses) St. Louis (13) Kansas City (13) Pasadena (5) North Shore (5) Miami (2) Indianapolis (13) Cleveland East North Shore Jr. (4) Columbus Houston .. . Philadelphia (4) Westchester Co. (3) Arlington Heights (3) Champaign-Urbana (2) Everett (6) Northern N. Jersey (2) Sacramento (3) Total $5,579.50 We take this opportunity to say a heart-felt thank you to all clubs that give substantial support to our national philanthropy year in and year out. Many other clubs not named this year have given similar support though not continuously. Still others give to the limit of their annual in-come and we are grateful to them. It is distressing to those of us who must fight the annual "battle of the budget" that some do not carry their fair share; because some don't, others must, and we are eternally grateful for that kind of loyalty. Chapter contributions increased an amazing 25% this year! The total was a fine new high of $3,406.76. The increase of $717.67 is most welcome, as is the convention vote to permit half of the annual chapter contributions to be used for operating expenses. Chapters giving $100 and over, together with continuous years each has given this kind of support since 1949, are: Texas Alpha $ 300.00 South Dakota Alpha (2) 165.00 Nevada Alpha 150.00 $1,200.00 1,000.00 380.00 350.00 300.00 270.00 264.50 250.00 200.00 200.00 200.00 200.00 165.00 150.00 150.00 150.00 150.00 50 Texas Gamma (7) ................................ 150.00 Alabama Beta (3) . . . ............................ 100.00 Missouri Beta (12) 100.00 Nebraska Beta 100.00 Total S1,065.00 The drop in Magazine Agency Commissions, a major source of annual income, was very disheartening both at Central Office and at Settlement School, especially since the trend had been consistently upward in the prior several years. A loss of expected income in the amount of $2,150 is serious for the Settlement School, and it is most earnestly hoped that magazine sales in the current year will provide commissions which more than make up for the discouraging drop this year. Many individuals, clubs, Mothers' clubs, and chapters donated cash for special purposes and goods of various kinds to the school. These include Christmas and other holiday remembrances, clothing and various household articles, Fire Relief donations already mentioned, and special goods to the Health Center. Memorial Fund gifts came to exactly $100 this year. Many thanks are extended to each donor. Many "free purchases" were permitted through gifts of SH and TV stamps. These are always wanted and appreciated. Please continue to send them to the Director. The dollar has shrunk as much in Gatlinburg as any-where else in the country, and it is sometimes wondered if new budgets using last year's contribution figures are automatic year after year. Please let no one misunderstand. Every dollar sent is gratefully received and put to good use, but we do need more of them! In an endeavor to increase contributions, the Settlement School Commit-tee at its last meeting adopted a new contribution credit plan which will make more bookkeeping for the Treasurer but which we believe will have appeal for many individual Pi Phis. Henceforth, individual Pi Phis may make personal contributions to the Settlement School (many do!), assigning contribution credit to a favorite club or chap-ter, providing this is done at the time a check is sent. It is hoped that such two-way benefit will appeal to many members of the fraternity as they plan their personal contribution programs for the year. Many of us give automatically each year to the United Fund, the Red Cross, and many other personal favorite philanthropies. Why not consider a similar tax-deductible contribution to the Settlement School each year too? With a second benefit added (contribution credit for an alumnae club or an active chapter), we hope for increased interest in personal Pi Phi donations. Such checks should be made out to "Pi Beta Phi Settlement School" and they may be sent direct to the Settlement School Treasurer or through a club or chapter Treasurer. Contribution credit will be given only if a designation note is received with a check. The concluding Settlement School year was a very busy one for the resident staff and for the Settlement School Committee. The gratitude of the fraternity is due Director Marion Mueller for her capable handling of so many musts, all of which seemed to run concurrently for most of the year! Committee members have given marvelous cooperation to the chairman all through the year too, and all appreciate the good help and advice given so generously by our Grand Council contact member Olivia Smith Moore. We regret the conclusion of close working relationships with our excellent retiring treasurer, Zoe Saunders James; at the same time we welcome Sally Bozman Schneiter of Muncie, Indiana who has already indicated a knowledgeable and able handling of our financial concerns. We were both sad and happy for Helen Boucher Dix to be so suddenly "snatched" from our committee and so wholeheartedly "seated" in Grand Council as Grand Vice President; our best wishes go with her. We are very happy to have Sally Wild Gordon, former Pi Province President, join us in the capacity of publicity work for the committee. Lois Overstreet Summers and Eloise Glazner Hensley add desirable, capable con THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI tinuity even though they have switched jobs Lois to Secretary and Eloise to Slides Programs! It is again comforting to the chairman to have loyal, analytic Pi Phis sharing in the deliberations of this fraternity committee. Needs and Challenges The need for more dollars to balance their shrinking value has already been stated. Salaries must be paid, equipment replaced, the monthly bills met, leaks re-paired and danger spots eliminated. We must keep our several educational endeavors going for we are that kind of institution, and teachers and even minimum supplies and tools of work do cost. This dorm boy needs to earn extra money to make the senior trip with his class, and that girl needs to get her teeth fixed. At Arrowcraft, threads must be bought, and the weavers paid when they bring in their weaving. The Settlement School is a big place. Five dollars help, of course, but they don't go far. Contributions without strings are preferred, for then they may be used where the need is greatest. When a donation is over and above the needed annual income, the Director or Chairman is always happy to advise on a designated use. We see a need for more thoughtful understanding and education concerning our Settlement School. Too many Pi Phis are misinformed; too many expect the settlement, the people and the area to be the same as 25 years ago. This is one reason why committee has been so eager for a new Settlement School booklet to be placed in the hands of initiates. The pioneering days are over; they should be in fifty years! The early days were colorful and fascinating, but it is wrong to depict those days as if they existed today. A good educational program will balance the historical and the contemporary, and both kinds of presentations should be correct. Creativity in programs is fine, but not so fine when it tampers with facts or omits so much of the whole story that the result is one-sided. Above all, our own fraternity membership should be thoroughly and correctly informed. We recommend periodic use of the Settlement School Slides Programs in chapters and clubs. These are revised each year to bring information and pictures up to date. Our challenges are immediate and long-range, and both bring successes and sometimes failures. Thus it has ever been for any supervising Settlement School Committee. No one year is the same as the year before, and some planning for future growth and development is always part of every year. Unexpected bequests and out-right gifts of large sums have smoothed the way, over the years, to fulfillment of a need, a dream. They have made possible the large steps forward, and perhaps the fact that we have no reserves of this kind now is a challenge. We have a challenge at Arrowcraft to not fail our weavers in their dependency on us. We have similar charges with regard to our classes at the school, the dorm children, the Health Center, and the expanding Craft Workshop. The newest challenge of all involves possible use of the Centennial Fund for the development and expansion of Arts and Crafts training at the Settlement School. This challenge is one most definitely before the fraternity as a whole. The role of the Settlement School Committee is not yet charted and, frankly, we do not know our responsibility to the fraternity in regard to this. Until committee's part in ensuing fraternity discussions is somehow clarified, we can only "advise and consent" to a 100th year infusion of new life for the 50 year Memorial to the Founders of the Fraternity, the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School. The roots of this tree were planted deeply and in good soil. Its limbs, branches and foliage are sturdy and healthy. It has had fifty years of nourishment and care. How will it be tended in the next fifty years, and how can the present caretakers serve the members of the fraternity in making this decision? HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 51 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S' REPORT Settlement School has been so very busy celebrating a special birthday yes, a golden anniversary. First recognition was given in February by the local Pi Phi Little Pigeon Alumnx Club. In March our own Alice Mansfield, Olivia Moore, Marianne Wild, Zoe James, and Eta Province president, Pat Akers, came for the Chapel Program in Pi Beta Phi High School. This consisted of a series of seven tableaux depicting phases of the school Early School, Health Center, Arrowcraft Weaver and Designer, Dormitory Students' Introduction, Introduction of Descendants of the first two classes--1912-1913, Arts and Crafts, Music and Workshop. Immediately following the Chapel Program our national officers were guests at a Little Pigeon Alumnm Club luncheon. At Staff House honored dinner guests were members of the first two classes in 1912-1913. Even though a snowstorm caused a few last minute cancellations there was much fun reminiscing. Simultaneously to our celebration construction of a weaving studio was started. What a nice birthday present! This was a dream come true in June when Workshop opened its doors and thirty-six looms were in readiness. This building will be available throughout the year for the teaching of weaving (or other crafts) preferably by classes, sometimes individually. Dedication of the Evelyn Bishop Room the entrance lounge was well attended by old-time local citizens. Our Settlement School Committee was also here for the event. At Convention in the Mayflower Hotel Arrowcraft displayed and sold all-gold purses and bookmarks along with many other crafts. A good response was shown by Pi Phis from everywhere. This is a mutual opportunity for Club personnel, Arrowcraft and Settlement School representatives to become acquainted. The exhibit of early and contemporary Arrowcraft and Workshop weaving at the Smithsonian was a high-light indeed. Admittedly a thrill to me! Having been at the Smithsonian years ago I never dreamed of participating in any way with that institution. The exhibit was in the Rotunda in the Textile Division and not far from the corridor with the presidents' wives in their array Mrs. Calvin Coolidge wearing her Arrow and Mrs. Harry Truman with her Mother's pin. It has been a privilege to participate in such a prolonged birthday celebration, and to see another project anchored at Settlement School. Publicity continues, so many more are becoming aware of our growth. Just before our celebration started there was a very unfortunate event a fire doing damage January 11th to the extent that our boys' dormitory and office building had to be vacated. Fortunately we were able to rebuild and refurnish due to insurance. The response of Pi Phis to the emergency appeal was deeply appreciated. Insurance did not cover the losses of the boys, nor all of Mrs. Adams' who is our boys' chaperon and cook. Perhaps the golden anniversary was timely because it certainly helped us through the horrors of the fire that cold, below-zero January 11th. That is something to forget as much as possible. Our dormitory program had its share of honors students in junior and senior plays, two members of Beta Club, president of Student Council, the outstanding basketball player on boys' and girls' teams (as chosen by the Boosters' Club), and girls' basketball captain. Graduation night Ruby Wright not only received the cup for the best player on the girls' team (chosen by faculty), but the $100-scholarship (for higher education) given by the Beta Club as well as $200 for higher education by Pi Beta Phi. Ruby was a four-year dormitory girl. Two boys were nominees for the Citizenship Award. Melvin Ogle received the award as chosen by the faculty for the sophomore showing the most improvement. MO was given to Randy Trentham for higher educa Lion (tuition and/or fees) by Pi Beta Phi. Proud? Frankly yes. This is one small way of "seeing" improvement and development in our dormitory program. The senior class dedicated its yearbook, The Mountaineer, to Pi Beta Phi Fraternity. Another birthday present! Craft Workshop with the University of Tennessee has grown and this year the eighteenth summer had the largest enrollment ever. Twenty-three states were represented among our personnel. There were also two students from Pakistan. Staff agreed the spirit was very good. Each year I marvel at the beautiful crafts displayed the last night at Open House. Yes, it's really worth the effort to "come see." Two students were on Pi Phi scholarships. At Arrowcraft one realizes the important part our Clubs have in this Memorial to our Pi Beta Phi Founders. Shipping was good last year. The Little Pigeon awards at Convention are a small token of appreciation, and in reality represent the loyalty shown by many Pi Phi groups. We are mighty proud of the thirty Alumna Clubs who paid Arrowcraft more than a thousand dollars. Not to be neglected are the small Clubs. Each article sold is helping a craftsman somewhere. A heritage of talent is aptly displayed by these mountaineers. As groups learn of our Barn/Dorm (Red Barn) avail-able for workshops, religious groups, retreats, or Pi Phi chapters, more come each year. Reservations should be made far in advance for spring vacations. The Health Center has continued with a preventive program under Marjorie Chalmer's watchful eye. Each year we think will be the last for the only one-room school at the Glades in our area. Surely its days are numbered. Marjorie's resignation from Health Center is regrettable yet with twenty-seven years at Settlement School we certainly should and do wish her well in her retirement which will take effect when a replacement is made. Gene Redding, designer at Arrowcraft, is retiring when there is a replacement for her. Gene claims over twenty years at Settlement School. Yes, best wishes to Gene. Nevada Christian's resignation as Arrowcraft manager after a mere one-and-a-half years at Settlement School was untimely (comparatively speaking). Nevada's destination was her former home in California. Best wishes to Nevada and Sutton. Arlie Watson's thirty-six years as maintenance man at Settlement School certainly contributes to our high total of years of service on our staff. Arlie seemed to enjoy his first year in semi-retirement. Retirement folks from any walk of life might well apply his "psychology of living." Zanley Watson has filled in for Arlie admirably always having his tools in readiness to repair anything. Zanley also cooperates with Neal in his chores, ship-ping, at Arrowcraft, and maintenance. Quite a capable pair! Discontinuing the raising of chickens will affect Richard Watson's schedule. However, with each new building maintenance problems increase; so far, there is always plenty to do. Richard's recent encounter with a copperhead ended with first-aid, snake serum, and a stay in the hospital. Mrs. Adams' narrow escape in the January fire has not seemed to affect her noticeably. She continues planning for those boys' and girls' appetites next winter. Gallons and bushels! Gallons of jelly, bushels of beans, corn, etc., are being prepared for their inevitable consummation. Ruth Spelman's many activities as housemother belie her being a Pi Phi over fifty years. In semi-retirement, she practices a healthy philosophy. Elizabeth Rue's semi-retirement has given an opportunity for her to participate in community and social 52 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI activities. She still enjoys sellin' (and she does lots of it) at the Mountain View Hotel Arrowcraft Shop. June Cook, the youngest and last of four sisters who have been employed at Arrowcraft came after her high school graduation in May '61. Faye Cook has been at Arrowcraft four years, Nella nine, jean Hembree three years, Shirley Roberts two years. These girls compose our sales and shipping staff, Nella assisting our de-signer part time. Nadine Grooms Whitted, a descendant of one of our earliest weavers, Mary L. Owenby, has served as secretary to the director for two years quite capably. As director and part time manager of Arrowcraft Shop my year has been a full one. It is a constant struggle to be in readiness for the next project. Serving as chairman of the October Southern Highland Guild Craftsmen's Fair in Gatlinburg again in '62 leaves few idle moments. The Southern Highland Handicrafts Guild is a large organization formed in 1928 to help craftsmen find an outlet for their crafts and to raise the standards of the work. Pi Phi works with the Guild, mutually and advantageously in the craft field. I am looking forward to serving as a member of the Board of Trustees, having been elected for a three-year term. A big "thank you" is extended to all donors to Settlement School. The Christmas list is an impressive one. Pi Phis again met a challenge with the Fire Emergency Fund. A constant stream of merchandise stamps also provides blankets and even some lamps for dormitory rooms. You have not forgotten us. Thank you again. The area and town surprisingly are still developing. A County Hospital and consolidation of our high school are imminent. Financing and details are still in the embryo stage. Pi Phi provided an Arts and Crafts teacher again a Pi Phi, Margaret Struble, from Ames, Iowa. The wood-craft instruction probably will be expanded from two to three classes. A music teacher is not assigned as yet. If one is obtained music will be taught again this year. If and when the high school moves, all available guidance, I am sure, will be used in directing our paths. It is my wish that every Pi Phi could visit Settlement School at some time. An invitation is extended to each of you to come for a tour of Settlement School. In June 1961 delegates from every Chapter came for our so-called Little Convention. That made Settlement School a reality to a nucleus of our actives and alumni. Mutually the delegates were a reality to us folks at Settlement School. "The years of man are the looms of God, Let down from the place of the sun, Wherein we all are weaving, 'til the Mystic web is done." Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER Little Rock, Arkansas August 1, 1962 Mrs. Richard E. James Treasurer Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Gatlinburg, Tennessee DEAR MRS.

Pi Beta Phi has been growing too. At age 95 we are 108 chapters tall. As we put a period to the activities for 1961-62 we added five marks to our growth record for the five new chapters added to our roll since the last Convention, three of them during the current year. They are Oregon Delta, Mississippi Alpha and Beta, Tennessee Delta and Kentucky Beta. Each will add strength to the fraternity in their accomplishments on their own campuses, and will increase our membership representation throughout the United States and Canada. We claim each of them with pride. With our new chapters in Mississippi only three states remains in the continental United States without representation. They are New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New Jersey. Increased enrollments make it desirable for Administrations to invite additional fraternities to establish chapters on their campuses, and new campuses are continually being opened to national fraternities. Some in this latter category offer promise for the future. However, at the present time no commitments have been made for new chapters for the coming year. This does not mean any reduction in the number of inquiries which have come to Pi Beta Phi about its interest in extension. To be exact there have been letters from thirty-four different campuses, and in some in-stances more than one inquiry from a given campus. Of this number, twenty are from campuses which have not previously been in contact with us. In the case of some inquiries which have come late in the year they have been asked to supply more information in order that the Grand Council could fairly evaluate the opportunity for extension. Many things are taken into consideration in such evaluations, not the least of which is opinion of officers, chapters and alumna' clubs in the province. With the growth in educational facilities, and changing populations, the colleges themselves change. Pi Beta Phi must consider these changes so that decisions are made in thebest interest of the fraternity. Other fraternities are placing new chapters each year. There have been 59 new women's chapters this year, 81 last year for a total of 140. since our last convention. We make no attempt to "keep up with the Joneses" but we must keep in mind the fact that each new chapter helps the older chapters by its coverage in membership in communities in which they also have an interest. Those thirty-four campuses interested in affiliation with Pi Beta Phi are as follows: Ferris Institute, Big Rapids, Michigan; University of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri; University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island; Lenoir Rhyne College, Hickory, North Carolina; Moorhead State College, Moorhead, Minnesota; Bryant College, Johnston, Rhode Island; Norfolk College of William and Mary, Norfolk, Virginia; Florence Branch, University of South Carolina, Florence, South Carolina; Alma College, Alma, Michigan; Eastern New Mexico University, Portales, New Mexico; Los Angeles State College, Los Angeles, California; Wittenberg University, Spring-field, Ohio; Stephen F. Austin St. College, Nacogdoches, Texas; Arizona State College, Flagstaff, Arizona; University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Transylvania College, Lexington, Kentucky; Southeast-ern Louisiana College, Hammond, Louisiana; Pennsylvania State College, East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania; College of Steubenville, Steubenville, Ohio; C. W. Post College of L.I. University, Brookville, New York; Alfred University, Alfred, New York and Rochester, New York; Illinois Wesleyan, Bloomington, Illinois; New Bedford Tech., Fairhaven, Massachusetts; San Fernando Valley State College, Northridge, California; Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Mankato State College, Mankato, Minnesota; University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida; Georgia State College, Atlanta, Georgia; Little Rock University, Little Rock, Arkansas; Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois. MARIANNE REID WILD NPC Delegate and Chairman of Extension HOLT HOUSE COMMITTEE In 1960-61 only eight chapters and twenty-seven clubs failed to contribute to Holt House. We've never had 100%, but we're hoping this may be the year ! At this writing it's too soon to know, but Jo Boydstun, our treasurer reports that contributions are ahead of last year, and May is always the biggest month, so we're keeping cur fingers crossed. We don't have as impressive a list of accomplishments this year as we did last, but sometimes after a big "splurge" you have to "coast" a bit. We had hoped to have a long range plan of redecorating and restoration set up and begun, but due to personal and family illness of our key member in this, Eleanor Miller, interior decorator with L. S. Ayres in Indianapolis, we were not able to get underway. We had set 1967, our centennial year as the year to have Holt House completely refurbished, so there is still time. Just keep those contributions coming. In August the house received two coats of white paint. Fresh paint does so much in the way of "face lifting." The powder room has a new vinyl floor and sparkling new curtains. The kitchen is proving its worth in added space and efficiency. A new formica topped table with matching chairs is a big improvement overthe old white porcelain table and worn chairs that had given us yeoman's service for so long. We hope to add to our supply of dishes, but had had difficulty in obtaining the present "Rose Point" pattern. If we can't get it, it will be necessary to start with another pattern. We are pleased that Holt House continues to be such an integral part of the "goings on" in Monmouth. It was used for 132 functions from May 1961 through April 1962, of which only twenty-five were Pi Phi. Several clubs use it for all their meetings and most months show a goodly number of showers, teas, and receptions. We have purposely kept the fees low, as we feel Holt House rep-resents the fraternity, and by making it available to the community for a small fee, we are spreading good will for Pi Phi. Through its warmth and charm one gets the feel of being in a lovely old home which is truly the case. Shirley Mann reports the slides were viewed by 37 groups. This is more than a 100% increase over last year. We are very pleased with the added interest, as we feel the best means of getting acquainted with Holt House is through the slides. A Holt House program is most interesting and informative, so why not schedule one for 55
