"Is the thread dyed by the mountaineers with native herbs ?" "Where did they get such lovely, soft, and unusual color combinations ?" these and many similar questions met the hostesses from the Dallas Alumnae Club at every turn, as they explained to visitors just what the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School was, and how the lovely articles, which were now so beautifully arranged in this large exhibit room at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, were made under Pi Phi's supervision and sold through Arrowcraft. An invitation extended by Jerry By-waters, Art Director of the Museum, to hold this exhibition was enthusiastically accepted by the Settlement School Committee, Arrowcraft, and the Dallas Alumnae Club. Under the leadership of Delia Hines Stephens, and Mary McLarry Bywaters, co-chairmen, both Texas B, a committee hung the walls with bright coverlets, soft-colored shawls, lovely woolen goods, Aunt Lizzie's jean cloth, and specially designed wall hangings. Towels, purses, ties, carved wooden animals and metal ware in two glass cases held the interest of children and adults, alike. And the artistic photographs of Dorothy MacLean, of Gatlinburg, hung at eye-level, gave an intimate picture of the men and women who had made this unusual handicraft. Opening Sunday, March 14, a large audience gathered in the Museum auditorium to see moving pictures taken last summer at the School, and to hear Ula Milner Gregory, Louisiana A, give a most interesting commentary. This "double feature" was again enjoyed the following Friday when the alumnae club entertained as guests representatives from the college and city Panhellenic groups, members of Texas Beta chapter and their mothers. Tea was served by Daisy Wallace Steineger, Missouri I', and her committee from a table on which "ma" and "pappy" dolls from the Smokies sat in Arrowcraft doll-chairs on a hand-woven runner. Each Sunday afternoon during the month's exhibit, members of the alumnae club served as hostesses in the exhibit room, and the films were shown in the auditorium to interested museum visitors. That some were also buyers was most welcome; but the significant fact was that Arrowcraft articles were acknowledged by the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts and the visitors as a worthy exponent of the finest in art and handicraft. rooks Memorial Art Gallery, Memphis, Tenn. In another city, Arrowcraft came into its own as an example of artistic handicraft. At Memphis, Tennessee, Mrs. Louise B. Clark, Director of the Brooks Memorial Art Gallery, in the largest gallery, held a month's exhibit of Arrowcraft, articles from Pendleton, and Bra.sstown. La Delle Allen Mitchell, Arkansas A, for many years Director of Arrowcraft, assisted with the selection and arrangement for Pi Beta. Phi. With coverlets and woven rugs hanging on the walls baskets and brooms arranged on either side of the attractive fireplace tables covered with towels, purses, knitting bags ; two step-ladder exhibits of shawls and luncheon sets; with tables of pewter and metalware at one end of the hall, and of large wooden carved animals at the other end this exhibit brought nine hundred admirers to see it on Opening Day. Sales have been so numerous that three re-orders of Arrowcraft articles have already been made. The Arrow at Gatlinburg The golden arrow of Pi Beta Phi is well-known to the students at the Settlement School, as many of the teachers, now and in the past; have worn it. These members of our fraternity have recognized their un 413 414 THE MAY ARROW Pi Phis at Gatlinburg Upper left: Elizabeth Peck, Director. Upper righ,t: Ethel Snozo, Arrowcraft Director.

The camera has caught glimpses of these Pi Phis at Gatlinburg. Coming up the walk is Director Elizabeth Comstock Peck, California Beta. Two years ago she was an important member of a St. Louis advertising company, when Marie Hagee, former Settle THE MAX ARROW 415 ment School Chairman, called her to head the staff of the Settlement School. In her new position, Mrs. Peck is winning and holding for Pi Beta Phi, the friendship of the community, as well as keeping the many intricate details of the huge system in order, although war conditions there, as in any other educational institution, cause serious problems. And there by the vine-covered trellis at Arrowcraft Shop is Ethel Weaver Snow, Iowa Director of Arrowcraft. She journeyed from Mexico to Alaska with her mining engineer husband, and while in Butte, Mont., became interested in weaving under Mary Meggs Atwater. This interest brought her seven years ago to Gatlinburg where her knowledge of handicraft plus a very fine business ability has made Arrow-craft profits increase steadily each year. Mrs. Snow is President of the Little Pigeon Alumnx Club, to which some fourteen Pi Beta Phi members belong. This year at Gatlinburg we find four wearers of the Arrow among the grade school teachers: Mary Hayward, Arizona A ; Marilyn Abel, South Dakota A; Flora Belle De Witt Poore, Colorado A ; and Pauline Whaley Huff, Illinois A. Mary Hayward is adored by her fourth graders for her ability to lead their singing and for her Girl Scout leadership; her attractive smile makes for popularity with everyone on the staff . An accomplished musician, Mary is in demand for many school and community entertainments. Attractive Marilyn Abel can compete in almost any kind of sport, snowballing included, and came back this fall tanned from a summer sailing, surf-boarding and aqua-planing at Lake Okoboji, Iowa. She also likes to bowl, and leisure hours find her at the alleys in Gatlinburg. A collection of large carved rings vies for her attention with her class of first and second grade children. Flora Belle Poore was Miss De Witt when she came to Gatlinburg two and a half years ago, to teach sixth grade. This fall she married John Poore, Arts and Crafts teacher at the School, and added to her teaching duties the keeping of an attractive home on Holly Ridge, overlooking the school grounds. Being a clever person, Flora Belle capably handles both jobs, and even maintains her fine sense of humor. Pauline Whaley Huff returned to the staff this year after an absence of several years, to take the place left vacant when Doris Hatch, another Pi Phi, returned home because of her mother's illness. Pauline was a teacher at the Settlement School when she married jack Huff in a ceremony on top of' Mt. Le Conte, where they now operate a summer lodge. Mrs. Huff has taught a small pre-school group in her home for companionship for her son, Philip. She, too, demonstrates a wonderful ability to get things done by keeping house, teaching, and being expert at both. These members are not the only ones who may benefit from this heart-warming service at Gatlinburg. Any Pi Beta Phi who can qualify as a teacher in the grade or high school is urged to make application for next year. With an acute teacher shortage in all rural communities, Gatlinburg is no exception, making more places available for Pi Phi members. As Elizabeth Peck has written, "To all of you who are thinking of. teaching, the school offers `new horizons.' You will find it a School with all the atmosphere and charm of a country school but with city school standards. You will make new Pi Phi friends, have a new and interesting experience, and enjoy teaching here as every Pi Phi has enjoyed it, who has ever taught at the school. "Salaries are adequate and living expenses are low and there are plenty of out-side activities, horse back riding, hiking, bowling, Arts and Crafts classes, and Red Cross work." To teach in the elementary school, the applicant must be a graduate of a standard college, must have twenty quarter hours in Education and if possible, practice teaching in an elementary school. High school teachers must be graduates of a standard college, must have completed twenty-seven quarter hours in Education-, and must have at least eighteen quarter hours in the subject to be taught. Remember that while it is absolutely necessary that we assist in winning this war, it is also essential that we hold fast to the principles for which we are fighting. Education for all must continue to be an American goal. If you have educated yourself to be a teacher, do not throw away your training for a position which requires less of you than your best!
