In her old fashioned dress, she presented a picture that will linger in the memories of all who were at the banquet. Gretchen Swayze, Washington r, History of the College of THE College of Puget Sound was first incorporated as the Puget Sound University on March 17, 1888, upon the application of the Puget Sound Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Its academic organization was changed from that of a university to that of a college of liberal arts in 1914. In 1927, it became strictly a four year liberal arts college. Its work has received the highest accreditation from the various ac-crediting organizations and it has been on the approved list .of the Association of American Universities since 1932. The campus comprises 60 acres in the heart of the finest residential district in Tacoma and commands a view of majestic Mount Rainier. There are ten buildings on the campus. Work lit 12 candles to honor the women who organized the sorority that we all love so dearly. As a finality to a memorable evening, the entire group sang the "Loving Cup" song. Friday morning, newly initiated members gathered in the chapter room with a shining new name plate on the door. Miss Onken in-stalled the new officers. The first chapter meeting followed. Invitations were issued to 750 friends and relatives of the newly installed chapter to a formal reception Friday evening. The affair was held in the reception rooms of Anderson Hall. Martha Wright, Gloria Nelson and Mrs. Paul Kirk were reception chairmen. Janice Ludwig, talented harpist in the chapter, played for the guests. Wine carnations were prominent in the floral decorations. In addition to visiting Pi Phi notables, Dr. R. Franklin Thompson, president of the college, Mrs. Thompson and Martha Wright, chapter president, were in the receiving line. Outstanding Thetas to be initiated into the new alumnae club were Mrs. Leonard Brown, daughter of Inez Smith Soule, one of the Pi Phi founders, Mrs. R. Franklin Thompson, wife of the college president, Mrs. Lyle Ford Drushel, dean of women, and Mrs. Dix Rowland, founder of K 0,, the local sorority. After a week of remarkable sunny weather, our visitors left the campus of the College of Puget Sound. They left behind them the first chapter of Washington 'Gamma's book of memories a book that is fast becoming one filled with high aspirations and loyalty to Pi Beta Phi. HELEN DAVIDSON, Washington B ROSE CARBONE, Washington r Puget Sound on a field house, new music building and the president's home have been started. This summer a ski lodge at Mount Rainier was obtained for the exclusive use of the college students. College attendance has hit the 2,000 mark. The college is the largest privately endowed institution of higher learning in the Northwest. The are two national fraternities, K and N on the campus. The other three men's groups are making plans to go national in the future. Pi Beta Phi is the only national women's group on the campus. There are three local sororities. The College of Puget Sound campus features the Gothic type of structure in all its buildings. It is the rambling castle of the northwest "Its guardian is the mountain beside the silver sea." Tennessee Gamma Installation ON MAY 15, 1948, the dream of sixteen girls and the members of the Knoxville-Little Pigeon Alumnae Club became a reality when II .13 r at the University of Tennessee was installed as Tennessee r of Pi Beta Phi. The dream began in the summer of 1947 when the alumni clubs of Knoxville and Little Pigeon laid plans whereby Pi Beta Phi's 93rd chapter would be chartered on the University of Tennessee campus. A very successful rushing season was conducted in competition with all the other national women's fraternities, and on October 6, pledging was held. Then began the enthusiastic work of the new members of II ' r with ther special supervisor, Peg Ward, Indiana E, and three other Pi Beta Phis on the campus, Julia Hildebrandt, D.C. A, Carroll Thompson, Tennessee A, and Charlotte Townsend Owen, Arkansas A, toward their goal of a chapter of Pi Beta Phi. The culmination of this dream took place last May 14 and 15 in Knoxville, for on those days pledging and initiation of sixteen girls into Pi Beta Phi were held. After pledging on Friday, May 14, a buffet supper-cooky-shine was given by the Knoxville-Little Pigeon Alumnae in the lovely home of Mrs. John Oliver in Holston Hills. Each new pledge read an original tribute to Pi Beta Phi and sang a song with original lyrics about Pi Beta Phi. Mrs. Frank E. Williams, Epsilon Province President, read to the girls from the Pi Beta Phi Constitution during the evening, and a discussion was held. The Delta Gamma chapter gave a special luncheon at noon Friday in the Delta Gamma room for the official Pi Beta Phi visitors.

(Picture taken May 14, 1948, at buffet supper-cooky-shine after formal pledging.) Saturday noon, May 15, the X S2 actives and alumni gave a luncheon for all out-of-town Pi Beta Phi visitors in the X SZ room in the Panhellenic Building. That afternoon the sixteen charter members of II IT were initiated and installed as charter members of Tennessee IT of Pi Beta Phi. Mrs. Robert S. Wild, Grand Vice-president, was the installing officer, and she was assisted by Mrs. Frank E. Williams, Epsilon Province President, and Mrs. John M. Foster, Epsilon Province Vice-president. Pi Phis from Chattanooga and Nashville were also on hand to witness the birth of the Fraternity's 93rd chapter. Miss L( lie Milligan, Tennessee A, and Miss Betty Ruble, Tennessee B, were the official representatives from their chapters. Following initiation and installation, a banquet was held in the Farragut Hotel in Knoxville. Miss Ruth Dyer of the Settlement School in Gatlinburg was toastmistress, and the theme of the program revolved around the "Pi Beta Phi Symphony." The program included inspirational talks by Mrs. Wild, Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Foster, Mrs. H. H. Everett, Knoxville alumnae, Jean DeVault, Tennessee r, and Peg Ward, Indiana E. Several lovely gifts to the chapter were opened and many telegrams and letters of congratulations were read. Gardenia corsages worn by all the Pi Phis at the banquet were gifts of Mrs. James E. Lindley, Zeta Province Vice-president. Joan Edington was awarded a special recognition pin for being the "outstanding pledge," and Martha Parks was given the scholarship ring for the greatest improvement in grades during the year. The Oak Ridge Alumnae presented a gavel guard to Peg Ward for her year as president of the chapter. The program was concluded with the singing of the Loving Cup Song. Sunday morning a model chapter meeting was held in the Pi Beta Phi room with Mrs. Wild presiding. The Pi Phis then attended the First Presbyterian Church in a group. In the after-noon a formal reception for the faculty, ad-ministration, student body, and friends was held in the beautiful X A E fraternity house. Thus, the ceremonies for the installation of Tennessee IT were concluded, but the joy and work in building Tennessee IT into one of the strongest links in the chain of Pi Beta Phi chapters has just begun ; and all of those connected with Tennessee r look forward to a great future in Pi Beta Phi. HISTORIC University of Tennessee, founded in 1794, is a fitting background for the new chapter. The University is fully accredited, and its student body is drawn from all over the South, by its various colleges, Liberal Arts, Engineering, Agriculture, and its Graduate School, all at Knoxville, and its Medical and Dental Schools, at Nashville. Co-operation between the University and the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School has long been close, with of late years a definite link in the University's support of the Summer Work Shop at the School, and the granting of credits toward a degree for properly accredited work done at Gatlinburg. The character. of its student body makes it a fittingly strong home for a chapter of Pi Beta Phi, and the new group there will have support from the entire Southern region.
