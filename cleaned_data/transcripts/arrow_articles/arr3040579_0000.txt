        578 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI the principal reasons which occur to me are: First, that the girl is at the age where she naturally dwells in generalities. She feeds herself upon idealities which, however beautiful and necessary to her development, are not apt to be practical. It is a pity the modern girl cannot go through that period and work out her specific needs from her generalizations! The hard facts are quite the contrary. She is, in the great majority of cases, crowding into four short years all the opportunities of a lifetime for getting definite training unless she is unusual enough to train herself. Second, the girl's family either by environment or education, does not recognize the need of making a girl's work an expression of herself. "Teaching is a lady-like profession, therefore, it is best that Ruth teach" or "I always wanted to paint, so, Jane shall learn painting" or kindred remarks are frequently made by mothers. Third, the college and university faculties either take the (1wstion too much as a matter of course or, granting they are conscious of the need, the greater number of students and their complicated duties, render them inadequate to cope with the situation. So the problem falls back upon the individual. So much is said about work being really a pleasure and about woman's work, etc. but how many college women give anything to society outside of their general intellectual influence? You will agree with me, I am sure, when I say that the great majority of college graduates have valuable capabilities, if only they were centralized enough to be effective. How true it is that our measure of greatness depends upon our usefulness. We must earn our living or we become drags on society no matter what our environment. How many women find themselves past the place where they can get definite training for any sort of paying work (work that pays either them or society) and . feel either a need or a craving for such work and an inherent conviction of their own capabilities, if only they had grasped the opportunity when it was theirs! I am a firm believer in everyone working out a profession which expresses his own individuality, and I am equally certain that this is a practical theory. At the same time I realize that the college girl cannot decide always just what would fit her personal needs. Unfortunately, everyone's nature doesn't call them to some definite line law, medicine, art, music, etc., but let each girl face the prob NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 579 lem, when she enters the university, and if she can't decide just what she needs and wants let her determine to study along some one line and learn it so in after years she will have something to work on; then' she will be independent and can earn her personal freedom. Marriage is not a solution of the problem as college girls, consciously or unconsciously, are so prone to generalize. A woman is no less an individual after marriage than before and no more apt to be satisfied intellectually with the routine of domestic drudgery. And she is no less perfect a wife and mother because she has a definite interest in life quite the contrary. A family of children satisfies this craving in women for a few years, but even then there comes the time when the children are away, married or otherwise independent, and then the need is most insistent ; for few women ha;ve the incentive in middle life to take up a purposeful work. I have seen women who have outgrown the taste for purely social interests of this age become prematurely old for lack of something definite and important to turn their thoughts from too much introspection. And the woman at this period has often just reached the point in a purposeful work where her rewards are most fruitful. The time to lay this foundation is in high school and college. Let the girl entering college look about her and even there she will see that it is the student with a real. aim, a definite purpose, who does the best work and carries away from college the most valuable gains. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON All's quiet along the Little Pigeon again. School has closed, three of the teachers have gone, and the new school house is completed. The last is now of first interest to us all. The building stands on gently rising ground, with Baskin's Creek, our western boundary, on one side, and the Little Pigeon River, several hundred yards to the northeast, in, front. The hills rise at the east, our own II (I) hill, and at the south beyond a stretch of cornfield. The building 'is 60 x 84. It is a one story and partial basement, six room frame structure, which, with its rather low, projecting roof, resembles a bungalow. The main entrance is from a porch into a large _hall, from which five class rooms open, one on each side, and Four of our school girls with Christmas dolls and new aprons they made themselves. Group of our school boys (1913-14). Some of these boys have come from a long distance to attend our school. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 581 three in the rear. The hall will be used as a reading and rest room, we hope, by the mountaineers as they come to the village store from their distant cabins. Its salient feature is the large fireplace opposite the entrance. The two class rooms on the sides are small, the three at the rear are much larger, two being 30 x 30 and the other, the middle one, 30 x 24. The three are separated by sliding partitions, which will permit of the three rooms being thrown into one large room. This we hope to make the social center of the community until we can build a real settlement house. The building will have a furnace, and will be equipped during the summer. After school had closed for the official year, Miss Pollard stayed. on, to rest, she said. Her resting has consisted in visiting our friends and in teaching twenty or more boys and girls who needed individual instruction. She wrote concerning one of her visits: "This morning (Sunday), three of the girls and I walked up Mill Creek to the church there. After church we went home with one of our pupils. The preacher was there, too. It was town talk last fall that he was so angry at 'us that he offered to fight one of our best friends. I had forgotten all about it, and never con. nected it with the preacher of to-day. So we sat at the table and discussed Moody and Sunday schools and sermons and mission churches and all sorts of things; and then we went out and looked at the onions and the flowers, and I offered to send them some suggestions for keeping worms out of apple trees. When I left, he held out his hand and said, `You have converted your worst enemy in town to-day; you needn't be afraid of any one else; I shall be your friend hereafter.' I really felt as though I had done a good day's work without knowing anything about it." All the teachers have done so many good days' work that, as the fiscal year of the committee ends, its members wish to express their appreciation to them. The committee also wishes to commend the school and its welfare to the fraternity at large during the summer, hoping that every II B I who is interested will see that every sister whom she meets during the summer who is not interested becomes so before she leaves her.
