        ~ew6 FROM LITTLE PIGEON Edited by Louise Wheelock Dobler, Washington Beta ONE of your Pi Phi dreams is coming true ! You are going to visit the Settlement Elool! May we be your guide, or give you me travel information that may help you to joy your visit to the fullest ? Of course you arrive by car or bus, for the arest railroad terminus is in Sevierville Dugh if you are travelling by rail you leave ur train in Knoxville which is 39 miles to the irthwest. As you approach this once-sprawling mmunity along the highway, you are amazed see how "developed" it has become. Either le of the roadway is lined with motor courts and small shops the kind that are indigenous to a resort town. For Gatlinburg today is the gateway to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park with scores of hotel, motel, court, and inn accommodations for the two and one-half mil-lion annual visitors to this most popular of the national parks. The myriad of neon signs may be a surprise to you. They reflect local enter-prise which, lacking local industries, has sought to capitalize on their very advantageous tourist location. Looking straight ahead as you arrive on the road from Knoxville, a state road which is con PI BETA Pt-l1 1 11 LL.MAP SHOWING PR.oPaRTY OF Pt BETA PHI SETTLE?-ICIT SCHOOL GAT LtN13UCiGTENN.eSSEE 1-Arrow Craft Shop 2-Jennie Nicol Health Center 3-Emma Harper Turner Craft Center 4-Pi Beta Phi High School 5-Pi Beta Phi Grade School 6-County Grade School 7-Helmick House (Teachers' Cottage) 8-Pollard Dorm 9-Stuart Cottage 10-Maintenance Man's House 11-Original Log Cabin 12-Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House 13-Barn 14-Carport 232 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 233 tained by Little Pigeon River on one side and a high rock bluff behind the shops on the other (until the bluff is blasted away to make room for more shops and lodgings !) you see an expanse of green lawn rolling toward the wooded hill ahead. Just below the tree line, and set far back from the road on the crest of the knoll, is a pretentious shake dwelling that is often mistaken for a guest lodge of the Mountain View Hotel! You see the Hotel on your left as the street at the light intersection follows a slight curve to the right. The attractive house you first spotted is your newest addition to Pi Phi holdings in Gatlinburg The Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House where, for a reasonable fee, our staff and teachers live. This is a great aid in securing and holding personnel for living expenses are high in a resort town, and the Tennessee wage scale for teachers is not so high as in some states. During the Summer Craft Work-shop, sponsored jointly by ,Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee, the students and staff have their meals in the large sunny dining room. As you pass the Staff House, you must be on your guard in the fast-moving traffic to spot the first sign near the street on the lawn which marks our property. After you proceed with the traffic for about a block as it travels the only highway through the "burg," you see on your left another expanse of green lawn and again your eye must be quick to see the sign of the Jennie Nicol Health Center, for unlike practically every other sign in the town, those of Pi Phi are not of the expensively-prohibitive neon or electric variety, and so are not so easy to spot. But there, very close to the street, is the modest, simple, grey shake structure a symbol of first aid, well babies, medical care, and health education. By this time you have applied your brakes and are ready to stop just before you come to the concrete bridge which spans Baskin's Creek. On your left is the very attractive fieldstone and shake Arrow Craft Shop where you make your first call, sign the Pi Phi guest book, see the figurines of the Founders which were presented by the Northern New Jersey Alumnae Club at the Miami Convention, and purchase faultless weaving and other handcraft. Be sure to tell Mrs. Rue, the new Arrow Craft manager, or one of the girls, that you would like to visit our school and buildings. You can do all this if you arrive during shop hours which are from 8 to 5 week-days. On Sundays or in the evenings the place to call is at the Staff House, which can be reached from the main street via the steps from the city sidewalk, thence along the stone walk across the expanse of lawn at the edge of ourproperty and hedge farthest from the Mountain View Hotel. By car you must follow "Pi Phi Lane" which is reached from the main street and runs between the business block which houses the theatre and our Health Center. The "lane" runs between "Teachers' Cottage" and the newest County brick grade school building, turns to the left and goes behind Pollard and Stuart Cottages. During the winter Stuart Cottage is the dormitory for girls living too far from the school bus route to attend high school. For $5 per month, plus after-school chores, these young people have the opportunity to finish their schooling while receiving valuable supervised training. The Assistant to the Director serves as house mother for the girls. In the summer Stuart and Pollard Cottages are used to house the Workshop students. The "lane" finally brings you to the parking area at the rear of Staff House. Should you arrive in Gatlinburg from Ashville, you drive through the park before you arrive in town, and find the first border of our Pi Phi property is Baskin's Creek immediately across from the Baptist Church which is on your right near the center of the town. There also on your right, and bordered by the creek, is our Arrow Craft Shop. During shop hours the folks at Arrow Craft will direct you to the walk that runs between the shop and Health Center, across the school play ground and up to "Teacher's" cottage the office of our Director, Mrs. Marion Mueller and her assistant, Nancy Jo Hayes. "Teacher's" really began as Helmick House, so named for one of the early committee chairmen when it was built in 1916 to provide living space for the teachers and an office for the Director. Since the new Staff House has come into being, Teacher's contains the Director's office, serves as housing for Workshop teachers in the summer, and as a dormitory for boys and their advisor in the winter. Should your visit occur during the Craft Workshop, you will find the original grade school, a white frame structure erected by Pi Phi in 1913-14, converted into a makeshift woman's dormitory for those attending the special session. This white frame building stands between the brick grade school which the county built on land donated by Pi Phi, and our high school. The little building between the high school and Arrow Craft Shop is the Emma Harper Turner Craft Center where woodworking and craft are taught in the winter, and the Workshop students use it in summer. Please keep in mind that in 1949 the Fraternity entered into a lease agreement with the county. The 234 THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI terms of that provided for the use of our two buildings for the very nominal sum of $1 per year, and the County in turn was to maintain and be responsible for the upkeep of the property. Sevier County is a poor one and its standards of upkeep do not always coincide with ours. However the committee feels that since the responsibility has been assumed by the County, it is up to us to encourage them to live up to the agreement. With Mrs. Mueller or one of her staff as your guide, you will see the pleasant surroundings for the girls who are boarding students at Stuart, visit the very attractive Staff House, and see the little log cabin that is an early landmark of our original property, our garden and farm. One experience that we covet for you is to meet Arlie Watson, our head maintenance man who haslong been watching over Pi Phi interests in Gatlinburg. Arlie and his wife live in the house that was used for many years as our health center. If you wish to visit any other type of craft shop such as those dealing in basketry, wood-work, or pottery, Mrs. Mueller can direct you to the most interesting ones. She can also recommend the best eating and over-nite lodging places, and point out the scenic and travel places of interest. We hope these few ideas of what to expect and how to find them will add greatly to an experience that will give you continued pride and added interest in one of the greatest of fraternity philanthropic endeavors, a first love of thousands of Pi Phis. 4 Spiritual Va Lei in ffJraterniij 1Vernerip By the Rev. Roy Ewing Vale, D.D., LL.D., Father of Dorothy Vale Kissinger, Wisconsin B, and Marjorie Vale Wilson, Virginia A-Indiana B Minister of The Tabernacle Presbyterian Church of Indianapolis Former Moderator of The Presbyterian Church in The United States of America -* WHAT, then, are the spiritual values of fraternity membership? 1. A Set of Precise Standards Many of us begin school with a somewhat vague idea that one should be decent. Most fraternity organizations sharpen one's ideals by clear and precise definition. Intellectually, socially, and in inner purpose we are pulled up to a clearer pattern. 2. Association With The Disliked It is human nature to avoid people we do not like. But fraternity organization requires that we associate with both the beloved and the disliked, which is very good for us. 3. Responsibility for Others Anyone who really enters into fraternity life shortly discovers an intermeshing of minds, hearts and purposes which really means, "All for one, and one for all." Every reader of these lines, with thoughtful experience, knows that this sense of duty to others makes life far richer.The Sense of Belonging One may, by testimony of various alumni and alumnae, be graduated from a famous school but later have only a quite general sense of "be-longing" in the institution. But in fraternal membership that same graduate has the distinct feeling: "This is my dwelling place. Here, even though personnel changes here, I always be-long." It is a radiant conviction. 4. A Heart For The Outsider It is possible to be snobbish toward members of other fraternal organizations or toward the "Independents." Snobbery, of course, reveals one's own poor stature of soul. But a true fraternity experience should make one more careful to respect the dignity of human personality everywhere. And it should stimulate us so to deal with the Outsider that his or her own self respect will be preserved, and even enhanced.

H.), Secretary, Holt House Committee -~ NOT THAT I've seen a ghost at Holt House. Dear me, no ! After all, we want our Mrs. Johnson to stay on there and look after things for us, and all this talk of ghosts might be a trifle upsetting. So I'll say again: I've never seen a ghost at Holt House. But in the next breath I'll add: not yet. I have been to Holt House only twice, meeting with the Holt House Committee and exploring every nook and cranny of the place to see where repairs should be made; observing every aspect of the hostess' careful housekeeping; planning with others of the committee some improvements for the future. And never a ghost has interrupted a committee meeting. But I have hopes! An old house sort of needs a friendly ghost. And today a ghost would find Holt House such a pleasant, busy place to be. Every month Holt House has its share of parties, for townsfolk increasingly recognize the house as a gracious center for civic and social activities. No doubt little Mrs. Holt, from her vantage point on the dining room wall, must look down on these scenes with real pleasure, rejoicing that her home is again a place of light-hearted fun. Perhaps, late at night, she some-times steps out of the big picture frame, places her child on the horsehair sofa, and shyly dances a waltz or two with the dapper Major! And Susan Holt the daughter who at last lived alone in the old house she would make an interesting ghost. How glad she must be to have company now! Pi Phi initiations, cooky-shines, visitors from far and near, club and committee meetings, bridge parties, receptions Susan Holt never dreamed that the house that at one time all but tumbled down around her would come so to life again. But the dearest ghosts the ones I'm very sure are always close at hand are the lively spirits of the twelve Founders. There are Ada Bruen and Libbie Brook, who as students and close friends at Monmouth College obtained a room in the home of Major Holt. There are the ten other girls, who with Ada and Libbie met from time to time in the little southwest bedroom after that memorable first meeting on an April day in 1867. Do you suppose that sometimes at Holt Housethese gentle spirits creep out upon the up landing, spreading their wide skirts around as they sit on the floor beside the stairway they lean forward, ears turned toward the Room, where Maurine Cook, chairman o Holt House Committee, is efficiently oud the major needs of the house? Imagine the looks of surprise on the g faces of the Founders when members o committee exclaim over the beautifully pointed Pi Phi chapter room which they just seen in the new Panhellenic House in : mouth. Why, the only rival of I. C. Soros. quite some time, the girls remember, wa "A," or Alpha, Society. What startling ch have come about ! Or perhaps Maurine is showing the come the handsome etching of Holt House mac Mr. and Mrs. Leon Pescherett, and comr members are asking for extra copies to s4 other alumnae. "I'd like to tell them the really hasn't changed much," says Whitenack to Margaret Campbell. "You'c tainly never think the place was over a hur years old." When Maurine announces that gifts fo house are still coming in, Emma Browl eyes sparkle. To think that she helped sta of this! Again the girls listen with rap proval as they hear that the hostess' room be redecorated immediately. They, better most people, know what a modest and coc tive hostess Mrs. Johnson has always been. The next tidbit from the Pine Room, t new bookcase is to be purchased for the flow of books by Pi Phi authors, is received astonished delight. Nancy Black whispr Rosa Moore that she just hopes some of the books penned by ,Pi Phi will be what the "best-sellers." But the girls are sure they haven't aright when the chairman tells the memb the committee that the Holt House AC should be brought up to date by insertic recent revisions, among them the change house smoking rules.
