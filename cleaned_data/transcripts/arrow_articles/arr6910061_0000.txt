Only a new' birth of the understanding of the true nature of our freedom can save us. Settlernent School Reports CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE pI BETA PHI is celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the Settlement School this year. That is sufficient years to prove the worth of an undertaking and it has stood the test. The foundation of every state is said to be the education of its youth. The state of Tennessee, however, was slow to start and in 1912 could do little if anything when we started our project there. It still does not equal in scope that done by the majority of other states. However, it is now giving increased aid to all schools and the diversion of the sales tax money into school building funds has made possible improvements in housing. Yet it is significant that the County Superintendent of Schools feels a continued need for the assistance of Pi Beta Phi in meeting the requirements for a Class A school in Gatlinburg. In contrast to beginning days poor roads, small inadequate cabins, lack of hygiene, inadequate water sources, we find today that better highways, tourist travel to the national park, the influence of the radio, the arrival of a money-making people, all these are modernizing what once was the home of descendants of the first Gaelic people who settled in the Smokies. In spite of the influx of new social forces one still may talk to the straightforward, unassuming mountaineer and hear the Elizabethan expressions found no-where else. At our school gather the grandchildren of these fine people and the children of newcomers who do not always understand the old traditions. Forty years ago, education in Gatlinburg consisted of two or three months of simple schooling; Pi Beta Phi changed this to a six and then a nine month term but with one teacher carrying the burden of teaching all ages. To quote Shakespeare: "To climb steep hills requires slow pace at first." So step by step through the years, the attendance grew, other grades were added until finally the system included all elementary grades and a full high school course. Then came the gradual relinquishing of our responsibilities., allowing the county to take over more and more of the ad-ministration and the cost of the school. The leasing of our school buildings for a token fee, the erection of the new grade school unit by the County two years ago, the cost of maintaining the school and paying all teachers' salaries but four, all these are signs of change. Today, in the Pi Beta Phi School, the fraternity interests are confined to three subjects;Physical Education, Music, and Arts and Crafts, including Woodworking and these salaries are paid by Pi Beta Phi. The over-all program in Physical Education, en). bracing many forms of sport seems closely linked with our Health program and therefore of special importance. Mr. Hartford Granitz, graduate of the University of Chattanooga, has given all students well rounded courses in sports, particularly emphasizing intra-murals for the sake of sportsmanship. Our teams received awards this year for good sportsmanship, in addition \ to winning ,games. While basketball is the main competitive sport, Mr. Granitz has also assisted in football coaching. We regret that he will not return for a third year with us but he has gone to a much higher salaried position in Georgia. Mr. Carl Huskey has again given part time to instructing in Woodworking and his boys have turned out some commendable products during the year. Teaching and working both have been simplified bythe new lathe and motor purchased last summel The Arts and Crafts Department has been i hands of three teachers during the past year. January 1, Miss Dorothy Deiss, with a Master's c and with exceptional. talent, gave more than full to her work. It was difficult for her to see that ing all students to art, whether they were taleni not, could mean a development in appreciatior she was of tremendous help to those with skill a those staging school productions. Following Miss Deiss' departure, Mrs. Hadle wife of one of the Park staff, most ably subst. until .the graduation of Ann Smith from the Uni' of Tennessee in March. Ann is already makin, place in school and community and will continue us next year. Her approach to students makes wish to produce results. Mrs. Aletha Armstrong continues to develop voices and has the ability to coordinate them melodic harmony, while she gives them also a ground of musical history. and a knowledge ( forms of vocal and instrumental music.. Her tea has been coordinated with the band instruction was made available by the County this year an been of help to the band instructor. During the two operettas have been produced, one at Chri time and one at the close of the school year; in many voices were used commendably. In addition to our teachers, another staff is n to make the project what it is today. Director c whole over-all picture is Miss Ruth Dyer, who handles the mechanics of running the school an( ommends to the Committee, actions or change feels are to the best interests of the school an fraternity.

New strip films and slides for purposes of education in dental and other hygienic care have been purchased with money from various clubs and chapters and have been shown extensively. Layettes, gifts for the "loan closet" or baby toys are welcome gifts from clubs or chapters. Often, like old Mother Hubbard's, Marjorie's cupboard becomes bare, also. The Arrowcraft Shop is the mecca for all Pi Phis going to Gatlinburg and by remote control, is familiar to every Pi Phi. From it, under the practiced and practicable management of Ethel M. Snow, go the many beautiful crafts designed by Tina. McMorran, our Weaving Designer, to please the Pi Phis. When the advance in cost of linens, threads or other supplies necessitates a raise in price to absorb production costs, there must be a slight change in form or pattern of the article in order to meet O.P.A. requirements. This often means time must be taken to design other than entirely new patterns. With temperatures in the high nineties it sounds incongruous to talk of new patterned wool dirndls with matching stoles but soon we shall be wanting them again; there is a new knitting bag, and a new luncheon set will soon be in production. The popular woolen ties are no more, since men have taken to the bows and the cost of producing such ties as ours is prohibitive at the old price. Tina has designed and woven a second large dossal this year as her gift to her own little Episcopal church in Gatlinburg. It is in the old, lovely ecclesiastical red, the color having been selected by the rector. At present she is on leave to attend a special short course in weaving under the leadership of the famed Dorothy Leibes. This should mean new designs in new and gorgeous colors for next year's sales. Assisting Mrs. Snow and Mrs. McMorran in sales and weaving are Edna Cook, Reba Owenby, Margaret Ogle and Wanda Ogle. While the total number of weavers has been reduced this year, by keeping the very best, greater production is possible at lower cost. Our hotel shop at the Mountain View, under the supervision of Mrs. McCutchan, is a special attraction to all visitors. It is ever important to remember that no contribu tion to the Settlement School funds nor money re-turned to Arrowcraft is ever used other than for the development and broadening of the Settlement School program. As always we are appreciative of your efforts, which result in new funds to maintain or widen the scope of our project. The bareness of the Arrowcraft storage shelves in November attest to how many clubs order for the fall sales. The prompt return of unsold goods is vital to the business at Arrowcraft as is the prompt payment of bills. The same courtesy and business tactics should be used with II B (1) as with the merchants from whom one purchases locally. The assistance of all clubs selling Arrowcraft products is most appreciated and we regret being .able to list only the top few here. They are: Champaign-Urbana $2458.01 Milwaukee 1700.00 Coos County, Oregon 1628,41 Philadelphia 1625.96 Portland, Ore 1450.00 Houston, Tex 1337.77 Pittsburgh 1150.00 Madison 1119.55 Northern New jersey 973.75 Dallas 904.42 The Pi Beta Phi Cook-book has returned in a new blue cover.

Now we have arrived at the place where ing must be furnished. In all the Southern area, Pi Beta Phi stands first in its leadership development and for this reason we feel thi must be an example of what crafts schoo should or could be, and while economically cally done, it must also be well done. Those who attended the jasper Convei always remember the very touching speed Maryland A delegate when she officially 1 well, as the representative of the active chap fraternity and at the same time presented ti ing funds of her chapter to the Settlement be used toward the furnishing of the lout then proposed Staff House. This gift honore L. Keller, President Emeritus, and Mrs. He 64 THE SEPTEMBER RRt \h'' two of their most loyal charter members. This was the beginning of an idea. Without cur-tailing the amount of regular contributions so necessary for operation, we are asking that every chapter and club give consideration toward a special contribution for the furnishing of some room of the house. This would celebrate forty years of existence and could honor some fine alumna of your chapter or club, as did Maryland A. We also know that many Pi Phis individually will wish to help in making our building serviceable and beautiful. Should some one lean to the practical rather than the aesthetic, two thousand dollars will provide a kitchen with the type cabinets and tables highly recommended for institutional work. For many of us less fortunate financially, there are lamps, small scatter rugs, hangings, separate chairs, tables, even sofas and dining room furniture, all needed to create a useful whole. Furnishing is in the hands of a committee and the money may be sent to Mrs. Thomas E. Graham, 3324 W. 18th Street, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the Committee Treasurer. In the planning of the Staff House and the steps taken toward construction, we would express our great appreciation to Miss Jessie W. Harris, Miss Henrietta Sivyer, Miss Ruth Buckley, Miss Marian Heard, all of the University of Tennessee College of Home Economics and Mr. Warren T. Smith for the time and effort each has expended for Pi Beta Phi. Their counsel has been of inestimable value. The 1952 Workshop with Marian G. Heard of the University of Tennessee again serving as Director offers two three week sessions. Conducted as it is, in conjunction with the University, classes are on a university level for those desiring credit, while non-credit students are also welcome. This year, courses offered are Jewelry, Metal Work, introductory, advanced and rug Weaving, Pottery and Woodworking. Students from seventeen states are in attendance. A member of Pi Beta Phi, Mary Elizabeth Sullivan, heads the weaving section and two Pi Phis, Caroline Edmonds, California B, and Esther Breckinridge, Iowa r, are serving as Graduate Assistants. We are pleased that Marian Heard, whom we almost claim as our own, was elected President of the Southern Highlands' Guild for the current year. Having had so much to do with the encouragement of the crafts in that area, through the years, Pi Beta Phi continues to hold an important place in Guild activities. It is said that having a party is ever good for the house and so it proved in the fall when Gatlinburg entertained all the Governors of the United States for their annual conference. Merchants and townspeople cleaned and polished until the town shone and the whole affair brought wide and favorable comment. Pi Beta Phi loaned its Health Center and the surrounding grounds for a small Craftsmen's Fair where local craftsmen demonstrated their arts. Inside, a fine exhibit of finished products was arranged. This fair and exhibition was enjoyed by the Governors and their families because it was typical of the district. Were one ever to hear that our work is finished in Gatlinburg, one has but to think back on all that we do there. Think first of the place we hold in the fraternity world for having established a type of service outside our own organization; then the benefits of our Health program, relieving the over-taxed doctors of school Inspections, inoculations and consultations on minor ailments or accidents, or the advice given on ore-natal care or to the mothers of little babies, or the First Aid to the school children, day after day; the program of sanitation, disease prevention and health preservation would have a tremendous set-back,were the Health Center work to he withdrawn. The '`Workshop program in Crafts has just begun and has a large future, should we wish to expand it; the departure of many students to many states makes possible a wide-spread knowledge of the fraternity's influence on the handicrafts of the area. It means prestige for us when we display and sell the beautiful articles made for our Arrowcraft Shop and distributed all over the United States. It does not necessarily follow that we shall always have direct obligations along the lines of secondary education for the Gatlinburg school system, but when one is in Gatlinburg and talks with the older established residents or the doctors, rather than the new-comers in business on the street, eager for tourist trade but with less knowledge of the long .develop-meat of the town itself, one knows that we are needed. We ask each of the members of the Staff to contribute some of her own free time toward community or social service and the demands upon them are tremendous. The future program may change in many respects but we could ill afford to discontinue our interests. With the majority of fraternity members believing in the School and the work done there, we must continue our support to the best ..of our ability. It takes the cooperation of everyone to "lighten the load." Working and planning together for the Settlement School closely unites a Committee and Staff and results in respect for each one's capabilities and affection for each other. This coming year, we shall sorely miss from the Committee, Olivia Smith Moore of Texarkana, Texas who has been our most capable treasurer and friend, and Harriet Goodsell Rauch of New York City whose excellent publicity is familiar to all through the ARROW. To take their places, Grand Council appointed Theresa Graham of Oklahoma City as Treasurer and Virginia Brackett Green of Indianapolis. Mrs. Green will edit "News of Lillie Pigeon' and handle public relations. In addition to losing Lillian Howell as Assistant to the Director we also regret the resignation of Mrs. Eunice Cole from her duties as book-keeper at. Arrow-craft. She resigns to assist her husband in their business. Replacing them next fall we shall have two Pi Phis: Joan Newcomer, Kansas B, will become Miss Dyer's Assistant and Katherine McIntosh, Alabama B will take the position of Book-keeper and Assistant to Mrs. Snow at Arrowcraft. Pi beta Phis are particularly welcome both as teachers or on the regular staff and applications may be placed with the Director at any time. For the time this Chairman has served on the Committee, Amy B. Onken by appointment from the Council, has been the contact member. In an extremely heavy schedule she has found immediate time to answer a call for assistance or to give of her in-formation to benefit the School. The Committee is grateful for her help as well as that of the Council and the Province officers in sending can to you the month by month happenings at the Settlement School. The evidence of their assistance in keeping you in-formed manifests itself in your growing interest in this memorial to our Founders. Our Founders believed in our School and in those who outlined its development, Their prayers were for a lasting project which, in some form, would keep Pi Beta Phi fore-most in the fraternity world for its philanthropy. Let us keep it so. May future planners have "the heart to conceive, the understanding to direct, and the hand to execute." RUTH BARRETT SMITH THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1952 65 LFE is not a little bundle of big things, but a big bundle of little things." This statement from a newspaper column seems a fitting theme for my annual report. While big things have been accomplished in the village and at the school, it is the little things that make up the big bundle of daily happenings at the Settlement School. From humble beginnings of forty years ago, our project has grown and changed with the years, the program adapting to the new phases of life in a rapidly growing community. Community The year has marked an extensive program among the different churches for improvement to their buildings. Now we have several fine churches that are a credit to any town. The new Baptist Church of Crab Orchard stone in modern design has been completed. The beautiful pipe organ which is equipped with chimes, was the gift of Mrs. Mary Huff in memory of her husband, Andy Huff. The Methodist congregation has built a beautiful new parsonage and also purchased a parking lot behind the church. The little Episcopal Church has had a number of gifts. A pipe organ from Mrs. Ethel Voorheis Murry and a beautiful hand-woven dossal in ecclesiastical red from Tina McMorran were two of these. The Roaring Fork Baptist Church finished their basement and the little Primitive Baptist Church was repaired and painted. There has been great activity in the construction of new motels and tourist courts. Owners of existing courts have added new units and remodeled their old cabins until the town is very well supplied with fine accommodations for the tourists. People here complain of a poor season, but to the casual observer it does not seem that way. Statistics at the Park show an increase in visitors over last year. Perhaps we are reaching a saturation point. New shops have been added to the many in town and outside on the highways. Several of the new courts and shops show the influence of an architect who has moved to the community. He is Mr. Hubert Bebb, brother of Douglass Bebb of Buckhorn Inn. It is too bad that he did not come sooner, for his work is a distinct addition to the town. One bundle that could be called Big was made up of three factors. These were, the flash flood of September first, the Governor's Conference of the week of October first, and the Gatlinburg Craft Show held the same week. The flood made cleaning up for the Conference much harder, and the Craft Show was one of the factors in the entertainment of the visitors. The sudden, destructive flood was caused by a cloudburst in the mountains above the Alum Cave Trail. Ten inches of water fell in about an hour. Fortunately, no lives were lost, but the highway across the mountains was closed for eight days before temporary repairs could be made. Much damage was done to properties along the river, especially in the lower end of town. The water made the Greystone lawn into a lake, was over the railing of the Greystone Bridge, and made the highway into Knoxville accessible only to a jeep or a boat. The waters backed up Baskins Creek, but did not touch our property. When it receded, it left much debris and muck behind. Everyone worked, and by October first the town never looked better. We had perfect weather all the week of the Conference. The Governors' parties were housed in the four hotels, the press had quarters in certain designated motels, and the highway patrolmen had other courts assigned to them. For that week Gatlinburg was the center ofmuch activity. Because everyone worked together, this small town was able to entertain our distinguished guests. Banquets were held at different hotels, but the china and silver and even the waitresses of all the hotels appeared at the one where the function was being held. To provide entertainment for the wives of the governors and others not too busy with conferences, the local shops put on a Craft exhibition. The Health Center was used for the exhibit of outstanding examples of weaving, wood work, and other crafts. Behind the building and on the lawn were umbrellas and tents housing weavers, basket makers, broom makers, woodworkers, and others. No admission was charged, and hostesses were on hand to tell the guests about the craft industry in this locality. One of the interesting things about this was that some local and rural people came and, for. the first time, were made to realize what was going on and how their own skill fitted into the whole picture. The Chamber of Commerce made a great effort to extend the season at both ends. In the fall a group of Marble Dealers held a convention the week after the Governors had been here, and in the early spring we had meetings of the Wilson Club of America, a District Rotary convention and the Second Wildflower Pilgrimage. The bird lovers had continuous rain but hunted new species with great ardor. The other groups had better luck. During the dull season, the local people have made it a practice to stage. different benefit parties. This year the Polio Benefit netted much more than it had before, but the one for the village library brought considerably less. The Episcopal Guild had a game party one night that helped them put the slate roof on their new church and provided a good time besides. In December, the Garden Club held an unusually good show of flower arrangements and of the winter greens that grow in such abundance in this area. This group and the Rotary Club placed a number of concrete benches along the Parkway for the benefit of the tourists. The usual union services were held by the town churches at Thanksgiving and Christmas. On Easter, besides the sunrise service, there was an egg hunt for all the local children at the Whittle place. A new Park Superintendent was appointed for our Park. He is Mr. John. C. Preston from Mount Rainier National Park near Seattle. A survey and revaluation of property in town for taxation purposes and more talk of a village sewer system show that there is civic interest in the community. School A review of the school year brings to mind many little things the day-to-day routine of any school system which is highlighted by certain events of importance. Mr. Walter Ogle served his second year as principal, and we had Mrs. Ann Lighter for assistant principal. She returned after a year's leave of absence to have charge of the library and to teach junior and senior English. We have always been proud of our library, which is called the Grace Coolidge Library. We are especially proud of it since it has been so much improved by a number of changes. By taking out a partition between the library and an adjoining class room, the room was enlarged and space made for four new tables. The County paid for the carpenter work, the tables and the chairs. The tables are birch and were made in Mr. Cole's woodworking shop. They are beautiful. Mrs. Benjamin Weir, Illinois Z, who has made several fine gifts to the library, had made 66 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW an additional gift of $100 which we had been saving for something special. .New shelving seemed very necessary, and with this gift, $50 from Committee, and help from the County, we have entire new shelving in the room. We were very fortunate that Mr. Lighter, who is the husband of the librarian, has a hobby of woodworking. He made these shelves in our Craft Shop. They are made to scale to fit into each available space and are very well made. The library has to serve as a classroom, but with the L-shape can be used at the same time for study. Interested Pi Phi alumna clubs, active chapters and individuals have added many volumes to our book collection. Mrs. Lighter has a special Memorial Shelf where books that have been given in memory of Pi Phis have an honored place. These books are often special -volumes that are too expensive to be acquired in the ordinary way. The Washington D. C. Alumnae Club has a practice of sending a book to the School instead of giving flowers at the death of a member. Mrs. Lighter can secure such good discounts and often wants some special book, so a gift of money can be spent most advantageously. More books came to the School from Texas A and from the Lexington, Kentucky Alumnae Club. These were sorted and placed where they could best be used. Many juvenile books were put in the new elementary building to form a collection for the use of the teachers in the lower grades. Books get pretty hard wear from the little folk, and it is fine to have new material to place on the tables in their rooms for them to read and enjoy. These gifts made it possible to discard some books that were really worn out. Departmentalization in the seventh and eighth grades worked a little better than it did last year. Mr. Tip Robertson had the eighth grade home room and coached the boys' basketball team. Miss Hazel Watson, daughter of Richard, our farm manager, had the seventh grade and coached the girls' team. Hazel graduated from Berea College and did a very good job in her first teaching assignment. Both of the junior basketball teams made excellent records. The high school freshman English teacher had these two grades in that subject and their other studies were divided between the two home room teachers. The work in business was taught by Mr. Jack Miller. In the second semester he added a course in Business Law to the curriculum. Mrs. Ruth Owenby and Mr. Mark Grim have been good members of our faculty for several years, and both did their part in helping make the teaching pro-gram a good one. The home economics department was in charge of Miss Joan McCready, an Iowa State College graduate. She was an outstanding teacher and gave the girls some very practical instruction in sewing and cooking. Miss Hodgen and I both felt that the dormitory girls learned more under her than they had previously. The arts and crafts program was carried on under great difficulty. Not in the woodworking department, for Mr. Carl Huskey had a good class of boys who did some very nice work in producing small articles of furniture. A late resignation by the art teacher made it difficult to find the proper person for our program, but Miss Dorothy Deiss came down from New York, where she had just finished work for her master's degree in time to start the second week of school. She was a teacher of outstanding ability and gave some fine service to the school, but she did not feel that she could carry on the work after the first semester. The high school classes had to have the credit, so we were fortunate in securing Mrs. Charm Hadley, wife of Dr. Jervis Hadley, park geologist, to teach just those twoclasses. Mrs. Hadley has an art degree and had taught the subject, so we were well pleased with that arrangement. In March, Ann Smith came from the University of Tennessee to take over the entire program, the very day she graduated. Ann had been a Workshop student the summer before, came back to Workshop this summer, and is to teach for us next year. She was a happy solution to that difficulty. Mrs. Armstrong again had the classes in music. She had a good chorus of high school students, a girls' glee club, and gave two very fine programs. The annual operetta was called "The Frog Prince." It was as cute as it could be. We were glad that the Committee was in town to see the younger children in their clever costumes and to hear their sweet young voices. The town is still talking about the Christmas program, for it was one of the finest we have ever had at the school. Miss Deiss and her students helped with the staging. They made the "Talking Christmas Tree" and the papier rnache reindeer, Santa and his sleigh. The reindeer were almost life-size. They won a blue ribbon for the Arts and Crafts department in the Garden Club show and were much admired in the lobby of the Mountain View Hotel during the holiday season. Mr. Hartford Granitz taught the classes in health, coached the girls' and boys' basketball teams in the high school, and helped with the football pro-gram. No spectacular results came from either sport, but this was due to the material he had to work with rather than from his work. The School has long felt the need of a band, and for the first time, a start has been made toward that project. The Rotary Club acted as sponsor, and a Knoxville firm provided the instruments on a six weeks rental-trial basis. At the end of that time, the rent paid was applied on the price of the instrument. A good start was made, and they even had a concert to show progress. Now the school board is trying to find a band director who can also teach some academic subject, and thus be on the regular payroll. This year, we again cooperated with the University of Tennessee in having a group of student practice teachers work at the school for six weeks. The young people were mostly preparing for elementary teaching positions and worked with our grade school teachers to their mutual advantage. In order to foster professional interest, an active in-service training program was instituted for the faculty and five meetings were held. One of these was a county-wide meeting held at our School. Mrs. Lighter was chosen to serve on an important committee of educators who spent one week in intensive evaluation of Rule High School in Knoxville. Their findings will be a help to the whole area. The Junior play was "Little Women" and was very well cast and produced. The Seniors chose "Johnny on the Spot" for their play. It was fun to see a tall mountain lad play the part of the returned soldier who against his will was posing as a great hero. Room parties for the grade school children at the Christmas and Valentine seasons, the high school basketball, football, and Junior banquets were all Big things that brought gayety and happiness into the regular school program. The Senior Class of twenty-two members made a trip to Washington, D. C., with a stopover at Luray Caverns in Virginia. They had been well-briefed before they left school in the historical and scenic wonders they were to see. Even the arrow on Mrs. Coolidge's dress caught their notice when they visited the Smithsonian Institute and saw the wax figures of the Presidents' wives. The Baccalaureate service was held in the new Baptist Church with a fine speaker and lovely music by the girls' glee club. Class night THE SEPTEMBER ARROW and Commencement followed, both being held in our auditorium. A number of the class are planning on going to college this fall. Most of them have positions in restaurants, shops, or hotels this summer. P.T There had been a growing sentiment against raising money for P.T.A. projects by holding Bingo games both here in town and in the state organization. The new Baptist minister, Rev. J. B. Carter, very much disapproved. and this year the games were given up. Revenue has come from three rummage sales that brought in about $350.00 and from a Minstrel Show that netted the same amount. This was given two nights in the High School gym and was a gala affair. A surprising amount of local talent gave an outstanding performance. Marjorie Chalmers and Lillian Hansen of our staff were in the cast. The pharmacist at one of the drug stores directed the show. The P.T.A. again operated the school lunch program under the efficient management of Mrs. Grace Morell. They contributed the proceeds of one rummage sale to the school library and have a surplus to spend for some worthy cause next year. The monthly programs were interesting and in several instances brought many fathers to the meetings. Sue Huff Cox served as President, Lillian was Secretary, and Mrs. Henrietta Huff was Program chairman for the year. Two study meetings were held at Teachers' Cottage with the Director serving as discussion leader. At these meetings every-one brought their own sandwiches, and Miss Hodgen provided cake and coffee for dessert one time, and the other time Sue baked the cake. Dormitory We had twelve dormitory students during the year, nine girls and three boys. Seven of these were fresh-.men and new to group living. It took a couple of months for them to lose some of their shyness and to learn what was expected of them. Before the year was over, they felt at home and contributed their part toward running the place. The girls esnecially helped with work in the kitchen and dining room and did very well when we were without a cook, by preparing breakfast and helping at supper time. We have had a serious time with help shortages. I do not know what we would have done without Miss Hodgen to take over when we had no cook. Lillian Hansen, my assist-ant, chaperoned the girls and taught them many things they should always remember. We entertained at several nice dinners during the year. Committee members were with us one evening and we also had the annual dinner for the Commencement speaker, the County Superintendent, and others. I entertained all of the teachers at tea, early in the fall, and when the student teachers came, we had another get-together for them, the faculty and our staff. We have a number of foreign visitors each year who come to see our school as an example of a good Craft Center. Last fall a group of South American students were here. They talked to the students at a special assembly and had a public exhibition of crafts they had brought from their own countries. Later that evening, we invited interested friends to meet the group at Teachers' Cottage and served doughnuts and coffee. We have entertained guests from Egypt, China, England, and Austria, some of them for overnight stops. They always bring much of interest to us, and I know carry away knowledge that will help them in their different work. Stuart College living room has again served as a piano studio for a private teacher whose pupils get excused from class work to take les-sons during school hours. The girls of Lillian's Scout troop held their annu Silver Tea at Stuart, and also held their Christm party there. The Dormitory students had several pz ties, and the whole family went on several picnic One of these was a rather damp one when we all car back to Stuart to eat our dessert and have a surpri shower for Lillian and her fiance, Harry W. Howe Health Center Of all the varied services contributed by the Et ternity to the community, none is more important th that rendered by our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmei She presides over our modern little Health Cent where several important local clinics are held ea, year. Two of these are the pre-school clinic for ch. dren entering school for the first time, and the visit the state mobile X-ray unit for chest examinations. , the latter visit, over 1000 people were X-rayed in ol day. This is a great number for this small town, b is due to the number of people who work in resc restaurants and hotels and must have a health car Marjorie has taught classes in child care to the soph more home economics class and to Lillian's Sco troop. Another Scout troop had lessons in First Ai The daily visits of the school children for Fii Aid, home visits, health talks given and pictures shwa in the rural schools, all seem like everyday, liti things, but when a summary is made of the wo done over a long period of time, we have a B bundle. Some startling figures came to light wh records of the past twenty years were consulted and tabulation made. Field Visits 23,5 Office Calls 41,31 First Aid Dressings ;5,3: Inoculations 1,1, Physical Examinations and Pupil Inspections 54,6 Health Talks 2,11 Newspaper Articles (5 years) The state of Tennessee furnishes the serums for Ma. orie's work, and we receive gifts from other sour( that help with the program. Outside our own chaptc and alumnae clubs, who are most generous with cif the greatest source of income is from Sigma P Gamma, international sorority. This group sends t Council of Southern Mountain Workers a sum money each year to be used for health work in t mountains. Last year this was $1350. Our share of tl amount was over $50. Individual chapters of that ( ganization adopt our project as the special center receive their welfare gifts. In money this amounts quite a sum during the year, and they also send tool brushes and other items that the nurse can use in 1-work. They have provided glasses for a number children who could not otherwise afford them. T shelves at the Health Center that are reserved i "give-aways" need frequent replenishing, especia for baby items and for clean, used clothing for sm children. Just last week, Marjorie was telephoning l friends and scurrying around to find a layette fox new baby. Farm Richard Watson was in charge of the garden, i chickens and our livestock, which consists of t mules and six pigs. The chickens provide us w meat and eggs for the table, the pigs are our prix garbage disposal unit, and the mules we use wh, people on level ground would use a tractor. 'I garden provides us with fresh vegetables, and w.17 68 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW the new staff house took away a good garden spot, we still have good potatoes on a hillside above the chicken houses. The Dormitory boys help wherever they are needed in keeping up the place. Arrowcraft Shop With the many craft shops now operating in Gatlin-burg, our shop occupies a unique position. We are one of three Guild shops in town, and since our merchandise is all of superior workmanship and quality-, we attract the more discriminating tourists. Sometimes our five o'clock closing hour and the fact that we are never open on Sunday causes a disappointment for people whose stay in town is limited. Longer hours would mean more employees and be too hard on the regular staff. Our big order business' with alumna Clubs and active chapters keeps everyone working at top speed all during .the fall shipping season. Last summer, many clubs ordered even' before the new price list had been sent to them. August was the heaviest .month's business in the history of the shop. In addition to the summer tourist customers, 42 club orders were filled and there were about ten others waiting to be shipped. In November, the weavers' pay roll was $5600, an all-time high. Still, there were shortages in some items, for try as we will to plan ahead, no one is a mind reader to foretell just what items will be most in demand. Some club chairmen order too optimistically, and if everything is not sold or returned promptly, some other club may be short some items. Many Arrowcraft articles were displayed in the exhibits at the Craftsman's Fair in Asheville, N. C., and ' we sent Tina McMorran and Wanda Ogle to demonstrate weaving, and Edna Cook for the sales room. Last fall, the Qatlinburg Craft Exhibit held during the Governors' Conference meant much extra work. Ethel Snow was in charge of the demonstrations. Arrowcraft furnished two demonstrators, one for weaving and one for warping. The Elmer Kear family, makers of our brooms, were there, .and Mat and Mary L. Owenby put on a chair-making demonstration. Pi Phi's gift: to each Governor's lady was a handwoven, ' white linen guest towel which was wrapped and sent to their hotel rooms., That same month we sent articles to; the Tennessee Annual Craft Exhibit and Sale at the University of Tennessee. ' In the ' spring during the Wilson Club Convention, we,were asked to have. a display of our weavings in the lobby of the Mountain.View Hotel, Edna helped Mrs. McCutchan in the Hotel Shop that' .'day ' and answered questions about the exhibit. The.', interior arrangement of the ,Arr'owcraft'shop has been changed by ;moving the bed into ,the second sales "room and by having a . room with a pretty Warp on it in the main sales room. Tina and Mary Elizabeth' Sullivan, one of the Workshop 'Teachers and also a Pi Phi, wove two screens for window display that are very interesting. They are' made of hardwood ;strips held together with a. gay warp. The windows were especially pretty during the Christmas season. An unusual creche made entirely of corn stalks, candles, and native greens were used. The Weavers' Annual Christmas party brought a large attendance. The program of carols by a group of school children, harp-singing, and the gift exchange were held at Stuart Cottage. Refreshments were served at the. dining rental tables and at extra card tables in Pollard. Tina spent a week in New York attending exhibitions, gaining inspiration for new designs. One recognition for her work was an article in the Spring and Summer Quarterly of . cCall's Magazine on her work, in which our. aprons and bags were pictured in color. Summer Activities An event of early summer was the June wedding of roy.aassistant, Lillian Hansen, and Harry W. Howell. The ceremony Was performed in the Episcopal Church, with the reception at the Greystone Playhouse. Lillian has made a place for herself in the hearts of all the community by her work at the School and her outside activities with the Girl Scouts and the Episcopal church group. Everyone was glad to wish her well, and to have the assurance that she 'would stay on with the School until September when Harry goes to Atlanta to take advanced work in architecture at Georgia Tech. Mr. Richards and his Gateway Players again used the gymnasium for summer stock. The plays provided good entertainment for the summer people. The 1951 Workshop was the most successful one we have ever had both in quality of the students and in the work produced. We had people from 26 states, represented by the staff and student body. A number were Pi Phis, but not as many as we would like to have. if our own members could attend a session of the Workshop, working and playing with the group, enjoying the outings and the daily fellowship in the dining room, it would be the greatest boost we could have. One has to be here to realize what a wonderful Craft School we have. . This summer we have watched the progress of our lovely new Staff House with great interest. The work has progressed with very little delay from lack of materials and. each week shows progress. Workshop students were interested in, that they will. have the facilities of the larger dining room next summer. In this summary of tle.y*car's pork, the little thing~, both ,good xnd had, crowd. my memory. Some of the things in the 'Good bundle are the gifts' at Christmas time and through the year from alum= clubs, active chapters and individual Pi Phis, the many .pleasant contact~ ith interested visitors, and the faithfulness of our loyal employees. These far outweigh the bad things,, the discouragernents and problems of maintenance And help in running the Settlement School. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to the Settlement 'School Committee and to all others who have helped me handle my "bundle of little things." Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER, Director Use the .Pi Beta .Phi Magazine A.gency', 410 Standard Building, Decatur, Illinois.

The Program offers six months of class instruction taught largely by the faculty of the Harvard Business School. The curriculum includes .courses in human relations, personnel administration, management problems and objectives, wage policies and procedures, marketing, retailing, accounting, labor problems, andothers. Ten weeks of full time field work, arranged in two periods of four and six weeks, in business, government and other organizations enables the student to see the practical application of her academic work. Graduates of the Program now hold administrative positions in business, industry, in government offices, the armed forces, and in educational institutions. For further information, apply to Mr. T. North Whitehead, Management Training Program, Radcliffe College, Cambridge 38, Massachusetts. Committee Reports Holt House Committee IT IS the feeling of the Committee that Holt House has, during the year now closing, well served its purpose as a modest shrine dedicated to the memory of the Founders of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and as a gracious house which renders valuable, and valued, service to the community where that fraternity was founded eighty-five years ago. During the year, Holt House was used sixty-six times as a meeting place for organizations or to pro-vide accommodations for private entertaining on thirty-one of these occasions by groups affiliated with the fraternity. The chapters in the vicinity used the house for rushing parties, formal parties, cooky-shines, pledge parties, teas and for initiation. Thirty-one members of Illinois Eta visited the house in a group. The alumnae clubs of the area and the Illinois Alpha Mothers' Club held regular meetings, suppers, cooky-shines and teas there. Three other alumnae clubs came from distant points to hold special meetings there; and one distant club paid a visit to the house. It is the hope of the Committee that these groups and other distant clubs and chapters will make arrangements to visit Holt House during the year ahead, for they are most welcome. The house also accommodated, on thirty-five occasions, groups and individuals not connected with the Fraternity organization. Groups meeting there with regularity were the PEO, the DAR, the 0GM Bridge Club and the Monmouth Women's Club. A number of other organizations used the house on one occasion, or more. Holt House also provided a gracious setting for teas, showers, parties and wed-ding receptions given by individuals. A number of lovely gifts for the house were received during the year. The Committee is very grateful to Fannie Bradford Bailey who gave to Holt House the antique oil portraits of her grandparents, Major and Mrs. Holt. These portraits had previously been loaned, by Mrs. Bailey. The Springfield, Illinois, Alumnae Club presented a fine silver tray which was greatly needed. The Spokane, Washington, Alumnae Club very thoughtfully gave a beautiful little antique English silver "sweets basket" in memory of Eloise Ohme Moffatt, one of their younger members who was also a Pi Phi daughter. Mrs Moffat's name was en-graved on the little basket which was placed on the melodeon in the Victorian Parlor. The Burlington-Fort Madison, Iowa, Club, after holding a meeting in the house, presented a lovely antique shadow box which is to display old I. C. and Pi Phi pins. The alumna of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, made a gift of a small check with which to buy something for the house, at the time of their meeting there; and a member of the Avon-Bushnell, Illinois, group left two pairs of pretty, old pillow shams at the conclusion of their meeting in Holt House. To all these donors, the Committee is most grateful for their gifts and for their thoughtful interest in the house. The house itself is in good condition, only minor repairs being ,required during the year. The folding chairs, ordered some time ago, were received in the summer of 1951 and have been put to use many times. A number of replacements will be necessary during the coming year: new ruffled curtains have been ordered for the Founders' Room; several pieces of furniture will need to be re-covered; and the stair carpeting must soon be replaced. Also, the Victorian Parlor will need to be re-papered. The Committee will bevery grateful for nineteenth century photographs of members, to be placed in the velvet covered albums received last year; and for old I. C. or Pi Phi pins, to be placed in the shadow box received recently. Such items may be either loaned or presented to the house and will add a great deal to its small treasury of mementos of the early days of Pi Beta Phi. Mabel T. Johnson, who came to Holt House as hostess in December of 1950, keeps the house and its furnishings in excellent condition. She has assumed all the responsibilities of her position in splendid fashion and acts with graciousness and hospitality. Mrs. Johnson is well aware of the purpose and function of Holt House, having been a Monmouth resident all of her life. The Committee feels that the Fraternity is fortunate in having her as hostess and is glad to report that she is apparently happy in her association with Pi Beta Phi. The Committee is sincerely grateful to the many chapters and clubs which have contributed to the support of Holt House this year. The number of clubs contributing to the fund is, however; fewer, by nine, than the total of two-hundred twenty-two clubs which contributed during the preceding year. Among the clubs, the highest contributor was KansaS ' City, Missouri, with a gift of $50.00. The Spokane, Washing-ton, Club gave almost this exact amount for the purchase of a special memorial gift. The second highest contributor to the general fund was the Everett, Washington, Club which gave $30.00. Springfield, Illinois, gave this amount, too, for the purchase of a special gift for the house; in addition to their regular contribution to the fund. The Monmouth, Illinois, alumna group gave $25.00, the third highest contribution to the general fund. Many other clubs were very generous in their gifts. The number of chapters supporting the house in-creased from eighty-five during 1950-51 to eighty-nine during 1951-52. The highest contributing chap ters were: California $50.00 Louisiana A 50.00 Oklahoma A 35.00 Tennessee B 30.00 Illinois A 25.00 Kansas B 25.00 Texas A 25.00 As was also true last year, every chapter and every club in Delta Province and in Zeta Province contributed to the Holt House Fund. In addition to these provinces, in Alpha West, Gamma, Epsilon. Eta and Kappa Provinces, every chapter contributed ; and in Iota Province every club contributed. Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, followed by Eta Province in second place and by Mu Province, third. It is with extreme regret 'that the Holt House Committee announces the recent death of Evelyn Holliday Bridge who served as Committee Secretary during the past two years. Her interest in the house and in the work of the Committee was unfailing. Her efforts in behalf of the house continued, in spite of her illness, until a few months before her death. Her loss will be deeply felt. Alice McDougall Jensen, Monmouth member of the Committee, has, through her presence in Mon 77

New strip films and slides for purposes of education in dental and other hygienic care have been purchased with money from various clubs and chapters and have been shown extensively. Layettes, gifts for the "loan closet" or baby toys are welcome gifts from clubs or chapters. Often, like old Mother Hubbard's, Marjorie's cupboard becomes bare, also. The Arrowcraft Shop is the mecca for all Pi Phis going to Gatlinburg and by remote control, is familiar to every Pi Phi. From it, under the practiced and practicable management of Ethel M. Snow, go the many beautiful crafts designed by Tina. McMorran, our Weaving Designer, to please the Pi Phis. When the advance in cost of linens, threads or other supplies necessitates a raise in price to absorb production costs, there must be a slight change in form or pattern of the article in order to meet O.P.A. requirements. This often means time must be taken to design other than entirely new patterns. With temperatures in the high nineties it sounds incongruous to talk of new patterned wool dirndls with matching stoles but soon we shall be wanting them again; there is a new knitting bag, and a new luncheon set will soon be in production. The popular woolen ties are no more, since men have taken to the bows and the cost of producing such ties as ours is prohibitive at the old price. Tina has designed and woven a second large dossal this year as her gift to her own little Episcopal church in Gatlinburg. It is in the old, lovely ecclesiastical red, the color having been selected by the rector. At present she is on leave to attend a special short course in weaving under the leadership of the famed Dorothy Leibes. This should mean new designs in new and gorgeous colors for next year's sales. Assisting Mrs. Snow and Mrs. McMorran in sales and weaving are Edna Cook, Reba Owenby, Margaret Ogle and Wanda Ogle. While the total number of weavers has been reduced this year, by keeping the very best, greater production is possible at lower cost. Our hotel shop at the Mountain View, under the supervision of Mrs. McCutchan, is a special attraction to all visitors. It is ever important to remember that no contribu tion to the Settlement School funds nor money re-turned to Arrowcraft is ever used other than for the development and broadening of the Settlement School program. As always we are appreciative of your efforts, which result in new funds to maintain or widen the scope of our project. The bareness of the Arrowcraft storage shelves in November attest to how many clubs order for the fall sales. The prompt return of unsold goods is vital to the business at Arrowcraft as is the prompt payment of bills. The same courtesy and business tactics should be used with II B (1) as with the merchants from whom one purchases locally. The assistance of all clubs selling Arrowcraft products is most appreciated and we regret being .able to list only the top few here. They are: Champaign-Urbana $2458.01 Milwaukee 1700.00 Coos County, Oregon 1628,41 Philadelphia 1625.96 Portland, Ore 1450.00 Houston, Tex 1337.77 Pittsburgh 1150.00 Madison 1119.55 Northern New jersey 973.75 Dallas 904.42 The Pi Beta Phi Cook-book has returned in a new blue cover.

The Committee and the School are very also for the fine gifts of toys, books and clothing received at Christmas time. The di of these gifts to each child of the lower gra a particular gift for each room and the takin to the other schools of the district are higI Christmas week. The extra gifts, as some one club or du] of a desire or need, are appreciated, too. Thi: special Wishing List is long indeed and cor primarily upon one special thing the r House. You will recall that it has been felt f( years that the bottleneck in further expansi, Summer Workshop with the University of ' lay in lack of sufficient housing and dining We have transformed the grade school ead into dormitory living quarters but the rm applicants ask for single or double rooms, In to rectify this situation, to facilitate the feedin people and to provide more comfortable qu our all-year staff, it was decided that a new must be erected. With the fine bequest Garshwiler Estate, money from California a amounts placed regularly in the Sinking just such a need, it became possible two ye; consult with an architect and in March of tE break ground for the building. Now we have arrived at the place where ing must be furnished. In all the Southern area, Pi Beta Phi stands first in its leadership development and for this reason we feel thi must be an example of what crafts schoo should or could be, and while economically cally done, it must also be well done. Those who attended the jasper Convei always remember the very touching speed Maryland A delegate when she officially 1 well, as the representative of the active chap fraternity and at the same time presented ti ing funds of her chapter to the Settlement be used toward the furnishing of the lout then proposed Staff House. This gift honore L. Keller, President Emeritus, and Mrs. He 64 THE SEPTEMBER RRt \h'' two of their most loyal charter members. This was the beginning of an idea. Without cur-tailing the amount of regular contributions so necessary for operation, we are asking that every chapter and club give consideration toward a special contribution for the furnishing of some room of the house. This would celebrate forty years of existence and could honor some fine alumna of your chapter or club, as did Maryland A. We also know that many Pi Phis individually will wish to help in making our building serviceable and beautiful. Should some one lean to the practical rather than the aesthetic, two thousand dollars will provide a kitchen with the type cabinets and tables highly recommended for institutional work. For many of us less fortunate financially, there are lamps, small scatter rugs, hangings, separate chairs, tables, even sofas and dining room furniture, all needed to create a useful whole. Furnishing is in the hands of a committee and the money may be sent to Mrs. Thomas E. Graham, 3324 W. 18th Street, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the Committee Treasurer. In the planning of the Staff House and the steps taken toward construction, we would express our great appreciation to Miss Jessie W. Harris, Miss Henrietta Sivyer, Miss Ruth Buckley, Miss Marian Heard, all of the University of Tennessee College of Home Economics and Mr. Warren T. Smith for the time and effort each has expended for Pi Beta Phi. Their counsel has been of inestimable value. The 1952 Workshop with Marian G. Heard of the University of Tennessee again serving as Director offers two three week sessions. Conducted as it is, in conjunction with the University, classes are on a university level for those desiring credit, while non-credit students are also welcome. This year, courses offered are Jewelry, Metal Work, introductory, advanced and rug Weaving, Pottery and Woodworking. Students from seventeen states are in attendance. A member of Pi Beta Phi, Mary Elizabeth Sullivan, heads the weaving section and two Pi Phis, Caroline Edmonds, California B, and Esther Breckinridge, Iowa r, are serving as Graduate Assistants. We are pleased that Marian Heard, whom we almost claim as our own, was elected President of the Southern Highlands' Guild for the current year. Having had so much to do with the encouragement of the crafts in that area, through the years, Pi Beta Phi continues to hold an important place in Guild activities. It is said that having a party is ever good for the house and so it proved in the fall when Gatlinburg entertained all the Governors of the United States for their annual conference. Merchants and townspeople cleaned and polished until the town shone and the whole affair brought wide and favorable comment. Pi Beta Phi loaned its Health Center and the surrounding grounds for a small Craftsmen's Fair where local craftsmen demonstrated their arts. Inside, a fine exhibit of finished products was arranged. This fair and exhibition was enjoyed by the Governors and their families because it was typical of the district. Were one ever to hear that our work is finished in Gatlinburg, one has but to think back on all that we do there. Think first of the place we hold in the fraternity world for having established a type of service outside our own organization; then the benefits of our Health program, relieving the over-taxed doctors of school Inspections, inoculations and consultations on minor ailments or accidents, or the advice given on ore-natal care or to the mothers of little babies, or the First Aid to the school children, day after day; the program of sanitation, disease prevention and health preservation would have a tremendous set-back,were the Health Center work to he withdrawn. The '`Workshop program in Crafts has just begun and has a large future, should we wish to expand it; the departure of many students to many states makes possible a wide-spread knowledge of the fraternity's influence on the handicrafts of the area. It means prestige for us when we display and sell the beautiful articles made for our Arrowcraft Shop and distributed all over the United States. It does not necessarily follow that we shall always have direct obligations along the lines of secondary education for the Gatlinburg school system, but when one is in Gatlinburg and talks with the older established residents or the doctors, rather than the new-comers in business on the street, eager for tourist trade but with less knowledge of the long .develop-meat of the town itself, one knows that we are needed. We ask each of the members of the Staff to contribute some of her own free time toward community or social service and the demands upon them are tremendous. The future program may change in many respects but we could ill afford to discontinue our interests. With the majority of fraternity members believing in the School and the work done there, we must continue our support to the best ..of our ability. It takes the cooperation of everyone to "lighten the load." Working and planning together for the Settlement School closely unites a Committee and Staff and results in respect for each one's capabilities and affection for each other. This coming year, we shall sorely miss from the Committee, Olivia Smith Moore of Texarkana, Texas who has been our most capable treasurer and friend, and Harriet Goodsell Rauch of New York City whose excellent publicity is familiar to all through the ARROW. To take their places, Grand Council appointed Theresa Graham of Oklahoma City as Treasurer and Virginia Brackett Green of Indianapolis. Mrs. Green will edit "News of Lillie Pigeon' and handle public relations. In addition to losing Lillian Howell as Assistant to the Director we also regret the resignation of Mrs. Eunice Cole from her duties as book-keeper at. Arrow-craft. She resigns to assist her husband in their business. Replacing them next fall we shall have two Pi Phis: Joan Newcomer, Kansas B, will become Miss Dyer's Assistant and Katherine McIntosh, Alabama B will take the position of Book-keeper and Assistant to Mrs. Snow at Arrowcraft. Pi beta Phis are particularly welcome both as teachers or on the regular staff and applications may be placed with the Director at any time. For the time this Chairman has served on the Committee, Amy B. Onken by appointment from the Council, has been the contact member. In an extremely heavy schedule she has found immediate time to answer a call for assistance or to give of her in-formation to benefit the School. The Committee is grateful for her help as well as that of the Council and the Province officers in sending can to you the month by month happenings at the Settlement School. The evidence of their assistance in keeping you in-formed manifests itself in your growing interest in this memorial to our Founders. Our Founders believed in our School and in those who outlined its development, Their prayers were for a lasting project which, in some form, would keep Pi Beta Phi fore-most in the fraternity world for its philanthropy. Let us keep it so. May future planners have "the heart to conceive, the understanding to direct, and the hand to execute." RUTH BARRETT SMITH THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1952 65 LFE is not a little bundle of big things, but a big bundle of little things." This statement from a newspaper column seems a fitting theme for my annual report. While big things have been accomplished in the village and at the school, it is the little things that make up the big bundle of daily happenings at the Settlement School. From humble beginnings of forty years ago, our project has grown and changed with the years, the program adapting to the new phases of life in a rapidly growing community. Community The year has marked an extensive program among the different churches for improvement to their buildings. Now we have several fine churches that are a credit to any town. The new Baptist Church of Crab Orchard stone in modern design has been completed. The beautiful pipe organ which is equipped with chimes, was the gift of Mrs. Mary Huff in memory of her husband, Andy Huff. The Methodist congregation has built a beautiful new parsonage and also purchased a parking lot behind the church. The little Episcopal Church has had a number of gifts. A pipe organ from Mrs. Ethel Voorheis Murry and a beautiful hand-woven dossal in ecclesiastical red from Tina McMorran were two of these. The Roaring Fork Baptist Church finished their basement and the little Primitive Baptist Church was repaired and painted. There has been great activity in the construction of new motels and tourist courts. Owners of existing courts have added new units and remodeled their old cabins until the town is very well supplied with fine accommodations for the tourists. People here complain of a poor season, but to the casual observer it does not seem that way. Statistics at the Park show an increase in visitors over last year. Perhaps we are reaching a saturation point. New shops have been added to the many in town and outside on the highways. Several of the new courts and shops show the influence of an architect who has moved to the community. He is Mr. Hubert Bebb, brother of Douglass Bebb of Buckhorn Inn. It is too bad that he did not come sooner, for his work is a distinct addition to the town. One bundle that could be called Big was made up of three factors. These were, the flash flood of September first, the Governor's Conference of the week of October first, and the Gatlinburg Craft Show held the same week. The flood made cleaning up for the Conference much harder, and the Craft Show was one of the factors in the entertainment of the visitors. The sudden, destructive flood was caused by a cloudburst in the mountains above the Alum Cave Trail. Ten inches of water fell in about an hour. Fortunately, no lives were lost, but the highway across the mountains was closed for eight days before temporary repairs could be made. Much damage was done to properties along the river, especially in the lower end of town. The water made the Greystone lawn into a lake, was over the railing of the Greystone Bridge, and made the highway into Knoxville accessible only to a jeep or a boat. The waters backed up Baskins Creek, but did not touch our property. When it receded, it left much debris and muck behind. Everyone worked, and by October first the town never looked better. We had perfect weather all the week of the Conference. The Governors' parties were housed in the four hotels, the press had quarters in certain designated motels, and the highway patrolmen had other courts assigned to them. For that week Gatlinburg was the center ofmuch activity. Because everyone worked together, this small town was able to entertain our distinguished guests. Banquets were held at different hotels, but the china and silver and even the waitresses of all the hotels appeared at the one where the function was being held. To provide entertainment for the wives of the governors and others not too busy with conferences, the local shops put on a Craft exhibition. The Health Center was used for the exhibit of outstanding examples of weaving, wood work, and other crafts. Behind the building and on the lawn were umbrellas and tents housing weavers, basket makers, broom makers, woodworkers, and others. No admission was charged, and hostesses were on hand to tell the guests about the craft industry in this locality. One of the interesting things about this was that some local and rural people came and, for. the first time, were made to realize what was going on and how their own skill fitted into the whole picture. The Chamber of Commerce made a great effort to extend the season at both ends. In the fall a group of Marble Dealers held a convention the week after the Governors had been here, and in the early spring we had meetings of the Wilson Club of America, a District Rotary convention and the Second Wildflower Pilgrimage. The bird lovers had continuous rain but hunted new species with great ardor. The other groups had better luck. During the dull season, the local people have made it a practice to stage. different benefit parties. This year the Polio Benefit netted much more than it had before, but the one for the village library brought considerably less. The Episcopal Guild had a game party one night that helped them put the slate roof on their new church and provided a good time besides. In December, the Garden Club held an unusually good show of flower arrangements and of the winter greens that grow in such abundance in this area. This group and the Rotary Club placed a number of concrete benches along the Parkway for the benefit of the tourists. The usual union services were held by the town churches at Thanksgiving and Christmas. On Easter, besides the sunrise service, there was an egg hunt for all the local children at the Whittle place. A new Park Superintendent was appointed for our Park. He is Mr. John. C. Preston from Mount Rainier National Park near Seattle. A survey and revaluation of property in town for taxation purposes and more talk of a village sewer system show that there is civic interest in the community. School A review of the school year brings to mind many little things the day-to-day routine of any school system which is highlighted by certain events of importance. Mr. Walter Ogle served his second year as principal, and we had Mrs. Ann Lighter for assistant principal. She returned after a year's leave of absence to have charge of the library and to teach junior and senior English. We have always been proud of our library, which is called the Grace Coolidge Library. We are especially proud of it since it has been so much improved by a number of changes. By taking out a partition between the library and an adjoining class room, the room was enlarged and space made for four new tables. The County paid for the carpenter work, the tables and the chairs. The tables are birch and were made in Mr. Cole's woodworking shop. They are beautiful. Mrs. Benjamin Weir, Illinois Z, who has made several fine gifts to the library, had made 66 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW an additional gift of $100 which we had been saving for something special. .New shelving seemed very necessary, and with this gift, $50 from Committee, and help from the County, we have entire new shelving in the room. We were very fortunate that Mr. Lighter, who is the husband of the librarian, has a hobby of woodworking. He made these shelves in our Craft Shop. They are made to scale to fit into each available space and are very well made. The library has to serve as a classroom, but with the L-shape can be used at the same time for study. Interested Pi Phi alumna clubs, active chapters and individuals have added many volumes to our book collection. Mrs. Lighter has a special Memorial Shelf where books that have been given in memory of Pi Phis have an honored place. These books are often special -volumes that are too expensive to be acquired in the ordinary way. The Washington D. C. Alumnae Club has a practice of sending a book to the School instead of giving flowers at the death of a member. Mrs. Lighter can secure such good discounts and often wants some special book, so a gift of money can be spent most advantageously. More books came to the School from Texas A and from the Lexington, Kentucky Alumnae Club. These were sorted and placed where they could best be used. Many juvenile books were put in the new elementary building to form a collection for the use of the teachers in the lower grades. Books get pretty hard wear from the little folk, and it is fine to have new material to place on the tables in their rooms for them to read and enjoy. These gifts made it possible to discard some books that were really worn out. Departmentalization in the seventh and eighth grades worked a little better than it did last year. Mr. Tip Robertson had the eighth grade home room and coached the boys' basketball team. Miss Hazel Watson, daughter of Richard, our farm manager, had the seventh grade and coached the girls' team. Hazel graduated from Berea College and did a very good job in her first teaching assignment. Both of the junior basketball teams made excellent records. The high school freshman English teacher had these two grades in that subject and their other studies were divided between the two home room teachers. The work in business was taught by Mr. Jack Miller. In the second semester he added a course in Business Law to the curriculum. Mrs. Ruth Owenby and Mr. Mark Grim have been good members of our faculty for several years, and both did their part in helping make the teaching pro-gram a good one. The home economics department was in charge of Miss Joan McCready, an Iowa State College graduate. She was an outstanding teacher and gave the girls some very practical instruction in sewing and cooking. Miss Hodgen and I both felt that the dormitory girls learned more under her than they had previously. The arts and crafts program was carried on under great difficulty. Not in the woodworking department, for Mr. Carl Huskey had a good class of boys who did some very nice work in producing small articles of furniture. A late resignation by the art teacher made it difficult to find the proper person for our program, but Miss Dorothy Deiss came down from New York, where she had just finished work for her master's degree in time to start the second week of school. She was a teacher of outstanding ability and gave some fine service to the school, but she did not feel that she could carry on the work after the first semester. The high school classes had to have the credit, so we were fortunate in securing Mrs. Charm Hadley, wife of Dr. Jervis Hadley, park geologist, to teach just those twoclasses. Mrs. Hadley has an art degree and had taught the subject, so we were well pleased with that arrangement. In March, Ann Smith came from the University of Tennessee to take over the entire program, the very day she graduated. Ann had been a Workshop student the summer before, came back to Workshop this summer, and is to teach for us next year. She was a happy solution to that difficulty. Mrs. Armstrong again had the classes in music. She had a good chorus of high school students, a girls' glee club, and gave two very fine programs. The annual operetta was called "The Frog Prince." It was as cute as it could be. We were glad that the Committee was in town to see the younger children in their clever costumes and to hear their sweet young voices. The town is still talking about the Christmas program, for it was one of the finest we have ever had at the school. Miss Deiss and her students helped with the staging. They made the "Talking Christmas Tree" and the papier rnache reindeer, Santa and his sleigh. The reindeer were almost life-size. They won a blue ribbon for the Arts and Crafts department in the Garden Club show and were much admired in the lobby of the Mountain View Hotel during the holiday season. Mr. Hartford Granitz taught the classes in health, coached the girls' and boys' basketball teams in the high school, and helped with the football pro-gram. No spectacular results came from either sport, but this was due to the material he had to work with rather than from his work. The School has long felt the need of a band, and for the first time, a start has been made toward that project. The Rotary Club acted as sponsor, and a Knoxville firm provided the instruments on a six weeks rental-trial basis. At the end of that time, the rent paid was applied on the price of the instrument. A good start was made, and they even had a concert to show progress. Now the school board is trying to find a band director who can also teach some academic subject, and thus be on the regular payroll. This year, we again cooperated with the University of Tennessee in having a group of student practice teachers work at the school for six weeks. The young people were mostly preparing for elementary teaching positions and worked with our grade school teachers to their mutual advantage. In order to foster professional interest, an active in-service training program was instituted for the faculty and five meetings were held. One of these was a county-wide meeting held at our School. Mrs. Lighter was chosen to serve on an important committee of educators who spent one week in intensive evaluation of Rule High School in Knoxville. Their findings will be a help to the whole area. The Junior play was "Little Women" and was very well cast and produced. The Seniors chose "Johnny on the Spot" for their play. It was fun to see a tall mountain lad play the part of the returned soldier who against his will was posing as a great hero. Room parties for the grade school children at the Christmas and Valentine seasons, the high school basketball, football, and Junior banquets were all Big things that brought gayety and happiness into the regular school program. The Senior Class of twenty-two members made a trip to Washington, D. C., with a stopover at Luray Caverns in Virginia. They had been well-briefed before they left school in the historical and scenic wonders they were to see. Even the arrow on Mrs. Coolidge's dress caught their notice when they visited the Smithsonian Institute and saw the wax figures of the Presidents' wives. The Baccalaureate service was held in the new Baptist Church with a fine speaker and lovely music by the girls' glee club. Class night THE SEPTEMBER ARROW and Commencement followed, both being held in our auditorium. A number of the class are planning on going to college this fall. Most of them have positions in restaurants, shops, or hotels this summer. P.T There had been a growing sentiment against raising money for P.T.A. projects by holding Bingo games both here in town and in the state organization. The new Baptist minister, Rev. J. B. Carter, very much disapproved. and this year the games were given up. Revenue has come from three rummage sales that brought in about $350.00 and from a Minstrel Show that netted the same amount. This was given two nights in the High School gym and was a gala affair. A surprising amount of local talent gave an outstanding performance. Marjorie Chalmers and Lillian Hansen of our staff were in the cast. The pharmacist at one of the drug stores directed the show. The P.T.A. again operated the school lunch program under the efficient management of Mrs. Grace Morell. They contributed the proceeds of one rummage sale to the school library and have a surplus to spend for some worthy cause next year. The monthly programs were interesting and in several instances brought many fathers to the meetings. Sue Huff Cox served as President, Lillian was Secretary, and Mrs. Henrietta Huff was Program chairman for the year. Two study meetings were held at Teachers' Cottage with the Director serving as discussion leader. At these meetings every-one brought their own sandwiches, and Miss Hodgen provided cake and coffee for dessert one time, and the other time Sue baked the cake. Dormitory We had twelve dormitory students during the year, nine girls and three boys. Seven of these were fresh-.men and new to group living. It took a couple of months for them to lose some of their shyness and to learn what was expected of them. Before the year was over, they felt at home and contributed their part toward running the place. The girls esnecially helped with work in the kitchen and dining room and did very well when we were without a cook, by preparing breakfast and helping at supper time. We have had a serious time with help shortages. I do not know what we would have done without Miss Hodgen to take over when we had no cook. Lillian Hansen, my assist-ant, chaperoned the girls and taught them many things they should always remember. We entertained at several nice dinners during the year. Committee members were with us one evening and we also had the annual dinner for the Commencement speaker, the County Superintendent, and others. I entertained all of the teachers at tea, early in the fall, and when the student teachers came, we had another get-together for them, the faculty and our staff. We have a number of foreign visitors each year who come to see our school as an example of a good Craft Center. Last fall a group of South American students were here. They talked to the students at a special assembly and had a public exhibition of crafts they had brought from their own countries. Later that evening, we invited interested friends to meet the group at Teachers' Cottage and served doughnuts and coffee. We have entertained guests from Egypt, China, England, and Austria, some of them for overnight stops. They always bring much of interest to us, and I know carry away knowledge that will help them in their different work. Stuart College living room has again served as a piano studio for a private teacher whose pupils get excused from class work to take les-sons during school hours. The girls of Lillian's Scout troop held their annu Silver Tea at Stuart, and also held their Christm party there. The Dormitory students had several pz ties, and the whole family went on several picnic One of these was a rather damp one when we all car back to Stuart to eat our dessert and have a surpri shower for Lillian and her fiance, Harry W. Howe Health Center Of all the varied services contributed by the Et ternity to the community, none is more important th that rendered by our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmei She presides over our modern little Health Cent where several important local clinics are held ea, year. Two of these are the pre-school clinic for ch. dren entering school for the first time, and the visit the state mobile X-ray unit for chest examinations. , the latter visit, over 1000 people were X-rayed in ol day. This is a great number for this small town, b is due to the number of people who work in resc restaurants and hotels and must have a health car Marjorie has taught classes in child care to the soph more home economics class and to Lillian's Sco troop. Another Scout troop had lessons in First Ai The daily visits of the school children for Fii Aid, home visits, health talks given and pictures shwa in the rural schools, all seem like everyday, liti things, but when a summary is made of the wo done over a long period of time, we have a B bundle. Some startling figures came to light wh records of the past twenty years were consulted and tabulation made. Field Visits 23,5 Office Calls 41,31 First Aid Dressings ;5,3: Inoculations 1,1, Physical Examinations and Pupil Inspections 54,6 Health Talks 2,11 Newspaper Articles (5 years) The state of Tennessee furnishes the serums for Ma. orie's work, and we receive gifts from other sour( that help with the program. Outside our own chaptc and alumnae clubs, who are most generous with cif the greatest source of income is from Sigma P Gamma, international sorority. This group sends t Council of Southern Mountain Workers a sum money each year to be used for health work in t mountains. Last year this was $1350. Our share of tl amount was over $50. Individual chapters of that ( ganization adopt our project as the special center receive their welfare gifts. In money this amounts quite a sum during the year, and they also send tool brushes and other items that the nurse can use in 1-work. They have provided glasses for a number children who could not otherwise afford them. T shelves at the Health Center that are reserved i "give-aways" need frequent replenishing, especia for baby items and for clean, used clothing for sm children. Just last week, Marjorie was telephoning l friends and scurrying around to find a layette fox new baby. Farm Richard Watson was in charge of the garden, i chickens and our livestock, which consists of t mules and six pigs. The chickens provide us w meat and eggs for the table, the pigs are our prix garbage disposal unit, and the mules we use wh, people on level ground would use a tractor. 'I garden provides us with fresh vegetables, and w.17 68 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW the new staff house took away a good garden spot, we still have good potatoes on a hillside above the chicken houses. The Dormitory boys help wherever they are needed in keeping up the place. Arrowcraft Shop With the many craft shops now operating in Gatlin-burg, our shop occupies a unique position. We are one of three Guild shops in town, and since our merchandise is all of superior workmanship and quality-, we attract the more discriminating tourists. Sometimes our five o'clock closing hour and the fact that we are never open on Sunday causes a disappointment for people whose stay in town is limited. Longer hours would mean more employees and be too hard on the regular staff. Our big order business' with alumna Clubs and active chapters keeps everyone working at top speed all during .the fall shipping season. Last summer, many clubs ordered even' before the new price list had been sent to them. August was the heaviest .month's business in the history of the shop. In addition to the summer tourist customers, 42 club orders were filled and there were about ten others waiting to be shipped. In November, the weavers' pay roll was $5600, an all-time high. Still, there were shortages in some items, for try as we will to plan ahead, no one is a mind reader to foretell just what items will be most in demand. Some club chairmen order too optimistically, and if everything is not sold or returned promptly, some other club may be short some items. Many Arrowcraft articles were displayed in the exhibits at the Craftsman's Fair in Asheville, N. C., and ' we sent Tina McMorran and Wanda Ogle to demonstrate weaving, and Edna Cook for the sales room. Last fall, the Qatlinburg Craft Exhibit held during the Governors' Conference meant much extra work. Ethel Snow was in charge of the demonstrations. Arrowcraft furnished two demonstrators, one for weaving and one for warping. The Elmer Kear family, makers of our brooms, were there, .and Mat and Mary L. Owenby put on a chair-making demonstration. Pi Phi's gift: to each Governor's lady was a handwoven, ' white linen guest towel which was wrapped and sent to their hotel rooms., That same month we sent articles to; the Tennessee Annual Craft Exhibit and Sale at the University of Tennessee. ' In the ' spring during the Wilson Club Convention, we,were asked to have. a display of our weavings in the lobby of the Mountain.View Hotel, Edna helped Mrs. McCutchan in the Hotel Shop that' .'day ' and answered questions about the exhibit. The.', interior arrangement of the ,Arr'owcraft'shop has been changed by ;moving the bed into ,the second sales "room and by having a . room with a pretty Warp on it in the main sales room. Tina and Mary Elizabeth' Sullivan, one of the Workshop 'Teachers and also a Pi Phi, wove two screens for window display that are very interesting. They are' made of hardwood ;strips held together with a. gay warp. The windows were especially pretty during the Christmas season. An unusual creche made entirely of corn stalks, candles, and native greens were used. The Weavers' Annual Christmas party brought a large attendance. The program of carols by a group of school children, harp-singing, and the gift exchange were held at Stuart Cottage. Refreshments were served at the. dining rental tables and at extra card tables in Pollard. Tina spent a week in New York attending exhibitions, gaining inspiration for new designs. One recognition for her work was an article in the Spring and Summer Quarterly of . cCall's Magazine on her work, in which our. aprons and bags were pictured in color. Summer Activities An event of early summer was the June wedding of roy.aassistant, Lillian Hansen, and Harry W. Howell. The ceremony Was performed in the Episcopal Church, with the reception at the Greystone Playhouse. Lillian has made a place for herself in the hearts of all the community by her work at the School and her outside activities with the Girl Scouts and the Episcopal church group. Everyone was glad to wish her well, and to have the assurance that she 'would stay on with the School until September when Harry goes to Atlanta to take advanced work in architecture at Georgia Tech. Mr. Richards and his Gateway Players again used the gymnasium for summer stock. The plays provided good entertainment for the summer people. The 1951 Workshop was the most successful one we have ever had both in quality of the students and in the work produced. We had people from 26 states, represented by the staff and student body. A number were Pi Phis, but not as many as we would like to have. if our own members could attend a session of the Workshop, working and playing with the group, enjoying the outings and the daily fellowship in the dining room, it would be the greatest boost we could have. One has to be here to realize what a wonderful Craft School we have. . This summer we have watched the progress of our lovely new Staff House with great interest. The work has progressed with very little delay from lack of materials and. each week shows progress. Workshop students were interested in, that they will. have the facilities of the larger dining room next summer. In this summary of tle.y*car's pork, the little thing~, both ,good xnd had, crowd. my memory. Some of the things in the 'Good bundle are the gifts' at Christmas time and through the year from alum= clubs, active chapters and individual Pi Phis, the many .pleasant contact~ ith interested visitors, and the faithfulness of our loyal employees. These far outweigh the bad things,, the discouragernents and problems of maintenance And help in running the Settlement School.

Committee Reports Holt House Committee IT IS the feeling of the Committee that Holt House has, during the year now closing, well served its purpose as a modest shrine dedicated to the memory of the Founders of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and as a gracious house which renders valuable, and valued, service to the community where that fraternity was founded eighty-five years ago. During the year, Holt House was used sixty-six times as a meeting place for organizations or to pro-vide accommodations for private entertaining on thirty-one of these occasions by groups affiliated with the fraternity. The chapters in the vicinity used the house for rushing parties, formal parties, cooky-shines, pledge parties, teas and for initiation. Thirty-one members of Illinois Eta visited the house in a group. The alumnae clubs of the area and the Illinois Alpha Mothers' Club held regular meetings, suppers, cooky-shines and teas there. Three other alumnae clubs came from distant points to hold special meetings there; and one distant club paid a visit to the house. It is the hope of the Committee that these groups and other distant clubs and chapters will make arrangements to visit Holt House during the year ahead, for they are most welcome. The house also accommodated, on thirty-five occasions, groups and individuals not connected with the Fraternity organization. Groups meeting there with regularity were the PEO, the DAR, the 0GM Bridge Club and the Monmouth Women's Club. A number of other organizations used the house on one occasion, or more. Holt House also provided a gracious setting for teas, showers, parties and wed-ding receptions given by individuals. A number of lovely gifts for the house were received during the year. The Committee is very grateful to Fannie Bradford Bailey who gave to Holt House the antique oil portraits of her grandparents, Major and Mrs. Holt. These portraits had previously been loaned, by Mrs. Bailey. The Springfield, Illinois, Alumnae Club presented a fine silver tray which was greatly needed. The Spokane, Washington, Alumnae Club very thoughtfully gave a beautiful little antique English silver "sweets basket" in memory of Eloise Ohme Moffatt, one of their younger members who was also a Pi Phi daughter. Mrs Moffat's name was en-graved on the little basket which was placed on the melodeon in the Victorian Parlor. The Burlington-Fort Madison, Iowa, Club, after holding a meeting in the house, presented a lovely antique shadow box which is to display old I. C. and Pi Phi pins. The alumna of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, made a gift of a small check with which to buy something for the house, at the time of their meeting there; and a member of the Avon-Bushnell, Illinois, group left two pairs of pretty, old pillow shams at the conclusion of their meeting in Holt House. To all these donors, the Committee is most grateful for their gifts and for their thoughtful interest in the house. The house itself is in good condition, only minor repairs being ,required during the year. The folding chairs, ordered some time ago, were received in the summer of 1951 and have been put to use many times. A number of replacements will be necessary during the coming year: new ruffled curtains have been ordered for the Founders' Room; several pieces of furniture will need to be re-covered; and the stair carpeting must soon be replaced. Also, the Victorian Parlor will need to be re-papered. The Committee will bevery grateful for nineteenth century photographs of members, to be placed in the velvet covered albums received last year; and for old I. C. or Pi Phi pins, to be placed in the shadow box received recently. Such items may be either loaned or presented to the house and will add a great deal to its small treasury of mementos of the early days of Pi Beta Phi. Mabel T. Johnson, who came to Holt House as hostess in December of 1950, keeps the house and its furnishings in excellent condition. She has assumed all the responsibilities of her position in splendid fashion and acts with graciousness and hospitality. Mrs. Johnson is well aware of the purpose and function of Holt House, having been a Monmouth resident all of her life. The Committee feels that the Fraternity is fortunate in having her as hostess and is glad to report that she is apparently happy in her association with Pi Beta Phi. The Committee is sincerely grateful to the many chapters and clubs which have contributed to the support of Holt House this year. The number of clubs contributing to the fund is, however; fewer, by nine, than the total of two-hundred twenty-two clubs which contributed during the preceding year. Among the clubs, the highest contributor was KansaS ' City, Missouri, with a gift of $50.00. The Spokane, Washing-ton, Club gave almost this exact amount for the purchase of a special memorial gift. The second highest contributor to the general fund was the Everett, Washington, Club which gave $30.00. Springfield, Illinois, gave this amount, too, for the purchase of a special gift for the house; in addition to their regular contribution to the fund. The Monmouth, Illinois, alumna group gave $25.00, the third highest contribution to the general fund. Many other clubs were very generous in their gifts. The number of chapters supporting the house in-creased from eighty-five during 1950-51 to eighty-nine during 1951-52. The highest contributing chap ters were: California $50.00 Louisiana A 50.00 Oklahoma A 35.00 Tennessee B 30.00 Illinois A 25.00 Kansas B 25.00 Texas A 25.00 As was also true last year, every chapter and every club in Delta Province and in Zeta Province contributed to the Holt House Fund. In addition to these provinces, in Alpha West, Gamma, Epsilon. Eta and Kappa Provinces, every chapter contributed ; and in Iota Province every club contributed. Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, followed by Eta Province in second place and by Mu Province, third. It is with extreme regret 'that the Holt House Committee announces the recent death of Evelyn Holliday Bridge who served as Committee Secretary during the past two years. Her interest in the house and in the work of the Committee was unfailing. Her efforts in behalf of the house continued, in spite of her illness, until a few months before her death. Her loss will be deeply felt. Alice McDougall Jensen, Monmouth member of the Committee, has, through her presence in Mon 77

        64 THE SEPTEMBER RRt \h'' two of their most loyal charter members. This was the beginning of an idea. Without cur-tailing the amount of regular contributions so necessary for operation, we are asking that every chapter and club give consideration toward a special contribution for the furnishing of some room of the house. This would celebrate forty years of existence and could honor some fine alumna of your chapter or club, as did Maryland A. We also know that many Pi Phis individually will wish to help in making our building serviceable and beautiful. Should some one lean to the practical rather than the aesthetic, two thousand dollars will provide a kitchen with the type cabinets and tables highly recommended for institutional work. For many of us less fortunate financially, there are lamps, small scatter rugs, hangings, separate chairs, tables, even sofas and dining room furniture, all needed to create a useful whole. Furnishing is in the hands of a committee and the money may be sent to Mrs. Thomas E. Graham, 3324 W. 18th Street, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the Committee Treasurer. In the planning of the Staff House and the steps taken toward construction, we would express our great appreciation to Miss Jessie W. Harris, Miss Henrietta Sivyer, Miss Ruth Buckley, Miss Marian Heard, all of the University of Tennessee College of Home Economics and Mr. Warren T. Smith for the time and effort each has expended for Pi Beta Phi. Their counsel has been of inestimable value. The 1952 Workshop with Marian G. Heard of the University of Tennessee again serving as Director offers two three week sessions. Conducted as it is, in conjunction with the University, classes are on a university level for those desiring credit, while non-credit students are also welcome. This year, courses offered are Jewelry, Metal Work, introductory, advanced and rug Weaving, Pottery and Woodworking. Students from seventeen states are in attendance. A member of Pi Beta Phi, Mary Elizabeth Sullivan, heads the weaving section and two Pi Phis, Caroline Edmonds, California B, and Esther Breckinridge, Iowa r, are serving as Graduate Assistants. We are pleased that Marian Heard, whom we almost claim as our own, was elected President of the Southern Highlands' Guild for the current year. Having had so much to do with the encouragement of the crafts in that area, through the years, Pi Beta Phi continues to hold an important place in Guild activities. It is said that having a party is ever good for the house and so it proved in the fall when Gatlinburg entertained all the Governors of the United States for their annual conference. Merchants and townspeople cleaned and polished until the town shone and the whole affair brought wide and favorable comment. Pi Beta Phi loaned its Health Center and the surrounding grounds for a small Craftsmen's Fair where local craftsmen demonstrated their arts. Inside, a fine exhibit of finished products was arranged. This fair and exhibition was enjoyed by the Governors and their families because it was typical of the district. Were one ever to hear that our work is finished in Gatlinburg, one has but to think back on all that we do there. Think first of the place we hold in the fraternity world for having established a type of service outside our own organization; then the benefits of our Health program, relieving the over-taxed doctors of school Inspections, inoculations and consultations on minor ailments or accidents, or the advice given on ore-natal care or to the mothers of little babies, or the First Aid to the school children, day after day; the program of sanitation, disease prevention and health preservation would have a tremendous set-back,were the Health Center work to he withdrawn. The '`Workshop program in Crafts has just begun and has a large future, should we wish to expand it; the departure of many students to many states makes possible a wide-spread knowledge of the fraternity's influence on the handicrafts of the area. It means prestige for us when we display and sell the beautiful articles made for our Arrowcraft Shop and distributed all over the United States. It does not necessarily follow that we shall always have direct obligations along the lines of secondary education for the Gatlinburg school system, but when one is in Gatlinburg and talks with the older established residents or the doctors, rather than the new-comers in business on the street, eager for tourist trade but with less knowledge of the long .develop-meat of the town itself, one knows that we are needed. We ask each of the members of the Staff to contribute some of her own free time toward community or social service and the demands upon them are tremendous. The future program may change in many respects but we could ill afford to discontinue our interests. With the majority of fraternity members believing in the School and the work done there, we must continue our support to the best ..of our ability. It takes the cooperation of everyone to "lighten the load." Working and planning together for the Settlement School closely unites a Committee and Staff and results in respect for each one's capabilities and affection for each other. This coming year, we shall sorely miss from the Committee, Olivia Smith Moore of Texarkana, Texas who has been our most capable treasurer and friend, and Harriet Goodsell Rauch of New York City whose excellent publicity is familiar to all through the ARROW. To take their places, Grand Council appointed Theresa Graham of Oklahoma City as Treasurer and Virginia Brackett Green of Indianapolis. Mrs. Green will edit "News of Lillie Pigeon' and handle public relations. In addition to losing Lillian Howell as Assistant to the Director we also regret the resignation of Mrs. Eunice Cole from her duties as book-keeper at. Arrow-craft. She resigns to assist her husband in their business. Replacing them next fall we shall have two Pi Phis: Joan Newcomer, Kansas B, will become Miss Dyer's Assistant and Katherine McIntosh, Alabama B will take the position of Book-keeper and Assistant to Mrs. Snow at Arrowcraft. Pi beta Phis are particularly welcome both as teachers or on the regular staff and applications may be placed with the Director at any time. For the time this Chairman has served on the Committee, Amy B. Onken by appointment from the Council, has been the contact member. In an extremely heavy schedule she has found immediate time to answer a call for assistance or to give of her in-formation to benefit the School. The Committee is grateful for her help as well as that of the Council and the Province officers in sending can to you the month by month happenings at the Settlement School. The evidence of their assistance in keeping you in-formed manifests itself in your growing interest in this memorial to our Founders. Our Founders believed in our School and in those who outlined its development, Their prayers were for a lasting project which, in some form, would keep Pi Beta Phi fore-most in the fraternity world for its philanthropy. Let us keep it so. May future planners have "the heart to conceive, the understanding to direct, and the hand to execute." RUTH BARRETT SMITH THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1952 65 LFE is not a little bundle of big things, but a big bundle of little things." This statement from a newspaper column seems a fitting theme for my annual report. While big things have been accomplished in the village and at the school, it is the little things that make up the big bundle of daily happenings at the Settlement School. From humble beginnings of forty years ago, our project has grown and changed with the years, the program adapting to the new phases of life in a rapidly growing community. Community The year has marked an extensive program among the different churches for improvement to their buildings. Now we have several fine churches that are a credit to any town. The new Baptist Church of Crab Orchard stone in modern design has been completed. The beautiful pipe organ which is equipped with chimes, was the gift of Mrs. Mary Huff in memory of her husband, Andy Huff. The Methodist congregation has built a beautiful new parsonage and also purchased a parking lot behind the church. The little Episcopal Church has had a number of gifts. A pipe organ from Mrs. Ethel Voorheis Murry and a beautiful hand-woven dossal in ecclesiastical red from Tina McMorran were two of these. The Roaring Fork Baptist Church finished their basement and the little Primitive Baptist Church was repaired and painted. There has been great activity in the construction of new motels and tourist courts. Owners of existing courts have added new units and remodeled their old cabins until the town is very well supplied with fine accommodations for the tourists. People here complain of a poor season, but to the casual observer it does not seem that way. Statistics at the Park show an increase in visitors over last year. Perhaps we are reaching a saturation point. New shops have been added to the many in town and outside on the highways. Several of the new courts and shops show the influence of an architect who has moved to the community. He is Mr. Hubert Bebb, brother of Douglass Bebb of Buckhorn Inn. It is too bad that he did not come sooner, for his work is a distinct addition to the town. One bundle that could be called Big was made up of three factors. These were, the flash flood of September first, the Governor's Conference of the week of October first, and the Gatlinburg Craft Show held the same week. The flood made cleaning up for the Conference much harder, and the Craft Show was one of the factors in the entertainment of the visitors. The sudden, destructive flood was caused by a cloudburst in the mountains above the Alum Cave Trail. Ten inches of water fell in about an hour. Fortunately, no lives were lost, but the highway across the mountains was closed for eight days before temporary repairs could be made. Much damage was done to properties along the river, especially in the lower end of town. The water made the Greystone lawn into a lake, was over the railing of the Greystone Bridge, and made the highway into Knoxville accessible only to a jeep or a boat. The waters backed up Baskins Creek, but did not touch our property. When it receded, it left much debris and muck behind. Everyone worked, and by October first the town never looked better. We had perfect weather all the week of the Conference. The Governors' parties were housed in the four hotels, the press had quarters in certain designated motels, and the highway patrolmen had other courts assigned to them. For that week Gatlinburg was the center ofmuch activity. Because everyone worked together, this small town was able to entertain our distinguished guests. Banquets were held at different hotels, but the china and silver and even the waitresses of all the hotels appeared at the one where the function was being held. To provide entertainment for the wives of the governors and others not too busy with conferences, the local shops put on a Craft exhibition. The Health Center was used for the exhibit of outstanding examples of weaving, wood work, and other crafts. Behind the building and on the lawn were umbrellas and tents housing weavers, basket makers, broom makers, woodworkers, and others. No admission was charged, and hostesses were on hand to tell the guests about the craft industry in this locality. One of the interesting things about this was that some local and rural people came and, for. the first time, were made to realize what was going on and how their own skill fitted into the whole picture. The Chamber of Commerce made a great effort to extend the season at both ends. In the fall a group of Marble Dealers held a convention the week after the Governors had been here, and in the early spring we had meetings of the Wilson Club of America, a District Rotary convention and the Second Wildflower Pilgrimage. The bird lovers had continuous rain but hunted new species with great ardor. The other groups had better luck. During the dull season, the local people have made it a practice to stage. different benefit parties. This year the Polio Benefit netted much more than it had before, but the one for the village library brought considerably less. The Episcopal Guild had a game party one night that helped them put the slate roof on their new church and provided a good time besides. In December, the Garden Club held an unusually good show of flower arrangements and of the winter greens that grow in such abundance in this area. This group and the Rotary Club placed a number of concrete benches along the Parkway for the benefit of the tourists. The usual union services were held by the town churches at Thanksgiving and Christmas. On Easter, besides the sunrise service, there was an egg hunt for all the local children at the Whittle place. A new Park Superintendent was appointed for our Park. He is Mr. John. C. Preston from Mount Rainier National Park near Seattle. A survey and revaluation of property in town for taxation purposes and more talk of a village sewer system show that there is civic interest in the community. School A review of the school year brings to mind many little things the day-to-day routine of any school system which is highlighted by certain events of importance. Mr. Walter Ogle served his second year as principal, and we had Mrs. Ann Lighter for assistant principal. She returned after a year's leave of absence to have charge of the library and to teach junior and senior English. We have always been proud of our library, which is called the Grace Coolidge Library. We are especially proud of it since it has been so much improved by a number of changes. By taking out a partition between the library and an adjoining class room, the room was enlarged and space made for four new tables. The County paid for the carpenter work, the tables and the chairs. The tables are birch and were made in Mr. Cole's woodworking shop. They are beautiful. Mrs. Benjamin Weir, Illinois Z, who has made several fine gifts to the library, had made 66 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW an additional gift of $100 which we had been saving for something special. .New shelving seemed very necessary, and with this gift, $50 from Committee, and help from the County, we have entire new shelving in the room. We were very fortunate that Mr. Lighter, who is the husband of the librarian, has a hobby of woodworking. He made these shelves in our Craft Shop. They are made to scale to fit into each available space and are very well made. The library has to serve as a classroom, but with the L-shape can be used at the same time for study. Interested Pi Phi alumna clubs, active chapters and individuals have added many volumes to our book collection. Mrs. Lighter has a special Memorial Shelf where books that have been given in memory of Pi Phis have an honored place. These books are often special -volumes that are too expensive to be acquired in the ordinary way. The Washington D. C. Alumnae Club has a practice of sending a book to the School instead of giving flowers at the death of a member. Mrs. Lighter can secure such good discounts and often wants some special book, so a gift of money can be spent most advantageously. More books came to the School from Texas A and from the Lexington, Kentucky Alumnae Club. These were sorted and placed where they could best be used. Many juvenile books were put in the new elementary building to form a collection for the use of the teachers in the lower grades. Books get pretty hard wear from the little folk, and it is fine to have new material to place on the tables in their rooms for them to read and enjoy. These gifts made it possible to discard some books that were really worn out. Departmentalization in the seventh and eighth grades worked a little better than it did last year. Mr. Tip Robertson had the eighth grade home room and coached the boys' basketball team. Miss Hazel Watson, daughter of Richard, our farm manager, had the seventh grade and coached the girls' team. Hazel graduated from Berea College and did a very good job in her first teaching assignment. Both of the junior basketball teams made excellent records. The high school freshman English teacher had these two grades in that subject and their other studies were divided between the two home room teachers. The work in business was taught by Mr. Jack Miller. In the second semester he added a course in Business Law to the curriculum. Mrs. Ruth Owenby and Mr. Mark Grim have been good members of our faculty for several years, and both did their part in helping make the teaching pro-gram a good one. The home economics department was in charge of Miss Joan McCready, an Iowa State College graduate. She was an outstanding teacher and gave the girls some very practical instruction in sewing and cooking. Miss Hodgen and I both felt that the dormitory girls learned more under her than they had previously. The arts and crafts program was carried on under great difficulty. Not in the woodworking department, for Mr. Carl Huskey had a good class of boys who did some very nice work in producing small articles of furniture. A late resignation by the art teacher made it difficult to find the proper person for our program, but Miss Dorothy Deiss came down from New York, where she had just finished work for her master's degree in time to start the second week of school. She was a teacher of outstanding ability and gave some fine service to the school, but she did not feel that she could carry on the work after the first semester. The high school classes had to have the credit, so we were fortunate in securing Mrs. Charm Hadley, wife of Dr. Jervis Hadley, park geologist, to teach just those twoclasses. Mrs. Hadley has an art degree and had taught the subject, so we were well pleased with that arrangement. In March, Ann Smith came from the University of Tennessee to take over the entire program, the very day she graduated. Ann had been a Workshop student the summer before, came back to Workshop this summer, and is to teach for us next year. She was a happy solution to that difficulty. Mrs. Armstrong again had the classes in music. She had a good chorus of high school students, a girls' glee club, and gave two very fine programs. The annual operetta was called "The Frog Prince." It was as cute as it could be. We were glad that the Committee was in town to see the younger children in their clever costumes and to hear their sweet young voices. The town is still talking about the Christmas program, for it was one of the finest we have ever had at the school. Miss Deiss and her students helped with the staging. They made the "Talking Christmas Tree" and the papier rnache reindeer, Santa and his sleigh. The reindeer were almost life-size. They won a blue ribbon for the Arts and Crafts department in the Garden Club show and were much admired in the lobby of the Mountain View Hotel during the holiday season. Mr. Hartford Granitz taught the classes in health, coached the girls' and boys' basketball teams in the high school, and helped with the football pro-gram. No spectacular results came from either sport, but this was due to the material he had to work with rather than from his work. The School has long felt the need of a band, and for the first time, a start has been made toward that project. The Rotary Club acted as sponsor, and a Knoxville firm provided the instruments on a six weeks rental-trial basis. At the end of that time, the rent paid was applied on the price of the instrument. A good start was made, and they even had a concert to show progress. Now the school board is trying to find a band director who can also teach some academic subject, and thus be on the regular payroll. This year, we again cooperated with the University of Tennessee in having a group of student practice teachers work at the school for six weeks. The young people were mostly preparing for elementary teaching positions and worked with our grade school teachers to their mutual advantage. In order to foster professional interest, an active in-service training program was instituted for the faculty and five meetings were held. One of these was a county-wide meeting held at our School. Mrs. Lighter was chosen to serve on an important committee of educators who spent one week in intensive evaluation of Rule High School in Knoxville. Their findings will be a help to the whole area. The Junior play was "Little Women" and was very well cast and produced. The Seniors chose "Johnny on the Spot" for their play. It was fun to see a tall mountain lad play the part of the returned soldier who against his will was posing as a great hero. Room parties for the grade school children at the Christmas and Valentine seasons, the high school basketball, football, and Junior banquets were all Big things that brought gayety and happiness into the regular school program. The Senior Class of twenty-two members made a trip to Washington, D. C., with a stopover at Luray Caverns in Virginia. They had been well-briefed before they left school in the historical and scenic wonders they were to see. Even the arrow on Mrs. Coolidge's dress caught their notice when they visited the Smithsonian Institute and saw the wax figures of the Presidents' wives. The Baccalaureate service was held in the new Baptist Church with a fine speaker and lovely music by the girls' glee club. Class night THE SEPTEMBER ARROW and Commencement followed, both being held in our auditorium. A number of the class are planning on going to college this fall. Most of them have positions in restaurants, shops, or hotels this summer. P.T There had been a growing sentiment against raising money for P.T.A. projects by holding Bingo games both here in town and in the state organization. The new Baptist minister, Rev. J. B. Carter, very much disapproved. and this year the games were given up. Revenue has come from three rummage sales that brought in about $350.00 and from a Minstrel Show that netted the same amount. This was given two nights in the High School gym and was a gala affair. A surprising amount of local talent gave an outstanding performance. Marjorie Chalmers and Lillian Hansen of our staff were in the cast. The pharmacist at one of the drug stores directed the show. The P.T.A. again operated the school lunch program under the efficient management of Mrs. Grace Morell. They contributed the proceeds of one rummage sale to the school library and have a surplus to spend for some worthy cause next year. The monthly programs were interesting and in several instances brought many fathers to the meetings. Sue Huff Cox served as President, Lillian was Secretary, and Mrs. Henrietta Huff was Program chairman for the year. Two study meetings were held at Teachers' Cottage with the Director serving as discussion leader. At these meetings every-one brought their own sandwiches, and Miss Hodgen provided cake and coffee for dessert one time, and the other time Sue baked the cake. Dormitory We had twelve dormitory students during the year, nine girls and three boys. Seven of these were fresh-.men and new to group living. It took a couple of months for them to lose some of their shyness and to learn what was expected of them. Before the year was over, they felt at home and contributed their part toward running the place. The girls esnecially helped with work in the kitchen and dining room and did very well when we were without a cook, by preparing breakfast and helping at supper time. We have had a serious time with help shortages. I do not know what we would have done without Miss Hodgen to take over when we had no cook. Lillian Hansen, my assist-ant, chaperoned the girls and taught them many things they should always remember. We entertained at several nice dinners during the year. Committee members were with us one evening and we also had the annual dinner for the Commencement speaker, the County Superintendent, and others. I entertained all of the teachers at tea, early in the fall, and when the student teachers came, we had another get-together for them, the faculty and our staff. We have a number of foreign visitors each year who come to see our school as an example of a good Craft Center. Last fall a group of South American students were here. They talked to the students at a special assembly and had a public exhibition of crafts they had brought from their own countries. Later that evening, we invited interested friends to meet the group at Teachers' Cottage and served doughnuts and coffee. We have entertained guests from Egypt, China, England, and Austria, some of them for overnight stops. They always bring much of interest to us, and I know carry away knowledge that will help them in their different work. Stuart College living room has again served as a piano studio for a private teacher whose pupils get excused from class work to take les-sons during school hours. The girls of Lillian's Scout troop held their annu Silver Tea at Stuart, and also held their Christm party there. The Dormitory students had several pz ties, and the whole family went on several picnic One of these was a rather damp one when we all car back to Stuart to eat our dessert and have a surpri shower for Lillian and her fiance, Harry W. Howe Health Center Of all the varied services contributed by the Et ternity to the community, none is more important th that rendered by our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmei She presides over our modern little Health Cent where several important local clinics are held ea, year. Two of these are the pre-school clinic for ch. dren entering school for the first time, and the visit the state mobile X-ray unit for chest examinations. , the latter visit, over 1000 people were X-rayed in ol day. This is a great number for this small town, b is due to the number of people who work in resc restaurants and hotels and must have a health car Marjorie has taught classes in child care to the soph more home economics class and to Lillian's Sco troop. Another Scout troop had lessons in First Ai The daily visits of the school children for Fii Aid, home visits, health talks given and pictures shwa in the rural schools, all seem like everyday, liti things, but when a summary is made of the wo done over a long period of time, we have a B bundle. Some startling figures came to light wh records of the past twenty years were consulted and tabulation made. Field Visits 23,5 Office Calls 41,31 First Aid Dressings ;5,3: Inoculations 1,1, Physical Examinations and Pupil Inspections 54,6 Health Talks 2,11 Newspaper Articles (5 years) The state of Tennessee furnishes the serums for Ma. orie's work, and we receive gifts from other sour( that help with the program. Outside our own chaptc and alumnae clubs, who are most generous with cif the greatest source of income is from Sigma P Gamma, international sorority. This group sends t Council of Southern Mountain Workers a sum money each year to be used for health work in t mountains. Last year this was $1350. Our share of tl amount was over $50. Individual chapters of that ( ganization adopt our project as the special center receive their welfare gifts. In money this amounts quite a sum during the year, and they also send tool brushes and other items that the nurse can use in 1-work. They have provided glasses for a number children who could not otherwise afford them. T shelves at the Health Center that are reserved i "give-aways" need frequent replenishing, especia for baby items and for clean, used clothing for sm children. Just last week, Marjorie was telephoning l friends and scurrying around to find a layette fox new baby. Farm Richard Watson was in charge of the garden, i chickens and our livestock, which consists of t mules and six pigs. The chickens provide us w meat and eggs for the table, the pigs are our prix garbage disposal unit, and the mules we use wh, people on level ground would use a tractor. 'I garden provides us with fresh vegetables, and w.17 68 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW the new staff house took away a good garden spot, we still have good potatoes on a hillside above the chicken houses. The Dormitory boys help wherever they are needed in keeping up the place. Arrowcraft Shop With the many craft shops now operating in Gatlin-burg, our shop occupies a unique position. We are one of three Guild shops in town, and since our merchandise is all of superior workmanship and quality-, we attract the more discriminating tourists. Sometimes our five o'clock closing hour and the fact that we are never open on Sunday causes a disappointment for people whose stay in town is limited. Longer hours would mean more employees and be too hard on the regular staff. Our big order business' with alumna Clubs and active chapters keeps everyone working at top speed all during .the fall shipping season. Last summer, many clubs ordered even' before the new price list had been sent to them. August was the heaviest .month's business in the history of the shop. In addition to the summer tourist customers, 42 club orders were filled and there were about ten others waiting to be shipped. In November, the weavers' pay roll was $5600, an all-time high. Still, there were shortages in some items, for try as we will to plan ahead, no one is a mind reader to foretell just what items will be most in demand. Some club chairmen order too optimistically, and if everything is not sold or returned promptly, some other club may be short some items. Many Arrowcraft articles were displayed in the exhibits at the Craftsman's Fair in Asheville, N. C., and ' we sent Tina McMorran and Wanda Ogle to demonstrate weaving, and Edna Cook for the sales room. Last fall, the Qatlinburg Craft Exhibit held during the Governors' Conference meant much extra work. Ethel Snow was in charge of the demonstrations. Arrowcraft furnished two demonstrators, one for weaving and one for warping. The Elmer Kear family, makers of our brooms, were there, .and Mat and Mary L. Owenby put on a chair-making demonstration. Pi Phi's gift: to each Governor's lady was a handwoven, ' white linen guest towel which was wrapped and sent to their hotel rooms., That same month we sent articles to; the Tennessee Annual Craft Exhibit and Sale at the University of Tennessee. ' In the ' spring during the Wilson Club Convention, we,were asked to have. a display of our weavings in the lobby of the Mountain.View Hotel, Edna helped Mrs. McCutchan in the Hotel Shop that' .'day ' and answered questions about the exhibit. The.', interior arrangement of the ,Arr'owcraft'shop has been changed by ;moving the bed into ,the second sales "room and by having a . room with a pretty Warp on it in the main sales room. Tina and Mary Elizabeth' Sullivan, one of the Workshop 'Teachers and also a Pi Phi, wove two screens for window display that are very interesting. They are' made of hardwood ;strips held together with a. gay warp. The windows were especially pretty during the Christmas season. An unusual creche made entirely of corn stalks, candles, and native greens were used. The Weavers' Annual Christmas party brought a large attendance. The program of carols by a group of school children, harp-singing, and the gift exchange were held at Stuart Cottage. Refreshments were served at the. dining rental tables and at extra card tables in Pollard. Tina spent a week in New York attending exhibitions, gaining inspiration for new designs. One recognition for her work was an article in the Spring and Summer Quarterly of . cCall's Magazine on her work, in which our. aprons and bags were pictured in color. Summer Activities An event of early summer was the June wedding of roy.aassistant, Lillian Hansen, and Harry W. Howell. The ceremony Was performed in the Episcopal Church, with the reception at the Greystone Playhouse. Lillian has made a place for herself in the hearts of all the community by her work at the School and her outside activities with the Girl Scouts and the Episcopal church group. Everyone was glad to wish her well, and to have the assurance that she 'would stay on with the School until September when Harry goes to Atlanta to take advanced work in architecture at Georgia Tech. Mr. Richards and his Gateway Players again used the gymnasium for summer stock. The plays provided good entertainment for the summer people. The 1951 Workshop was the most successful one we have ever had both in quality of the students and in the work produced. We had people from 26 states, represented by the staff and student body. A number were Pi Phis, but not as many as we would like to have. if our own members could attend a session of the Workshop, working and playing with the group, enjoying the outings and the daily fellowship in the dining room, it would be the greatest boost we could have. One has to be here to realize what a wonderful Craft School we have. . This summer we have watched the progress of our lovely new Staff House with great interest. The work has progressed with very little delay from lack of materials and. each week shows progress. Workshop students were interested in, that they will. have the facilities of the larger dining room next summer. In this summary of tle.y*car's pork, the little thing~, both ,good xnd had, crowd. my memory. Some of the things in the 'Good bundle are the gifts' at Christmas time and through the year from alum= clubs, active chapters and individual Pi Phis, the many .pleasant contact~ ith interested visitors, and the faithfulness of our loyal employees. These far outweigh the bad things,, the discouragernents and problems of maintenance And help in running the Settlement School. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to the Settlement 'School Committee and to all others who have helped me handle my "bundle of little things." Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER, Director Use the .Pi Beta .Phi Magazine A.gency', 410 Standard Building, Decatur, Illinois.

North Whitehead, Management Training Program, Radcliffe College, Cambridge 38, Massachusetts. Committee Reports Holt House Committee IT IS the feeling of the Committee that Holt House has, during the year now closing, well served its purpose as a modest shrine dedicated to the memory of the Founders of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and as a gracious house which renders valuable, and valued, service to the community where that fraternity was founded eighty-five years ago. During the year, Holt House was used sixty-six times as a meeting place for organizations or to pro-vide accommodations for private entertaining on thirty-one of these occasions by groups affiliated with the fraternity. The chapters in the vicinity used the house for rushing parties, formal parties, cooky-shines, pledge parties, teas and for initiation. Thirty-one members of Illinois Eta visited the house in a group. The alumnae clubs of the area and the Illinois Alpha Mothers' Club held regular meetings, suppers, cooky-shines and teas there. Three other alumnae clubs came from distant points to hold special meetings there; and one distant club paid a visit to the house. It is the hope of the Committee that these groups and other distant clubs and chapters will make arrangements to visit Holt House during the year ahead, for they are most welcome. The house also accommodated, on thirty-five occasions, groups and individuals not connected with the Fraternity organization. Groups meeting there with regularity were the PEO, the DAR, the 0GM Bridge Club and the Monmouth Women's Club. A number of other organizations used the house on one occasion, or more. Holt House also provided a gracious setting for teas, showers, parties and wed-ding receptions given by individuals. A number of lovely gifts for the house were received during the year. The Committee is very grateful to Fannie Bradford Bailey who gave to Holt House the antique oil portraits of her grandparents, Major and Mrs. Holt. These portraits had previously been loaned, by Mrs. Bailey. The Springfield, Illinois, Alumnae Club presented a fine silver tray which was greatly needed. The Spokane, Washington, Alumnae Club very thoughtfully gave a beautiful little antique English silver "sweets basket" in memory of Eloise Ohme Moffatt, one of their younger members who was also a Pi Phi daughter. Mrs Moffat's name was en-graved on the little basket which was placed on the melodeon in the Victorian Parlor. The Burlington-Fort Madison, Iowa, Club, after holding a meeting in the house, presented a lovely antique shadow box which is to display old I. C. and Pi Phi pins. The alumna of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, made a gift of a small check with which to buy something for the house, at the time of their meeting there; and a member of the Avon-Bushnell, Illinois, group left two pairs of pretty, old pillow shams at the conclusion of their meeting in Holt House. To all these donors, the Committee is most grateful for their gifts and for their thoughtful interest in the house. The house itself is in good condition, only minor repairs being ,required during the year. The folding chairs, ordered some time ago, were received in the summer of 1951 and have been put to use many times. A number of replacements will be necessary during the coming year: new ruffled curtains have been ordered for the Founders' Room; several pieces of furniture will need to be re-covered; and the stair carpeting must soon be replaced. Also, the Victorian Parlor will need to be re-papered. The Committee will bevery grateful for nineteenth century photographs of members, to be placed in the velvet covered albums received last year; and for old I. C. or Pi Phi pins, to be placed in the shadow box received recently. Such items may be either loaned or presented to the house and will add a great deal to its small treasury of mementos of the early days of Pi Beta Phi. Mabel T. Johnson, who came to Holt House as hostess in December of 1950, keeps the house and its furnishings in excellent condition. She has assumed all the responsibilities of her position in splendid fashion and acts with graciousness and hospitality. Mrs. Johnson is well aware of the purpose and function of Holt House, having been a Monmouth resident all of her life. The Committee feels that the Fraternity is fortunate in having her as hostess and is glad to report that she is apparently happy in her association with Pi Beta Phi. The Committee is sincerely grateful to the many chapters and clubs which have contributed to the support of Holt House this year. The number of clubs contributing to the fund is, however; fewer, by nine, than the total of two-hundred twenty-two clubs which contributed during the preceding year. Among the clubs, the highest contributor was KansaS ' City, Missouri, with a gift of $50.00. The Spokane, Washing-ton, Club gave almost this exact amount for the purchase of a special memorial gift. The second highest contributor to the general fund was the Everett, Washington, Club which gave $30.00. Springfield, Illinois, gave this amount, too, for the purchase of a special gift for the house; in addition to their regular contribution to the fund. The Monmouth, Illinois, alumna group gave $25.00, the third highest contribution to the general fund. Many other clubs were very generous in their gifts. The number of chapters supporting the house in-creased from eighty-five during 1950-51 to eighty-nine during 1951-52. The highest contributing chap ters were: California $50.00 Louisiana A 50.00 Oklahoma A 35.00 Tennessee B 30.00 Illinois A 25.00 Kansas B 25.00 Texas A 25.00 As was also true last year, every chapter and every club in Delta Province and in Zeta Province contributed to the Holt House Fund. In addition to these provinces, in Alpha West, Gamma, Epsilon. Eta and Kappa Provinces, every chapter contributed ; and in Iota Province every club contributed. Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, followed by Eta Province in second place and by Mu Province, third. It is with extreme regret 'that the Holt House Committee announces the recent death of Evelyn Holliday Bridge who served as Committee Secretary during the past two years. Her interest in the house and in the work of the Committee was unfailing. Her efforts in behalf of the house continued, in spite of her illness, until a few months before her death. Her loss will be deeply felt. Alice McDougall Jensen, Monmouth member of the Committee, has, through her presence in Mon 77

        66 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW an additional gift of $100 which we had been saving for something special. .New shelving seemed very necessary, and with this gift, $50 from Committee, and help from the County, we have entire new shelving in the room. We were very fortunate that Mr. Lighter, who is the husband of the librarian, has a hobby of woodworking. He made these shelves in our Craft Shop. They are made to scale to fit into each available space and are very well made. The library has to serve as a classroom, but with the L-shape can be used at the same time for study. Interested Pi Phi alumna clubs, active chapters and individuals have added many volumes to our book collection. Mrs. Lighter has a special Memorial Shelf where books that have been given in memory of Pi Phis have an honored place. These books are often special -volumes that are too expensive to be acquired in the ordinary way. The Washington D. C. Alumnae Club has a practice of sending a book to the School instead of giving flowers at the death of a member. Mrs. Lighter can secure such good discounts and often wants some special book, so a gift of money can be spent most advantageously. More books came to the School from Texas A and from the Lexington, Kentucky Alumnae Club. These were sorted and placed where they could best be used. Many juvenile books were put in the new elementary building to form a collection for the use of the teachers in the lower grades. Books get pretty hard wear from the little folk, and it is fine to have new material to place on the tables in their rooms for them to read and enjoy. These gifts made it possible to discard some books that were really worn out. Departmentalization in the seventh and eighth grades worked a little better than it did last year. Mr. Tip Robertson had the eighth grade home room and coached the boys' basketball team. Miss Hazel Watson, daughter of Richard, our farm manager, had the seventh grade and coached the girls' team. Hazel graduated from Berea College and did a very good job in her first teaching assignment. Both of the junior basketball teams made excellent records. The high school freshman English teacher had these two grades in that subject and their other studies were divided between the two home room teachers. The work in business was taught by Mr. Jack Miller. In the second semester he added a course in Business Law to the curriculum. Mrs. Ruth Owenby and Mr. Mark Grim have been good members of our faculty for several years, and both did their part in helping make the teaching pro-gram a good one. The home economics department was in charge of Miss Joan McCready, an Iowa State College graduate. She was an outstanding teacher and gave the girls some very practical instruction in sewing and cooking. Miss Hodgen and I both felt that the dormitory girls learned more under her than they had previously. The arts and crafts program was carried on under great difficulty. Not in the woodworking department, for Mr. Carl Huskey had a good class of boys who did some very nice work in producing small articles of furniture. A late resignation by the art teacher made it difficult to find the proper person for our program, but Miss Dorothy Deiss came down from New York, where she had just finished work for her master's degree in time to start the second week of school. She was a teacher of outstanding ability and gave some fine service to the school, but she did not feel that she could carry on the work after the first semester. The high school classes had to have the credit, so we were fortunate in securing Mrs. Charm Hadley, wife of Dr. Jervis Hadley, park geologist, to teach just those twoclasses. Mrs. Hadley has an art degree and had taught the subject, so we were well pleased with that arrangement. In March, Ann Smith came from the University of Tennessee to take over the entire program, the very day she graduated. Ann had been a Workshop student the summer before, came back to Workshop this summer, and is to teach for us next year. She was a happy solution to that difficulty. Mrs. Armstrong again had the classes in music. She had a good chorus of high school students, a girls' glee club, and gave two very fine programs. The annual operetta was called "The Frog Prince." It was as cute as it could be. We were glad that the Committee was in town to see the younger children in their clever costumes and to hear their sweet young voices. The town is still talking about the Christmas program, for it was one of the finest we have ever had at the school. Miss Deiss and her students helped with the staging. They made the "Talking Christmas Tree" and the papier rnache reindeer, Santa and his sleigh. The reindeer were almost life-size. They won a blue ribbon for the Arts and Crafts department in the Garden Club show and were much admired in the lobby of the Mountain View Hotel during the holiday season. Mr. Hartford Granitz taught the classes in health, coached the girls' and boys' basketball teams in the high school, and helped with the football pro-gram. No spectacular results came from either sport, but this was due to the material he had to work with rather than from his work. The School has long felt the need of a band, and for the first time, a start has been made toward that project. The Rotary Club acted as sponsor, and a Knoxville firm provided the instruments on a six weeks rental-trial basis. At the end of that time, the rent paid was applied on the price of the instrument. A good start was made, and they even had a concert to show progress. Now the school board is trying to find a band director who can also teach some academic subject, and thus be on the regular payroll. This year, we again cooperated with the University of Tennessee in having a group of student practice teachers work at the school for six weeks. The young people were mostly preparing for elementary teaching positions and worked with our grade school teachers to their mutual advantage. In order to foster professional interest, an active in-service training program was instituted for the faculty and five meetings were held. One of these was a county-wide meeting held at our School. Mrs. Lighter was chosen to serve on an important committee of educators who spent one week in intensive evaluation of Rule High School in Knoxville. Their findings will be a help to the whole area. The Junior play was "Little Women" and was very well cast and produced. The Seniors chose "Johnny on the Spot" for their play. It was fun to see a tall mountain lad play the part of the returned soldier who against his will was posing as a great hero. Room parties for the grade school children at the Christmas and Valentine seasons, the high school basketball, football, and Junior banquets were all Big things that brought gayety and happiness into the regular school program. The Senior Class of twenty-two members made a trip to Washington, D. C., with a stopover at Luray Caverns in Virginia. They had been well-briefed before they left school in the historical and scenic wonders they were to see. Even the arrow on Mrs. Coolidge's dress caught their notice when they visited the Smithsonian Institute and saw the wax figures of the Presidents' wives. The Baccalaureate service was held in the new Baptist Church with a fine speaker and lovely music by the girls' glee club. Class night THE SEPTEMBER ARROW and Commencement followed, both being held in our auditorium. A number of the class are planning on going to college this fall. Most of them have positions in restaurants, shops, or hotels this summer. P.T There had been a growing sentiment against raising money for P.T.A. projects by holding Bingo games both here in town and in the state organization. The new Baptist minister, Rev. J. B. Carter, very much disapproved. and this year the games were given up. Revenue has come from three rummage sales that brought in about $350.00 and from a Minstrel Show that netted the same amount. This was given two nights in the High School gym and was a gala affair. A surprising amount of local talent gave an outstanding performance. Marjorie Chalmers and Lillian Hansen of our staff were in the cast. The pharmacist at one of the drug stores directed the show. The P.T.A. again operated the school lunch program under the efficient management of Mrs. Grace Morell. They contributed the proceeds of one rummage sale to the school library and have a surplus to spend for some worthy cause next year. The monthly programs were interesting and in several instances brought many fathers to the meetings. Sue Huff Cox served as President, Lillian was Secretary, and Mrs. Henrietta Huff was Program chairman for the year. Two study meetings were held at Teachers' Cottage with the Director serving as discussion leader. At these meetings every-one brought their own sandwiches, and Miss Hodgen provided cake and coffee for dessert one time, and the other time Sue baked the cake. Dormitory We had twelve dormitory students during the year, nine girls and three boys. Seven of these were fresh-.men and new to group living. It took a couple of months for them to lose some of their shyness and to learn what was expected of them. Before the year was over, they felt at home and contributed their part toward running the place. The girls esnecially helped with work in the kitchen and dining room and did very well when we were without a cook, by preparing breakfast and helping at supper time. We have had a serious time with help shortages. I do not know what we would have done without Miss Hodgen to take over when we had no cook. Lillian Hansen, my assist-ant, chaperoned the girls and taught them many things they should always remember. We entertained at several nice dinners during the year. Committee members were with us one evening and we also had the annual dinner for the Commencement speaker, the County Superintendent, and others. I entertained all of the teachers at tea, early in the fall, and when the student teachers came, we had another get-together for them, the faculty and our staff. We have a number of foreign visitors each year who come to see our school as an example of a good Craft Center. Last fall a group of South American students were here. They talked to the students at a special assembly and had a public exhibition of crafts they had brought from their own countries. Later that evening, we invited interested friends to meet the group at Teachers' Cottage and served doughnuts and coffee. We have entertained guests from Egypt, China, England, and Austria, some of them for overnight stops. They always bring much of interest to us, and I know carry away knowledge that will help them in their different work. Stuart College living room has again served as a piano studio for a private teacher whose pupils get excused from class work to take les-sons during school hours. The girls of Lillian's Scout troop held their annu Silver Tea at Stuart, and also held their Christm party there. The Dormitory students had several pz ties, and the whole family went on several picnic One of these was a rather damp one when we all car back to Stuart to eat our dessert and have a surpri shower for Lillian and her fiance, Harry W. Howe Health Center Of all the varied services contributed by the Et ternity to the community, none is more important th that rendered by our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmei She presides over our modern little Health Cent where several important local clinics are held ea, year. Two of these are the pre-school clinic for ch. dren entering school for the first time, and the visit the state mobile X-ray unit for chest examinations. , the latter visit, over 1000 people were X-rayed in ol day. This is a great number for this small town, b is due to the number of people who work in resc restaurants and hotels and must have a health car Marjorie has taught classes in child care to the soph more home economics class and to Lillian's Sco troop. Another Scout troop had lessons in First Ai The daily visits of the school children for Fii Aid, home visits, health talks given and pictures shwa in the rural schools, all seem like everyday, liti things, but when a summary is made of the wo done over a long period of time, we have a B bundle. Some startling figures came to light wh records of the past twenty years were consulted and tabulation made. Field Visits 23,5 Office Calls 41,31 First Aid Dressings ;5,3: Inoculations 1,1, Physical Examinations and Pupil Inspections 54,6 Health Talks 2,11 Newspaper Articles (5 years) The state of Tennessee furnishes the serums for Ma. orie's work, and we receive gifts from other sour( that help with the program. Outside our own chaptc and alumnae clubs, who are most generous with cif the greatest source of income is from Sigma P Gamma, international sorority. This group sends t Council of Southern Mountain Workers a sum money each year to be used for health work in t mountains. Last year this was $1350. Our share of tl amount was over $50. Individual chapters of that ( ganization adopt our project as the special center receive their welfare gifts. In money this amounts quite a sum during the year, and they also send tool brushes and other items that the nurse can use in 1-work. They have provided glasses for a number children who could not otherwise afford them. T shelves at the Health Center that are reserved i "give-aways" need frequent replenishing, especia for baby items and for clean, used clothing for sm children. Just last week, Marjorie was telephoning l friends and scurrying around to find a layette fox new baby. Farm Richard Watson was in charge of the garden, i chickens and our livestock, which consists of t mules and six pigs. The chickens provide us w meat and eggs for the table, the pigs are our prix garbage disposal unit, and the mules we use wh, people on level ground would use a tractor. 'I garden provides us with fresh vegetables, and w.17 68 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW the new staff house took away a good garden spot, we still have good potatoes on a hillside above the chicken houses. The Dormitory boys help wherever they are needed in keeping up the place. Arrowcraft Shop With the many craft shops now operating in Gatlin-burg, our shop occupies a unique position. We are one of three Guild shops in town, and since our merchandise is all of superior workmanship and quality-, we attract the more discriminating tourists. Sometimes our five o'clock closing hour and the fact that we are never open on Sunday causes a disappointment for people whose stay in town is limited. Longer hours would mean more employees and be too hard on the regular staff. Our big order business' with alumna Clubs and active chapters keeps everyone working at top speed all during .the fall shipping season. Last summer, many clubs ordered even' before the new price list had been sent to them. August was the heaviest .month's business in the history of the shop. In addition to the summer tourist customers, 42 club orders were filled and there were about ten others waiting to be shipped. In November, the weavers' pay roll was $5600, an all-time high. Still, there were shortages in some items, for try as we will to plan ahead, no one is a mind reader to foretell just what items will be most in demand. Some club chairmen order too optimistically, and if everything is not sold or returned promptly, some other club may be short some items. Many Arrowcraft articles were displayed in the exhibits at the Craftsman's Fair in Asheville, N. C., and ' we sent Tina McMorran and Wanda Ogle to demonstrate weaving, and Edna Cook for the sales room. Last fall, the Qatlinburg Craft Exhibit held during the Governors' Conference meant much extra work. Ethel Snow was in charge of the demonstrations. Arrowcraft furnished two demonstrators, one for weaving and one for warping. The Elmer Kear family, makers of our brooms, were there, .and Mat and Mary L. Owenby put on a chair-making demonstration. Pi Phi's gift: to each Governor's lady was a handwoven, ' white linen guest towel which was wrapped and sent to their hotel rooms., That same month we sent articles to; the Tennessee Annual Craft Exhibit and Sale at the University of Tennessee. ' In the ' spring during the Wilson Club Convention, we,were asked to have. a display of our weavings in the lobby of the Mountain.View Hotel, Edna helped Mrs. McCutchan in the Hotel Shop that' .'day ' and answered questions about the exhibit. The.', interior arrangement of the ,Arr'owcraft'shop has been changed by ;moving the bed into ,the second sales "room and by having a . room with a pretty Warp on it in the main sales room. Tina and Mary Elizabeth' Sullivan, one of the Workshop 'Teachers and also a Pi Phi, wove two screens for window display that are very interesting. They are' made of hardwood ;strips held together with a. gay warp. The windows were especially pretty during the Christmas season. An unusual creche made entirely of corn stalks, candles, and native greens were used. The Weavers' Annual Christmas party brought a large attendance. The program of carols by a group of school children, harp-singing, and the gift exchange were held at Stuart Cottage. Refreshments were served at the. dining rental tables and at extra card tables in Pollard. Tina spent a week in New York attending exhibitions, gaining inspiration for new designs. One recognition for her work was an article in the Spring and Summer Quarterly of . cCall's Magazine on her work, in which our. aprons and bags were pictured in color. Summer Activities An event of early summer was the June wedding of roy.aassistant, Lillian Hansen, and Harry W. Howell. The ceremony Was performed in the Episcopal Church, with the reception at the Greystone Playhouse. Lillian has made a place for herself in the hearts of all the community by her work at the School and her outside activities with the Girl Scouts and the Episcopal church group. Everyone was glad to wish her well, and to have the assurance that she 'would stay on with the School until September when Harry goes to Atlanta to take advanced work in architecture at Georgia Tech. Mr. Richards and his Gateway Players again used the gymnasium for summer stock. The plays provided good entertainment for the summer people. The 1951 Workshop was the most successful one we have ever had both in quality of the students and in the work produced. We had people from 26 states, represented by the staff and student body. A number were Pi Phis, but not as many as we would like to have. if our own members could attend a session of the Workshop, working and playing with the group, enjoying the outings and the daily fellowship in the dining room, it would be the greatest boost we could have. One has to be here to realize what a wonderful Craft School we have. . This summer we have watched the progress of our lovely new Staff House with great interest. The work has progressed with very little delay from lack of materials and. each week shows progress. Workshop students were interested in, that they will. have the facilities of the larger dining room next summer. In this summary of tle.y*car's pork, the little thing~, both ,good xnd had, crowd. my memory. Some of the things in the 'Good bundle are the gifts' at Christmas time and through the year from alum= clubs, active chapters and individual Pi Phis, the many .pleasant contact~ ith interested visitors, and the faithfulness of our loyal employees. These far outweigh the bad things,, the discouragernents and problems of maintenance And help in running the Settlement School. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to the Settlement 'School Committee and to all others who have helped me handle my "bundle of little things." Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER, Director Use the .Pi Beta .Phi Magazine A.gency', 410 Standard Building, Decatur, Illinois.

North Whitehead, Management Training Program, Radcliffe College, Cambridge 38, Massachusetts. Committee Reports Holt House Committee IT IS the feeling of the Committee that Holt House has, during the year now closing, well served its purpose as a modest shrine dedicated to the memory of the Founders of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and as a gracious house which renders valuable, and valued, service to the community where that fraternity was founded eighty-five years ago. During the year, Holt House was used sixty-six times as a meeting place for organizations or to pro-vide accommodations for private entertaining on thirty-one of these occasions by groups affiliated with the fraternity. The chapters in the vicinity used the house for rushing parties, formal parties, cooky-shines, pledge parties, teas and for initiation. Thirty-one members of Illinois Eta visited the house in a group. The alumnae clubs of the area and the Illinois Alpha Mothers' Club held regular meetings, suppers, cooky-shines and teas there. Three other alumnae clubs came from distant points to hold special meetings there; and one distant club paid a visit to the house. It is the hope of the Committee that these groups and other distant clubs and chapters will make arrangements to visit Holt House during the year ahead, for they are most welcome. The house also accommodated, on thirty-five occasions, groups and individuals not connected with the Fraternity organization. Groups meeting there with regularity were the PEO, the DAR, the 0GM Bridge Club and the Monmouth Women's Club. A number of other organizations used the house on one occasion, or more. Holt House also provided a gracious setting for teas, showers, parties and wed-ding receptions given by individuals. A number of lovely gifts for the house were received during the year. The Committee is very grateful to Fannie Bradford Bailey who gave to Holt House the antique oil portraits of her grandparents, Major and Mrs. Holt. These portraits had previously been loaned, by Mrs. Bailey. The Springfield, Illinois, Alumnae Club presented a fine silver tray which was greatly needed. The Spokane, Washington, Alumnae Club very thoughtfully gave a beautiful little antique English silver "sweets basket" in memory of Eloise Ohme Moffatt, one of their younger members who was also a Pi Phi daughter. Mrs Moffat's name was en-graved on the little basket which was placed on the melodeon in the Victorian Parlor. The Burlington-Fort Madison, Iowa, Club, after holding a meeting in the house, presented a lovely antique shadow box which is to display old I. C. and Pi Phi pins. The alumna of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, made a gift of a small check with which to buy something for the house, at the time of their meeting there; and a member of the Avon-Bushnell, Illinois, group left two pairs of pretty, old pillow shams at the conclusion of their meeting in Holt House. To all these donors, the Committee is most grateful for their gifts and for their thoughtful interest in the house. The house itself is in good condition, only minor repairs being ,required during the year. The folding chairs, ordered some time ago, were received in the summer of 1951 and have been put to use many times. A number of replacements will be necessary during the coming year: new ruffled curtains have been ordered for the Founders' Room; several pieces of furniture will need to be re-covered; and the stair carpeting must soon be replaced. Also, the Victorian Parlor will need to be re-papered. The Committee will bevery grateful for nineteenth century photographs of members, to be placed in the velvet covered albums received last year; and for old I. C. or Pi Phi pins, to be placed in the shadow box received recently. Such items may be either loaned or presented to the house and will add a great deal to its small treasury of mementos of the early days of Pi Beta Phi. Mabel T. Johnson, who came to Holt House as hostess in December of 1950, keeps the house and its furnishings in excellent condition. She has assumed all the responsibilities of her position in splendid fashion and acts with graciousness and hospitality. Mrs. Johnson is well aware of the purpose and function of Holt House, having been a Monmouth resident all of her life. The Committee feels that the Fraternity is fortunate in having her as hostess and is glad to report that she is apparently happy in her association with Pi Beta Phi. The Committee is sincerely grateful to the many chapters and clubs which have contributed to the support of Holt House this year. The number of clubs contributing to the fund is, however; fewer, by nine, than the total of two-hundred twenty-two clubs which contributed during the preceding year. Among the clubs, the highest contributor was KansaS ' City, Missouri, with a gift of $50.00. The Spokane, Washing-ton, Club gave almost this exact amount for the purchase of a special memorial gift. The second highest contributor to the general fund was the Everett, Washington, Club which gave $30.00. Springfield, Illinois, gave this amount, too, for the purchase of a special gift for the house; in addition to their regular contribution to the fund. The Monmouth, Illinois, alumna group gave $25.00, the third highest contribution to the general fund. Many other clubs were very generous in their gifts. The number of chapters supporting the house in-creased from eighty-five during 1950-51 to eighty-nine during 1951-52. The highest contributing chap ters were: California $50.00 Louisiana A 50.00 Oklahoma A 35.00 Tennessee B 30.00 Illinois A 25.00 Kansas B 25.00 Texas A 25.00 As was also true last year, every chapter and every club in Delta Province and in Zeta Province contributed to the Holt House Fund. In addition to these provinces, in Alpha West, Gamma, Epsilon. Eta and Kappa Provinces, every chapter contributed ; and in Iota Province every club contributed. Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, followed by Eta Province in second place and by Mu Province, third. It is with extreme regret 'that the Holt House Committee announces the recent death of Evelyn Holliday Bridge who served as Committee Secretary during the past two years. Her interest in the house and in the work of the Committee was unfailing. Her efforts in behalf of the house continued, in spite of her illness, until a few months before her death. Her loss will be deeply felt. Alice McDougall Jensen, Monmouth member of the Committee, has, through her presence in Mon 77

        68 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW the new staff house took away a good garden spot, we still have good potatoes on a hillside above the chicken houses. The Dormitory boys help wherever they are needed in keeping up the place. Arrowcraft Shop With the many craft shops now operating in Gatlin-burg, our shop occupies a unique position. We are one of three Guild shops in town, and since our merchandise is all of superior workmanship and quality-, we attract the more discriminating tourists. Sometimes our five o'clock closing hour and the fact that we are never open on Sunday causes a disappointment for people whose stay in town is limited. Longer hours would mean more employees and be too hard on the regular staff. Our big order business' with alumna Clubs and active chapters keeps everyone working at top speed all during .the fall shipping season. Last summer, many clubs ordered even' before the new price list had been sent to them. August was the heaviest .month's business in the history of the shop. In addition to the summer tourist customers, 42 club orders were filled and there were about ten others waiting to be shipped. In November, the weavers' pay roll was $5600, an all-time high. Still, there were shortages in some items, for try as we will to plan ahead, no one is a mind reader to foretell just what items will be most in demand. Some club chairmen order too optimistically, and if everything is not sold or returned promptly, some other club may be short some items. Many Arrowcraft articles were displayed in the exhibits at the Craftsman's Fair in Asheville, N. C., and ' we sent Tina McMorran and Wanda Ogle to demonstrate weaving, and Edna Cook for the sales room. Last fall, the Qatlinburg Craft Exhibit held during the Governors' Conference meant much extra work. Ethel Snow was in charge of the demonstrations. Arrowcraft furnished two demonstrators, one for weaving and one for warping. The Elmer Kear family, makers of our brooms, were there, .and Mat and Mary L. Owenby put on a chair-making demonstration. Pi Phi's gift: to each Governor's lady was a handwoven, ' white linen guest towel which was wrapped and sent to their hotel rooms., That same month we sent articles to; the Tennessee Annual Craft Exhibit and Sale at the University of Tennessee. ' In the ' spring during the Wilson Club Convention, we,were asked to have. a display of our weavings in the lobby of the Mountain.View Hotel, Edna helped Mrs. McCutchan in the Hotel Shop that' .'day ' and answered questions about the exhibit. The.', interior arrangement of the ,Arr'owcraft'shop has been changed by ;moving the bed into ,the second sales "room and by having a . room with a pretty Warp on it in the main sales room. Tina and Mary Elizabeth' Sullivan, one of the Workshop 'Teachers and also a Pi Phi, wove two screens for window display that are very interesting. They are' made of hardwood ;strips held together with a. gay warp. The windows were especially pretty during the Christmas season. An unusual creche made entirely of corn stalks, candles, and native greens were used. The Weavers' Annual Christmas party brought a large attendance. The program of carols by a group of school children, harp-singing, and the gift exchange were held at Stuart Cottage. Refreshments were served at the. dining rental tables and at extra card tables in Pollard. Tina spent a week in New York attending exhibitions, gaining inspiration for new designs. One recognition for her work was an article in the Spring and Summer Quarterly of . cCall's Magazine on her work, in which our. aprons and bags were pictured in color. Summer Activities An event of early summer was the June wedding of roy.aassistant, Lillian Hansen, and Harry W. Howell. The ceremony Was performed in the Episcopal Church, with the reception at the Greystone Playhouse. Lillian has made a place for herself in the hearts of all the community by her work at the School and her outside activities with the Girl Scouts and the Episcopal church group. Everyone was glad to wish her well, and to have the assurance that she 'would stay on with the School until September when Harry goes to Atlanta to take advanced work in architecture at Georgia Tech. Mr. Richards and his Gateway Players again used the gymnasium for summer stock. The plays provided good entertainment for the summer people. The 1951 Workshop was the most successful one we have ever had both in quality of the students and in the work produced. We had people from 26 states, represented by the staff and student body. A number were Pi Phis, but not as many as we would like to have. if our own members could attend a session of the Workshop, working and playing with the group, enjoying the outings and the daily fellowship in the dining room, it would be the greatest boost we could have. One has to be here to realize what a wonderful Craft School we have. . This summer we have watched the progress of our lovely new Staff House with great interest. The work has progressed with very little delay from lack of materials and. each week shows progress. Workshop students were interested in, that they will. have the facilities of the larger dining room next summer. In this summary of tle.y*car's pork, the little thing~, both ,good xnd had, crowd. my memory. Some of the things in the 'Good bundle are the gifts' at Christmas time and through the year from alum= clubs, active chapters and individual Pi Phis, the many .pleasant contact~ ith interested visitors, and the faithfulness of our loyal employees. These far outweigh the bad things,, the discouragernents and problems of maintenance And help in running the Settlement School. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to the Settlement 'School Committee and to all others who have helped me handle my "bundle of little things."

North Whitehead, Management Training Program, Radcliffe College, Cambridge 38, Massachusetts. Committee Reports Holt House Committee IT IS the feeling of the Committee that Holt House has, during the year now closing, well served its purpose as a modest shrine dedicated to the memory of the Founders of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and as a gracious house which renders valuable, and valued, service to the community where that fraternity was founded eighty-five years ago. During the year, Holt House was used sixty-six times as a meeting place for organizations or to pro-vide accommodations for private entertaining on thirty-one of these occasions by groups affiliated with the fraternity. The chapters in the vicinity used the house for rushing parties, formal parties, cooky-shines, pledge parties, teas and for initiation. Thirty-one members of Illinois Eta visited the house in a group. The alumnae clubs of the area and the Illinois Alpha Mothers' Club held regular meetings, suppers, cooky-shines and teas there. Three other alumnae clubs came from distant points to hold special meetings there; and one distant club paid a visit to the house. It is the hope of the Committee that these groups and other distant clubs and chapters will make arrangements to visit Holt House during the year ahead, for they are most welcome. The house also accommodated, on thirty-five occasions, groups and individuals not connected with the Fraternity organization. Groups meeting there with regularity were the PEO, the DAR, the 0GM Bridge Club and the Monmouth Women's Club. A number of other organizations used the house on one occasion, or more. Holt House also provided a gracious setting for teas, showers, parties and wed-ding receptions given by individuals. A number of lovely gifts for the house were received during the year. The Committee is very grateful to Fannie Bradford Bailey who gave to Holt House the antique oil portraits of her grandparents, Major and Mrs. Holt. These portraits had previously been loaned, by Mrs. Bailey. The Springfield, Illinois, Alumnae Club presented a fine silver tray which was greatly needed. The Spokane, Washington, Alumnae Club very thoughtfully gave a beautiful little antique English silver "sweets basket" in memory of Eloise Ohme Moffatt, one of their younger members who was also a Pi Phi daughter. Mrs Moffat's name was en-graved on the little basket which was placed on the melodeon in the Victorian Parlor. The Burlington-Fort Madison, Iowa, Club, after holding a meeting in the house, presented a lovely antique shadow box which is to display old I. C. and Pi Phi pins. The alumna of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, made a gift of a small check with which to buy something for the house, at the time of their meeting there; and a member of the Avon-Bushnell, Illinois, group left two pairs of pretty, old pillow shams at the conclusion of their meeting in Holt House. To all these donors, the Committee is most grateful for their gifts and for their thoughtful interest in the house. The house itself is in good condition, only minor repairs being ,required during the year. The folding chairs, ordered some time ago, were received in the summer of 1951 and have been put to use many times. A number of replacements will be necessary during the coming year: new ruffled curtains have been ordered for the Founders' Room; several pieces of furniture will need to be re-covered; and the stair carpeting must soon be replaced. Also, the Victorian Parlor will need to be re-papered. The Committee will bevery grateful for nineteenth century photographs of members, to be placed in the velvet covered albums received last year; and for old I. C. or Pi Phi pins, to be placed in the shadow box received recently. Such items may be either loaned or presented to the house and will add a great deal to its small treasury of mementos of the early days of Pi Beta Phi. Mabel T. Johnson, who came to Holt House as hostess in December of 1950, keeps the house and its furnishings in excellent condition. She has assumed all the responsibilities of her position in splendid fashion and acts with graciousness and hospitality. Mrs. Johnson is well aware of the purpose and function of Holt House, having been a Monmouth resident all of her life. The Committee feels that the Fraternity is fortunate in having her as hostess and is glad to report that she is apparently happy in her association with Pi Beta Phi. The Committee is sincerely grateful to the many chapters and clubs which have contributed to the support of Holt House this year. The number of clubs contributing to the fund is, however; fewer, by nine, than the total of two-hundred twenty-two clubs which contributed during the preceding year. Among the clubs, the highest contributor was KansaS ' City, Missouri, with a gift of $50.00. The Spokane, Washing-ton, Club gave almost this exact amount for the purchase of a special memorial gift. The second highest contributor to the general fund was the Everett, Washington, Club which gave $30.00. Springfield, Illinois, gave this amount, too, for the purchase of a special gift for the house; in addition to their regular contribution to the fund. The Monmouth, Illinois, alumna group gave $25.00, the third highest contribution to the general fund. Many other clubs were very generous in their gifts. The number of chapters supporting the house in-creased from eighty-five during 1950-51 to eighty-nine during 1951-52. The highest contributing chap ters were: California $50.00 Louisiana A 50.00 Oklahoma A 35.00 Tennessee B 30.00 Illinois A 25.00 Kansas B 25.00 Texas A 25.00 As was also true last year, every chapter and every club in Delta Province and in Zeta Province contributed to the Holt House Fund. In addition to these provinces, in Alpha West, Gamma, Epsilon. Eta and Kappa Provinces, every chapter contributed ; and in Iota Province every club contributed. Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, followed by Eta Province in second place and by Mu Province, third. It is with extreme regret 'that the Holt House Committee announces the recent death of Evelyn Holliday Bridge who served as Committee Secretary during the past two years. Her interest in the house and in the work of the Committee was unfailing. Her efforts in behalf of the house continued, in spite of her illness, until a few months before her death. Her loss will be deeply felt. Alice McDougall Jensen, Monmouth member of the Committee, has, through her presence in Mon 77

Committee Reports Holt House Committee IT IS the feeling of the Committee that Holt House has, during the year now closing, well served its purpose as a modest shrine dedicated to the memory of the Founders of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and as a gracious house which renders valuable, and valued, service to the community where that fraternity was founded eighty-five years ago. During the year, Holt House was used sixty-six times as a meeting place for organizations or to pro-vide accommodations for private entertaining on thirty-one of these occasions by groups affiliated with the fraternity. The chapters in the vicinity used the house for rushing parties, formal parties, cooky-shines, pledge parties, teas and for initiation. Thirty-one members of Illinois Eta visited the house in a group. The alumnae clubs of the area and the Illinois Alpha Mothers' Club held regular meetings, suppers, cooky-shines and teas there. Three other alumnae clubs came from distant points to hold special meetings there; and one distant club paid a visit to the house. It is the hope of the Committee that these groups and other distant clubs and chapters will make arrangements to visit Holt House during the year ahead, for they are most welcome. The house also accommodated, on thirty-five occasions, groups and individuals not connected with the Fraternity organization. Groups meeting there with regularity were the PEO, the DAR, the 0GM Bridge Club and the Monmouth Women's Club. A number of other organizations used the house on one occasion, or more. Holt House also provided a gracious setting for teas, showers, parties and wed-ding receptions given by individuals. A number of lovely gifts for the house were received during the year. The Committee is very grateful to Fannie Bradford Bailey who gave to Holt House the antique oil portraits of her grandparents, Major and Mrs. Holt. These portraits had previously been loaned, by Mrs. Bailey. The Springfield, Illinois, Alumnae Club presented a fine silver tray which was greatly needed. The Spokane, Washington, Alumnae Club very thoughtfully gave a beautiful little antique English silver "sweets basket" in memory of Eloise Ohme Moffatt, one of their younger members who was also a Pi Phi daughter. Mrs Moffat's name was en-graved on the little basket which was placed on the melodeon in the Victorian Parlor. The Burlington-Fort Madison, Iowa, Club, after holding a meeting in the house, presented a lovely antique shadow box which is to display old I. C. and Pi Phi pins. The alumna of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, made a gift of a small check with which to buy something for the house, at the time of their meeting there; and a member of the Avon-Bushnell, Illinois, group left two pairs of pretty, old pillow shams at the conclusion of their meeting in Holt House. To all these donors, the Committee is most grateful for their gifts and for their thoughtful interest in the house. The house itself is in good condition, only minor repairs being ,required during the year. The folding chairs, ordered some time ago, were received in the summer of 1951 and have been put to use many times. A number of replacements will be necessary during the coming year: new ruffled curtains have been ordered for the Founders' Room; several pieces of furniture will need to be re-covered; and the stair carpeting must soon be replaced. Also, the Victorian Parlor will need to be re-papered. The Committee will bevery grateful for nineteenth century photographs of members, to be placed in the velvet covered albums received last year; and for old I. C. or Pi Phi pins, to be placed in the shadow box received recently. Such items may be either loaned or presented to the house and will add a great deal to its small treasury of mementos of the early days of Pi Beta Phi. Mabel T. Johnson, who came to Holt House as hostess in December of 1950, keeps the house and its furnishings in excellent condition. She has assumed all the responsibilities of her position in splendid fashion and acts with graciousness and hospitality. Mrs. Johnson is well aware of the purpose and function of Holt House, having been a Monmouth resident all of her life. The Committee feels that the Fraternity is fortunate in having her as hostess and is glad to report that she is apparently happy in her association with Pi Beta Phi. The Committee is sincerely grateful to the many chapters and clubs which have contributed to the support of Holt House this year. The number of clubs contributing to the fund is, however; fewer, by nine, than the total of two-hundred twenty-two clubs which contributed during the preceding year. Among the clubs, the highest contributor was KansaS ' City, Missouri, with a gift of $50.00. The Spokane, Washing-ton, Club gave almost this exact amount for the purchase of a special memorial gift. The second highest contributor to the general fund was the Everett, Washington, Club which gave $30.00. Springfield, Illinois, gave this amount, too, for the purchase of a special gift for the house; in addition to their regular contribution to the fund. The Monmouth, Illinois, alumna group gave $25.00, the third highest contribution to the general fund. Many other clubs were very generous in their gifts. The number of chapters supporting the house in-creased from eighty-five during 1950-51 to eighty-nine during 1951-52. The highest contributing chap ters were: California $50.00 Louisiana A 50.00 Oklahoma A 35.00 Tennessee B 30.00 Illinois A 25.00 Kansas B 25.00 Texas A 25.00 As was also true last year, every chapter and every club in Delta Province and in Zeta Province contributed to the Holt House Fund. In addition to these provinces, in Alpha West, Gamma, Epsilon. Eta and Kappa Provinces, every chapter contributed ; and in Iota Province every club contributed. Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, followed by Eta Province in second place and by Mu Province, third. It is with extreme regret 'that the Holt House Committee announces the recent death of Evelyn Holliday Bridge who served as Committee Secretary during the past two years. Her interest in the house and in the work of the Committee was unfailing. Her efforts in behalf of the house continued, in spite of her illness, until a few months before her death.

Committee Reports Holt House Committee IT IS the feeling of the Committee that Holt House has, during the year now closing, well served its purpose as a modest shrine dedicated to the memory of the Founders of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and as a gracious house which renders valuable, and valued, service to the community where that fraternity was founded eighty-five years ago. During the year, Holt House was used sixty-six times as a meeting place for organizations or to pro-vide accommodations for private entertaining on thirty-one of these occasions by groups affiliated with the fraternity. The chapters in the vicinity used the house for rushing parties, formal parties, cooky-shines, pledge parties, teas and for initiation. Thirty-one members of Illinois Eta visited the house in a group. The alumnae clubs of the area and the Illinois Alpha Mothers' Club held regular meetings, suppers, cooky-shines and teas there. Three other alumnae clubs came from distant points to hold special meetings there; and one distant club paid a visit to the house. It is the hope of the Committee that these groups and other distant clubs and chapters will make arrangements to visit Holt House during the year ahead, for they are most welcome. The house also accommodated, on thirty-five occasions, groups and individuals not connected with the Fraternity organization. Groups meeting there with regularity were the PEO, the DAR, the 0GM Bridge Club and the Monmouth Women's Club. A number of other organizations used the house on one occasion, or more. Holt House also provided a gracious setting for teas, showers, parties and wed-ding receptions given by individuals. A number of lovely gifts for the house were received during the year. The Committee is very grateful to Fannie Bradford Bailey who gave to Holt House the antique oil portraits of her grandparents, Major and Mrs. Holt. These portraits had previously been loaned, by Mrs. Bailey. The Springfield, Illinois, Alumnae Club presented a fine silver tray which was greatly needed. The Spokane, Washington, Alumnae Club very thoughtfully gave a beautiful little antique English silver "sweets basket" in memory of Eloise Ohme Moffatt, one of their younger members who was also a Pi Phi daughter. Mrs Moffat's name was en-graved on the little basket which was placed on the melodeon in the Victorian Parlor. The Burlington-Fort Madison, Iowa, Club, after holding a meeting in the house, presented a lovely antique shadow box which is to display old I. C. and Pi Phi pins. The alumna of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, made a gift of a small check with which to buy something for the house, at the time of their meeting there; and a member of the Avon-Bushnell, Illinois, group left two pairs of pretty, old pillow shams at the conclusion of their meeting in Holt House. To all these donors, the Committee is most grateful for their gifts and for their thoughtful interest in the house. The house itself is in good condition, only minor repairs being ,required during the year. The folding chairs, ordered some time ago, were received in the summer of 1951 and have been put to use many times. A number of replacements will be necessary during the coming year: new ruffled curtains have been ordered for the Founders' Room; several pieces of furniture will need to be re-covered; and the stair carpeting must soon be replaced. Also, the Victorian Parlor will need to be re-papered. The Committee will bevery grateful for nineteenth century photographs of members, to be placed in the velvet covered albums received last year; and for old I. C. or Pi Phi pins, to be placed in the shadow box received recently. Such items may be either loaned or presented to the house and will add a great deal to its small treasury of mementos of the early days of Pi Beta Phi. Mabel T. Johnson, who came to Holt House as hostess in December of 1950, keeps the house and its furnishings in excellent condition. She has assumed all the responsibilities of her position in splendid fashion and acts with graciousness and hospitality. Mrs. Johnson is well aware of the purpose and function of Holt House, having been a Monmouth resident all of her life. The Committee feels that the Fraternity is fortunate in having her as hostess and is glad to report that she is apparently happy in her association with Pi Beta Phi. The Committee is sincerely grateful to the many chapters and clubs which have contributed to the support of Holt House this year. The number of clubs contributing to the fund is, however; fewer, by nine, than the total of two-hundred twenty-two clubs which contributed during the preceding year. Among the clubs, the highest contributor was KansaS ' City, Missouri, with a gift of $50.00. The Spokane, Washing-ton, Club gave almost this exact amount for the purchase of a special memorial gift. The second highest contributor to the general fund was the Everett, Washington, Club which gave $30.00. Springfield, Illinois, gave this amount, too, for the purchase of a special gift for the house; in addition to their regular contribution to the fund. The Monmouth, Illinois, alumna group gave $25.00, the third highest contribution to the general fund. Many other clubs were very generous in their gifts. The number of chapters supporting the house in-creased from eighty-five during 1950-51 to eighty-nine during 1951-52. The highest contributing chap ters were: California $50.00 Louisiana A 50.00 Oklahoma A 35.00 Tennessee B 30.00 Illinois A 25.00 Kansas B 25.00 Texas A 25.00 As was also true last year, every chapter and every club in Delta Province and in Zeta Province contributed to the Holt House Fund. In addition to these provinces, in Alpha West, Gamma, Epsilon. Eta and Kappa Provinces, every chapter contributed ; and in Iota Province every club contributed. Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, followed by Eta Province in second place and by Mu Province, third. It is with extreme regret 'that the Holt House Committee announces the recent death of Evelyn Holliday Bridge who served as Committee Secretary during the past two years. Her interest in the house and in the work of the Committee was unfailing. Her efforts in behalf of the house continued, in spite of her illness, until a few months before her death. Her loss will be deeply felt. Alice McDougall Jensen, Monmouth member of the Committee, has, through her presence in Mon 77

Mrs. Johnson is well aware of the purpose and function of Holt House, having been a Monmouth resident all of her life. The Committee feels that the Fraternity is fortunate in having her as hostess and is glad to report that she is apparently happy in her association with Pi Beta Phi. The Committee is sincerely grateful to the many chapters and clubs which have contributed to the support of Holt House this year. The number of clubs contributing to the fund is, however; fewer, by nine, than the total of two-hundred twenty-two clubs which contributed during the preceding year. Among the clubs, the highest contributor was KansaS ' City, Missouri, with a gift of $50.00. The Spokane, Washing-ton, Club gave almost this exact amount for the purchase of a special memorial gift. The second highest contributor to the general fund was the Everett, Washington, Club which gave $30.00. Springfield, Illinois, gave this amount, too, for the purchase of a special gift for the house; in addition to their regular contribution to the fund. The Monmouth, Illinois, alumna group gave $25.00, the third highest contribution to the general fund. Many other clubs were very generous in their gifts. The number of chapters supporting the house in-creased from eighty-five during 1950-51 to eighty-nine during 1951-52. The highest contributing chap ters were: California $50.00 Louisiana A 50.00 Oklahoma A 35.00 Tennessee B 30.00 Illinois A 25.00 Kansas B 25.00 Texas A 25.00 As was also true last year, every chapter and every club in Delta Province and in Zeta Province contributed to the Holt House Fund. In addition to these provinces, in Alpha West, Gamma, Epsilon. Eta and Kappa Provinces, every chapter contributed ; and in Iota Province every club contributed. Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, followed by Eta Province in second place and by Mu Province, third. It is with extreme regret 'that the Holt House Committee announces the recent death of Evelyn Holliday Bridge who served as Committee Secretary during the past two years. Her interest in the house and in the work of the Committee was unfailing. Her efforts in behalf of the house continued, in spite of her illness, until a few months before her death. Her loss will be deeply felt. Alice McDougall Jensen, Monmouth member of the Committee, has, through her presence in Mon 77

Committee Reports Holt House Committee IT IS the feeling of the Committee that Holt House has, during the year now closing, well served its purpose as a modest shrine dedicated to the memory of the Founders of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and as a gracious house which renders valuable, and valued, service to the community where that fraternity was founded eighty-five years ago. During the year, Holt House was used sixty-six times as a meeting place for organizations or to pro-vide accommodations for private entertaining on thirty-one of these occasions by groups affiliated with the fraternity. The chapters in the vicinity used the house for rushing parties, formal parties, cooky-shines, pledge parties, teas and for initiation. Thirty-one members of Illinois Eta visited the house in a group. The alumnae clubs of the area and the Illinois Alpha Mothers' Club held regular meetings, suppers, cooky-shines and teas there. Three other alumnae clubs came from distant points to hold special meetings there; and one distant club paid a visit to the house. It is the hope of the Committee that these groups and other distant clubs and chapters will make arrangements to visit Holt House during the year ahead, for they are most welcome. The house also accommodated, on thirty-five occasions, groups and individuals not connected with the Fraternity organization. Groups meeting there with regularity were the PEO, the DAR, the 0GM Bridge Club and the Monmouth Women's Club. A number of other organizations used the house on one occasion, or more. Holt House also provided a gracious setting for teas, showers, parties and wed-ding receptions given by individuals. A number of lovely gifts for the house were received during the year. The Committee is very grateful to Fannie Bradford Bailey who gave to Holt House the antique oil portraits of her grandparents, Major and Mrs. Holt. These portraits had previously been loaned, by Mrs. Bailey. The Springfield, Illinois, Alumnae Club presented a fine silver tray which was greatly needed. The Spokane, Washington, Alumnae Club very thoughtfully gave a beautiful little antique English silver "sweets basket" in memory of Eloise Ohme Moffatt, one of their younger members who was also a Pi Phi daughter. Mrs Moffat's name was en-graved on the little basket which was placed on the melodeon in the Victorian Parlor. The Burlington-Fort Madison, Iowa, Club, after holding a meeting in the house, presented a lovely antique shadow box which is to display old I. C. and Pi Phi pins. The alumna of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, made a gift of a small check with which to buy something for the house, at the time of their meeting there; and a member of the Avon-Bushnell, Illinois, group left two pairs of pretty, old pillow shams at the conclusion of their meeting in Holt House. To all these donors, the Committee is most grateful for their gifts and for their thoughtful interest in the house. The house itself is in good condition, only minor repairs being ,required during the year. The folding chairs, ordered some time ago, were received in the summer of 1951 and have been put to use many times. A number of replacements will be necessary during the coming year: new ruffled curtains have been ordered for the Founders' Room; several pieces of furniture will need to be re-covered; and the stair carpeting must soon be replaced. Also, the Victorian Parlor will need to be re-papered. The Committee will bevery grateful for nineteenth century photographs of members, to be placed in the velvet covered albums received last year; and for old I. C. or Pi Phi pins, to be placed in the shadow box received recently. Such items may be either loaned or presented to the house and will add a great deal to its small treasury of mementos of the early days of Pi Beta Phi. Mabel T. Johnson, who came to Holt House as hostess in December of 1950, keeps the house and its furnishings in excellent condition.

Only a new' birth of the understanding of the true nature of our freedom can save us. Settlernent School Reports CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE pI BETA PHI is celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the Settlement School this year. That is sufficient years to prove the worth of an undertaking and it has stood the test. The foundation of every state is said to be the education of its youth. The state of Tennessee, however, was slow to start and in 1912 could do little if anything when we started our project there. It still does not equal in scope that done by the majority of other states. However, it is now giving increased aid to all schools and the diversion of the sales tax money into school building funds has made possible improvements in housing. Yet it is significant that the County Superintendent of Schools feels a continued need for the assistance of Pi Beta Phi in meeting the requirements for a Class A school in Gatlinburg. In contrast to beginning days poor roads, small inadequate cabins, lack of hygiene, inadequate water sources, we find today that better highways, tourist travel to the national park, the influence of the radio, the arrival of a money-making people, all these are modernizing what once was the home of descendants of the first Gaelic people who settled in the Smokies. In spite of the influx of new social forces one still may talk to the straightforward, unassuming mountaineer and hear the Elizabethan expressions found no-where else. At our school gather the grandchildren of these fine people and the children of newcomers who do not always understand the old traditions. Forty years ago, education in Gatlinburg consisted of two or three months of simple schooling; Pi Beta Phi changed this to a six and then a nine month term but with one teacher carrying the burden of teaching all ages. To quote Shakespeare: "To climb steep hills requires slow pace at first." So step by step through the years, the attendance grew, other grades were added until finally the system included all elementary grades and a full high school course. Then came the gradual relinquishing of our responsibilities., allowing the county to take over more and more of the ad-ministration and the cost of the school. The leasing of our school buildings for a token fee, the erection of the new grade school unit by the County two years ago, the cost of maintaining the school and paying all teachers' salaries but four, all these are signs of change. Today, in the Pi Beta Phi School, the fraternity interests are confined to three subjects;Physical Education, Music, and Arts and Crafts, including Woodworking and these salaries are paid by Pi Beta Phi. The over-all program in Physical Education, en). bracing many forms of sport seems closely linked with our Health program and therefore of special importance. Mr. Hartford Granitz, graduate of the University of Chattanooga, has given all students well rounded courses in sports, particularly emphasizing intra-murals for the sake of sportsmanship. Our teams received awards this year for good sportsmanship, in addition \ to winning ,games. While basketball is the main competitive sport, Mr. Granitz has also assisted in football coaching. We regret that he will not return for a third year with us but he has gone to a much higher salaried position in Georgia. Mr. Carl Huskey has again given part time to instructing in Woodworking and his boys have turned out some commendable products during the year. Teaching and working both have been simplified bythe new lathe and motor purchased last summel The Arts and Crafts Department has been i hands of three teachers during the past year. January 1, Miss Dorothy Deiss, with a Master's c and with exceptional. talent, gave more than full to her work. It was difficult for her to see that ing all students to art, whether they were taleni not, could mean a development in appreciatior she was of tremendous help to those with skill a those staging school productions. Following Miss Deiss' departure, Mrs. Hadle wife of one of the Park staff, most ably subst. until .the graduation of Ann Smith from the Uni' of Tennessee in March. Ann is already makin, place in school and community and will continue us next year. Her approach to students makes wish to produce results. Mrs. Aletha Armstrong continues to develop voices and has the ability to coordinate them melodic harmony, while she gives them also a ground of musical history. and a knowledge ( forms of vocal and instrumental music.. Her tea has been coordinated with the band instruction was made available by the County this year an been of help to the band instructor. During the two operettas have been produced, one at Chri time and one at the close of the school year; in many voices were used commendably. In addition to our teachers, another staff is n to make the project what it is today. Director c whole over-all picture is Miss Ruth Dyer, who handles the mechanics of running the school an( ommends to the Committee, actions or change feels are to the best interests of the school an fraternity.

New strip films and slides for purposes of education in dental and other hygienic care have been purchased with money from various clubs and chapters and have been shown extensively. Layettes, gifts for the "loan closet" or baby toys are welcome gifts from clubs or chapters. Often, like old Mother Hubbard's, Marjorie's cupboard becomes bare, also. The Arrowcraft Shop is the mecca for all Pi Phis going to Gatlinburg and by remote control, is familiar to every Pi Phi. From it, under the practiced and practicable management of Ethel M. Snow, go the many beautiful crafts designed by Tina. McMorran, our Weaving Designer, to please the Pi Phis. When the advance in cost of linens, threads or other supplies necessitates a raise in price to absorb production costs, there must be a slight change in form or pattern of the article in order to meet O.P.A. requirements. This often means time must be taken to design other than entirely new patterns. With temperatures in the high nineties it sounds incongruous to talk of new patterned wool dirndls with matching stoles but soon we shall be wanting them again; there is a new knitting bag, and a new luncheon set will soon be in production. The popular woolen ties are no more, since men have taken to the bows and the cost of producing such ties as ours is prohibitive at the old price. Tina has designed and woven a second large dossal this year as her gift to her own little Episcopal church in Gatlinburg. It is in the old, lovely ecclesiastical red, the color having been selected by the rector. At present she is on leave to attend a special short course in weaving under the leadership of the famed Dorothy Leibes. This should mean new designs in new and gorgeous colors for next year's sales. Assisting Mrs. Snow and Mrs. McMorran in sales and weaving are Edna Cook, Reba Owenby, Margaret Ogle and Wanda Ogle. While the total number of weavers has been reduced this year, by keeping the very best, greater production is possible at lower cost. Our hotel shop at the Mountain View, under the supervision of Mrs. McCutchan, is a special attraction to all visitors. It is ever important to remember that no contribu tion to the Settlement School funds nor money re-turned to Arrowcraft is ever used other than for the development and broadening of the Settlement School program. As always we are appreciative of your efforts, which result in new funds to maintain or widen the scope of our project. The bareness of the Arrowcraft storage shelves in November attest to how many clubs order for the fall sales. The prompt return of unsold goods is vital to the business at Arrowcraft as is the prompt payment of bills. The same courtesy and business tactics should be used with II B (1) as with the merchants from whom one purchases locally. The assistance of all clubs selling Arrowcraft products is most appreciated and we regret being .able to list only the top few here. They are: Champaign-Urbana $2458.01 Milwaukee 1700.00 Coos County, Oregon 1628,41 Philadelphia 1625.96 Portland, Ore 1450.00 Houston, Tex 1337.77 Pittsburgh 1150.00 Madison 1119.55 Northern New jersey 973.75 Dallas 904.42 The Pi Beta Phi Cook-book has returned in a new blue cover.

Now we have arrived at the place where ing must be furnished. In all the Southern area, Pi Beta Phi stands first in its leadership development and for this reason we feel thi must be an example of what crafts schoo should or could be, and while economically cally done, it must also be well done. Those who attended the jasper Convei always remember the very touching speed Maryland A delegate when she officially 1 well, as the representative of the active chap fraternity and at the same time presented ti ing funds of her chapter to the Settlement be used toward the furnishing of the lout then proposed Staff House. This gift honore L. Keller, President Emeritus, and Mrs. He 64 THE SEPTEMBER RRt \h'' two of their most loyal charter members. This was the beginning of an idea. Without cur-tailing the amount of regular contributions so necessary for operation, we are asking that every chapter and club give consideration toward a special contribution for the furnishing of some room of the house. This would celebrate forty years of existence and could honor some fine alumna of your chapter or club, as did Maryland A. We also know that many Pi Phis individually will wish to help in making our building serviceable and beautiful. Should some one lean to the practical rather than the aesthetic, two thousand dollars will provide a kitchen with the type cabinets and tables highly recommended for institutional work. For many of us less fortunate financially, there are lamps, small scatter rugs, hangings, separate chairs, tables, even sofas and dining room furniture, all needed to create a useful whole. Furnishing is in the hands of a committee and the money may be sent to Mrs. Thomas E. Graham, 3324 W. 18th Street, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the Committee Treasurer. In the planning of the Staff House and the steps taken toward construction, we would express our great appreciation to Miss Jessie W. Harris, Miss Henrietta Sivyer, Miss Ruth Buckley, Miss Marian Heard, all of the University of Tennessee College of Home Economics and Mr. Warren T. Smith for the time and effort each has expended for Pi Beta Phi. Their counsel has been of inestimable value. The 1952 Workshop with Marian G. Heard of the University of Tennessee again serving as Director offers two three week sessions. Conducted as it is, in conjunction with the University, classes are on a university level for those desiring credit, while non-credit students are also welcome. This year, courses offered are Jewelry, Metal Work, introductory, advanced and rug Weaving, Pottery and Woodworking. Students from seventeen states are in attendance. A member of Pi Beta Phi, Mary Elizabeth Sullivan, heads the weaving section and two Pi Phis, Caroline Edmonds, California B, and Esther Breckinridge, Iowa r, are serving as Graduate Assistants. We are pleased that Marian Heard, whom we almost claim as our own, was elected President of the Southern Highlands' Guild for the current year. Having had so much to do with the encouragement of the crafts in that area, through the years, Pi Beta Phi continues to hold an important place in Guild activities. It is said that having a party is ever good for the house and so it proved in the fall when Gatlinburg entertained all the Governors of the United States for their annual conference. Merchants and townspeople cleaned and polished until the town shone and the whole affair brought wide and favorable comment. Pi Beta Phi loaned its Health Center and the surrounding grounds for a small Craftsmen's Fair where local craftsmen demonstrated their arts. Inside, a fine exhibit of finished products was arranged. This fair and exhibition was enjoyed by the Governors and their families because it was typical of the district. Were one ever to hear that our work is finished in Gatlinburg, one has but to think back on all that we do there. Think first of the place we hold in the fraternity world for having established a type of service outside our own organization; then the benefits of our Health program, relieving the over-taxed doctors of school Inspections, inoculations and consultations on minor ailments or accidents, or the advice given on ore-natal care or to the mothers of little babies, or the First Aid to the school children, day after day; the program of sanitation, disease prevention and health preservation would have a tremendous set-back,were the Health Center work to he withdrawn. The '`Workshop program in Crafts has just begun and has a large future, should we wish to expand it; the departure of many students to many states makes possible a wide-spread knowledge of the fraternity's influence on the handicrafts of the area. It means prestige for us when we display and sell the beautiful articles made for our Arrowcraft Shop and distributed all over the United States. It does not necessarily follow that we shall always have direct obligations along the lines of secondary education for the Gatlinburg school system, but when one is in Gatlinburg and talks with the older established residents or the doctors, rather than the new-comers in business on the street, eager for tourist trade but with less knowledge of the long .develop-meat of the town itself, one knows that we are needed. We ask each of the members of the Staff to contribute some of her own free time toward community or social service and the demands upon them are tremendous. The future program may change in many respects but we could ill afford to discontinue our interests. With the majority of fraternity members believing in the School and the work done there, we must continue our support to the best ..of our ability. It takes the cooperation of everyone to "lighten the load." Working and planning together for the Settlement School closely unites a Committee and Staff and results in respect for each one's capabilities and affection for each other. This coming year, we shall sorely miss from the Committee, Olivia Smith Moore of Texarkana, Texas who has been our most capable treasurer and friend, and Harriet Goodsell Rauch of New York City whose excellent publicity is familiar to all through the ARROW. To take their places, Grand Council appointed Theresa Graham of Oklahoma City as Treasurer and Virginia Brackett Green of Indianapolis. Mrs. Green will edit "News of Lillie Pigeon' and handle public relations. In addition to losing Lillian Howell as Assistant to the Director we also regret the resignation of Mrs. Eunice Cole from her duties as book-keeper at. Arrow-craft. She resigns to assist her husband in their business. Replacing them next fall we shall have two Pi Phis: Joan Newcomer, Kansas B, will become Miss Dyer's Assistant and Katherine McIntosh, Alabama B will take the position of Book-keeper and Assistant to Mrs. Snow at Arrowcraft. Pi beta Phis are particularly welcome both as teachers or on the regular staff and applications may be placed with the Director at any time. For the time this Chairman has served on the Committee, Amy B. Onken by appointment from the Council, has been the contact member. In an extremely heavy schedule she has found immediate time to answer a call for assistance or to give of her in-formation to benefit the School. The Committee is grateful for her help as well as that of the Council and the Province officers in sending can to you the month by month happenings at the Settlement School. The evidence of their assistance in keeping you in-formed manifests itself in your growing interest in this memorial to our Founders. Our Founders believed in our School and in those who outlined its development, Their prayers were for a lasting project which, in some form, would keep Pi Beta Phi fore-most in the fraternity world for its philanthropy. Let us keep it so. May future planners have "the heart to conceive, the understanding to direct, and the hand to execute." RUTH BARRETT SMITH THE SEPTEMBER ARROW REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1952 65 LFE is not a little bundle of big things, but a big bundle of little things." This statement from a newspaper column seems a fitting theme for my annual report. While big things have been accomplished in the village and at the school, it is the little things that make up the big bundle of daily happenings at the Settlement School. From humble beginnings of forty years ago, our project has grown and changed with the years, the program adapting to the new phases of life in a rapidly growing community. Community The year has marked an extensive program among the different churches for improvement to their buildings. Now we have several fine churches that are a credit to any town. The new Baptist Church of Crab Orchard stone in modern design has been completed. The beautiful pipe organ which is equipped with chimes, was the gift of Mrs. Mary Huff in memory of her husband, Andy Huff. The Methodist congregation has built a beautiful new parsonage and also purchased a parking lot behind the church. The little Episcopal Church has had a number of gifts. A pipe organ from Mrs. Ethel Voorheis Murry and a beautiful hand-woven dossal in ecclesiastical red from Tina McMorran were two of these. The Roaring Fork Baptist Church finished their basement and the little Primitive Baptist Church was repaired and painted. There has been great activity in the construction of new motels and tourist courts. Owners of existing courts have added new units and remodeled their old cabins until the town is very well supplied with fine accommodations for the tourists. People here complain of a poor season, but to the casual observer it does not seem that way. Statistics at the Park show an increase in visitors over last year. Perhaps we are reaching a saturation point. New shops have been added to the many in town and outside on the highways. Several of the new courts and shops show the influence of an architect who has moved to the community. He is Mr. Hubert Bebb, brother of Douglass Bebb of Buckhorn Inn. It is too bad that he did not come sooner, for his work is a distinct addition to the town. One bundle that could be called Big was made up of three factors. These were, the flash flood of September first, the Governor's Conference of the week of October first, and the Gatlinburg Craft Show held the same week. The flood made cleaning up for the Conference much harder, and the Craft Show was one of the factors in the entertainment of the visitors. The sudden, destructive flood was caused by a cloudburst in the mountains above the Alum Cave Trail. Ten inches of water fell in about an hour. Fortunately, no lives were lost, but the highway across the mountains was closed for eight days before temporary repairs could be made. Much damage was done to properties along the river, especially in the lower end of town. The water made the Greystone lawn into a lake, was over the railing of the Greystone Bridge, and made the highway into Knoxville accessible only to a jeep or a boat. The waters backed up Baskins Creek, but did not touch our property. When it receded, it left much debris and muck behind. Everyone worked, and by October first the town never looked better. We had perfect weather all the week of the Conference. The Governors' parties were housed in the four hotels, the press had quarters in certain designated motels, and the highway patrolmen had other courts assigned to them. For that week Gatlinburg was the center ofmuch activity. Because everyone worked together, this small town was able to entertain our distinguished guests. Banquets were held at different hotels, but the china and silver and even the waitresses of all the hotels appeared at the one where the function was being held. To provide entertainment for the wives of the governors and others not too busy with conferences, the local shops put on a Craft exhibition. The Health Center was used for the exhibit of outstanding examples of weaving, wood work, and other crafts. Behind the building and on the lawn were umbrellas and tents housing weavers, basket makers, broom makers, woodworkers, and others. No admission was charged, and hostesses were on hand to tell the guests about the craft industry in this locality. One of the interesting things about this was that some local and rural people came and, for. the first time, were made to realize what was going on and how their own skill fitted into the whole picture. The Chamber of Commerce made a great effort to extend the season at both ends. In the fall a group of Marble Dealers held a convention the week after the Governors had been here, and in the early spring we had meetings of the Wilson Club of America, a District Rotary convention and the Second Wildflower Pilgrimage. The bird lovers had continuous rain but hunted new species with great ardor. The other groups had better luck. During the dull season, the local people have made it a practice to stage. different benefit parties. This year the Polio Benefit netted much more than it had before, but the one for the village library brought considerably less. The Episcopal Guild had a game party one night that helped them put the slate roof on their new church and provided a good time besides. In December, the Garden Club held an unusually good show of flower arrangements and of the winter greens that grow in such abundance in this area. This group and the Rotary Club placed a number of concrete benches along the Parkway for the benefit of the tourists. The usual union services were held by the town churches at Thanksgiving and Christmas. On Easter, besides the sunrise service, there was an egg hunt for all the local children at the Whittle place. A new Park Superintendent was appointed for our Park. He is Mr. John. C. Preston from Mount Rainier National Park near Seattle. A survey and revaluation of property in town for taxation purposes and more talk of a village sewer system show that there is civic interest in the community. School A review of the school year brings to mind many little things the day-to-day routine of any school system which is highlighted by certain events of importance. Mr. Walter Ogle served his second year as principal, and we had Mrs. Ann Lighter for assistant principal. She returned after a year's leave of absence to have charge of the library and to teach junior and senior English. We have always been proud of our library, which is called the Grace Coolidge Library. We are especially proud of it since it has been so much improved by a number of changes. By taking out a partition between the library and an adjoining class room, the room was enlarged and space made for four new tables. The County paid for the carpenter work, the tables and the chairs. The tables are birch and were made in Mr. Cole's woodworking shop. They are beautiful. Mrs. Benjamin Weir, Illinois Z, who has made several fine gifts to the library, had made 66 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW an additional gift of $100 which we had been saving for something special. .New shelving seemed very necessary, and with this gift, $50 from Committee, and help from the County, we have entire new shelving in the room. We were very fortunate that Mr. Lighter, who is the husband of the librarian, has a hobby of woodworking. He made these shelves in our Craft Shop. They are made to scale to fit into each available space and are very well made. The library has to serve as a classroom, but with the L-shape can be used at the same time for study. Interested Pi Phi alumna clubs, active chapters and individuals have added many volumes to our book collection. Mrs. Lighter has a special Memorial Shelf where books that have been given in memory of Pi Phis have an honored place. These books are often special -volumes that are too expensive to be acquired in the ordinary way. The Washington D. C. Alumnae Club has a practice of sending a book to the School instead of giving flowers at the death of a member. Mrs. Lighter can secure such good discounts and often wants some special book, so a gift of money can be spent most advantageously. More books came to the School from Texas A and from the Lexington, Kentucky Alumnae Club. These were sorted and placed where they could best be used. Many juvenile books were put in the new elementary building to form a collection for the use of the teachers in the lower grades. Books get pretty hard wear from the little folk, and it is fine to have new material to place on the tables in their rooms for them to read and enjoy. These gifts made it possible to discard some books that were really worn out. Departmentalization in the seventh and eighth grades worked a little better than it did last year. Mr. Tip Robertson had the eighth grade home room and coached the boys' basketball team. Miss Hazel Watson, daughter of Richard, our farm manager, had the seventh grade and coached the girls' team. Hazel graduated from Berea College and did a very good job in her first teaching assignment. Both of the junior basketball teams made excellent records. The high school freshman English teacher had these two grades in that subject and their other studies were divided between the two home room teachers. The work in business was taught by Mr. Jack Miller. In the second semester he added a course in Business Law to the curriculum. Mrs. Ruth Owenby and Mr. Mark Grim have been good members of our faculty for several years, and both did their part in helping make the teaching pro-gram a good one. The home economics department was in charge of Miss Joan McCready, an Iowa State College graduate. She was an outstanding teacher and gave the girls some very practical instruction in sewing and cooking. Miss Hodgen and I both felt that the dormitory girls learned more under her than they had previously. The arts and crafts program was carried on under great difficulty. Not in the woodworking department, for Mr. Carl Huskey had a good class of boys who did some very nice work in producing small articles of furniture. A late resignation by the art teacher made it difficult to find the proper person for our program, but Miss Dorothy Deiss came down from New York, where she had just finished work for her master's degree in time to start the second week of school. She was a teacher of outstanding ability and gave some fine service to the school, but she did not feel that she could carry on the work after the first semester. The high school classes had to have the credit, so we were fortunate in securing Mrs. Charm Hadley, wife of Dr. Jervis Hadley, park geologist, to teach just those twoclasses. Mrs. Hadley has an art degree and had taught the subject, so we were well pleased with that arrangement. In March, Ann Smith came from the University of Tennessee to take over the entire program, the very day she graduated. Ann had been a Workshop student the summer before, came back to Workshop this summer, and is to teach for us next year. She was a happy solution to that difficulty. Mrs. Armstrong again had the classes in music. She had a good chorus of high school students, a girls' glee club, and gave two very fine programs. The annual operetta was called "The Frog Prince." It was as cute as it could be. We were glad that the Committee was in town to see the younger children in their clever costumes and to hear their sweet young voices. The town is still talking about the Christmas program, for it was one of the finest we have ever had at the school. Miss Deiss and her students helped with the staging. They made the "Talking Christmas Tree" and the papier rnache reindeer, Santa and his sleigh. The reindeer were almost life-size. They won a blue ribbon for the Arts and Crafts department in the Garden Club show and were much admired in the lobby of the Mountain View Hotel during the holiday season. Mr. Hartford Granitz taught the classes in health, coached the girls' and boys' basketball teams in the high school, and helped with the football pro-gram. No spectacular results came from either sport, but this was due to the material he had to work with rather than from his work. The School has long felt the need of a band, and for the first time, a start has been made toward that project. The Rotary Club acted as sponsor, and a Knoxville firm provided the instruments on a six weeks rental-trial basis. At the end of that time, the rent paid was applied on the price of the instrument. A good start was made, and they even had a concert to show progress. Now the school board is trying to find a band director who can also teach some academic subject, and thus be on the regular payroll. This year, we again cooperated with the University of Tennessee in having a group of student practice teachers work at the school for six weeks. The young people were mostly preparing for elementary teaching positions and worked with our grade school teachers to their mutual advantage. In order to foster professional interest, an active in-service training program was instituted for the faculty and five meetings were held. One of these was a county-wide meeting held at our School. Mrs. Lighter was chosen to serve on an important committee of educators who spent one week in intensive evaluation of Rule High School in Knoxville. Their findings will be a help to the whole area. The Junior play was "Little Women" and was very well cast and produced. The Seniors chose "Johnny on the Spot" for their play. It was fun to see a tall mountain lad play the part of the returned soldier who against his will was posing as a great hero. Room parties for the grade school children at the Christmas and Valentine seasons, the high school basketball, football, and Junior banquets were all Big things that brought gayety and happiness into the regular school program. The Senior Class of twenty-two members made a trip to Washington, D. C., with a stopover at Luray Caverns in Virginia. They had been well-briefed before they left school in the historical and scenic wonders they were to see. Even the arrow on Mrs. Coolidge's dress caught their notice when they visited the Smithsonian Institute and saw the wax figures of the Presidents' wives. The Baccalaureate service was held in the new Baptist Church with a fine speaker and lovely music by the girls' glee club. Class night THE SEPTEMBER ARROW and Commencement followed, both being held in our auditorium. A number of the class are planning on going to college this fall. Most of them have positions in restaurants, shops, or hotels this summer. P.T There had been a growing sentiment against raising money for P.T.A. projects by holding Bingo games both here in town and in the state organization. The new Baptist minister, Rev. J. B. Carter, very much disapproved. and this year the games were given up. Revenue has come from three rummage sales that brought in about $350.00 and from a Minstrel Show that netted the same amount. This was given two nights in the High School gym and was a gala affair. A surprising amount of local talent gave an outstanding performance. Marjorie Chalmers and Lillian Hansen of our staff were in the cast. The pharmacist at one of the drug stores directed the show. The P.T.A. again operated the school lunch program under the efficient management of Mrs. Grace Morell. They contributed the proceeds of one rummage sale to the school library and have a surplus to spend for some worthy cause next year. The monthly programs were interesting and in several instances brought many fathers to the meetings. Sue Huff Cox served as President, Lillian was Secretary, and Mrs. Henrietta Huff was Program chairman for the year. Two study meetings were held at Teachers' Cottage with the Director serving as discussion leader. At these meetings every-one brought their own sandwiches, and Miss Hodgen provided cake and coffee for dessert one time, and the other time Sue baked the cake. Dormitory We had twelve dormitory students during the year, nine girls and three boys. Seven of these were fresh-.men and new to group living. It took a couple of months for them to lose some of their shyness and to learn what was expected of them. Before the year was over, they felt at home and contributed their part toward running the place. The girls esnecially helped with work in the kitchen and dining room and did very well when we were without a cook, by preparing breakfast and helping at supper time. We have had a serious time with help shortages. I do not know what we would have done without Miss Hodgen to take over when we had no cook. Lillian Hansen, my assist-ant, chaperoned the girls and taught them many things they should always remember. We entertained at several nice dinners during the year. Committee members were with us one evening and we also had the annual dinner for the Commencement speaker, the County Superintendent, and others. I entertained all of the teachers at tea, early in the fall, and when the student teachers came, we had another get-together for them, the faculty and our staff. We have a number of foreign visitors each year who come to see our school as an example of a good Craft Center. Last fall a group of South American students were here. They talked to the students at a special assembly and had a public exhibition of crafts they had brought from their own countries. Later that evening, we invited interested friends to meet the group at Teachers' Cottage and served doughnuts and coffee. We have entertained guests from Egypt, China, England, and Austria, some of them for overnight stops. They always bring much of interest to us, and I know carry away knowledge that will help them in their different work. Stuart College living room has again served as a piano studio for a private teacher whose pupils get excused from class work to take les-sons during school hours. The girls of Lillian's Scout troop held their annu Silver Tea at Stuart, and also held their Christm party there. The Dormitory students had several pz ties, and the whole family went on several picnic One of these was a rather damp one when we all car back to Stuart to eat our dessert and have a surpri shower for Lillian and her fiance, Harry W. Howe Health Center Of all the varied services contributed by the Et ternity to the community, none is more important th that rendered by our nurse, Mrs. Marjorie Chalmei She presides over our modern little Health Cent where several important local clinics are held ea, year. Two of these are the pre-school clinic for ch. dren entering school for the first time, and the visit the state mobile X-ray unit for chest examinations. , the latter visit, over 1000 people were X-rayed in ol day. This is a great number for this small town, b is due to the number of people who work in resc restaurants and hotels and must have a health car Marjorie has taught classes in child care to the soph more home economics class and to Lillian's Sco troop. Another Scout troop had lessons in First Ai The daily visits of the school children for Fii Aid, home visits, health talks given and pictures shwa in the rural schools, all seem like everyday, liti things, but when a summary is made of the wo done over a long period of time, we have a B bundle. Some startling figures came to light wh records of the past twenty years were consulted and tabulation made. Field Visits 23,5 Office Calls 41,31 First Aid Dressings ;5,3: Inoculations 1,1, Physical Examinations and Pupil Inspections 54,6 Health Talks 2,11 Newspaper Articles (5 years) The state of Tennessee furnishes the serums for Ma. orie's work, and we receive gifts from other sour( that help with the program. Outside our own chaptc and alumnae clubs, who are most generous with cif the greatest source of income is from Sigma P Gamma, international sorority. This group sends t Council of Southern Mountain Workers a sum money each year to be used for health work in t mountains. Last year this was $1350. Our share of tl amount was over $50. Individual chapters of that ( ganization adopt our project as the special center receive their welfare gifts. In money this amounts quite a sum during the year, and they also send tool brushes and other items that the nurse can use in 1-work. They have provided glasses for a number children who could not otherwise afford them. T shelves at the Health Center that are reserved i "give-aways" need frequent replenishing, especia for baby items and for clean, used clothing for sm children. Just last week, Marjorie was telephoning l friends and scurrying around to find a layette fox new baby. Farm Richard Watson was in charge of the garden, i chickens and our livestock, which consists of t mules and six pigs. The chickens provide us w meat and eggs for the table, the pigs are our prix garbage disposal unit, and the mules we use wh, people on level ground would use a tractor. 'I garden provides us with fresh vegetables, and w.17 68 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW the new staff house took away a good garden spot, we still have good potatoes on a hillside above the chicken houses. The Dormitory boys help wherever they are needed in keeping up the place. Arrowcraft Shop With the many craft shops now operating in Gatlin-burg, our shop occupies a unique position. We are one of three Guild shops in town, and since our merchandise is all of superior workmanship and quality-, we attract the more discriminating tourists. Sometimes our five o'clock closing hour and the fact that we are never open on Sunday causes a disappointment for people whose stay in town is limited. Longer hours would mean more employees and be too hard on the regular staff. Our big order business' with alumna Clubs and active chapters keeps everyone working at top speed all during .the fall shipping season. Last summer, many clubs ordered even' before the new price list had been sent to them. August was the heaviest .month's business in the history of the shop. In addition to the summer tourist customers, 42 club orders were filled and there were about ten others waiting to be shipped. In November, the weavers' pay roll was $5600, an all-time high. Still, there were shortages in some items, for try as we will to plan ahead, no one is a mind reader to foretell just what items will be most in demand. Some club chairmen order too optimistically, and if everything is not sold or returned promptly, some other club may be short some items. Many Arrowcraft articles were displayed in the exhibits at the Craftsman's Fair in Asheville, N. C., and ' we sent Tina McMorran and Wanda Ogle to demonstrate weaving, and Edna Cook for the sales room. Last fall, the Qatlinburg Craft Exhibit held during the Governors' Conference meant much extra work. Ethel Snow was in charge of the demonstrations. Arrowcraft furnished two demonstrators, one for weaving and one for warping. The Elmer Kear family, makers of our brooms, were there, .and Mat and Mary L. Owenby put on a chair-making demonstration. Pi Phi's gift: to each Governor's lady was a handwoven, ' white linen guest towel which was wrapped and sent to their hotel rooms., That same month we sent articles to; the Tennessee Annual Craft Exhibit and Sale at the University of Tennessee. ' In the ' spring during the Wilson Club Convention, we,were asked to have. a display of our weavings in the lobby of the Mountain.View Hotel, Edna helped Mrs. McCutchan in the Hotel Shop that' .'day ' and answered questions about the exhibit. The.', interior arrangement of the ,Arr'owcraft'shop has been changed by ;moving the bed into ,the second sales "room and by having a . room with a pretty Warp on it in the main sales room. Tina and Mary Elizabeth' Sullivan, one of the Workshop 'Teachers and also a Pi Phi, wove two screens for window display that are very interesting. They are' made of hardwood ;strips held together with a. gay warp. The windows were especially pretty during the Christmas season. An unusual creche made entirely of corn stalks, candles, and native greens were used. The Weavers' Annual Christmas party brought a large attendance. The program of carols by a group of school children, harp-singing, and the gift exchange were held at Stuart Cottage. Refreshments were served at the. dining rental tables and at extra card tables in Pollard. Tina spent a week in New York attending exhibitions, gaining inspiration for new designs. One recognition for her work was an article in the Spring and Summer Quarterly of . cCall's Magazine on her work, in which our. aprons and bags were pictured in color. Summer Activities An event of early summer was the June wedding of roy.aassistant, Lillian Hansen, and Harry W. Howell. The ceremony Was performed in the Episcopal Church, with the reception at the Greystone Playhouse. Lillian has made a place for herself in the hearts of all the community by her work at the School and her outside activities with the Girl Scouts and the Episcopal church group. Everyone was glad to wish her well, and to have the assurance that she 'would stay on with the School until September when Harry goes to Atlanta to take advanced work in architecture at Georgia Tech. Mr. Richards and his Gateway Players again used the gymnasium for summer stock. The plays provided good entertainment for the summer people. The 1951 Workshop was the most successful one we have ever had both in quality of the students and in the work produced. We had people from 26 states, represented by the staff and student body. A number were Pi Phis, but not as many as we would like to have. if our own members could attend a session of the Workshop, working and playing with the group, enjoying the outings and the daily fellowship in the dining room, it would be the greatest boost we could have. One has to be here to realize what a wonderful Craft School we have. . This summer we have watched the progress of our lovely new Staff House with great interest. The work has progressed with very little delay from lack of materials and. each week shows progress. Workshop students were interested in, that they will. have the facilities of the larger dining room next summer. In this summary of tle.y*car's pork, the little thing~, both ,good xnd had, crowd. my memory. Some of the things in the 'Good bundle are the gifts' at Christmas time and through the year from alum= clubs, active chapters and individual Pi Phis, the many .pleasant contact~ ith interested visitors, and the faithfulness of our loyal employees. These far outweigh the bad things,, the discouragernents and problems of maintenance And help in running the Settlement School. I wish to close by expressing my thanks to the Settlement 'School Committee and to all others who have helped me handle my "bundle of little things." Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER, Director Use the .Pi Beta .Phi Magazine A.gency', 410 Standard Building, Decatur, Illinois.

Committee Reports Holt House Committee IT IS the feeling of the Committee that Holt House has, during the year now closing, well served its purpose as a modest shrine dedicated to the memory of the Founders of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity and as a gracious house which renders valuable, and valued, service to the community where that fraternity was founded eighty-five years ago. During the year, Holt House was used sixty-six times as a meeting place for organizations or to pro-vide accommodations for private entertaining on thirty-one of these occasions by groups affiliated with the fraternity. The chapters in the vicinity used the house for rushing parties, formal parties, cooky-shines, pledge parties, teas and for initiation. Thirty-one members of Illinois Eta visited the house in a group. The alumnae clubs of the area and the Illinois Alpha Mothers' Club held regular meetings, suppers, cooky-shines and teas there. Three other alumnae clubs came from distant points to hold special meetings there; and one distant club paid a visit to the house. It is the hope of the Committee that these groups and other distant clubs and chapters will make arrangements to visit Holt House during the year ahead, for they are most welcome. The house also accommodated, on thirty-five occasions, groups and individuals not connected with the Fraternity organization. Groups meeting there with regularity were the PEO, the DAR, the 0GM Bridge Club and the Monmouth Women's Club. A number of other organizations used the house on one occasion, or more. Holt House also provided a gracious setting for teas, showers, parties and wed-ding receptions given by individuals. A number of lovely gifts for the house were received during the year. The Committee is very grateful to Fannie Bradford Bailey who gave to Holt House the antique oil portraits of her grandparents, Major and Mrs. Holt. These portraits had previously been loaned, by Mrs. Bailey. The Springfield, Illinois, Alumnae Club presented a fine silver tray which was greatly needed. The Spokane, Washington, Alumnae Club very thoughtfully gave a beautiful little antique English silver "sweets basket" in memory of Eloise Ohme Moffatt, one of their younger members who was also a Pi Phi daughter. Mrs Moffat's name was en-graved on the little basket which was placed on the melodeon in the Victorian Parlor. The Burlington-Fort Madison, Iowa, Club, after holding a meeting in the house, presented a lovely antique shadow box which is to display old I. C. and Pi Phi pins. The alumna of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, made a gift of a small check with which to buy something for the house, at the time of their meeting there; and a member of the Avon-Bushnell, Illinois, group left two pairs of pretty, old pillow shams at the conclusion of their meeting in Holt House. To all these donors, the Committee is most grateful for their gifts and for their thoughtful interest in the house. The house itself is in good condition, only minor repairs being ,required during the year. The folding chairs, ordered some time ago, were received in the summer of 1951 and have been put to use many times. A number of replacements will be necessary during the coming year: new ruffled curtains have been ordered for the Founders' Room; several pieces of furniture will need to be re-covered; and the stair carpeting must soon be replaced. Also, the Victorian Parlor will need to be re-papered. The Committee will bevery grateful for nineteenth century photographs of members, to be placed in the velvet covered albums received last year; and for old I. C. or Pi Phi pins, to be placed in the shadow box received recently. Such items may be either loaned or presented to the house and will add a great deal to its small treasury of mementos of the early days of Pi Beta Phi. Mabel T. Johnson, who came to Holt House as hostess in December of 1950, keeps the house and its furnishings in excellent condition. She has assumed all the responsibilities of her position in splendid fashion and acts with graciousness and hospitality. Mrs. Johnson is well aware of the purpose and function of Holt House, having been a Monmouth resident all of her life. The Committee feels that the Fraternity is fortunate in having her as hostess and is glad to report that she is apparently happy in her association with Pi Beta Phi. The Committee is sincerely grateful to the many chapters and clubs which have contributed to the support of Holt House this year. The number of clubs contributing to the fund is, however; fewer, by nine, than the total of two-hundred twenty-two clubs which contributed during the preceding year. Among the clubs, the highest contributor was KansaS ' City, Missouri, with a gift of $50.00. The Spokane, Washing-ton, Club gave almost this exact amount for the purchase of a special memorial gift. The second highest contributor to the general fund was the Everett, Washington, Club which gave $30.00. Springfield, Illinois, gave this amount, too, for the purchase of a special gift for the house; in addition to their regular contribution to the fund. The Monmouth, Illinois, alumna group gave $25.00, the third highest contribution to the general fund. Many other clubs were very generous in their gifts. The number of chapters supporting the house in-creased from eighty-five during 1950-51 to eighty-nine during 1951-52. The highest contributing chap ters were: California $50.00 Louisiana A 50.00 Oklahoma A 35.00 Tennessee B 30.00 Illinois A 25.00 Kansas B 25.00 Texas A 25.00 As was also true last year, every chapter and every club in Delta Province and in Zeta Province contributed to the Holt House Fund. In addition to these provinces, in Alpha West, Gamma, Epsilon. Eta and Kappa Provinces, every chapter contributed ; and in Iota Province every club contributed. Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, followed by Eta Province in second place and by Mu Province, third. It is with extreme regret 'that the Holt House Committee announces the recent death of Evelyn Holliday Bridge who served as Committee Secretary during the past two years. Her interest in the house and in the work of the Committee was unfailing. Her efforts in behalf of the house continued, in spite of her illness, until a few months before her death. Her loss will be deeply felt. Alice McDougall Jensen, Monmouth member of the Committee, has, through her presence in Mon 77
