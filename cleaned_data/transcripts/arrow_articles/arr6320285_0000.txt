        284 THE DECEMBER ARROW of indignant letters to the editor of the Mon-mouth newspaper, protesting the abuses which a handful of radical Abolitionists were perpetrating upon a helpless South. Major Holt is typical of a generation of men, who, through individual courage and perseverance, succeeded in transforming a wilderness into a highly civilized nation within the span of a few decades. Growing up at a time when his family were struggling against a series of misfortunes which had reduced them to poverty, he early realized that whatever he was to possess he must gain for himself. He set out alone, braving danger and hardship, to seek his for-tune; yet he became no mere adventurer. While still a young man he began to assume all the responsibilities of a solid citizen. His periods of schooling were few and frequently inter-rupted; yet he undertook to teach a "select school" in Georgetown, Kentucky, and later studied law in a New York City office. His business successes were due to a combination of energy and shrewdness ; yet he seems always to have had a high regard for honor, and to have been just in all his dealings. Time after time, when his prospects seemed ruined by epidemics, cotton market crashes, "brass hat" favoritism and political trends, he remained undiscouraged and did not seek a life of ease until he had amply provided for his family. Not only does the Statement furnish material for historical research, but it offers a challenge to the men and women of this generation who may be toh easily dismayed by present-day obstacles to achievement. What a Fraternity Girl Thinks . . . From this day forward you cannot act alone. . ." These simple words in the pledging ceremony are dearer to a fraternity girl than all others she hears ever again. She knows then that at last she has found happiness a happiness which she does not realize then will grow to be a top joy in her whole life. Not until she has sat through her first rush discussion, seen her sisters in gaiety and sorrow, helped in some way to pull her fraternity over thin ice be it making a scholastic average, or making a pajama party a success does she realize that the happiness of Pi Beta Phi is not so much personal happiness as that top joy of "not acting alone." College life suddenly becomes a dream in reality, for all she does on campus is a part of her responsibility to her chapter. She joins organizations, cooperates with her instructors, lives and acts as an example to others not for any individual glory she will receive, but for that ever-hoped for additional praise that the Pi Beta Phis will receive. Fraternity life, she soon discovers, is not that taken-for-granted love of her family, but thelove of a group of girls who take her at her own valuation, who judge her for what she contributes to life, not for what she takes from it. Sometimes a fraternity girl does not realize this feeling of being part of a whole until her second or third year in the group. Often it takes a little jolt of some kind perhaps being away over the summer, or being faced with a new organizational responsibility which rests solely upon her but when she does discover in her heart the meaning of belonging to a fraternity, she suddenly sees that she has found that complete interlacing of ideals: the striving toward high living, toward unequaled character, and toward fine womanhood the unity of happiness which every Pi Beta Phi finds when she no longer acts alone. Her graceful golden arrow means more to her than just "one of the best fraternities in the land"; it signifies now what a fraternity girl thinks: "Through Pi Beta Pi l have learned what happiness is."

LITTLE PIGEON Edited by EUGENIA BROOKS SMITH, Indiana r A Province Vice-President Visits Settlement School Louise Wheelock Dobler, Washington B, Lambda Province Vice-President, took the long way home from Convention last summer and with her attractive young son, Bill, visited Gatlinburg for the day. It was a pleasure for "Committee" and the Settlement School staff to meet Louise and as she relives the experience of her visit we know it was a happy day for her. It is a beautiful summer day, and we almost pinch ourselves to be sure we aren't dreaming. Just a few more turns on that winding mountain road and we'll be there ! Where ? Why, the Pi Phi Settlement School, of course. "We left Knoxville on a crowded Smoky Mountain Trailways Bus in the cool of the morning, and now after nearly two hours over well-paved mountain roads, past modest farm houses and cabins, steep hillsides and fertile meadows rich with cotton, corn, "caters," and tobacco, we approach the smoky haze that tells us our goal is in sight. For as long as we've known about Pi Phi, we have known and loved "The school," and now our first glimpse finds us a bit awed and tremulous. "The bus takes us past the familiar land marks and we are a bit surprised, and proud, to find that the school is in the heart of Gatlin-burg, more truly it is Gatlinburg, and we see the enterprises of the town have nestled around her very skirts as though to be assured strength and protection. "After noting that the Arrowcraft shop looks just as it does in pictures (except the color of the native `brownstone' is lovelier `in person') we go inside and greet Ethel Snow amid displays of most of our favorites luncheon mats, scarfs, and handbags. We miss the familiar array of baskets and toasting forks, but are delighted with the sight of fireplace brooms, as we think of all our customers who want them this year. We take a peek in the stock room and find shelves gay with brightly colored woolens; and in the packing room, labels which will take packages to all corners of our land, are finding their way to well-done-up parcels. "Going out the back door of.the Arrowcraft Shop, we find ourselves in the midst of the school playground with the Arts and Crafts building to the right, the high school straightahead, and the grade school just west of that. But now the grounds are quiet, the grass is brown from summer sun, for this is vacation time and the children of the district are buSy with home chores. We are curious to look into the Craft Building and find it fascinatingly alive with adults doing all sorts of things with Wood and metal. They are the summer work-shop people who have learned how much' fun it for families to play and work together. In the high school building we find still others experimenting with colors and cloths in making lovely draperies and linens. Our inspection of that building reveals an all-purpose combination gymnasium and auditorium, a small, but well-equipped domestic science room; and signs over some of the doors to let us know that the elementary school enrollment has outgrown its modest building, and the seventh and eighth grades have had to find space in the bigger one. We see signs of needed paint and repair that will come as soon as the summer school is out. "Over in the teachers' cottage, which nestles in the shade of lovely trees, we find Miss Ruth Dyer, the genial director of the school, and all of the Settlement School Committee enjoying a before-luncheon respite on the screened-in porch. Luncheon is delicious and enjoyable, and affords an opportunity to show off the productiveness of the school garden; for we feast on fresh cob corn, shell beans, sweet potatoes, and okra, just to mention a few of the good things. "Despite the heat we resume our tour early after lunch because this is our ONE day here at the school, and we must see it all. We walk past the barn, through the pasture, and come to a plain little frame cottage that serves as the health center and the home of our be-loved nurse, Marjorie Chalmers. We look past the worn and sagging floors, the small but scrupulously clean dispensary, and 'picture the new building that is an assured promise to rise in memory of our own Jennie Nicol. And as we ride over the countryside to help Marjorie post notices of forthcoming health clinics, we realize in part the role we have played as privileged and educated women in 285 This Lovely Picture of A.rrowucraft Shop Was Made Recently by Mr. Allen R. Rankin, Husband of Edith Hoyer Rankin, Beta Province Vice-President. giving joy and blessing to `some of the least of these.' "As the shadows lengthened and we made our way back down the winding road, we thought of the great future possibilities and opportunities that are ours in the Smokies. Our school as it stands today is a monument to those who have had faith in its need and mission. Our school as it continues in the future will reflect the cherished esteem we hold for our Founders by the loyalty and support we give it. The need is there, the time is now, and as the Smokies slid from sight, we were truly grateful for our good fortune to know first hand the thing that brings so much joy and pride to all Pi Phis." 1946 Commencement Activities Eighteen graduating Seniors all members of the class of 1946 of the Pi Beta Phi High School, now look back upon the thrills and excitement of their Commencement as the great-est days in their lives. There was the Senior Class Play, the memorable trip to Atlanta, the Baccalaureate Service, Class Night, and finally the Commencement Exercises. Graduation activities actually began with the Senior Class play on April 19th, 1946. Ten members of the class proved their dramatic ability in the three act comedy drama, "He Couldn't Marry Five." They did a commendable piece of work under the able direction of Mrs. Lighter, one of our English teachers and High School Librarian. The new cyclorama and curtains add so much dignity and color to all the varied events of the school year and provide more incentive to strive for perfection. There are no more curious, smiling faces "peeking" through the holes in the makeshift curtains to see if admiring family and friends have arrived to see their exhibition of skill as actors. For weeks it seemed that in spite of all the work to be done May 14th would never roll around. Note books, final tests, and classes all THE DECEMBER ARROW 287 helped to pass the time until that "special day" when the entire class "took off ." for Atlanta, under the supervision of Mrs. Lighter, Senior Class sponsor and Miss Elizabeth Petrie, Arts and Crafts teacher. The Seniors had worked and saved for a period of weeks in order to have enough money to pay for the chartered bus and their lodgings while away. The trip south was broken to give ample time to see the beauty spots which spring had brought to the mountains. In Atlanta, the class members were especially impressed by the colorful cyclorama of the Battle of Atlanta which was on exhibit in Grant Park. The murals were arranged in a circle to give a vivid story of the dramatic incidents in the battle. The Seniors were also greatly interested in the carved image of General Robert E. Lee eternally engraved on the slope of Stone Mountain. Back home from this exciting trip, the class members scarcely had time to get ready for the inspiring Baccalaureate Service which was held at the Baptist Church on Sunday evening, May 19th. Promptly at eight o'clock, the class marched into the crowded church to the strains of the Processional, "0 Zion Haste." The sermon to the class was given by the Reverend J. C. Chapman of Sevierville. On the following Wednesday night the annual Junior-Senior Banquet was held at the New Gatlinburg Inn to give the members of the Junior Class just a slight indication of the thrills ahead when they would be Seniors. This was a formal affair even down to a floor show given by some of the students. Class Night brought the members of the class to the realization that high school days would soon be over. The girls who greatly out-numbered the boys in the class of '46, were attractive in their long, formal dresses. From the "Welcoming Address" by Sara Frances Mize, the program unfolded to reveal the "Class Prophecy," the "History," and the "Class Will." A serious and dignified group of Seniors stood at the close of the evening to sing "Farewell to Thee." At last the day of days arrived. At eight o'clock in the evening of May 24th, the Seniors, splendid in their caps and gowns, marched into the High School Auditorium, with the eyes of all the community upon them. The Commencement address was delivered by Mr. Victor Davis, Director of Personnel at the University of Tennessee. Jack Hoover Jenkins, with a four year average of 96.6 gave the Valedictory, and Dorothy Jeanette Maples was Salutatorian with an average of 93.25. Each Senior in turn walked across the stage to receive his diplomaat the hands of School Superintendent, Mr. Theron H. Hodges. Awards were presented for outstanding accomplishments. Then, as the piano played the Recessional, "Crown Him With Many Crowns," another class of graduates marched out of the Pi Beta Phi School to meet the responsibilities of life. Grammar School Operetta The following account was taken from the Gatlinburg weekly newspaper. As part of the High School English assignments, Mrs. Lighter has her students write articles for the paper. The Operetta was reported by Barbara Huff and Dorothy Miller. :On April 19th, in the high school auditorium, the grammar school of Pi Beta Phi gave an operetta called `The Rose Dream.' Gaily costumed children from all of the grades participated in the play. "The operetta was about a little girl, Patsy King, who fell asleep in the woods and had a dream. In the dream were Virginia Davenport, the fairy queen, Carl Wade, Hop-0-My-Thumb, and the fairies, roses and elves from all the grades. The stage was gaily decorated as a rose garden. Choruses from all the grades participated. "The operetta was under the direction of Mrs. Stanley Armstrong, public school music teacher." Mrs. Armstrong and the teachers spent unlimited time and effort on the production with wonderful results. The costumes were clever, the acting good, and the singing especially fine. The rosebuds wore crepe paper dresses with green tops and pink, yellow or white petal skirts. The boys were dressed as elves with orange paper caps and the fairies' costumes were made of white tobacco netting and trimmed with silver stars. Tarltan could not be supplied and the Home Economic girls made the substitute by starching the tobacco netting very stiffly. The scenery and throne for the operetta were built by Mr. Huskey's woodworking classes. Summer School and Workshop at Gatlinburg This past summer, for the second consecutive year, Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee offered a craftmanship school at Gatlinburg. Here in the heart of the Smoky Mountains, students came to learn, create, play, and enjoy the beauties of nature. The summer school was operated on the in288 THE DECEMBER ARROW One of the New Doily Designs the Clubs Will Be Selling This Year. formal workshop plan where work either for University credit or on a non-credit basis was available in Crafts and Community Recreation. Fifteen states were represented in the student body and as many different types of students represented their states. One person, who came from Georgia, did work with patients in a United States Veterans Administration Hospital; another one came from the faculty of the Art Department at the University of Minnesota. There were Home Demonstration Agents, Home Economics Teachers, Grammar School Teachers, a Librarian, two Nurses, a Teacher of Drawing and Industrial Arts and an Assistant Professor of Home Economics at the University of Oklahoma. There were four scholarships offered for room and board for assistance in the dining room. Three younger Pi Phis were there taking ad-vantage of this privilege. Their pep, enthusiasm, and talents added much to the six weeks session. The roll call of states was interesting and each student proudly represented her state. They were: Virginia, Alabama, Florida, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Minnesota, Georgia, Kansas, North Carolina, Illinois, Maryland, Oklahoma, Iowa and Wisconsin. Many worthwhile things were planned for recreation in the form of trips which included one to the John C. Campbell School of Brass-town, North Carolina, and to the Cherokee Indian School at the Cherokee Indian Reservation. Walks, hikes, nature study trips, horseback rides, games, folk dances, and motor trips occupied the students' time when they were not in the workshop. An evening of Open House at the School gave interested visitors the opportunity to see the beautiful results of the six weeks' session. The weaving department had lovely and interesting designs on display. In the recreational crafts shop were beautiful pieces of hand blocking and hand screened prints. Down in the arts and crafts building, which housed the wood-working and metal work departments, ,were interesting pieces of work in the form of hand turned bowls and trays of cherry, walnut, sassafras, and mahogany. Several students had made looms which looked very intricate. In the jewelry shop were bracelets, rings, earrings, and pins of exquisitely delicate design and workmanship. Some pieces were beautiful in sirnplicity, while others were unusual for the difficult work involved in the setting of stones. In metal, were many trays, plates, bowls, and dishes of copper and aluminum. The work rep-resented originality in design and skill in workmanship. The school was under the able co-direction of Miss Elsa Ulbricht, B.S., member of the School of Art at the Milwaukee State Teachers College, and Miss Marian Heard, B.S., M.A., Associate Professor of Related Art at the University of Tennessee. Miss Ulbricht was instructor in weaving and design and Miss Heard was instructor in jewelry and recreational Crafts. Other members of the staff were Miss Harriet Gill, B.Ed. who was an instructor of Art at Berea College, and in charge of woodcraft. Community Recreation was under the able direction of Josephine Arnquist Bakke, B.S., Secretary of the Y.W.C.A. at Iowa State College at Ames, Iowa. The students felt they had experienced a very interesting .and profitable time in the work-shop as well as having a most enjoyable vacation in the heart of the Great Smoky Mountains. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Films are now in char ,e of the Publicity Member on the Committee. Write to Mrs. G. Herbert Smith, 180 S. Winter Street, Salem, Oregon, for information regarding the films. There are three films in color, each requiring about twenty minutes showing time.

OM PPHI PENS Edited by MARY ELIZABETH BARNETTE, Ohio A 11 F DR. ICIE G. MACY and DR. HAROLD H. WILLIAMS, Hidden Hunger, The Jacques Cattell Press, 320 pp. A Science Book Club selection for July, "Hidden Hunger," a book with the definitive sub-title, "Tragedy of the Unbalanced Diet," concerns a subject which should be meaningful to every American. It is written by two nutrition experts, not for other diet specialists, but for the general public regardless of age or income strata. Startling in that it reveals that America, though well fed, is poorly nourished, the book is constructive because besides deploring inadequate diets it indicates the ways in which the deficiencies can be corrected. For example, it points out: "Freedom from `obvious hunger' is accomplished through soil conservation, improved fertilizers and seeds, development of methods for control of blight and pests, more efficient machinery, and improvements in animal husbandry. . . Good nutrition has its inception in the soil, which determines the composition of the plants and animals that man eats." "Hidden Hunger" is written in terms sufficiently common to be clearly understandable to the average woman, who is eager to maintain her family's health through supplying proper food, but at the same time it is comprehensive and detailed enough to be a sound text for the embryonic dietician. There is thorough discussion of the common faults of improper diets ranging from baby feeding to C-rations; there is a complete history of the evolution of feeding habits, tracing the early beginnings of man from the hunger stage to today's mechanized era, and there is the record of how man struggled to escape starvation, a struggle which still continues since man has only recently begun to learn to eat correct foods. A touch of the crusade is also evident, for the authors take the opportunity to attack food quackery, the war-time menu, and the illusions of well-feeding. In one portion of the book they declare: "In World War I, the emphasis was on the total supply of food, and the need for energy and protein. Particular stress was placed onthese foods for combat troops with less concern for civilians. Actually, the foods `left' for civilians provided more nutritious, diets than were used in the army. Today, however, the stress is on quality rather than quantity. Equal consideration is given to civilians and soldiers and the emphasis was shifted from calories alone to foods which provide calories and at the same time ample amounts of minerals, amino acids, and vitamins." In one sentence, the answer to the question, "What causes poor nutrition ?", is the reason why "Hidden Hunger" is a book for the many, not just for the few. The authors' reply to that question is : "Inability to purchase sufficient food, disease, ignorance, and indifference in selecting, preparing, and serving food, and unwillingness to accept and put good nutritional principles into practice." AUTHOR INTEREST: Dr. Icie G. Macy, Virginia A, has devoted the past quarter' of a century to investigating foods and their relation to health and human happiness and, there-fore, is eminently fitted to share in the writing of this particular book. Among other things she has served as secretary and president of the American Institute of Nutrition, is a member of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council, and for the past fourteen years has directed the Research Laboratory of the Children's Fund of Michigan. She is also author of "Nutrition and Chemical Growth in Childhood," a three-volume report of nutrition research with children, and was awarded the Norlin Achievement Medal in 1938 and the Borden Award in 1939. She was also a holder of the Pi Beta Phi Fellowship for Graduate Study. FLORENCE MARIE TAYLOR, articles, stories, and poetry in various magazines and newspapers.

OM PPHI PENS Edited by MARY ELIZABETH BARNETTE, Ohio A 11 F DR. ICIE G. MACY and DR. HAROLD H. WILLIAMS, Hidden Hunger, The Jacques Cattell Press, 320 pp. A Science Book Club selection for July, "Hidden Hunger," a book with the definitive sub-title, "Tragedy of the Unbalanced Diet," concerns a subject which should be meaningful to every American. It is written by two nutrition experts, not for other diet specialists, but for the general public regardless of age or income strata. Startling in that it reveals that America, though well fed, is poorly nourished, the book is constructive because besides deploring inadequate diets it indicates the ways in which the deficiencies can be corrected. For example, it points out: "Freedom from `obvious hunger' is accomplished through soil conservation, improved fertilizers and seeds, development of methods for control of blight and pests, more efficient machinery, and improvements in animal husbandry. . . Good nutrition has its inception in the soil, which determines the composition of the plants and animals that man eats." "Hidden Hunger" is written in terms sufficiently common to be clearly understandable to the average woman, who is eager to maintain her family's health through supplying proper food, but at the same time it is comprehensive and detailed enough to be a sound text for the embryonic dietician. There is thorough discussion of the common faults of improper diets ranging from baby feeding to C-rations; there is a complete history of the evolution of feeding habits, tracing the early beginnings of man from the hunger stage to today's mechanized era, and there is the record of how man struggled to escape starvation, a struggle which still continues since man has only recently begun to learn to eat correct foods. A touch of the crusade is also evident, for the authors take the opportunity to attack food quackery, the war-time menu, and the illusions of well-feeding. In one portion of the book they declare: "In World War I, the emphasis was on the total supply of food, and the need for energy and protein. Particular stress was placed onthese foods for combat troops with less concern for civilians. Actually, the foods `left' for civilians provided more nutritious, diets than were used in the army. Today, however, the stress is on quality rather than quantity.

Major Holt is typical of a generation of men, who, through individual courage and perseverance, succeeded in transforming a wilderness into a highly civilized nation within the span of a few decades. Growing up at a time when his family were struggling against a series of misfortunes which had reduced them to poverty, he early realized that whatever he was to possess he must gain for himself. He set out alone, braving danger and hardship, to seek his for-tune; yet he became no mere adventurer. While still a young man he began to assume all the responsibilities of a solid citizen. His periods of schooling were few and frequently inter-rupted; yet he undertook to teach a "select school" in Georgetown, Kentucky, and later studied law in a New York City office. His business successes were due to a combination of energy and shrewdness ; yet he seems always to have had a high regard for honor, and to have been just in all his dealings. Time after time, when his prospects seemed ruined by epidemics, cotton market crashes, "brass hat" favoritism and political trends, he remained undiscouraged and did not seek a life of ease until he had amply provided for his family. Not only does the Statement furnish material for historical research, but it offers a challenge to the men and women of this generation who may be toh easily dismayed by present-day obstacles to achievement. What a Fraternity Girl Thinks . . . From this day forward you cannot act alone. . ." These simple words in the pledging ceremony are dearer to a fraternity girl than all others she hears ever again. She knows then that at last she has found happiness a happiness which she does not realize then will grow to be a top joy in her whole life. Not until she has sat through her first rush discussion, seen her sisters in gaiety and sorrow, helped in some way to pull her fraternity over thin ice be it making a scholastic average, or making a pajama party a success does she realize that the happiness of Pi Beta Phi is not so much personal happiness as that top joy of "not acting alone." College life suddenly becomes a dream in reality, for all she does on campus is a part of her responsibility to her chapter. She joins organizations, cooperates with her instructors, lives and acts as an example to others not for any individual glory she will receive, but for that ever-hoped for additional praise that the Pi Beta Phis will receive. Fraternity life, she soon discovers, is not that taken-for-granted love of her family, but thelove of a group of girls who take her at her own valuation, who judge her for what she contributes to life, not for what she takes from it. Sometimes a fraternity girl does not realize this feeling of being part of a whole until her second or third year in the group. Often it takes a little jolt of some kind perhaps being away over the summer, or being faced with a new organizational responsibility which rests solely upon her but when she does discover in her heart the meaning of belonging to a fraternity, she suddenly sees that she has found that complete interlacing of ideals: the striving toward high living, toward unequaled character, and toward fine womanhood the unity of happiness which every Pi Beta Phi finds when she no longer acts alone. Her graceful golden arrow means more to her than just "one of the best fraternities in the land"; it signifies now what a fraternity girl thinks: "Through Pi Beta Pi l have learned what happiness is."

LITTLE PIGEON Edited by EUGENIA BROOKS SMITH, Indiana r A Province Vice-President Visits Settlement School Louise Wheelock Dobler, Washington B, Lambda Province Vice-President, took the long way home from Convention last summer and with her attractive young son, Bill, visited Gatlinburg for the day. It was a pleasure for "Committee" and the Settlement School staff to meet Louise and as she relives the experience of her visit we know it was a happy day for her. It is a beautiful summer day, and we almost pinch ourselves to be sure we aren't dreaming. Just a few more turns on that winding mountain road and we'll be there ! Where ? Why, the Pi Phi Settlement School, of course. "We left Knoxville on a crowded Smoky Mountain Trailways Bus in the cool of the morning, and now after nearly two hours over well-paved mountain roads, past modest farm houses and cabins, steep hillsides and fertile meadows rich with cotton, corn, "caters," and tobacco, we approach the smoky haze that tells us our goal is in sight. For as long as we've known about Pi Phi, we have known and loved "The school," and now our first glimpse finds us a bit awed and tremulous. "The bus takes us past the familiar land marks and we are a bit surprised, and proud, to find that the school is in the heart of Gatlin-burg, more truly it is Gatlinburg, and we see the enterprises of the town have nestled around her very skirts as though to be assured strength and protection. "After noting that the Arrowcraft shop looks just as it does in pictures (except the color of the native `brownstone' is lovelier `in person') we go inside and greet Ethel Snow amid displays of most of our favorites luncheon mats, scarfs, and handbags. We miss the familiar array of baskets and toasting forks, but are delighted with the sight of fireplace brooms, as we think of all our customers who want them this year. We take a peek in the stock room and find shelves gay with brightly colored woolens; and in the packing room, labels which will take packages to all corners of our land, are finding their way to well-done-up parcels. "Going out the back door of.the Arrowcraft Shop, we find ourselves in the midst of the school playground with the Arts and Crafts building to the right, the high school straightahead, and the grade school just west of that. But now the grounds are quiet, the grass is brown from summer sun, for this is vacation time and the children of the district are buSy with home chores. We are curious to look into the Craft Building and find it fascinatingly alive with adults doing all sorts of things with Wood and metal. They are the summer work-shop people who have learned how much' fun it for families to play and work together. In the high school building we find still others experimenting with colors and cloths in making lovely draperies and linens. Our inspection of that building reveals an all-purpose combination gymnasium and auditorium, a small, but well-equipped domestic science room; and signs over some of the doors to let us know that the elementary school enrollment has outgrown its modest building, and the seventh and eighth grades have had to find space in the bigger one. We see signs of needed paint and repair that will come as soon as the summer school is out. "Over in the teachers' cottage, which nestles in the shade of lovely trees, we find Miss Ruth Dyer, the genial director of the school, and all of the Settlement School Committee enjoying a before-luncheon respite on the screened-in porch. Luncheon is delicious and enjoyable, and affords an opportunity to show off the productiveness of the school garden; for we feast on fresh cob corn, shell beans, sweet potatoes, and okra, just to mention a few of the good things. "Despite the heat we resume our tour early after lunch because this is our ONE day here at the school, and we must see it all. We walk past the barn, through the pasture, and come to a plain little frame cottage that serves as the health center and the home of our be-loved nurse, Marjorie Chalmers. We look past the worn and sagging floors, the small but scrupulously clean dispensary, and 'picture the new building that is an assured promise to rise in memory of our own Jennie Nicol. And as we ride over the countryside to help Marjorie post notices of forthcoming health clinics, we realize in part the role we have played as privileged and educated women in 285 This Lovely Picture of A.rrowucraft Shop Was Made Recently by Mr. Allen R. Rankin, Husband of Edith Hoyer Rankin, Beta Province Vice-President. giving joy and blessing to `some of the least of these.' "As the shadows lengthened and we made our way back down the winding road, we thought of the great future possibilities and opportunities that are ours in the Smokies. Our school as it stands today is a monument to those who have had faith in its need and mission. Our school as it continues in the future will reflect the cherished esteem we hold for our Founders by the loyalty and support we give it. The need is there, the time is now, and as the Smokies slid from sight, we were truly grateful for our good fortune to know first hand the thing that brings so much joy and pride to all Pi Phis." 1946 Commencement Activities Eighteen graduating Seniors all members of the class of 1946 of the Pi Beta Phi High School, now look back upon the thrills and excitement of their Commencement as the great-est days in their lives. There was the Senior Class Play, the memorable trip to Atlanta, the Baccalaureate Service, Class Night, and finally the Commencement Exercises. Graduation activities actually began with the Senior Class play on April 19th, 1946. Ten members of the class proved their dramatic ability in the three act comedy drama, "He Couldn't Marry Five." They did a commendable piece of work under the able direction of Mrs. Lighter, one of our English teachers and High School Librarian. The new cyclorama and curtains add so much dignity and color to all the varied events of the school year and provide more incentive to strive for perfection. There are no more curious, smiling faces "peeking" through the holes in the makeshift curtains to see if admiring family and friends have arrived to see their exhibition of skill as actors. For weeks it seemed that in spite of all the work to be done May 14th would never roll around. Note books, final tests, and classes all THE DECEMBER ARROW 287 helped to pass the time until that "special day" when the entire class "took off ." for Atlanta, under the supervision of Mrs. Lighter, Senior Class sponsor and Miss Elizabeth Petrie, Arts and Crafts teacher. The Seniors had worked and saved for a period of weeks in order to have enough money to pay for the chartered bus and their lodgings while away. The trip south was broken to give ample time to see the beauty spots which spring had brought to the mountains. In Atlanta, the class members were especially impressed by the colorful cyclorama of the Battle of Atlanta which was on exhibit in Grant Park. The murals were arranged in a circle to give a vivid story of the dramatic incidents in the battle. The Seniors were also greatly interested in the carved image of General Robert E. Lee eternally engraved on the slope of Stone Mountain. Back home from this exciting trip, the class members scarcely had time to get ready for the inspiring Baccalaureate Service which was held at the Baptist Church on Sunday evening, May 19th. Promptly at eight o'clock, the class marched into the crowded church to the strains of the Processional, "0 Zion Haste." The sermon to the class was given by the Reverend J. C. Chapman of Sevierville. On the following Wednesday night the annual Junior-Senior Banquet was held at the New Gatlinburg Inn to give the members of the Junior Class just a slight indication of the thrills ahead when they would be Seniors. This was a formal affair even down to a floor show given by some of the students. Class Night brought the members of the class to the realization that high school days would soon be over. The girls who greatly out-numbered the boys in the class of '46, were attractive in their long, formal dresses. From the "Welcoming Address" by Sara Frances Mize, the program unfolded to reveal the "Class Prophecy," the "History," and the "Class Will." A serious and dignified group of Seniors stood at the close of the evening to sing "Farewell to Thee." At last the day of days arrived. At eight o'clock in the evening of May 24th, the Seniors, splendid in their caps and gowns, marched into the High School Auditorium, with the eyes of all the community upon them. The Commencement address was delivered by Mr. Victor Davis, Director of Personnel at the University of Tennessee. Jack Hoover Jenkins, with a four year average of 96.6 gave the Valedictory, and Dorothy Jeanette Maples was Salutatorian with an average of 93.25. Each Senior in turn walked across the stage to receive his diplomaat the hands of School Superintendent, Mr. Theron H. Hodges. Awards were presented for outstanding accomplishments. Then, as the piano played the Recessional, "Crown Him With Many Crowns," another class of graduates marched out of the Pi Beta Phi School to meet the responsibilities of life. Grammar School Operetta The following account was taken from the Gatlinburg weekly newspaper. As part of the High School English assignments, Mrs. Lighter has her students write articles for the paper. The Operetta was reported by Barbara Huff and Dorothy Miller. :On April 19th, in the high school auditorium, the grammar school of Pi Beta Phi gave an operetta called `The Rose Dream.' Gaily costumed children from all of the grades participated in the play. "The operetta was about a little girl, Patsy King, who fell asleep in the woods and had a dream. In the dream were Virginia Davenport, the fairy queen, Carl Wade, Hop-0-My-Thumb, and the fairies, roses and elves from all the grades. The stage was gaily decorated as a rose garden. Choruses from all the grades participated. "The operetta was under the direction of Mrs. Stanley Armstrong, public school music teacher." Mrs. Armstrong and the teachers spent unlimited time and effort on the production with wonderful results. The costumes were clever, the acting good, and the singing especially fine. The rosebuds wore crepe paper dresses with green tops and pink, yellow or white petal skirts. The boys were dressed as elves with orange paper caps and the fairies' costumes were made of white tobacco netting and trimmed with silver stars. Tarltan could not be supplied and the Home Economic girls made the substitute by starching the tobacco netting very stiffly. The scenery and throne for the operetta were built by Mr. Huskey's woodworking classes. Summer School and Workshop at Gatlinburg This past summer, for the second consecutive year, Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee offered a craftmanship school at Gatlinburg. Here in the heart of the Smoky Mountains, students came to learn, create, play, and enjoy the beauties of nature.
