        Pi L?eta Ph,i Settlement School CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS, ARROWMONT SCHOOL OF ARTS AND CRAFTS The annual meeting of the Board of Governors of Arowmont was held October 26 through 29, 1972, at Gatlinurg, Tenn., at which time the present chairman was in-tailed in office. This report will cover the period from that ate through May, 1973. While the Gatlinburg community is expanding in great roportions, Pi Beta Phi continues to hold its respected paition and recognition for its high ideals as expressed hrough Arrowmont and Arrowcraft and their outstanding taffs. In September, 1972, Arrowcraft weavers produced the argest order of whig rose placemats in its history. One housand were ordered for the dining room of the new /farriott Hotel in Minneapolis. Arrowcraft has enjoyed a ood year financially which, in turn, means added support or Arrowmont. During the 1972 Summer Craft School, 821 students vere enrolled representing 37 states and 5 foreign counries. The 1973 session will include 3 two-week courses .nd 4 one-week courses under the direction of Marian -leard, Director. Woodworking will be offered as a new ourse this year as well as a course in kiln building. The .eramic studio will have a new pugmill, the gift of the Wichita Club, and a new pottery wheel, gift of the Indi-1napolis Club, along with a special throwing head pur-:hased by the Cincinnati Club. The loom house will be air-:onditioned. Additional workshops again have been conlucted by Marian Heard. It is anticipated that more of hem will be added to the program in the future. Dona.-:ions, in lieu of scholarships, have been emphasized this Tear due to the ever increasing demand for places by reguar students and the needed funds to help defray high costs )f operating expenses. Marian Heard, Director, continues to be honored in her field having been made a Life Member by the Tennessee Artist Craftsmen Association and being invited by the Na-:ional Park Service to attend their meeting in Florida as dvisor for their craft program. Caroline Mills Riddle joined the staff of Arrowmont as of March 16, 1973. She will assist Helen Lewis, present Administrator, until September 1, 1973, at which time she will becomeAdministrator. Helen Lewis, who has done 3uch outstanding work in that position, will retire at that time. A full article about the new administrator will appear in the winter ARROW. Members of the Board busily pursued their particular work areas during the year. The program for Arrowmont night at Convention, June 25th, is an address by Wilma Dykeman, author and journalist for the Knoxville News ADMINISTRATOR, PI BETA The past year was a full and busy one at the Arrowmont chool and the Arrowcraft Shop. At the end of, the summer eason, 1972, there were the usual reports and pulling to-ether of all phases of the operation here during those months. The fall season was a busy one again with the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild Fair the highlight of that period. We used all our housing facilities to take care of exhibitors, workers, and visitors. The annual meeting of the Board of Governors was held in October, and at that time three new members were welcomed Mary Helen Holliday, Melinda Mahone, and Sentinel. Multi-media slides from Arrowmont for use in connection with workshops, along with a display of Arrowmont work, also will be offered. The Arrowcraft shop will be under the direction of Helen Lewis. The Emma Harper Turner Building, also known as the Arrowmont Building, brought great honor to its designer, Community Tectonics, as it was awarded an Award of Merit by the AIA and American Association of School Administrators. The model will be displayed at Convention so many Pi Phis may further appreciate their famous building. Lists of Arrowmont students and staff attending the 1973 Summer Craft School will again be divided into provinces and sent to each APP for distribution to clubs. Pro-gram chairmen are urged to contact those nearest them to speak to their clubs about Arrowmont, thus helping to educate Pi Phis about their school. In some instances, club sup-port of local projects has become quite competitive with the national philanthropy due to the difficulty of relating its full meaning so many miles from its source. Arrowmont contributions are up this year. They form a great source of income for the operation of the school. Contributions from the Pi Phi owners of the Kansas State Travel Agency continue and will increase with more Pi Phis using their prompt service. Arrowmont is benefited by the magazine agency, so please remember when subscriptions are due. Pi Phis are encouraged to make In Memoriam gifts honoring deceased Pi Phis and members of their families. The Board of Governors wishes to take this opportunity to thank all Pi Phis for their interest and continued support of Arrowmont. An interim visit to Gatlinburg in March was a busy one, but there was a little time to visit with the Arrowcraft staff who are among the world's most devoted employees. Community Tectonics, the architectural firm who designed the Arrowmont building, is interested in expanding a building leased from the 'Fraternity by their firm. Final decision is contingent upon lease arrangements. It is hoped that during the coming year, each Pi Phi, active and alumnae, will gain more knowledge about her outstanding school of crafts which she, as a Pi Phi, is part owner. With this pride and understanding "Make Arrowmont Your Favorite Philanthropy" will become not merely a slogan but an act. The Chairman wishes to express her gratitude to the members of the Board of Governors, the Grand Council, Central Office, and the staff of Arrowmont and Arrowcraft for their assistance on her behalf during the past months of service in this office. HELEN DEPPE VOLLMAR PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Helen Vollmar, who assumed the duties as chairman succeeding Betty Hall. Also, the position of Administrator was offered to Caroline Mills Riddle, Florida Beta, from Orlando, Florida, and we were very pleased that she accepted. The Red Barn was a popular place as usual for week end retreats or work sessions. There were eighteen bookings and we were happy to have South Carolina Alpha, Tennessee Alpha and Gamma, and Alabama Alpha with us. Several dates have been reserved for the Fair this fall and for other times during the coming year. Arrowcraft had a very good year and we appreciate the fine cooperation of our clubs and chapters. There were 252 32 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 33 clubs and 39 chapters selling Arrowcraft merchandise this past year for a total purchase figure of $201,146.30. This is an increase over the previous year in total sales as well as in the number of clubs and chapters placing orders. As a result of this increase, we were able to transfer some funds from Arrowcraft to Arrowmont School. Our sales in the shop have been very good also. We have a fine group of girls working for us in the shop and they are a credit to Pi Phi. They continue to work extremely well in spite of the crowded conditions under which. they have to work. Arrowmont School of Crafts continues to attract students from all over the country, from all walks of life, and all age groups. The instructors are outstanding craftsmen and teachers, and we have many who return year after year to teach. The same may be said for our students, for many of them are "repeaters" of one or more years. Our instructor from abroad this year is Liv Gjelsvik from Norway who is to teach advanced weaving. We are looking forward to an outstanding summer workshop program under the direction of Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont School, and Sandra Blain, the Assistant Director. This year, for the first time, Arrowmont was the recipient of a scholarship to be given to one of our students. The Rotary Club of Gatlinburg gave a $200 scholarship and that was awarded to Sister Consolata Agyapong of Ghana. Our pre-school registration is such that we anticipate an-other increase in the number of students over the previous three years. We are gratified that so much interest is shown in the school and that it has such a fine reputation across the country, but each year we must turn some students away for lack of housing. After providing beds for staff, instructors and graduate assistants, we have only 80 beds left for students. This is less than half the number we had enrolled for a two week session and a one week session this summer. Arrowmont and the University of Tennessee joined forces and had a beautiful exhibit at the Craftsmen's Fair in October. Arrowcraft had some merchandise for sale in the Central Booth. Both Arrowmont and Arrowcraft partic-ipate in the Fair which is held in Asheville, N.C., during the summer. The Arrowmont auditorium was rented out to the Gatlinburg Christian Science Church for a lecture one Sunday afternoon in March. In April we put on a workshop for Art in Home Economics, co-sponsored by the College of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. Once again, we housed and fed the leaders of the annual Wild Flower Pilgrimage, held the last week end in April. The first week end in May, the Little Pigeon Alumnae Club sponsored a Founders' Day Luncheon at the Staff House. There were about 100 Pi Phis present to help, celebrate the 25th anniversary of Tennessee Gamma chapter. In March, Caroline Riddle arrived to start a period of training for the position as Administrator. She will assume full responsibility on September 1, 1973. The two of us attended the annual meeting of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild, which was held in April at Fontana Village, N.C. We have had our usual pleasant contacts with the elementary school which is still known officially as the Pi Beta Phi School. Lunch at the school one day was enjoyed along with other invited guests. Early in December we gave each classroom one of the colored glass candy canes to hang in the window along with the little angel which was given last year. Caroline and I attended the science fair which was held in May and was open to the public. Since Arrowmont does not own enough typewriters to see us through the summer, we always borrow two or three from the school. Yes, it has been a full and busy year, but an interesting one. It has meant more than words can express, to have been a part of this outstanding Pi Beta Phi project. We wish for Caroline Riddle, the very best, and feel confident that the Pi Phi operation here in Gatlinburg will continue to make progress under her direction. Sincere thanks and grateful appreciation to all those who have made this a most rewarding experience.

AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE May 31, 1973 and 1972 ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Gatlinburg, Tennessee We have examined the financial statements of the following funds of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School (a division of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity) for the years ended May 31, 1973 and 1972: Current Fund Endowment Funds Invested in Plant Special Funds Our examinations were made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. In our opinion, subject to the outcome of the income tax matter referred to in Note D, the accompanying statements of financial condition and statements of revenues and expenditures and changes in fund balances pre-sent fairly the financial position of the funds (as described above) of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at May 31, 1973 and 1972, and the results of their operations and changes in fund balances for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. 4'...41.44r+Ct' Little Rock, Arkansas August 2, 1973 NOTE A Significant Accounting Policies The accounts of the Settlement School are maintained on a fund basis of accounting appropriate to non-profit organizations. The current funds are used to account for transactions related to the instructional programs of the School and the auxiliary activities which provide services to the students, faculty and public. The Endowment Funds are used to account for gifts which allow only the income thereon to be expended. The Invested In Plant Fund contains the transactions relating to investment in property and equipment. The format of the financial statements displaying these funds is presented in a manner which is appropriate for colleges and universities. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for colleges and universities, no provision has been made for depreciation of buildings and equipment. Certain expenses paid from other funds of Pi Beta Phi are allocable to Settlement School and are included as income and expenses in these financial statements. NOTE B Due to Pi Beta Phi Grand Treasurer Advances to Settlement School were made as a loan for the purpose of paying a portion of the construction costs of a classroom building to be known as Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. The loan is with interest at 5% beginning July 17, 1970, the date of completion, and the interest is due annually. There is no stated due date for the loan principal. At May 31, 1972, the advances due to the Grand Treasurer were transferred from the Land Sale Fund to the General Fund and the Land Sale Fund was closed. NOTE C Meals and Room Rents Paid Certain amounts in 1972 have been reclassified to facilitate comparability and increase meaningfulness of the statement. Items previously reported were: meals paid $32 ,081; room rents paid $27, 650. NOTE D Contiiigent Liability Subsequent to May 31, 1973, the Settlement School received a notice of income tax deficiencies from the Internal Revenue Service for years ended May 31, 1961 through May 31, 1968, which amounted to approximately $60,000, including penalties. The Internal Revenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop income is not related to the tax exempt purpose of Settlement School and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree with this position and plans to pursue the matter in court. The outcome cannot be deter-mined at this time and no provision has been made for any liability in connection with this matter. Standing Co'tteeJ CANADIAN PHILANTHROPIES COMMITTEE The donation of $1000' for "Arrow in the Arctic" went last summer to the Yukon Library Services. They are setting up an Indian Resource Centre, and seeking approval from the government to include the Centre as a branch library. The gift enabled them immediately to supply books, pamphlets, and periodicals to this Resource Centre. An addition has been made to the Library in Whitehorse, and a children's librarian has been added to the staff. The videorecorder purchased by the NorthWest Territories Library Services with our previous donation of $1000 has proved extremely valuable in taping films of Eskimo storytellers, to show in various communities. It is hoped to foster an interchange of information and cultural material. Library Service has been extended to Igloolik and Pangnirtung in the Eastern Arctic, and the local librarians are Esk-imo girls. The loan fund for students in social work was increase( from $150 to $300 maximum on a trial basis two year ago. It has been used to a greater extent, and the record o repayment has improved. It still seems to serve a usefu purpose, and is appreciated by recipients and the schools o social work alike. Your continued loyal support for the Canadian Philan thropies is requested and appreciated. Your support o Northern Libraries is accomplished by continued giving b. loyal Pi Phis. It has been a privilege to serve as Chairman for thre years. It is a pleasure to report that Carol McGonigal o Winnipeg Manitoba will be chairman for the next term. PATRICIA FOSTER WEIR THE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Twenty-seven years ago Pi Beta Phi launched a new project, a project that was to become a wonderful adventure in friendship and compassion. At the Swampscott Convention in 1946 it was voted to appropriate fifty thousand dollars from Fraternity funds to establish the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds, a project with a dual purpose. The principal was to be used for loans to chapters for building or remodelling purposes; the interest paid by the chapters on these loans was to be used for gifts to alumnae who through tragic circumstances may be in need of special assistance. This is the only Fraternity project designed to help alumnae members. Over the years the 'Fund has been augumented by donations from clubs, chapters, and individual Pi Phis. An increasing number of clubs and members send special gifts to the Fund, honoring the memory of a Pi Phi friend who has passed away. The Emma 'Harper Turner Committee, composed of three alumnae appointed by the Grand Council, is not concerned in any way with chapter house loans and it handles no money. Its sole function is to process grants given to alumnae who are in need of the special assistance this fund can provide. The funds are not large enough and were not designed to provide continuing sustenance expense, nor can we underwrite the costs for extended hospital or medical expenses. Rather, we offer "gifts of love" for emergency needs or provide small monthly checks which have meant some little independence for alumnae with limited means, usually in the years when every cent of slender, total in-come is scarcely adequate to cover the bare necessities of life. The EHT Fund aids alumnae in two categories: (1) young alumni who have suffered major and often tragic emergencies and who are not covered by pensions, Social Security, Medicare, etc, and (2) older alumnae who often have adequate income to cover the bare minimum of living expenses, but nothing for extras or the small amenities which bring cheer and comfort to sad and lonely lives. Over the years this fund has provided a great variety of comfort and services to some of our less fortunate members: a wheel chair for an arthritic; a special orthopedic mattress for one who was bedridden; the services of a visiting nurse for one who was blind and almost helpless; an intercom system for the home of a young polio mother. The money has been used to pay for cortisone and other necessary but expensive medicines; to have neglected dental work done; for new eye glasses; for "Talking Books;" for taking a taxi instead of riding three buses to the doctor's office; and in countless ways which have brought cheer and comfort to lonely hearts. These are the tangibles and theycan be counted. The boost in morale of the recipients o these gifts cannot be measured because it is incalculable The knowledge that Pi Phi still cares about them, is intel ested in them and wants to help them bear their heavy bul dens, the lift to the heart and the spirit, has usually mean as much as the badly needed financial assistance. Happily, in July 1972, due principally to the generou support of this project by the alumnae clubs, Grand Counci was able to raise the maximum amount of the monthl gifts from twenty-five to fifty dollars. The maximur amount for emergency gifts, usually given only once, wa raised to five hundred dollars. Monthly gifts currentl range from ten to fifty dollars. One Golden Arrow who ha been a member for silty-eight years and who is almo! blind wrote a little thank you note when she learned of th increase in her monthly gift: "For one who has no incom at all, fifty dollars is indeed a gift !" Eight alumnae have received gifts from this fund durin the past year, all monthly grants except one. One nel emergency grant was approved. It is of great concern to th Grand Council and to the EHT committee that there ha been only one new request for help during the biennium. would be comforting to believe that there are only eigI alumna needing the service which this project can provid( but with our large membership that is highly improbable The committee has no way of locating Pi Phis who migf need these gifts; it is necessary to depend entirely upon th members of the alumna clubs to furnish the information. : is the responsibility of every alumna to be alert to possibi need for help and to get in touch with the EHT chairma for details about procedures. Every recipient of these gif, must have three Pi Beta Phi sponsors. These gifts are a ways given in confidence.

AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE May 31, 1973 and 1972 ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Gatlinburg, Tennessee We have examined the financial statements of the following funds of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School (a division of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity) for the years ended May 31, 1973 and 1972: Current Fund Endowment Funds Invested in Plant Special Funds Our examinations were made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. In our opinion, subject to the outcome of the income tax matter referred to in Note D, the accompanying statements of financial condition and statements of revenues and expenditures and changes in fund balances pre-sent fairly the financial position of the funds (as described above) of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at May 31, 1973 and 1972, and the results of their operations and changes in fund balances for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. 4'...41.44r+Ct' Little Rock, Arkansas August 2, 1973 NOTE A Significant Accounting Policies The accounts of the Settlement School are maintained on a fund basis of accounting appropriate to non-profit organizations. The current funds are used to account for transactions related to the instructional programs of the School and the auxiliary activities which provide services to the students, faculty and public. The Endowment Funds are used to account for gifts which allow only the income thereon to be expended. The Invested In Plant Fund contains the transactions relating to investment in property and equipment. The format of the financial statements displaying these funds is presented in a manner which is appropriate for colleges and universities. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for colleges and universities, no provision has been made for depreciation of buildings and equipment. Certain expenses paid from other funds of Pi Beta Phi are allocable to Settlement School and are included as income and expenses in these financial statements. NOTE B Due to Pi Beta Phi Grand Treasurer Advances to Settlement School were made as a loan for the purpose of paying a portion of the construction costs of a classroom building to be known as Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. The loan is with interest at 5% beginning July 17, 1970, the date of completion, and the interest is due annually. There is no stated due date for the loan principal. At May 31, 1972, the advances due to the Grand Treasurer were transferred from the Land Sale Fund to the General Fund and the Land Sale Fund was closed. NOTE C Meals and Room Rents Paid Certain amounts in 1972 have been reclassified to facilitate comparability and increase meaningfulness of the statement. Items previously reported were: meals paid $32 ,081; room rents paid $27, 650. NOTE D Contiiigent Liability Subsequent to May 31, 1973, the Settlement School received a notice of income tax deficiencies from the Internal Revenue Service for years ended May 31, 1961 through May 31, 1968, which amounted to approximately $60,000, including penalties. The Internal Revenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop income is not related to the tax exempt purpose of Settlement School and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree with this position and plans to pursue the matter in court. The outcome cannot be deter-mined at this time and no provision has been made for any liability in connection with this matter. Standing Co'tteeJ CANADIAN PHILANTHROPIES COMMITTEE The donation of $1000' for "Arrow in the Arctic" went last summer to the Yukon Library Services. They are setting up an Indian Resource Centre, and seeking approval from the government to include the Centre as a branch library. The gift enabled them immediately to supply books, pamphlets, and periodicals to this Resource Centre. An addition has been made to the Library in Whitehorse, and a children's librarian has been added to the staff. The videorecorder purchased by the NorthWest Territories Library Services with our previous donation of $1000 has proved extremely valuable in taping films of Eskimo storytellers, to show in various communities. It is hoped to foster an interchange of information and cultural material. Library Service has been extended to Igloolik and Pangnirtung in the Eastern Arctic, and the local librarians are Esk-imo girls. The loan fund for students in social work was increase( from $150 to $300 maximum on a trial basis two year ago. It has been used to a greater extent, and the record o repayment has improved. It still seems to serve a usefu purpose, and is appreciated by recipients and the schools o social work alike. Your continued loyal support for the Canadian Philan thropies is requested and appreciated. Your support o Northern Libraries is accomplished by continued giving b. loyal Pi Phis. It has been a privilege to serve as Chairman for thre years. It is a pleasure to report that Carol McGonigal o Winnipeg Manitoba will be chairman for the next term. PATRICIA FOSTER WEIR THE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Twenty-seven years ago Pi Beta Phi launched a new project, a project that was to become a wonderful adventure in friendship and compassion. At the Swampscott Convention in 1946 it was voted to appropriate fifty thousand dollars from Fraternity funds to establish the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds, a project with a dual purpose. The principal was to be used for loans to chapters for building or remodelling purposes; the interest paid by the chapters on these loans was to be used for gifts to alumnae who through tragic circumstances may be in need of special assistance. This is the only Fraternity project designed to help alumnae members. Over the years the 'Fund has been augumented by donations from clubs, chapters, and individual Pi Phis. An increasing number of clubs and members send special gifts to the Fund, honoring the memory of a Pi Phi friend who has passed away. The Emma 'Harper Turner Committee, composed of three alumnae appointed by the Grand Council, is not concerned in any way with chapter house loans and it handles no money. Its sole function is to process grants given to alumnae who are in need of the special assistance this fund can provide. The funds are not large enough and were not designed to provide continuing sustenance expense, nor can we underwrite the costs for extended hospital or medical expenses. Rather, we offer "gifts of love" for emergency needs or provide small monthly checks which have meant some little independence for alumnae with limited means, usually in the years when every cent of slender, total in-come is scarcely adequate to cover the bare necessities of life. The EHT Fund aids alumnae in two categories: (1) young alumni who have suffered major and often tragic emergencies and who are not covered by pensions, Social Security, Medicare, etc, and (2) older alumnae who often have adequate income to cover the bare minimum of living expenses, but nothing for extras or the small amenities which bring cheer and comfort to sad and lonely lives. Over the years this fund has provided a great variety of comfort and services to some of our less fortunate members: a wheel chair for an arthritic; a special orthopedic mattress for one who was bedridden; the services of a visiting nurse for one who was blind and almost helpless; an intercom system for the home of a young polio mother. The money has been used to pay for cortisone and other necessary but expensive medicines; to have neglected dental work done; for new eye glasses; for "Talking Books;" for taking a taxi instead of riding three buses to the doctor's office; and in countless ways which have brought cheer and comfort to lonely hearts. These are the tangibles and theycan be counted.

They are setting up an Indian Resource Centre, and seeking approval from the government to include the Centre as a branch library. The gift enabled them immediately to supply books, pamphlets, and periodicals to this Resource Centre. An addition has been made to the Library in Whitehorse, and a children's librarian has been added to the staff. The videorecorder purchased by the NorthWest Territories Library Services with our previous donation of $1000 has proved extremely valuable in taping films of Eskimo storytellers, to show in various communities. It is hoped to foster an interchange of information and cultural material. Library Service has been extended to Igloolik and Pangnirtung in the Eastern Arctic, and the local librarians are Esk-imo girls. The loan fund for students in social work was increase( from $150 to $300 maximum on a trial basis two year ago. It has been used to a greater extent, and the record o repayment has improved. It still seems to serve a usefu purpose, and is appreciated by recipients and the schools o social work alike. Your continued loyal support for the Canadian Philan thropies is requested and appreciated. Your support o Northern Libraries is accomplished by continued giving b. loyal Pi Phis. It has been a privilege to serve as Chairman for thre years. It is a pleasure to report that Carol McGonigal o Winnipeg Manitoba will be chairman for the next term. PATRICIA FOSTER WEIR THE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Twenty-seven years ago Pi Beta Phi launched a new project, a project that was to become a wonderful adventure in friendship and compassion. At the Swampscott Convention in 1946 it was voted to appropriate fifty thousand dollars from Fraternity funds to establish the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds, a project with a dual purpose. The principal was to be used for loans to chapters for building or remodelling purposes; the interest paid by the chapters on these loans was to be used for gifts to alumnae who through tragic circumstances may be in need of special assistance. This is the only Fraternity project designed to help alumnae members. Over the years the 'Fund has been augumented by donations from clubs, chapters, and individual Pi Phis. An increasing number of clubs and members send special gifts to the Fund, honoring the memory of a Pi Phi friend who has passed away. The Emma 'Harper Turner Committee, composed of three alumnae appointed by the Grand Council, is not concerned in any way with chapter house loans and it handles no money. Its sole function is to process grants given to alumnae who are in need of the special assistance this fund can provide. The funds are not large enough and were not designed to provide continuing sustenance expense, nor can we underwrite the costs for extended hospital or medical expenses. Rather, we offer "gifts of love" for emergency needs or provide small monthly checks which have meant some little independence for alumnae with limited means, usually in the years when every cent of slender, total in-come is scarcely adequate to cover the bare necessities of life. The EHT Fund aids alumnae in two categories: (1) young alumni who have suffered major and often tragic emergencies and who are not covered by pensions, Social Security, Medicare, etc, and (2) older alumnae who often have adequate income to cover the bare minimum of living expenses, but nothing for extras or the small amenities which bring cheer and comfort to sad and lonely lives. Over the years this fund has provided a great variety of comfort and services to some of our less fortunate members: a wheel chair for an arthritic; a special orthopedic mattress for one who was bedridden; the services of a visiting nurse for one who was blind and almost helpless; an intercom system for the home of a young polio mother. The money has been used to pay for cortisone and other necessary but expensive medicines; to have neglected dental work done; for new eye glasses; for "Talking Books;" for taking a taxi instead of riding three buses to the doctor's office; and in countless ways which have brought cheer and comfort to lonely hearts. These are the tangibles and theycan be counted. The boost in morale of the recipients o these gifts cannot be measured because it is incalculable The knowledge that Pi Phi still cares about them, is intel ested in them and wants to help them bear their heavy bul dens, the lift to the heart and the spirit, has usually mean as much as the badly needed financial assistance. Happily, in July 1972, due principally to the generou support of this project by the alumnae clubs, Grand Counci was able to raise the maximum amount of the monthl gifts from twenty-five to fifty dollars. The maximur amount for emergency gifts, usually given only once, wa raised to five hundred dollars. Monthly gifts currentl range from ten to fifty dollars. One Golden Arrow who ha been a member for silty-eight years and who is almo! blind wrote a little thank you note when she learned of th increase in her monthly gift: "For one who has no incom at all, fifty dollars is indeed a gift !" Eight alumnae have received gifts from this fund durin the past year, all monthly grants except one. One nel emergency grant was approved. It is of great concern to th Grand Council and to the EHT committee that there ha been only one new request for help during the biennium. would be comforting to believe that there are only eigI alumna needing the service which this project can provid( but with our large membership that is highly improbable The committee has no way of locating Pi Phis who migf need these gifts; it is necessary to depend entirely upon th members of the alumna clubs to furnish the information. : is the responsibility of every alumna to be alert to possibi need for help and to get in touch with the EHT chairma for details about procedures. Every recipient of these gif, must have three Pi Beta Phi sponsors. These gifts are a ways given in confidence. The names of the recipients al known only to the few Pi Phis involved in processing th grant, unless the recipient herself wishes to tell of her gif Alumnae who have sponsored and been instrumental in of taming help for a Pi Phi friend who has suffered grey misfortune are invariably moved by this tangible evident of the Fraternity's deep concern and interest in its less fo tunate 'members. Sincere appreciation is felt for the ever present help an guidance of Sally Hunt, who serves as ex-officio member ( the committee. The help and cooperation of Orpha Coenei Sally Schulenburg, and the two members of the committe Ninabelle Dame and Mary Frances Pirkey, have been Brat fying. It has been an inspiration to work for this small bl beautiful Fraternity project. RUTH WILLIAMS HANSEN 37 Pi L?eta Ph,i Settlement School CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS, ARROWMONT SCHOOL OF ARTS AND CRAFTS The annual meeting of the Board of Governors of Arowmont was held October 26 through 29, 1972, at Gatlinurg, Tenn., at which time the present chairman was in-tailed in office. This report will cover the period from that ate through May, 1973. While the Gatlinburg community is expanding in great roportions, Pi Beta Phi continues to hold its respected paition and recognition for its high ideals as expressed hrough Arrowmont and Arrowcraft and their outstanding taffs. In September, 1972, Arrowcraft weavers produced the argest order of whig rose placemats in its history. One housand were ordered for the dining room of the new /farriott Hotel in Minneapolis. Arrowcraft has enjoyed a ood year financially which, in turn, means added support or Arrowmont. During the 1972 Summer Craft School, 821 students vere enrolled representing 37 states and 5 foreign counries. The 1973 session will include 3 two-week courses .nd 4 one-week courses under the direction of Marian -leard, Director. Woodworking will be offered as a new ourse this year as well as a course in kiln building. The .eramic studio will have a new pugmill, the gift of the Wichita Club, and a new pottery wheel, gift of the Indi-1napolis Club, along with a special throwing head pur-:hased by the Cincinnati Club. The loom house will be air-:onditioned. Additional workshops again have been conlucted by Marian Heard. It is anticipated that more of hem will be added to the program in the future. Dona.-:ions, in lieu of scholarships, have been emphasized this Tear due to the ever increasing demand for places by reguar students and the needed funds to help defray high costs )f operating expenses. Marian Heard, Director, continues to be honored in her field having been made a Life Member by the Tennessee Artist Craftsmen Association and being invited by the Na-:ional Park Service to attend their meeting in Florida as dvisor for their craft program. Caroline Mills Riddle joined the staff of Arrowmont as of March 16, 1973. She will assist Helen Lewis, present Administrator, until September 1, 1973, at which time she will becomeAdministrator. Helen Lewis, who has done 3uch outstanding work in that position, will retire at that time. A full article about the new administrator will appear in the winter ARROW. Members of the Board busily pursued their particular work areas during the year. The program for Arrowmont night at Convention, June 25th, is an address by Wilma Dykeman, author and journalist for the Knoxville News ADMINISTRATOR, PI BETA The past year was a full and busy one at the Arrowmont chool and the Arrowcraft Shop. At the end of, the summer eason, 1972, there were the usual reports and pulling to-ether of all phases of the operation here during those months. The fall season was a busy one again with the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild Fair the highlight of that period. We used all our housing facilities to take care of exhibitors, workers, and visitors. The annual meeting of the Board of Governors was held in October, and at that time three new members were welcomed Mary Helen Holliday, Melinda Mahone, and Sentinel. Multi-media slides from Arrowmont for use in connection with workshops, along with a display of Arrowmont work, also will be offered. The Arrowcraft shop will be under the direction of Helen Lewis. The Emma Harper Turner Building, also known as the Arrowmont Building, brought great honor to its designer, Community Tectonics, as it was awarded an Award of Merit by the AIA and American Association of School Administrators. The model will be displayed at Convention so many Pi Phis may further appreciate their famous building. Lists of Arrowmont students and staff attending the 1973 Summer Craft School will again be divided into provinces and sent to each APP for distribution to clubs. Pro-gram chairmen are urged to contact those nearest them to speak to their clubs about Arrowmont, thus helping to educate Pi Phis about their school. In some instances, club sup-port of local projects has become quite competitive with the national philanthropy due to the difficulty of relating its full meaning so many miles from its source. Arrowmont contributions are up this year. They form a great source of income for the operation of the school. Contributions from the Pi Phi owners of the Kansas State Travel Agency continue and will increase with more Pi Phis using their prompt service. Arrowmont is benefited by the magazine agency, so please remember when subscriptions are due. Pi Phis are encouraged to make In Memoriam gifts honoring deceased Pi Phis and members of their families. The Board of Governors wishes to take this opportunity to thank all Pi Phis for their interest and continued support of Arrowmont. An interim visit to Gatlinburg in March was a busy one, but there was a little time to visit with the Arrowcraft staff who are among the world's most devoted employees. Community Tectonics, the architectural firm who designed the Arrowmont building, is interested in expanding a building leased from the 'Fraternity by their firm. Final decision is contingent upon lease arrangements. It is hoped that during the coming year, each Pi Phi, active and alumnae, will gain more knowledge about her outstanding school of crafts which she, as a Pi Phi, is part owner. With this pride and understanding "Make Arrowmont Your Favorite Philanthropy" will become not merely a slogan but an act. The Chairman wishes to express her gratitude to the members of the Board of Governors, the Grand Council, Central Office, and the staff of Arrowmont and Arrowcraft for their assistance on her behalf during the past months of service in this office. HELEN DEPPE VOLLMAR PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Helen Vollmar, who assumed the duties as chairman succeeding Betty Hall. Also, the position of Administrator was offered to Caroline Mills Riddle, Florida Beta, from Orlando, Florida, and we were very pleased that she accepted. The Red Barn was a popular place as usual for week end retreats or work sessions. There were eighteen bookings and we were happy to have South Carolina Alpha, Tennessee Alpha and Gamma, and Alabama Alpha with us. Several dates have been reserved for the Fair this fall and for other times during the coming year. Arrowcraft had a very good year and we appreciate the fine cooperation of our clubs and chapters. There were 252 32 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 33 clubs and 39 chapters selling Arrowcraft merchandise this past year for a total purchase figure of $201,146.30. This is an increase over the previous year in total sales as well as in the number of clubs and chapters placing orders. As a result of this increase, we were able to transfer some funds from Arrowcraft to Arrowmont School. Our sales in the shop have been very good also. We have a fine group of girls working for us in the shop and they are a credit to Pi Phi. They continue to work extremely well in spite of the crowded conditions under which. they have to work. Arrowmont School of Crafts continues to attract students from all over the country, from all walks of life, and all age groups. The instructors are outstanding craftsmen and teachers, and we have many who return year after year to teach. The same may be said for our students, for many of them are "repeaters" of one or more years. Our instructor from abroad this year is Liv Gjelsvik from Norway who is to teach advanced weaving. We are looking forward to an outstanding summer workshop program under the direction of Marian Heard, Director of Arrowmont School, and Sandra Blain, the Assistant Director. This year, for the first time, Arrowmont was the recipient of a scholarship to be given to one of our students. The Rotary Club of Gatlinburg gave a $200 scholarship and that was awarded to Sister Consolata Agyapong of Ghana. Our pre-school registration is such that we anticipate an-other increase in the number of students over the previous three years. We are gratified that so much interest is shown in the school and that it has such a fine reputation across the country, but each year we must turn some students away for lack of housing. After providing beds for staff, instructors and graduate assistants, we have only 80 beds left for students. This is less than half the number we had enrolled for a two week session and a one week session this summer. Arrowmont and the University of Tennessee joined forces and had a beautiful exhibit at the Craftsmen's Fair in October. Arrowcraft had some merchandise for sale in the Central Booth. Both Arrowmont and Arrowcraft partic-ipate in the Fair which is held in Asheville, N.C., during the summer. The Arrowmont auditorium was rented out to the Gatlinburg Christian Science Church for a lecture one Sunday afternoon in March. In April we put on a workshop for Art in Home Economics, co-sponsored by the College of Home Economics at the University of Tennessee. Once again, we housed and fed the leaders of the annual Wild Flower Pilgrimage, held the last week end in April. The first week end in May, the Little Pigeon Alumnae Club sponsored a Founders' Day Luncheon at the Staff House. There were about 100 Pi Phis present to help, celebrate the 25th anniversary of Tennessee Gamma chapter. In March, Caroline Riddle arrived to start a period of training for the position as Administrator. She will assume full responsibility on September 1, 1973. The two of us attended the annual meeting of the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild, which was held in April at Fontana Village, N.C. We have had our usual pleasant contacts with the elementary school which is still known officially as the Pi Beta Phi School. Lunch at the school one day was enjoyed along with other invited guests. Early in December we gave each classroom one of the colored glass candy canes to hang in the window along with the little angel which was given last year. Caroline and I attended the science fair which was held in May and was open to the public. Since Arrowmont does not own enough typewriters to see us through the summer, we always borrow two or three from the school. Yes, it has been a full and busy year, but an interesting one. It has meant more than words can express, to have been a part of this outstanding Pi Beta Phi project. We wish for Caroline Riddle, the very best, and feel confident that the Pi Phi operation here in Gatlinburg will continue to make progress under her direction. Sincere thanks and grateful appreciation to all those who have made this a most rewarding experience.

In our opinion, subject to the outcome of the income tax matter referred to in Note D, the accompanying statements of financial condition and statements of revenues and expenditures and changes in fund balances pre-sent fairly the financial position of the funds (as described above) of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at May 31, 1973 and 1972, and the results of their operations and changes in fund balances for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. 4'...41.44r+Ct' Little Rock, Arkansas August 2, 1973 NOTE A Significant Accounting Policies The accounts of the Settlement School are maintained on a fund basis of accounting appropriate to non-profit organizations. The current funds are used to account for transactions related to the instructional programs of the School and the auxiliary activities which provide services to the students, faculty and public. The Endowment Funds are used to account for gifts which allow only the income thereon to be expended. The Invested In Plant Fund contains the transactions relating to investment in property and equipment. The format of the financial statements displaying these funds is presented in a manner which is appropriate for colleges and universities. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for colleges and universities, no provision has been made for depreciation of buildings and equipment. Certain expenses paid from other funds of Pi Beta Phi are allocable to Settlement School and are included as income and expenses in these financial statements. NOTE B Due to Pi Beta Phi Grand Treasurer Advances to Settlement School were made as a loan for the purpose of paying a portion of the construction costs of a classroom building to be known as Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. The loan is with interest at 5% beginning July 17, 1970, the date of completion, and the interest is due annually. There is no stated due date for the loan principal. At May 31, 1972, the advances due to the Grand Treasurer were transferred from the Land Sale Fund to the General Fund and the Land Sale Fund was closed. NOTE C Meals and Room Rents Paid Certain amounts in 1972 have been reclassified to facilitate comparability and increase meaningfulness of the statement. Items previously reported were: meals paid $32 ,081; room rents paid $27, 650. NOTE D Contiiigent Liability Subsequent to May 31, 1973, the Settlement School received a notice of income tax deficiencies from the Internal Revenue Service for years ended May 31, 1961 through May 31, 1968, which amounted to approximately $60,000, including penalties. The Internal Revenue Service contends that the Arrowcraft Shop income is not related to the tax exempt purpose of Settlement School and is, therefore, subject to income taxation. The Settlement School does not agree with this position and plans to pursue the matter in court. The outcome cannot be deter-mined at this time and no provision has been made for any liability in connection with this matter. Standing Co'tteeJ CANADIAN PHILANTHROPIES COMMITTEE The donation of $1000' for "Arrow in the Arctic" went last summer to the Yukon Library Services. They are setting up an Indian Resource Centre, and seeking approval from the government to include the Centre as a branch library. The gift enabled them immediately to supply books, pamphlets, and periodicals to this Resource Centre. An addition has been made to the Library in Whitehorse, and a children's librarian has been added to the staff. The videorecorder purchased by the NorthWest Territories Library Services with our previous donation of $1000 has proved extremely valuable in taping films of Eskimo storytellers, to show in various communities. It is hoped to foster an interchange of information and cultural material. Library Service has been extended to Igloolik and Pangnirtung in the Eastern Arctic, and the local librarians are Esk-imo girls. The loan fund for students in social work was increase( from $150 to $300 maximum on a trial basis two year ago. It has been used to a greater extent, and the record o repayment has improved. It still seems to serve a usefu purpose, and is appreciated by recipients and the schools o social work alike. Your continued loyal support for the Canadian Philan thropies is requested and appreciated. Your support o Northern Libraries is accomplished by continued giving b. loyal Pi Phis. It has been a privilege to serve as Chairman for thre years. It is a pleasure to report that Carol McGonigal o Winnipeg Manitoba will be chairman for the next term. PATRICIA FOSTER WEIR THE EMMA HARPER TURNER MEMORIAL FUNDS COMMITTEE Twenty-seven years ago Pi Beta Phi launched a new project, a project that was to become a wonderful adventure in friendship and compassion. At the Swampscott Convention in 1946 it was voted to appropriate fifty thousand dollars from Fraternity funds to establish the Emma Harper Turner Memorial Funds, a project with a dual purpose. The principal was to be used for loans to chapters for building or remodelling purposes; the interest paid by the chapters on these loans was to be used for gifts to alumnae who through tragic circumstances may be in need of special assistance. This is the only Fraternity project designed to help alumnae members. Over the years the 'Fund has been augumented by donations from clubs, chapters, and individual Pi Phis. An increasing number of clubs and members send special gifts to the Fund, honoring the memory of a Pi Phi friend who has passed away. The Emma 'Harper Turner Committee, composed of three alumnae appointed by the Grand Council, is not concerned in any way with chapter house loans and it handles no money. Its sole function is to process grants given to alumnae who are in need of the special assistance this fund can provide. The funds are not large enough and were not designed to provide continuing sustenance expense, nor can we underwrite the costs for extended hospital or medical expenses. Rather, we offer "gifts of love" for emergency needs or provide small monthly checks which have meant some little independence for alumnae with limited means, usually in the years when every cent of slender, total in-come is scarcely adequate to cover the bare necessities of life. The EHT Fund aids alumnae in two categories: (1) young alumni who have suffered major and often tragic emergencies and who are not covered by pensions, Social Security, Medicare, etc, and (2) older alumnae who often have adequate income to cover the bare minimum of living expenses, but nothing for extras or the small amenities which bring cheer and comfort to sad and lonely lives. Over the years this fund has provided a great variety of comfort and services to some of our less fortunate members: a wheel chair for an arthritic; a special orthopedic mattress for one who was bedridden; the services of a visiting nurse for one who was blind and almost helpless; an intercom system for the home of a young polio mother. The money has been used to pay for cortisone and other necessary but expensive medicines; to have neglected dental work done; for new eye glasses; for "Talking Books;" for taking a taxi instead of riding three buses to the doctor's office; and in countless ways which have brought cheer and comfort to lonely hearts. These are the tangibles and theycan be counted. The boost in morale of the recipients o these gifts cannot be measured because it is incalculable The knowledge that Pi Phi still cares about them, is intel ested in them and wants to help them bear their heavy bul dens, the lift to the heart and the spirit, has usually mean as much as the badly needed financial assistance. Happily, in July 1972, due principally to the generou support of this project by the alumnae clubs, Grand Counci was able to raise the maximum amount of the monthl gifts from twenty-five to fifty dollars. The maximur amount for emergency gifts, usually given only once, wa raised to five hundred dollars. Monthly gifts currentl range from ten to fifty dollars. One Golden Arrow who ha been a member for silty-eight years and who is almo! blind wrote a little thank you note when she learned of th increase in her monthly gift: "For one who has no incom at all, fifty dollars is indeed a gift !" Eight alumnae have received gifts from this fund durin the past year, all monthly grants except one. One nel emergency grant was approved. It is of great concern to th Grand Council and to the EHT committee that there ha been only one new request for help during the biennium. would be comforting to believe that there are only eigI alumna needing the service which this project can provid( but with our large membership that is highly improbable The committee has no way of locating Pi Phis who migf need these gifts; it is necessary to depend entirely upon th members of the alumna clubs to furnish the information. : is the responsibility of every alumna to be alert to possibi need for help and to get in touch with the EHT chairma for details about procedures. Every recipient of these gif, must have three Pi Beta Phi sponsors. These gifts are a ways given in confidence. The names of the recipients al known only to the few Pi Phis involved in processing th grant, unless the recipient herself wishes to tell of her gif Alumnae who have sponsored and been instrumental in of taming help for a Pi Phi friend who has suffered grey misfortune are invariably moved by this tangible evident of the Fraternity's deep concern and interest in its less fo tunate 'members. Sincere appreciation is felt for the ever present help an guidance of Sally Hunt, who serves as ex-officio member ( the committee. The help and cooperation of Orpha Coenei Sally Schulenburg, and the two members of the committe Ninabelle Dame and Mary Frances Pirkey, have been Brat fying. It has been an inspiration to work for this small bl beautiful Fraternity project. RUTH WILLIAMS HANSEN 37
