        yid THE SEPTEMBER ARROW CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE Cecil Rhodes, when making his will to establish the Rhodes scholarships, wrote, "Educational relations make the strongest tie." How right was Pi Beta Phi, affiliated with education through all its years, when it chose that field for its philanthropy! How wise were the leaders of 1910 and 1911 to recognize that the level of culture in a country depends upon the education of its people ! Pi Beta Phi first offered in Gatlinburg only the basic needs the three Rs. Then came the necessity for health protection and methods of overcoming malnutrition. Next, we turned to another phase of educational progress the encouragement of weaving and other handicrafts with new colors and new ideas for the local people, already gifted, and the marketing of their products through Arrowcraft. Policies must ever be in a state of flux, subject always to changes which best meet current needs and developments, and as the county and state became financially able to assume more of their true responsibilities, we gave them their opportunity and turned to yet an-other phase of educational advance, the encouragement and development of the handicrafts in the whole Southern Highlands area. In 1945 still another transition came with the establishment of the Pi Beta Phi University of Tennessee Summer Workshop in Crafts. This time it was not only to further the crafts in the mountain areas of the south but to spread this education clear across the United States. This summer the ninth Workshop was held in Gatlinburg when twenty-two states, spreading from Florida to Toronto and westward to Colorado and Texas were represented. Twenty-two in attendance were graduate-students, seventeen were undergraduates and twenty-seven of the total sixty-six were non-credit, studying for sheer love of the crafts. Not only has there been a revival of interest in the crafts and related arts for the joy of creating but also has come a recognition of the great therapeutic value of crafts for hundreds of people handicapped through war or other injures, physical and mental, and instructors must be trained. Our Work-shop is a new venture in education and is attracting wide-spread attention to Pi Beta Phi and the University's all-year program in Related Arts and Crafts. Now two other summer schools for credit have been set up in the east but ours was the first. Plans for the Summer Workshop are made at the time of the Chairman's fall visit to the School. Then Miss Jessie W. Harris, Vice Dean of the College of Home Economics, Miss Henrietta R. Sivyer, Head of the Department of Related Arts and Crafts, Miss Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design, Miss Ruth Buckley, Head of the Department of Foods and Nutrition, together with Miss Dyer, her Assistant and the Chairman assemble in conference. One cannot go far wrong with such able advisors and Pi Beta Phi is ever grateful for their aid. Miss Harris, 1938 Convention initiate, has given her thought to our Workshop from before its inception and Miss Heard has been its Director from the start. We have appreciated, too, the encouragement from Prof. F. J. Lowry, Dean of the University Extension, under whose department we operate. The 1953 Workshop offered Metal Work and Jewelery, Weaving, Textile Design, Pottery, and Enameling for beginners and advanced students. We lean heavily on Miss Heard's enthusiastic leadership as well as her skill in the teaching of Advanced Jewelery making. Because of the present increased interest in Enameling, Mr. Kenneth S. Bates was brought down from the Cleveland Institute of Arts as instructor. His handsome display of museum pieces, particularly the enamels on pure silver or copper served as major incentives in that field. All phases of the curriculum had top instructors in their fields and the results of the three and six weeks' efforts, when displayed at two Open Houses, proved the value of their teaching. As mentioned in previous annual reports, the bottle neck of former Workshops has been the lack of adequate housing and too small kitchen and dining space to care for the staffs and summer students. This situation has now been eased with the completion of the new Staff House. This twelve bedroom home not only provides new year around living for our regular staff and the Workshop staff for six weeks but the dining room cares for one hundred comfortably. The kitchen is planned for scientific operation. Again we had the advice of the University of Tennessee: Miss Buckley on the kitchen planning; Miss Sivyer and Miss Heard with furnishings and colors. Money for the building of the Staff House came from bequests (the Garshwiler estate and the Graham estate), from California Alpha money, and from the Sinking Fund into which have been regularly placed amounts for such construction as needed at the Settlement School. The concept of having the house furnished by extra contributions to honor a friend, a relative, other loyal Pi Phi, or from devotion to the Settlement School came to the Committee even before plans for the Staff House were on paper. The idea was spear-headed by Maryland Alpha which pledged the balance of its treasury, one thousand dollars, at the Jasper Convention just as the chapter was withdrawing from the Goucher campus. We are very proud of the response to the letter sent out last fall by the Publicity member of the Committee and most particularly of those alumnae clubs which made their contribution to the Staff House furnishings without reducing the amount regularly donated to the maintenance program of the School. The following are those who, to date, share in the pleasure of seeing the house become habitable, attractive, and restful. Some contributions were made with specific purposes in mind. These are recorded but the balance will be assigned this summer and listed in a later ARROW. As promised previously, credit will also be posted at the Staff House.

Frances C. Curtis Memorial Gladys R. Finch Memorial Those clubs beside whose name appears one asterisk contributed to the Staff House without reducing their regular Settlement School contribution. Where two stars are evident, that club not only did not reduce the size of its regular contribution from last year but increased it! There are still four bedrooms whose furnishings must be provided and aside from these we are still in need of many things. On the practical side are such as a vacuum cleaner, a waxer, floor and table lamps, a clock. Among the more costly morale builders could be named a Deep Freeze or a refrigerator which will provide ice as well as furnish additional storage room (We have no ice machine at present and Tennessee heat really calls for one!) and a spinet piano. The piano is much desired. And now to the all-year program at the Settlement School Some staff changes have occurred this year. In December, the resignation of Ethel M. Snow as Manager of Arrowcraft became effective. During her sixteen years of service, she had become an integral part of Arrowcraft's relations with the alumnm, and to relinquish her meant a real adjustment. We appreciated her staying on through the fall shipping season. To the position came Mrs. Marian Webb Mueller, Indiana G, who in her six months has demonstrated her business ability and her merchandising talents. This June Lena Hodgen resigned as Housekeeper and for those who saw her quiet efficiency, the School will seem changed without her. Two others, Pi Phis, Joan ( Joni) Newcomer, Kansas Beta and Katherine (Katie) McIntosh, Alabama B, have been welcome additions to the official family. Ruth Dyer's expression, "Never a dull moment!" aptly describes the busy life of our staff. Miss Dyer herself never could be said to lead a leisurely existence nor a monotonous one for the she is in demand from morning till night. To read her report gives a full idea of her supervisory duties from overseeing the progress of the Staff House and its landscaping and that of the whole school to lecturing on her box or bird collections or passing out the diplomas at commencement time but it could never include all the unexpected demands. The Committee owes Miss Dyer a debt of gratitude for her vigilance and her interests in protecting Pi Phi possessions in Gatlinburg. Serv-ing as assistant to Miss Dyer is Joni Newcomer who, with her versatility has adapted herself quickly to the School and community needs. Joni has led a Girl Scout troop, taken charge of a young people's group and music at her church, lent her journalistic talents to the school and been most generous with her music on all occasions. At the Conclusion of the manual sent to each member of the staff it says, "The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee concurs in the opinion of the local committee that the interests of the school are best fostered when staff members participate in church and community enterprises." This, of course, is done in their own free time but each quickly finds herself drawn into church and community activity and makes her contribution willingly. Pi Beta Phi has provided four teachers to the County School in Gatlinburg this year and three, Mrs. Armstrong, Music, Ann Smith, Arts and Crafts, and Carl Huskey have been back with us this past year. The last named is on half-time but his contribution in teaching wood-working is valuable because many of the boys who do not go on to college are enabled, by his instruction, to find employment in the woodcraft shops of the area. They learn to handle safely the power machines and turn out commendable small pieces of furniture. Mrs. Aletha Armstrong continued her class work in Music with the elementary grades while directing the high school glee club, giving voice instruction for ten promising solo voices and preparing and producing two large performances during the year. Both of these used the grade and the high school students. In the Christmas play, "The Coming of the Prince of Peace" (Dickinson) the main continuity was handled by the Glee Club. In late spring the operetta "The Magic Nutcracker" (Tschaikovsky) was most successful. For both these productions Katie McIntosh practiced with them and served as the accompanist. Since she is a graduate in Music from the University of Alabama, her help was a great addition as was that of Ann Smith for settings and backgrounds. Mrs. Armstrong emphasizes that progress has been made in recognizing and developing the native voices and has expressed the need for a wire recorder in order that the young people may properly evaluate their tone and learn the value of voice training. This and money for still other fine records could well be suggestions for special club or chapter Christmas gifts. Ann Smith returned to complete her first full year of teaching Arts and Crafts after coming to us immediately after graduation from U.T. last March. The elementary pupils were exposed each week to developing their creativeness with everything from finger painting to the making of puppets. The 7th and 8th grade girls made match boxes, plastic bracelets, metal trays and Christmas decorations, to name a few. The boys did not take so readily to art but managed to show interest in poster making, metal work and crafts strip work. Two made very creditable lamps. There has to be much poster work for the school events which keep all students busy. There were classes of eleven and twelve each for the Junior and Senior girls, one hour daily wherein they did advanced metal work, made Christmas gifts and decorations. They entered these in the Christmas Garden Club Show and received a number of ribbons. Design and color were stressed all year. They worked also in leather and when weaving was offered, several advanced class girls made stoles. Entries were sent to two Arts and Crafts exhibits during the year: in the fall to the U.T. exhibit, and at the end of the year work from both grade and high 42 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW school went to Cherokee, N.C. for display. Ann is serving this summer as one of the Graduate Assistants at the Workshop. Mr. Chan Huskey, with a Master's degree came to us last fall from Sevierville High School to teach Physical Education and Health in the High School. The latter is taught only to the Sophomores each year and forty two completed the stipulated state text in May. In the gymnasium classes conditioning was given to all and there were intramurals and tournaments to arouse good class and school spirit. Games such as "Crows and crains," "Beater goes round," "Chain dodge ball," foreign to a western neophyte at least, were mixed with the old familiar relays, tugs of war, rope climbing, rooster fights, and arm wrestles. Basketball continues to hold high interest for both girls and boys. Twenty games were played in the district and our team was entered in the district tournament. Mr. Huskey, with the help of the rest of the faculty, conducted a field day for the entire school and swimming was included in the program for the final weeks of school, when a local pool was made available. It is unfortunate that the gymnasium is in-adequate because of size and small dressing room space. We hope that the County can provide some improvement in dressing room facilities before school opens in September. The County does not plan for any immediate building program in Gatlinburg though plans are on file. Two of the County schools burned within the past year and of necessity had to be replaced, and the County Superintendent told the Committee that the two story grade school building in the County seat is really unsafe structurally, and a fire-trap. We have had pleasant relations and cooperation with Mr. Roy Ledwell, County Superintendent, who is new this year and with Mr. Charles Clabo, Gatlin-burg representative on the County Board of Education. We also claim the president of the School Board, Mr. Ownby, as a friend since his wife teaches in our high school. The new principal for next year, Mr. Dewey Large has his Master's in School Administration and comes with high recommendations. The County Board is careful in consulting Miss Dyer on applications, which was a stipulation of the Pi Beta Phi County Lease Agreement some years ago, and is appreciated. We have been discouraged at the appearance and lack of maintenance of repairs which was also a stipulation of our agreement with the County and hope for better results next year. We ask that the teachers, whose salaries are paid by us, co-operate with the principal and superintendent in the same manner as do the other teachers. Three regular teachers, Schley Cardwell, 2nd grade, Carolyn Freshour, Home Economics, and Carl Lewelling, Commerce, have lived with our staff this past year and were claimed as part of our official family. With politics what they are in the Tennessee legislature, some one said, "This was not the year for Schools," though free text books were voted. We shall probably wait for some time for a revived interest in new Gatlinburg school plans. The P.T.A. has become an increasingly active organization in support of the needs of the school. This year, they have again operated the school lunch room, earned sufficient to replace the cyclorama on the school auditorium stage and have purchased a spinet piano for the auditorium. They also assisted our nurse in the preliminary arrangements for the Pre-school Round-up examinations. The Health Center continues to be a vital part of the Settlement School plant, as shown by the summation here given though it does not reveal all the ac-tivities of our nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, nor the difficulty in finding proper balance between the length of office hours and visits to the outlying district schools and the mountain homes.

However, in spite of vacation, the business class students gave up those days to assist in making out the necessary records. The doctors of the town cooperate fully with our program and are cognizant of the tremendous contribution which our Health Center gives to the cornmunity health and welfare. This past year Marjorie was active in the area polio drive and in conference with local, district and state representatives in Civil Defense. This spring she was appointed to the State Women's Advisory Committee for Civil Defense. Her weekly "Health Shots" which has appeared for five years in the Gatlinburg Press has proved a fine means of disseminating wise preventive information not only to the town itself but to a widened area through the paper's circulation elsewhere. We are ever appreciative of the assistance provided by Sigma Phi Gamma, national business women's organization, whose philanthropic services in Eye Correction extend through the mountain areas. Several different chapters have our Health Center assigned them each year and their donations to us widen our sphere of service. The Loan Closet, in large part supplied by the Pi Beta Phis from everywhere has its contents ever on the move. Sick room supplies and baby scales are usually returned but the layettes always need replenishing and new or used clothing in good condition, for all ages, is a special need every year. The contributions are welcomed and appreciated when loaned or given. Arrowcraft continues to produce its lovely products and the Pi Phis continue to find new markets for them. Accenting the length of time we have been in production was the party which Mrs. Muellr and Mrs. McMorran gave the weavers this spring, for on that occasion nine weavers were honored for having woven for Arrowcraft over a twenty five year period. A project is worthy which contributes toward the support of sixty or more weavers, most particularly during this period of high living costs. But when one realizes that the proceeds from all the combined sales also help to pay the salaries and to maintain the Settlement School as it should be, one recognizes our need for your continued help and our great appreciation for all each club does. Space does not permit the listing of sales amounts for every club but by turning to the Province Vice Presidents' charts in this ARROW, one may find just what any club has done up to May 31. Eight clubs THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 43 exceeded $1000. sales in 1952. We appreciate the promptness in payments this year and the fact that so many others have augmented their sales to pass the thousand dollar mark. Here are those whose paid-up purchases topped the thousand mark; there would have been several others included, had they settled their accounts before the auditor's visit. 1. Champaign-Urbana, III $2,153.41 2. Philadelphia, Pa 1,634.12 3. Coos County, Ore 1,580.4() 4. Houston, Tex 1,528.89 5. Pasadena, Calif 1,494.89 6. Pittsburgh, Pa 1,488.53 7.

Albuquerque, N.Mex 1,079.25 15. Bloomfield Hills, Mich 1,040.00 I am sure that each of you can appreciate that Katie McIntosh, Bookkeeper, would have a far easier task if every club, chapter, and person purchasing from Arrowcraft were to pay her bills promptly. Arrowcraft is a business and too, must meet its bills. When goods are sold, please pay promptly, or if not, return them for credit well within the time limit. It seems unfair that an incoming club Settlement School sales chair-man be faced with hold-over balances due. 1952-53 proved to be a big shipping season. Even with good imagination it is hard to think in terms of more than 800 skirts, over 300 stoles, 1900 seamless bags or Whig Rose doilies to the number of 6000. These examples attest the beauty of the designing by Tina McMorran, head of the Weaving department. The coming year, some of the articles will be available only "as long as they last" but new patterns will sup-plant the out-going ones. There are new cotton plaid fringed table mats in blues and browns to accompany cottage pottery: a new baby blanket; a new evening purse made so that no federal tax need be added; a new blue skirt; pillow covers, high-lighted with metallic threads; beautiful wide belts to which may be added a wooden buckle of walnut or cherry or maple; and bands for luggage racks, just to name a few. Assisting Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. McMorran in sales and weaving are Edna Cook, Ruby Watson, Nellie Cook and Susie Maples. Edna who has been with Arrowcraft six years divides her time between assisting Mrs. McMorran with the weavers and helping in the sales room. Ruby and Nellie are salesgirls while Susie, clad in one of our colorful cotton skirts, demonstrates at the loom, weaving the sparkling pillow tops. Mrs. Edna McCutchan is in charge of the branch shop in the lobby of the Mountain View Hotel. In addition to the returns in money from your sales, we are grateful for all the general contributions and for the effort and sacrifice which they represent. May we again call your attention to the policy which states that when a benefit is advertised in the name of the Settlement School, all amounts above expenses must go to our philanthropy. The fraternity lawyer also states that the fraternity may not sanction exemption from federal tax on admission tickets unless the money comes to the School. The Committee would refer you to the Chart of the Settlement School Income and Expense Dollars in your files and which may also be found in the1952 Information Arrow, page 62. (Correction: "Activities" should read "Actives.") The sample year shows an average income and outgo and why larger donations would he helpful. "School facility operation" requires 30% of every dollar received, "Instruction" amounts to 22%, the "Summer Workshop," 13%, "Additions to Reserve and Sinking Fund," 15%, which leaves a remaining 20% to provide for Replacements, Insurance, Repairs and Committee management expense. Over a period of some years, I have hoped to see a contribution from every single club and chapter but appreciation is no less sincere for all that has been given. An accolade goes to the St. Louis alumna club for again sending its annual thousand dollars, which it has done for many years. Another Epsilon province club, Kansas City, Mo. stands second with $700.00 to its credit. Our Grand Vice President must be very proud of her own club and of her province, too! The following clubs and chapters are on the honor roll this year, with contributions of one hundred fifty dollars or more (clubs) and sixty dollars or .more from the chapters. Clubs Chapters St. Louis, Mo. . .$1000.00 Missouri B $ 125.00 Kansas City, Mo. 700.00 Texas A 100.00 Milwaukee, Wis. 300.00 California I' 100.00 Cleveland-East 225.00 Louisiana A 85.00 Indianapolis, Ind. 210.00 Illinois El 75.00 Philadelphia, Pa. 200.00 Kansas B 75.00 Denver, Colo. ..... 200.00 Colorado A 75.00 N. New jersey .... 175.00 Nebraska B 68.59 Houston, Tex 150.00 Wisconsin I' 65.00 Missouri A 60.00 Twelve other clubs were in the $100. bracket and eight other chapters gave between $50. and $60.00. From the Magazine Agency profits this year our treasury received $7,532.10. This amount could be greatly augmented if every club inspired every member to subscribe for at least one magazine through the fraternity agency, and every chapter member sent one subscription to her family as a gift. Shall we consider our work in Gatlinburg finished and seek some other type of philanthorpy? Think first of the place we hold in the fraternity world, for our educational service to those outside Pi Beta Phi. Would you withdraw the benefits of our Health program relieving the over-taxed doctors of school inspections, inoculations and consultations on minor difficulties or accidents, the pre-natal advice and care given to new mothers, or First Aid to the school children, week after week? The program of sanitation, disease prevention and health preservation would have a tremendous set-back. The Workshop program is well launched and has a large future as it is expanded; many students returning to their many states carry a wide-spread message of the fraternity's influence not only on the handicrafts of the southern mountains but on every helpful and healthful objective of that vicinity. No money donated to us is spent other than on the Settlement School program and the withdrawal of these funds would have the wrong economic effect upon the community. Should we sacrifice the service we give our weavers and lose prestige as we display and sell the beautiful articles made for Arrowcraft and distributed all over the United States? It does not necessarily follow that we shall always have direct obligations in secondary education for the Gatlinburg school system, but when one goes to Gatlinburg and talks with the pioneers, the older established residents or the doctors rather than. the newcomers in business, eager for the tourist trade but 44 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW with less knowledge of the long development of the area, one knows that Pi Beta Phi is needed and appreciated. The future program will change, adjust itself to new conditions, but we could ill afford to discontinue our interests. With the majority of fraternity members believing in the School and our efforts there, we must continue our support to the best of our ability. This past month I heard an address by the president of one of our western colleges in which he referred to the sequence which sometimes occurs in the treatment of a worth-while activity: "First, we Choose it; Then we Use it; And then, if we Abuse it, It follows that we Lose it." CHOOSE USE ABUSE LOSE ! I earnestly hope this sequence will not obtain in our Settlement School, on account of the few rumblings heard, to the effect that our project has served its purpose. It is always wonderful to discover how many fine and able Pi Phis there are. In no place is this more quickly demonstrated than in service on the Settlement School Committee. The duties are many and the time for action, short. I have ever been appreciative of the Committee's assistance but particularly duringthe past two years when the burdens have been doubly heavy. Each member has responded hand. sorely to the extra calls for help. At this summer's meeting, Louise W. Nobler, Washington Beta, former Lambda Province Vice President of Everett, Washington was "pledged" to the Committee. She will serve as . Public Relations members and will edit "News of Little Pigeon" in the ARROW. Virginia Brackett Green, Indiana Gamma, former Delta Province Vice President, assumes the duties of the Chairman. This report concludes twenty two years and more of close official contact with the fraternity and I would register my gratitude for the privilege of this service. During this time the Settlement School has become very real and very dear to me. For my successor I can only wish the same heart-warming associations and in-creased opportunities for service in Pi Beta Phi. The Grand Council, all officers, the Staff and the Commit-tee members have ever been ready to show their cooperation and their commendation. I wish also to express my gratitude to the alum= clubs, active chapters and individual Pi Phis who, by their encouragement and their continued support have made possible the maintenance of our philanthropy. RUTH BARRETT SMITH REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1953 A pebble dropped into still water produces an ever-widening circle of ripples. In much the same way the first Settlement School workers introduced new ideas in education, sanitation, industry, and ways of living that have enlarged and grown with the years, ever spreading and enlarging that influence. Workers may come and go, Committee membership change, the economy of the village undergo startling transformations, but the idea of service to the mountain people remains the same as when this Memorial to our Founders was started forty-one years ago. Community Building of all sorts of tourist courts, shops and restaurants has been almost continuous throughout the year with little slowdown during the winter months. The Riverside Hotel had its "face lifted," and now has an exterior something like Mount Vernon. The Mountain View built new shuffleboard courts on the corner adjoining our property and changed the swampy ground across the street by draining it and making the river channel deeper before filling in the ground. A new Catholic church is being built in the Airport field, and we are at last to have a new building for the Post Office. Bruce Whaley is building a two-story stone and frame structure to house the Post Office and a craft shop on the first floor, with offices and apartments on the upper floor. The American Legion paid off the indebtedness on its property and is now working towards funds for a building. All these physical changes caused one newspaper reporter to refer to the town as "a Miami Beach without an ocean front, an Atlantic City without a beauty pageant, or a Colorado Springs without 16,000-foot mountains." He also added that 95 per cent of the business enterprises, from taxi service to hotels, is owned by natives of the area and that just a few miles from town you will still find the old time way of life being lived in cabin homes. The local people are much engrossed with all this business during the touristseason, but later in the year find time to meet socially and to work for worthy causes. Union church services were held on special occasions. The Thanksgiving service was held in the Baptist church with the new Methodist minister, Reverend Spurgeon McCartt, preaching the sermon. There was a service outside by the community Christmas tree when the lights were turned on, and at Easter there was the usual sunrise service on the Greystone lawn. Girl Scouting in the village is being carried on by an enthusiastic group of young mothers and others. Over 100 girls are participating in the program. The local leaders were hostesses to a one-day Area Workshop for Leaders held at the Assembly Grounds in October. National Girl Scout week was observed with an Open House at the New Gatlinburg Inn recreation room, and the Court of Awards was held one Sunday afternoon in the basement of the Baptist church. One troop of Boy Scouts is quite active, but the lack of leaders hinders a wider participation in that program. All of the local children were guests of the American Legion at their annual Christmas party held at the Cherokee Theater. This is a gay occasion with candy, gifts, and fun for all. The children who were not too fortunate were remembered well by local people, especially by the Santa who delivers gifts in costume and works hard for several months at the projects. He is Mr. Byron Herbold, a local chef. He and his wife have no children, but they spend hours working for the poor and needy. At Easter, the churches sponsored an egg hunt for all children on the Whittle lawn. The local Garden Club again had an outstanding show of Christmas greens and arrangements at the December meeting. The lobby of the Mountain View was filled with the different entries. Here again the children were included. Miss Smith worked with her art classes, Miss Freshour with the home economics classes, and the Girl Scout troops all brought interesting items for the show. Fund-raising for the Polio Fund by having a big party at one of the hotels has THE SEPTEMBER ARROW been an annual practice. The one this year was held at the Greystone Playhouse and was most successful. The receipts were $1,800.00 from the party and the polio candles that had been placed around town in different business places. It was fun to have Marianne Wild, Olivia Moore and Ruth Smith as our guests at the affair and to help eat the cake that Marianne won on a chance. Another benefit party was the one given by the \X''omen's Auxiliary of the Episcopal Guild. This netted them $335.00. A drive for the Red Cross and one for the benefit of the village library were carried on and were fairly successful. The young girls from our house had a good time when they helped serve as hostesses at the Fox Hunters Ball. That association met in Sevier County for their 59th Annual Field Trials during November, with the social affairs being held in Gatlinburg. October was a beautiful month with the exception of many forest fires in the surrounding mountains. We had none in the Park area, but did have overcast skies and were worried about the lack of rain and the constant threat of real danger, should a big fire get started. The weather was not so favorable when the third annual Wildflower Pilgrmage was held in the spring. It was rainy, but that did not seem to dampen the enthusiasm of the people who came from many places to study the flowers in the Park. Another spring event was the Horse Show, sponsored by the local Lions Club. It was something new to Gatlinburg. I do not think the Club made any money and they certainly worked hard putting on the affair, but it did prove interesting to tourists and locals alike. Changes in Staff and Physical Plant Perhaps of more interest than community affairs have been the changes in our own staff: Joan New-comer, Kansas Beta, came last July to take Lillian's place as my assistant. She has fitted into our life beatitifully and besides doing an efficient job at the school has contributed to community activities through her Girl Scout troop and work with the choir and the youth program at the Methodist church. She has been in demand as an entertainer, giving willingly of her talents. Another new staff member is Katie Mc-Intosh, Alabama Beta, who came to us right from college to help as bookkeeper at the Arrowcraft Shop. Katie was a music major and plays the organ at the Episcopal church and directs the choir, besides helping Mrs. Armstrong with the music program at the school. Ethel Snow resigned and left the school in December. It seemed strange without her, for she had been such a part of the school life in Gatlinburg for many years that her loyalty and talents were almost taken for granted. In February Mrs. Marion Mueller, Indiana Gamma, came to take over the Shop. She has proved to be very efficient, and in the few months she has been here has the situation well in hand. The Fraternity can be proud of its new representatives at the Settlement School. The year has marked many improvements in buildings. Stuart, Pollard, and Teachers Cottages, and the Health Center have all been painted. The barn was given a fresh coat of red paint, and the dormitory boys did the same for the brooder houses. Most important was the completion of the new Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House, the car port, and the setting for the house. A fieldstone retaining wall with the lichens carefully placed on the front side, a rustic bridge across the drainage ditch, slate sidewalks resembling stepping stones, a new lawn sloping gently down to the path across the field, and plantings around the house have taken hours of time and effort. There is still much to be done, butthe essential things have been taken care of. '1 house is lovely and those of us who are privileged live in it are more than grateful to everyone who made the dream of a new staff house a reality. School The year started out well, with a complete fact] and an enrollment of 510, 32 more girls than be Due to several causes, before the year ended a numl of changes in the faculty had been made. The F ternity enriched the curriculum and helped to m the school an accredited one by providing seve teachers. Mr. Chan Huskey served his first year teacher of physical education and coached the bask ball teams very well. Mrs. Aletha Armstrong ag taught the music classes and worked with cho groups, Ann Smith had the work in arts and cra. and Mr. Carl Huskey taught the high school bi woodworking. Marjorie looked after the health of student body with their daily first aid requests, and the spring had a fulltime job when we had our sh of epidemics of measles, mumps, chicken pox, whooping cough. In addition to these regular si members we were happy in that the two young Phis working at their own jobs were able to c tribute so much to the school program. Joni used talents in various ways and Katie accompanied Mrs. Armstrong. The usual events followed each ot in the general pattern of all schools. The gay cola leaves decorating the grade school blackboards g way to Pilgrams, turkeys, and pumpkins, and then jolly Santas and Christmas trees. There was no school carnival at Halloween, but the first six gra had a colorful costume parade with prizes for different classes. Football suits were laid aside al a fairly successful season, and basketball became favorite sport. "Strictly Formal" was the junior ci play given in the fall. Miss Margretta Craig, a r English teacher, was the class sponsor and direc the play. It was fun, especially for us, for -two the dormitory girls had parts. There was the us two-day vacation at Thanksgiving and two we for Christmas. December was such a short sch month with many things crowded into the days. the rooms had parties with the mother furnishing freshments. Pi Phi chapters and alumnae clubs r vided an orange for every child in school, and tl~. were individual gifts for the children in the first f grades. The older grades received nice books for ti room libraries, and one grade got the athletic eqt ment that the Cleveland Alumnae Club always ser We always have charming Christmas programs, bi thought Mrs. Armtrong quite outdid herself on one last year. It was in the nature of a Nativity of ancient Christmas songs and carols called Coming of the Prince of Peace." The children sani sweetly and the staging was specially good. Every helped make it a success: Ann, Arlie, Neal, and all grade school teachers. Katie's accompaniment lovely. January and February were busy months, the high school students having semester exam. Lions. Valentine parties in all the elementary grg gave color and happiness to those children. ' seniors sponsored a big party for the high sci students proving that red hearts and cupids can ti even a high school boy. By March several epider were causing much absenteeism in the school teacher had to miss over three weeks with a case of whooping .cough, and another one had emergency operation. Mr. Jack Miller resigned, 1 ing another vacancy. The problem was solved by use of student teachers from the University of 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nessee. Mr. Lewelling was shifted to Mr. Miller's commercial classes and the student teachers took over the other work. A group of fourteen were assigned to Gatlinburg for their work in practice teaching. It would have been hard to finish' the year without their help. The senior class play, "A Broom for the Bride," was well cast and well given. The home economics teacher, Miss Carolyn Freshour, was one of the class sponsors and directed the play. Another project of the seniors was the school annual. I doubt if this book would ever have gone to press if Joni had not come to the rescue with her knowledge of journal-ism and helped them meet the deadline. Dorothy Manley worked up a small operetta for the third grade students called "The Magic Word." A more ambitious operetta was the annual one given by Mrs. Armstrong. She had many discouragements for so many of the children were out of school on ac-count of illness, Katie got sick, and at the last minute, Mr. Armstrong had a heart attack! Joni came to the rescue again, playing the difficult score, and the play went on. The twenty-one seniors finished their school days with a trip to Washington, D.C. They had been well-instructed as to what they were to see, and I think got a great deal out of the experience. They returned to final examinations and Commencement activities. The Baccalaureate service was held in the Methodist church with Reverend McCartt preaching the sermon. The high school chorus, under Mrs. Armstrong's direction, provided the music. Class night was held in the High School auditorium. It was a clever little program written and directed by Joni, called "Graduation Choo Choo." The Commencement exercises were held in the Baptist church. Dean I. N. Carr from Carson Newman College gave the address. He is from a family that came from this area and he went to our school as a child. At a dinner I gave preceding the * program, he spoke of the changes in the community, and again during his talk he spoke of that and of the work done by the Fraternity during the years. During the summer of 1952, three of our teachers completed work on their Bachelor's degrees. This helped give Gatlinburg a very good rating in their instructional staff in a county where there are still many permit teachers. Next year, Mr. Dewy Large will replace Mr. Walter Ogle as principal. He has a master's de.7,ree in school administration and has many plans for improving the school. We have a new County Superintendent of Schools, Mr. Roy Ledwell, who was long connected with Sevier County High School. Mr. Charlie Clabo replaced Mr. Fred Ingle on the Board of Education, and we are to have a new janitor. With the County and the Fraternity working together, we will be able to have a better school than we had last year if all the plans work out. P.T.A. The school lunch program was again sponsored by this organization. Mrs. Morrell gave efficient service and the children were well fed. More free lunches had to be provided than in the past several years. Of all the money-making projects, rummage sales are one of the favorite P.T.A. methods. These sales are held in the school music room, always on the day the Pi Phi weavers receive their monthly checks. The sales usually bring in about an average of $120.00. One sale helped buy new suits for the girls' basketball team, another helped pay for the gray cyclorama curtains for the stage, and a third was used for lockers in the hall. The really big project was the second Minstrel Show. This was written and directed by alocal man, Harry M. Bird. He has had experience with such shows before and really put on a grand entertainment. The goal was a new piano for the assembly room towards which the county Board had promised 8300.00. Enough was realized to buy the piano and to have a "dolly" made for it so it can be moved into a safe place when the gym is used for basketball games. Some good programs were given at the monthly meetings with good average attendance and interest in the work of the organization in its efforts to help both the parents and the school. Dormitory Twelve dormitory students lived at the school during the year. Of the eight girls, one was Martha Houser, Mary's senior daughter, three were juniors, and the other five were second year students. Joni chaperoned the girls, and the four boys were under Mr. Lewelling's care. Two boys were sophomores and the other two were freshmen. All of the girls and boys, with possibly one exception, were good students and very capably executed their work assignments. We again had trouble finding a cook except for the winter months when our good Leona was free from her restaurant job. The rest of the time we had some help from others, but mostly it was Miss Hodgen who fed the family. The girls were good help, but the whole situation was not fair, although seemingly unavoidable. Of course, the'move into the new house was the main event of the year. The management of the Greystone Hotel offered a crew of men for the job of moving the stoves, refrigerator, and heavy kitchen equipment. They came one Saturday morning, and with the help of our regular men and the dormitory boys and girls, everything was installed and we had our first meal that night, December 6th. The boys moved out of Pollard into the rooms vacated at Teachers Cottage by the staff moving into the new house, and that old house was closed until time for Workshop students to occupy it. The first social affair in the new house was the Open House honoring Ethel Snow on December 15th. It was a nasty, cold day, but we had many guests. Among these were several of the weavers, all of whom had been sent a special invitation, and a party of friends from the University who had helped plan certain things about the house. It is a lovely place in which to entertain large groups, and that day the holiday decorations made the setting especially effective. Our local alumnie presided at the punch bowl. Since then we have entertained a number of times. We held an open house for the members of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild during their spring meeting, and a coffee party for the student teachers and our regular teachers and staff. One group from the Council of Southern Mountain Workers met in the lounge for two meetings. Miss Hodgen entertained the Methodist ladies one afternoon, and the ladies from the Episcopal church met with Tina and Katie another afternoon. Marjorie had her bridge club for a dessert luncheon, and one evening another club met with her. We have entertained at several dinner parties the local ministers and their families and other friends. There were two Christmas parties at Stuart, one for the dormitory students, and one for Joni's Scout troop. Mrs. Henry has again used the living room and piano at Stuart for her music pupils and since she lives in Pigeon Forge is most appreciative of the privilege. Health Center Gatlinburg without a Health Center and a Pi Phi nurse ! I imagine the community would regard such a THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 47 situation as a real calamity, for from the time the local babies are brought to the Health Center to be weighed and given their first inoculations, through pre-school examinations and their school years until perhaps they have children of their own, the Health Center with our nurse, kindly Marjorie Chalmers, has been considered a haven. The small pebble dropped by the first nurse, Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario Alpha, thirty-three years ago, started ripples that are still expanding in the area. Different clinics are held at the Health Center during the year. These include the one for pre-school children entering the first grade, and about two yearly visits from the state mobile X-Ray unit. Marjorie's Friday afternoon clinic hours bring many young mothers for counsel and advice. During the school year, she is kept busy looking after the health needs of the 500 children in our school and in making visits to three rural schools, giving nursing service to the childen enrolled there. In the field of community work, she worked with the county polio unit and was chosen to attend a study course in atomic nursing that was given at Nashville. Two of the meetings of the health division of the Council of Southern Mountain Workers were held at the Health Center. The members admired greatly our modern building and equipment. We acknowledged with gratitude the gifts sent especially for the health pro-gram. Sigma Phi Gamma International Sorority gives us money through the Council of Southern Mountain Workers to be used for eye and dental corrections. Through the kindness of a Maryville oculist and a local dentist, this money stretches over a number of needy cases. A Christmas gift of fifteen dollars from the Portland Alumni Club was added to this fund. Chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma are assigned to help us and gifts of small items useful to the nurse and even money come from time to time. In our own membership there are individuals and alumnm clubs that send layettes, something that we have never had a surplus of since I have been here. Farm Our farmer has suffered the usual vicissitudes due to the weather either too much or too little rainfall. Wet weather was responsible for the need of a string of tile to drain the side garden into the spring, and the dry weather ruined some of the garden crops. Some seeds lay dormant and never did come up, while other vegetables died from lack of water. We have had quite a few things for the table, but not much of the sweet corn we are all so fond of. Richard has helped Arlie and Neal with the work of getting the new lawn seeded and in shape. For clays the dormitory boys spent their working hours picking up the rocks that had been left by the graders. We had especially good luck with the baby chicks and have had good egg production all year. Arroweraf! The year has been a busy one with many changes. New faces in management and sales staff have made no radical change in the operation of the shop. We are getting used to having Marion Mueller in Ethel's place, Katie at Mrs. Cole's desk, and two new sales-girls in charge of selling our lovely merchandise to the tourists. Ethel had to set up the Convention Shop, which is always a task. Those of you who were at the Shamrock will remember we had an especially fine display, Fall shipping was very heavy with no let-up until just before Christmas. Business has been good at both of the shops. Tourists are always interested in seeing a loom in operation, so we have hadone set up in the front salesroom with a weaver demonstrating on it. Irene Wilson wove the drapery material that Tina designed for the lounge and hall of our new Staff House on that loom, and at present Susie Maples makes the shuttle fly. Last summer, Tina was given leave of absence to attend a six weeks workshop at the Inter-Mountain Indian School in Utah where she worked under the famous Dorothy Liebes. She and Irene demonstrated at the Crafts-man's Fair in Asheville last July. Edna helped sell our products in the booth that we shared with the McDonalds (pottery), Marian Heard and Jane Glass (jewelry), and Mr. Ronald Slayton (wood products), formerly with the University of Tennessee. Arrowcraft weavings were exhibited at the Cherokee Indian Fair and were entered at the Fall Craft Show held at the University of Tennessee. In recognition of the weavers who have worked continuously for Pi Phi for many years, Marion Mueller and Tina arranged a party which was held at the Staff House. Seven weavers with a record of twenty-five years of service to Arrow-craft were the honored guests. Each was given a Stuart Nye pin suitably engraved on the back. All enjoyed the visiting and there was much recalling of old times. They sang some old harp songs before we had refreshments. These consisted of punch and a cake beautifully decorated with an arrow. Everyone regretted that Ethel Snow was not present, for she knew all the weavers. It would have been nice if our former weaving designer, Jene Redding, could have been there, for she had started many of this group weaving "for the school." Jene had seen many of them earlier in the spring when she was our guest for a few days. She was invited to give a talk at the spring meeting of the Southern Highland 'Handicraft Guild held at the Greystone Hotel, coming down from Boston where she now operates her own weaving service. Summer Activities Pi Phi Visitors and Staff House Dedication Our official Pi Phi family held meetings in town during the summer. Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and then the Province Officers arrived. We were delighted to have them here. Committee arranged for a lovely dinner, a tour of the grounds with meetings with the local resident staff and several of the teachers hired by the Fraternity, a visit to Arrowcraft and for them to be present at the formal dedication of the staff house. This was a simple ceremony held in the lounge with local Pi Phi alum-rue and friends of the school also in attendance. To all of us the highlight was when the building was dedicated and named the "Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House." No name could have been more fitting nor an honor more deserved. As Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Ruth Smith, had worked untiringly for this house; from the time that the site and architect were selected until the building stood, completed. She was aided by her husband, Warren T. Smith, a builder of experience, who flew from Oregon at his own expense to help with the many complicated details involved in letting the contract for the house. His advice was invaluable and saved the Fraternity hundreds of dollars. We regretted that he could not have been present at the ceremony to hear the tributes paid to Ruth and her modest speech of acceptance of the honor. The name plaque of wrought iron which is in place by the front door reminds us all of the unselfish service of a person who leaves the Committee this year. I think that everyone present at the dedication was impressed with Pi Phis close bonds of 48 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW friendship, tangibly expressed in a beautiful building which will add to the effectiveness of the work done at the Settlement School. In 1952, summer schools at most universities and colleges showed a decrease in the number of registrations. This was also true of our Craft Workshop, but the group was an enthusiastic and talented one. Even a person with only a slight knowledge of good crafts, when attending one of the open house exhibits, could realize that the work turned out was superior in design and quality of workmanship. Courses were offered in Weaving, Metal, Jewelry, Pottery, and Wood Working. Interesting trips to other craft centers, such as those in Asheville, Cherokee, and Brasstown, North Carolina, were a part of the pro-gram. The group enjoyed several picnics in the mountains. We always make so many new friends among the students that it is with real regret we see the sessions end. The Gateway Stock Company again rented the school auditorium for the season. Mr. John Richards brings down from New York a groupof talented young actors who appear in five different plays during the season. Space does not permit my listing the gifts that have come to the school during the year. The special Pi Phi shelf in the high school library holds many lovely new volumes given as memorials. We have received money for speech records for the English classes and musical recordings for the music department. Christmas gifts for the children were many and varied. We again sent individual gifts to the students in three rural schools, remembered the lower grades in our school; and there were special gifts and clothing for the dormitory students from the Terre Haute Alum= Club. These gifts came from all over the United States and from Honolulu. They are typical representations of the affectionate interest held by our large membership for the Settlement School. We express gratitude for these gifts, for the unselfish devotion of the members of the Settlement School Committee, and for our loyal local employees. Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER, Director Great Potential for Character Building Pointing out how the fraternity may become an educational institution of great significance, Dr. Thomas A. Brady, Vice President of the University of Missouri, has listed these propositions as basic: "1. The educational institution should be concerned not only with formal instruction but with the building of character and the social integration of the individual as well. "2. Formal instruction alone, being entirely verbal and visual, can impart truths and correct principles but will not serve as a substitute for daily experience in molding the individual. "3. The experience most effective in molding the character of the student is that which he receives in daily contact with others of his own age." Dr. Brady's argument for the fraternity, then, requires one further step. "This would be the contention that, granted the importance of experience with students his own age, the greatest achievement in the building character may be made if (a) the association is voluntary, and (b) if the students themselves, under proper guidance have as large a voice as possible in managing and directing the organization which makes the corporate life possible." Dr. Brady's views were expressed in an address at the 29th biennial convention of Phi Kappa, a general fraternity for Catholic men. From "Quiet Please" in Fraternity Month Earl F. Schoening, Secretary-Treasurer of Phi Sigma Kappa, had this to say, "A fraternity should be what it was fundamentally designed to be: a social organization to make for a more congenial and a more pleasant college life than could otherwise be had; a richer undergraduate experience because in carrying on the work of the social organization, officers and members acquire lessons which stand them in good stead after college. They can learn something of leadership and financial management. I feel strongly that fraternity membership is an asset to any man in after-college life whether he admits it or not." THE SEPT.EMSER ARROW TREASURER OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Little Rock, Arkansas August 6, 1953 Mrs. Thomas E. Graham, Treasurer Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Oklahoma City, Oklahoma DEAR MRS.

For all but two of the six, visiting the memorial to our Founders was a new thrill and they were inspired and impressed, not only with the beauty of the house but with the feeling that it is a vital living center of social activity in Monmouth. Mrs. Mabel Johnson who came to Holt House in December of 1950 is gracious and charming and rep-resents the Fraternity well. The committee enjoyed her hospitality while in Monmouth and left with the assurance that she is taking care and the pride in the house as she would her own home. She has welcomed visitors from many states. During the year 1952-53, Sept. to June, Holt House was used sixty-nine times as a meeting place or as a setting for private entertaining. Illinois Alpha and the Monmouth Alumna Club enjoyed the use of it for initiation and for Founders' Day and for two or three rush parties. Two clubs from neighboring towns held meetings there. Three groups in Monmouth rent the house for their monthly meetings and others use it two or three times a year. The Monmouth PEO meets at the house monthly as does the Women's Club of Monmouth, also the Arrow Mothers' Club. Not counting the times the house was used by Pi Phi groups or by regular renters, the house accommodated, on nine-teen occasions, private parties of varied nature, wed-ding receptions, rehearsal dinners, showers, bridge parties and teas. Other groups using the house this year are: New Century Club, DAR, Fortnightly Club, OGM and the Hospital Auxiliary, and three sororities. Holt House is indeed a charming home in which to entertain. Because Monmouth College is celebrating its Centennial this year, the house was offered to the college to be used for any function during Commencement Week or any time during the spring. In thanking the committee chairman for the offer, Dr. Gibson, President of Monmouth College, wrote, "We do appreciate the variety of ways in which Holt House not only serves our college but serves the community. We are indebted to Pi Phi for a great many things, and we are proud of the current group of girls on our campus as well as the fine alumnae chapter in our community." The first gift to be received after the Houston Convention was an I.C. pin sent by Vera Wattles Kirkpatrick, Nebraska Beta, of Corpus Christi, Texas. The pin was given to her years ago by an aunt, Carrie Wattles Swinder, initiated into Iowa Gamma in 1883, who died November 5, 1945. The pin is lovely and has been placed in the shadow box which we are now using for old pins. Last fall Mr. Earl Bridge of Detroit sent to Holt House a large, beautiful silver tray that had belonged to his wife, Evelyn Holliday Bridge, who died last spring. She was a former Monmouth resident and was on the Holt House Committee at the time of her death. The tray has been appropriately engraved and is being used at many teas and parties given at the house. A group of Detroit and Dearborn Pi Phis recently sent a check for $50.00 to be used at the discretion of the Holt House Committee to purchase a needed and worth-while memorial to Evelyn Bridge who, the letter. states, "was one of the outstanding and diligent workers in our club and in COMMITTEE lieu of flowers at the time of her death this fund was started." It is hoped that other groups will choose to follow this kind of a memorial for their deceased friends. Washington Alpha has sent a beautiful blue and white quilt; the Arrow and Chain appears in four places, the names of the founders living at the time the quilt was made, are embroidered, and in the center block "Grace Coolidge, Vermont Alpha." Special gifts to Holt House include $25.00 from the Milwaukee Club, $25.00 from the Kansas City Missouri Club, and $9.15 from the Joliet, Illinois Club to be used for a dozen silver spoons. These gifts are in addition to the annual donations sent by these clubs. The Committee is most appreciative of the financial support accorded the house by the many contributing chapters and alumna clubs. Total contributions were somewht below those of the preceding year however, and total expenditures were slightly higher. The number of contributing alumni clubs decreased from 213 to 199 for this year. Active chapter contributors decreased from 89 to 81. Total contributions are $349.70 less than last year. The only province to reach 100% this year is Delta which has reached this goal for several years. The clubs in Theta Province reached 100% as did the chapters in Epsilon, Kappa, Lambda and Zeta Provinces. The highest contributors were: $50.00-California Louisiana A Kansas City, Mo. Club $35.00-Oklahoma A $34.00 Akron, Ohio Club $30.00 Tennessee B $25.00-Kansas B Texas B Monmouth, Ill. Club North Shore, Ill. Club Pittsburgh, Pa. Club Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, with Eta Province second, the same as last year. Next in place came Beta Province, then Mu and in fifth place, Epsilon Province. The committee found the furnishings most complete, however some repairs and replacements were necessary. A sidewalk from the rear door to the drive-way and a loading platform there, were installed. A casing around the furnace was replaced, the furnace cleaned, and the humidifier was re-conditioned. The piano was tuned, and one string was replaced. This summer a rug for the Pine Room must be purchased, and the two Holt House films repaired or replaced. The Holt House Chairman is grateful for the continued cooperation of the committee members. The Treasurer, Torrance Etheridge, has been most efficient and thorough in the handling of Holt House funds and has been very prompt in her reports; her annual report is most complete. Marion Tyte has served as secretary of the committee, taking minutes of our Monmouth conference, and typing and mailing copies to committee members and to the Grand President and Grand Vice-President. Gertrude Leetz has kept up the house inventory that was so well-compiled by Mrs. McMurray of Peoria. Louise Campbell, the Monmouth member of the committee has had complete charge of the 57

        42 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW school went to Cherokee, N.C. for display. Ann is serving this summer as one of the Graduate Assistants at the Workshop. Mr. Chan Huskey, with a Master's degree came to us last fall from Sevierville High School to teach Physical Education and Health in the High School. The latter is taught only to the Sophomores each year and forty two completed the stipulated state text in May. In the gymnasium classes conditioning was given to all and there were intramurals and tournaments to arouse good class and school spirit. Games such as "Crows and crains," "Beater goes round," "Chain dodge ball," foreign to a western neophyte at least, were mixed with the old familiar relays, tugs of war, rope climbing, rooster fights, and arm wrestles. Basketball continues to hold high interest for both girls and boys. Twenty games were played in the district and our team was entered in the district tournament. Mr. Huskey, with the help of the rest of the faculty, conducted a field day for the entire school and swimming was included in the program for the final weeks of school, when a local pool was made available. It is unfortunate that the gymnasium is in-adequate because of size and small dressing room space. We hope that the County can provide some improvement in dressing room facilities before school opens in September. The County does not plan for any immediate building program in Gatlinburg though plans are on file. Two of the County schools burned within the past year and of necessity had to be replaced, and the County Superintendent told the Committee that the two story grade school building in the County seat is really unsafe structurally, and a fire-trap. We have had pleasant relations and cooperation with Mr. Roy Ledwell, County Superintendent, who is new this year and with Mr. Charles Clabo, Gatlin-burg representative on the County Board of Education. We also claim the president of the School Board, Mr. Ownby, as a friend since his wife teaches in our high school. The new principal for next year, Mr. Dewey Large has his Master's in School Administration and comes with high recommendations. The County Board is careful in consulting Miss Dyer on applications, which was a stipulation of the Pi Beta Phi County Lease Agreement some years ago, and is appreciated. We have been discouraged at the appearance and lack of maintenance of repairs which was also a stipulation of our agreement with the County and hope for better results next year. We ask that the teachers, whose salaries are paid by us, co-operate with the principal and superintendent in the same manner as do the other teachers. Three regular teachers, Schley Cardwell, 2nd grade, Carolyn Freshour, Home Economics, and Carl Lewelling, Commerce, have lived with our staff this past year and were claimed as part of our official family. With politics what they are in the Tennessee legislature, some one said, "This was not the year for Schools," though free text books were voted. We shall probably wait for some time for a revived interest in new Gatlinburg school plans. The P.T.A. has become an increasingly active organization in support of the needs of the school. This year, they have again operated the school lunch room, earned sufficient to replace the cyclorama on the school auditorium stage and have purchased a spinet piano for the auditorium. They also assisted our nurse in the preliminary arrangements for the Pre-school Round-up examinations. The Health Center continues to be a vital part of the Settlement School plant, as shown by the summation here given though it does not reveal all the ac-tivities of our nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, nor the difficulty in finding proper balance between the length of office hours and visits to the outlying district schools and the mountain homes.

However, in spite of vacation, the business class students gave up those days to assist in making out the necessary records. The doctors of the town cooperate fully with our program and are cognizant of the tremendous contribution which our Health Center gives to the cornmunity health and welfare. This past year Marjorie was active in the area polio drive and in conference with local, district and state representatives in Civil Defense. This spring she was appointed to the State Women's Advisory Committee for Civil Defense. Her weekly "Health Shots" which has appeared for five years in the Gatlinburg Press has proved a fine means of disseminating wise preventive information not only to the town itself but to a widened area through the paper's circulation elsewhere. We are ever appreciative of the assistance provided by Sigma Phi Gamma, national business women's organization, whose philanthropic services in Eye Correction extend through the mountain areas. Several different chapters have our Health Center assigned them each year and their donations to us widen our sphere of service. The Loan Closet, in large part supplied by the Pi Beta Phis from everywhere has its contents ever on the move. Sick room supplies and baby scales are usually returned but the layettes always need replenishing and new or used clothing in good condition, for all ages, is a special need every year. The contributions are welcomed and appreciated when loaned or given. Arrowcraft continues to produce its lovely products and the Pi Phis continue to find new markets for them. Accenting the length of time we have been in production was the party which Mrs. Muellr and Mrs. McMorran gave the weavers this spring, for on that occasion nine weavers were honored for having woven for Arrowcraft over a twenty five year period. A project is worthy which contributes toward the support of sixty or more weavers, most particularly during this period of high living costs. But when one realizes that the proceeds from all the combined sales also help to pay the salaries and to maintain the Settlement School as it should be, one recognizes our need for your continued help and our great appreciation for all each club does. Space does not permit the listing of sales amounts for every club but by turning to the Province Vice Presidents' charts in this ARROW, one may find just what any club has done up to May 31. Eight clubs THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 43 exceeded $1000. sales in 1952. We appreciate the promptness in payments this year and the fact that so many others have augmented their sales to pass the thousand dollar mark. Here are those whose paid-up purchases topped the thousand mark; there would have been several others included, had they settled their accounts before the auditor's visit. 1.

Albuquerque, N.Mex 1,079.25 15. Bloomfield Hills, Mich 1,040.00 I am sure that each of you can appreciate that Katie McIntosh, Bookkeeper, would have a far easier task if every club, chapter, and person purchasing from Arrowcraft were to pay her bills promptly. Arrowcraft is a business and too, must meet its bills. When goods are sold, please pay promptly, or if not, return them for credit well within the time limit. It seems unfair that an incoming club Settlement School sales chair-man be faced with hold-over balances due. 1952-53 proved to be a big shipping season. Even with good imagination it is hard to think in terms of more than 800 skirts, over 300 stoles, 1900 seamless bags or Whig Rose doilies to the number of 6000. These examples attest the beauty of the designing by Tina McMorran, head of the Weaving department. The coming year, some of the articles will be available only "as long as they last" but new patterns will sup-plant the out-going ones. There are new cotton plaid fringed table mats in blues and browns to accompany cottage pottery: a new baby blanket; a new evening purse made so that no federal tax need be added; a new blue skirt; pillow covers, high-lighted with metallic threads; beautiful wide belts to which may be added a wooden buckle of walnut or cherry or maple; and bands for luggage racks, just to name a few. Assisting Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. McMorran in sales and weaving are Edna Cook, Ruby Watson, Nellie Cook and Susie Maples. Edna who has been with Arrowcraft six years divides her time between assisting Mrs. McMorran with the weavers and helping in the sales room. Ruby and Nellie are salesgirls while Susie, clad in one of our colorful cotton skirts, demonstrates at the loom, weaving the sparkling pillow tops. Mrs. Edna McCutchan is in charge of the branch shop in the lobby of the Mountain View Hotel. In addition to the returns in money from your sales, we are grateful for all the general contributions and for the effort and sacrifice which they represent. May we again call your attention to the policy which states that when a benefit is advertised in the name of the Settlement School, all amounts above expenses must go to our philanthropy. The fraternity lawyer also states that the fraternity may not sanction exemption from federal tax on admission tickets unless the money comes to the School. The Committee would refer you to the Chart of the Settlement School Income and Expense Dollars in your files and which may also be found in the1952 Information Arrow, page 62. (Correction: "Activities" should read "Actives.") The sample year shows an average income and outgo and why larger donations would he helpful. "School facility operation" requires 30% of every dollar received, "Instruction" amounts to 22%, the "Summer Workshop," 13%, "Additions to Reserve and Sinking Fund," 15%, which leaves a remaining 20% to provide for Replacements, Insurance, Repairs and Committee management expense. Over a period of some years, I have hoped to see a contribution from every single club and chapter but appreciation is no less sincere for all that has been given. An accolade goes to the St. Louis alumna club for again sending its annual thousand dollars, which it has done for many years. Another Epsilon province club, Kansas City, Mo. stands second with $700.00 to its credit. Our Grand Vice President must be very proud of her own club and of her province, too! The following clubs and chapters are on the honor roll this year, with contributions of one hundred fifty dollars or more (clubs) and sixty dollars or .more from the chapters. Clubs Chapters St. Louis, Mo. . .$1000.00 Missouri B $ 125.00 Kansas City, Mo. 700.00 Texas A 100.00 Milwaukee, Wis. 300.00 California I' 100.00 Cleveland-East 225.00 Louisiana A 85.00 Indianapolis, Ind. 210.00 Illinois El 75.00 Philadelphia, Pa. 200.00 Kansas B 75.00 Denver, Colo. ..... 200.00 Colorado A 75.00 N. New jersey .... 175.00 Nebraska B 68.59 Houston, Tex 150.00 Wisconsin I' 65.00 Missouri A 60.00 Twelve other clubs were in the $100. bracket and eight other chapters gave between $50. and $60.00. From the Magazine Agency profits this year our treasury received $7,532.10. This amount could be greatly augmented if every club inspired every member to subscribe for at least one magazine through the fraternity agency, and every chapter member sent one subscription to her family as a gift. Shall we consider our work in Gatlinburg finished and seek some other type of philanthorpy? Think first of the place we hold in the fraternity world, for our educational service to those outside Pi Beta Phi. Would you withdraw the benefits of our Health program relieving the over-taxed doctors of school inspections, inoculations and consultations on minor difficulties or accidents, the pre-natal advice and care given to new mothers, or First Aid to the school children, week after week? The program of sanitation, disease prevention and health preservation would have a tremendous set-back. The Workshop program is well launched and has a large future as it is expanded; many students returning to their many states carry a wide-spread message of the fraternity's influence not only on the handicrafts of the southern mountains but on every helpful and healthful objective of that vicinity. No money donated to us is spent other than on the Settlement School program and the withdrawal of these funds would have the wrong economic effect upon the community. Should we sacrifice the service we give our weavers and lose prestige as we display and sell the beautiful articles made for Arrowcraft and distributed all over the United States? It does not necessarily follow that we shall always have direct obligations in secondary education for the Gatlinburg school system, but when one goes to Gatlinburg and talks with the pioneers, the older established residents or the doctors rather than. the newcomers in business, eager for the tourist trade but 44 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW with less knowledge of the long development of the area, one knows that Pi Beta Phi is needed and appreciated. The future program will change, adjust itself to new conditions, but we could ill afford to discontinue our interests. With the majority of fraternity members believing in the School and our efforts there, we must continue our support to the best of our ability. This past month I heard an address by the president of one of our western colleges in which he referred to the sequence which sometimes occurs in the treatment of a worth-while activity: "First, we Choose it; Then we Use it; And then, if we Abuse it, It follows that we Lose it." CHOOSE USE ABUSE LOSE ! I earnestly hope this sequence will not obtain in our Settlement School, on account of the few rumblings heard, to the effect that our project has served its purpose. It is always wonderful to discover how many fine and able Pi Phis there are. In no place is this more quickly demonstrated than in service on the Settlement School Committee. The duties are many and the time for action, short. I have ever been appreciative of the Committee's assistance but particularly duringthe past two years when the burdens have been doubly heavy. Each member has responded hand. sorely to the extra calls for help. At this summer's meeting, Louise W. Nobler, Washington Beta, former Lambda Province Vice President of Everett, Washington was "pledged" to the Committee. She will serve as . Public Relations members and will edit "News of Little Pigeon" in the ARROW. Virginia Brackett Green, Indiana Gamma, former Delta Province Vice President, assumes the duties of the Chairman. This report concludes twenty two years and more of close official contact with the fraternity and I would register my gratitude for the privilege of this service. During this time the Settlement School has become very real and very dear to me. For my successor I can only wish the same heart-warming associations and in-creased opportunities for service in Pi Beta Phi. The Grand Council, all officers, the Staff and the Commit-tee members have ever been ready to show their cooperation and their commendation. I wish also to express my gratitude to the alum= clubs, active chapters and individual Pi Phis who, by their encouragement and their continued support have made possible the maintenance of our philanthropy. RUTH BARRETT SMITH REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1953 A pebble dropped into still water produces an ever-widening circle of ripples. In much the same way the first Settlement School workers introduced new ideas in education, sanitation, industry, and ways of living that have enlarged and grown with the years, ever spreading and enlarging that influence. Workers may come and go, Committee membership change, the economy of the village undergo startling transformations, but the idea of service to the mountain people remains the same as when this Memorial to our Founders was started forty-one years ago. Community Building of all sorts of tourist courts, shops and restaurants has been almost continuous throughout the year with little slowdown during the winter months. The Riverside Hotel had its "face lifted," and now has an exterior something like Mount Vernon. The Mountain View built new shuffleboard courts on the corner adjoining our property and changed the swampy ground across the street by draining it and making the river channel deeper before filling in the ground. A new Catholic church is being built in the Airport field, and we are at last to have a new building for the Post Office. Bruce Whaley is building a two-story stone and frame structure to house the Post Office and a craft shop on the first floor, with offices and apartments on the upper floor. The American Legion paid off the indebtedness on its property and is now working towards funds for a building. All these physical changes caused one newspaper reporter to refer to the town as "a Miami Beach without an ocean front, an Atlantic City without a beauty pageant, or a Colorado Springs without 16,000-foot mountains." He also added that 95 per cent of the business enterprises, from taxi service to hotels, is owned by natives of the area and that just a few miles from town you will still find the old time way of life being lived in cabin homes. The local people are much engrossed with all this business during the touristseason, but later in the year find time to meet socially and to work for worthy causes. Union church services were held on special occasions. The Thanksgiving service was held in the Baptist church with the new Methodist minister, Reverend Spurgeon McCartt, preaching the sermon. There was a service outside by the community Christmas tree when the lights were turned on, and at Easter there was the usual sunrise service on the Greystone lawn. Girl Scouting in the village is being carried on by an enthusiastic group of young mothers and others. Over 100 girls are participating in the program. The local leaders were hostesses to a one-day Area Workshop for Leaders held at the Assembly Grounds in October. National Girl Scout week was observed with an Open House at the New Gatlinburg Inn recreation room, and the Court of Awards was held one Sunday afternoon in the basement of the Baptist church. One troop of Boy Scouts is quite active, but the lack of leaders hinders a wider participation in that program. All of the local children were guests of the American Legion at their annual Christmas party held at the Cherokee Theater. This is a gay occasion with candy, gifts, and fun for all. The children who were not too fortunate were remembered well by local people, especially by the Santa who delivers gifts in costume and works hard for several months at the projects. He is Mr. Byron Herbold, a local chef. He and his wife have no children, but they spend hours working for the poor and needy. At Easter, the churches sponsored an egg hunt for all children on the Whittle lawn. The local Garden Club again had an outstanding show of Christmas greens and arrangements at the December meeting. The lobby of the Mountain View was filled with the different entries. Here again the children were included. Miss Smith worked with her art classes, Miss Freshour with the home economics classes, and the Girl Scout troops all brought interesting items for the show. Fund-raising for the Polio Fund by having a big party at one of the hotels has THE SEPTEMBER ARROW been an annual practice. The one this year was held at the Greystone Playhouse and was most successful. The receipts were $1,800.00 from the party and the polio candles that had been placed around town in different business places. It was fun to have Marianne Wild, Olivia Moore and Ruth Smith as our guests at the affair and to help eat the cake that Marianne won on a chance. Another benefit party was the one given by the \X''omen's Auxiliary of the Episcopal Guild. This netted them $335.00. A drive for the Red Cross and one for the benefit of the village library were carried on and were fairly successful. The young girls from our house had a good time when they helped serve as hostesses at the Fox Hunters Ball. That association met in Sevier County for their 59th Annual Field Trials during November, with the social affairs being held in Gatlinburg. October was a beautiful month with the exception of many forest fires in the surrounding mountains. We had none in the Park area, but did have overcast skies and were worried about the lack of rain and the constant threat of real danger, should a big fire get started. The weather was not so favorable when the third annual Wildflower Pilgrmage was held in the spring. It was rainy, but that did not seem to dampen the enthusiasm of the people who came from many places to study the flowers in the Park. Another spring event was the Horse Show, sponsored by the local Lions Club. It was something new to Gatlinburg. I do not think the Club made any money and they certainly worked hard putting on the affair, but it did prove interesting to tourists and locals alike. Changes in Staff and Physical Plant Perhaps of more interest than community affairs have been the changes in our own staff: Joan New-comer, Kansas Beta, came last July to take Lillian's place as my assistant. She has fitted into our life beatitifully and besides doing an efficient job at the school has contributed to community activities through her Girl Scout troop and work with the choir and the youth program at the Methodist church. She has been in demand as an entertainer, giving willingly of her talents. Another new staff member is Katie Mc-Intosh, Alabama Beta, who came to us right from college to help as bookkeeper at the Arrowcraft Shop. Katie was a music major and plays the organ at the Episcopal church and directs the choir, besides helping Mrs. Armstrong with the music program at the school. Ethel Snow resigned and left the school in December. It seemed strange without her, for she had been such a part of the school life in Gatlinburg for many years that her loyalty and talents were almost taken for granted. In February Mrs. Marion Mueller, Indiana Gamma, came to take over the Shop. She has proved to be very efficient, and in the few months she has been here has the situation well in hand. The Fraternity can be proud of its new representatives at the Settlement School. The year has marked many improvements in buildings. Stuart, Pollard, and Teachers Cottages, and the Health Center have all been painted. The barn was given a fresh coat of red paint, and the dormitory boys did the same for the brooder houses. Most important was the completion of the new Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House, the car port, and the setting for the house. A fieldstone retaining wall with the lichens carefully placed on the front side, a rustic bridge across the drainage ditch, slate sidewalks resembling stepping stones, a new lawn sloping gently down to the path across the field, and plantings around the house have taken hours of time and effort. There is still much to be done, butthe essential things have been taken care of. '1 house is lovely and those of us who are privileged live in it are more than grateful to everyone who made the dream of a new staff house a reality. School The year started out well, with a complete fact] and an enrollment of 510, 32 more girls than be Due to several causes, before the year ended a numl of changes in the faculty had been made. The F ternity enriched the curriculum and helped to m the school an accredited one by providing seve teachers. Mr. Chan Huskey served his first year teacher of physical education and coached the bask ball teams very well. Mrs. Aletha Armstrong ag taught the music classes and worked with cho groups, Ann Smith had the work in arts and cra. and Mr. Carl Huskey taught the high school bi woodworking. Marjorie looked after the health of student body with their daily first aid requests, and the spring had a fulltime job when we had our sh of epidemics of measles, mumps, chicken pox, whooping cough. In addition to these regular si members we were happy in that the two young Phis working at their own jobs were able to c tribute so much to the school program. Joni used talents in various ways and Katie accompanied Mrs. Armstrong. The usual events followed each ot in the general pattern of all schools. The gay cola leaves decorating the grade school blackboards g way to Pilgrams, turkeys, and pumpkins, and then jolly Santas and Christmas trees. There was no school carnival at Halloween, but the first six gra had a colorful costume parade with prizes for different classes. Football suits were laid aside al a fairly successful season, and basketball became favorite sport. "Strictly Formal" was the junior ci play given in the fall. Miss Margretta Craig, a r English teacher, was the class sponsor and direc the play. It was fun, especially for us, for -two the dormitory girls had parts. There was the us two-day vacation at Thanksgiving and two we for Christmas. December was such a short sch month with many things crowded into the days. the rooms had parties with the mother furnishing freshments. Pi Phi chapters and alumnae clubs r vided an orange for every child in school, and tl~. were individual gifts for the children in the first f grades. The older grades received nice books for ti room libraries, and one grade got the athletic eqt ment that the Cleveland Alumnae Club always ser We always have charming Christmas programs, bi thought Mrs. Armtrong quite outdid herself on one last year. It was in the nature of a Nativity of ancient Christmas songs and carols called Coming of the Prince of Peace." The children sani sweetly and the staging was specially good. Every helped make it a success: Ann, Arlie, Neal, and all grade school teachers. Katie's accompaniment lovely. January and February were busy months, the high school students having semester exam. Lions. Valentine parties in all the elementary grg gave color and happiness to those children. ' seniors sponsored a big party for the high sci students proving that red hearts and cupids can ti even a high school boy. By March several epider were causing much absenteeism in the school teacher had to miss over three weeks with a case of whooping .cough, and another one had emergency operation. Mr. Jack Miller resigned, 1 ing another vacancy. The problem was solved by use of student teachers from the University of 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nessee. Mr. Lewelling was shifted to Mr. Miller's commercial classes and the student teachers took over the other work. A group of fourteen were assigned to Gatlinburg for their work in practice teaching. It would have been hard to finish' the year without their help. The senior class play, "A Broom for the Bride," was well cast and well given. The home economics teacher, Miss Carolyn Freshour, was one of the class sponsors and directed the play. Another project of the seniors was the school annual. I doubt if this book would ever have gone to press if Joni had not come to the rescue with her knowledge of journal-ism and helped them meet the deadline. Dorothy Manley worked up a small operetta for the third grade students called "The Magic Word." A more ambitious operetta was the annual one given by Mrs. Armstrong. She had many discouragements for so many of the children were out of school on ac-count of illness, Katie got sick, and at the last minute, Mr. Armstrong had a heart attack! Joni came to the rescue again, playing the difficult score, and the play went on. The twenty-one seniors finished their school days with a trip to Washington, D.C. They had been well-instructed as to what they were to see, and I think got a great deal out of the experience. They returned to final examinations and Commencement activities. The Baccalaureate service was held in the Methodist church with Reverend McCartt preaching the sermon. The high school chorus, under Mrs. Armstrong's direction, provided the music. Class night was held in the High School auditorium. It was a clever little program written and directed by Joni, called "Graduation Choo Choo." The Commencement exercises were held in the Baptist church. Dean I. N. Carr from Carson Newman College gave the address. He is from a family that came from this area and he went to our school as a child. At a dinner I gave preceding the * program, he spoke of the changes in the community, and again during his talk he spoke of that and of the work done by the Fraternity during the years. During the summer of 1952, three of our teachers completed work on their Bachelor's degrees. This helped give Gatlinburg a very good rating in their instructional staff in a county where there are still many permit teachers. Next year, Mr. Dewy Large will replace Mr. Walter Ogle as principal. He has a master's de.7,ree in school administration and has many plans for improving the school. We have a new County Superintendent of Schools, Mr. Roy Ledwell, who was long connected with Sevier County High School. Mr. Charlie Clabo replaced Mr. Fred Ingle on the Board of Education, and we are to have a new janitor. With the County and the Fraternity working together, we will be able to have a better school than we had last year if all the plans work out. P.T.A. The school lunch program was again sponsored by this organization. Mrs. Morrell gave efficient service and the children were well fed. More free lunches had to be provided than in the past several years. Of all the money-making projects, rummage sales are one of the favorite P.T.A. methods. These sales are held in the school music room, always on the day the Pi Phi weavers receive their monthly checks. The sales usually bring in about an average of $120.00. One sale helped buy new suits for the girls' basketball team, another helped pay for the gray cyclorama curtains for the stage, and a third was used for lockers in the hall. The really big project was the second Minstrel Show. This was written and directed by alocal man, Harry M. Bird. He has had experience with such shows before and really put on a grand entertainment. The goal was a new piano for the assembly room towards which the county Board had promised 8300.00. Enough was realized to buy the piano and to have a "dolly" made for it so it can be moved into a safe place when the gym is used for basketball games. Some good programs were given at the monthly meetings with good average attendance and interest in the work of the organization in its efforts to help both the parents and the school. Dormitory Twelve dormitory students lived at the school during the year. Of the eight girls, one was Martha Houser, Mary's senior daughter, three were juniors, and the other five were second year students. Joni chaperoned the girls, and the four boys were under Mr. Lewelling's care. Two boys were sophomores and the other two were freshmen. All of the girls and boys, with possibly one exception, were good students and very capably executed their work assignments. We again had trouble finding a cook except for the winter months when our good Leona was free from her restaurant job. The rest of the time we had some help from others, but mostly it was Miss Hodgen who fed the family. The girls were good help, but the whole situation was not fair, although seemingly unavoidable. Of course, the'move into the new house was the main event of the year. The management of the Greystone Hotel offered a crew of men for the job of moving the stoves, refrigerator, and heavy kitchen equipment. They came one Saturday morning, and with the help of our regular men and the dormitory boys and girls, everything was installed and we had our first meal that night, December 6th. The boys moved out of Pollard into the rooms vacated at Teachers Cottage by the staff moving into the new house, and that old house was closed until time for Workshop students to occupy it. The first social affair in the new house was the Open House honoring Ethel Snow on December 15th. It was a nasty, cold day, but we had many guests. Among these were several of the weavers, all of whom had been sent a special invitation, and a party of friends from the University who had helped plan certain things about the house. It is a lovely place in which to entertain large groups, and that day the holiday decorations made the setting especially effective. Our local alumnie presided at the punch bowl. Since then we have entertained a number of times. We held an open house for the members of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild during their spring meeting, and a coffee party for the student teachers and our regular teachers and staff. One group from the Council of Southern Mountain Workers met in the lounge for two meetings. Miss Hodgen entertained the Methodist ladies one afternoon, and the ladies from the Episcopal church met with Tina and Katie another afternoon. Marjorie had her bridge club for a dessert luncheon, and one evening another club met with her. We have entertained at several dinner parties the local ministers and their families and other friends. There were two Christmas parties at Stuart, one for the dormitory students, and one for Joni's Scout troop. Mrs. Henry has again used the living room and piano at Stuart for her music pupils and since she lives in Pigeon Forge is most appreciative of the privilege. Health Center Gatlinburg without a Health Center and a Pi Phi nurse ! I imagine the community would regard such a THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 47 situation as a real calamity, for from the time the local babies are brought to the Health Center to be weighed and given their first inoculations, through pre-school examinations and their school years until perhaps they have children of their own, the Health Center with our nurse, kindly Marjorie Chalmers, has been considered a haven. The small pebble dropped by the first nurse, Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario Alpha, thirty-three years ago, started ripples that are still expanding in the area. Different clinics are held at the Health Center during the year. These include the one for pre-school children entering the first grade, and about two yearly visits from the state mobile X-Ray unit. Marjorie's Friday afternoon clinic hours bring many young mothers for counsel and advice. During the school year, she is kept busy looking after the health needs of the 500 children in our school and in making visits to three rural schools, giving nursing service to the childen enrolled there. In the field of community work, she worked with the county polio unit and was chosen to attend a study course in atomic nursing that was given at Nashville. Two of the meetings of the health division of the Council of Southern Mountain Workers were held at the Health Center. The members admired greatly our modern building and equipment. We acknowledged with gratitude the gifts sent especially for the health pro-gram. Sigma Phi Gamma International Sorority gives us money through the Council of Southern Mountain Workers to be used for eye and dental corrections. Through the kindness of a Maryville oculist and a local dentist, this money stretches over a number of needy cases. A Christmas gift of fifteen dollars from the Portland Alumni Club was added to this fund. Chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma are assigned to help us and gifts of small items useful to the nurse and even money come from time to time. In our own membership there are individuals and alumnm clubs that send layettes, something that we have never had a surplus of since I have been here. Farm Our farmer has suffered the usual vicissitudes due to the weather either too much or too little rainfall. Wet weather was responsible for the need of a string of tile to drain the side garden into the spring, and the dry weather ruined some of the garden crops. Some seeds lay dormant and never did come up, while other vegetables died from lack of water. We have had quite a few things for the table, but not much of the sweet corn we are all so fond of. Richard has helped Arlie and Neal with the work of getting the new lawn seeded and in shape. For clays the dormitory boys spent their working hours picking up the rocks that had been left by the graders. We had especially good luck with the baby chicks and have had good egg production all year. Arroweraf! The year has been a busy one with many changes. New faces in management and sales staff have made no radical change in the operation of the shop. We are getting used to having Marion Mueller in Ethel's place, Katie at Mrs. Cole's desk, and two new sales-girls in charge of selling our lovely merchandise to the tourists. Ethel had to set up the Convention Shop, which is always a task. Those of you who were at the Shamrock will remember we had an especially fine display, Fall shipping was very heavy with no let-up until just before Christmas. Business has been good at both of the shops. Tourists are always interested in seeing a loom in operation, so we have hadone set up in the front salesroom with a weaver demonstrating on it. Irene Wilson wove the drapery material that Tina designed for the lounge and hall of our new Staff House on that loom, and at present Susie Maples makes the shuttle fly. Last summer, Tina was given leave of absence to attend a six weeks workshop at the Inter-Mountain Indian School in Utah where she worked under the famous Dorothy Liebes. She and Irene demonstrated at the Crafts-man's Fair in Asheville last July. Edna helped sell our products in the booth that we shared with the McDonalds (pottery), Marian Heard and Jane Glass (jewelry), and Mr. Ronald Slayton (wood products), formerly with the University of Tennessee. Arrowcraft weavings were exhibited at the Cherokee Indian Fair and were entered at the Fall Craft Show held at the University of Tennessee. In recognition of the weavers who have worked continuously for Pi Phi for many years, Marion Mueller and Tina arranged a party which was held at the Staff House. Seven weavers with a record of twenty-five years of service to Arrow-craft were the honored guests. Each was given a Stuart Nye pin suitably engraved on the back. All enjoyed the visiting and there was much recalling of old times. They sang some old harp songs before we had refreshments. These consisted of punch and a cake beautifully decorated with an arrow. Everyone regretted that Ethel Snow was not present, for she knew all the weavers. It would have been nice if our former weaving designer, Jene Redding, could have been there, for she had started many of this group weaving "for the school." Jene had seen many of them earlier in the spring when she was our guest for a few days. She was invited to give a talk at the spring meeting of the Southern Highland 'Handicraft Guild held at the Greystone Hotel, coming down from Boston where she now operates her own weaving service. Summer Activities Pi Phi Visitors and Staff House Dedication Our official Pi Phi family held meetings in town during the summer. Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and then the Province Officers arrived. We were delighted to have them here. Committee arranged for a lovely dinner, a tour of the grounds with meetings with the local resident staff and several of the teachers hired by the Fraternity, a visit to Arrowcraft and for them to be present at the formal dedication of the staff house. This was a simple ceremony held in the lounge with local Pi Phi alum-rue and friends of the school also in attendance. To all of us the highlight was when the building was dedicated and named the "Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House." No name could have been more fitting nor an honor more deserved. As Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Ruth Smith, had worked untiringly for this house; from the time that the site and architect were selected until the building stood, completed. She was aided by her husband, Warren T. Smith, a builder of experience, who flew from Oregon at his own expense to help with the many complicated details involved in letting the contract for the house. His advice was invaluable and saved the Fraternity hundreds of dollars. We regretted that he could not have been present at the ceremony to hear the tributes paid to Ruth and her modest speech of acceptance of the honor. The name plaque of wrought iron which is in place by the front door reminds us all of the unselfish service of a person who leaves the Committee this year. I think that everyone present at the dedication was impressed with Pi Phis close bonds of 48 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW friendship, tangibly expressed in a beautiful building which will add to the effectiveness of the work done at the Settlement School. In 1952, summer schools at most universities and colleges showed a decrease in the number of registrations. This was also true of our Craft Workshop, but the group was an enthusiastic and talented one. Even a person with only a slight knowledge of good crafts, when attending one of the open house exhibits, could realize that the work turned out was superior in design and quality of workmanship. Courses were offered in Weaving, Metal, Jewelry, Pottery, and Wood Working. Interesting trips to other craft centers, such as those in Asheville, Cherokee, and Brasstown, North Carolina, were a part of the pro-gram. The group enjoyed several picnics in the mountains. We always make so many new friends among the students that it is with real regret we see the sessions end. The Gateway Stock Company again rented the school auditorium for the season. Mr. John Richards brings down from New York a groupof talented young actors who appear in five different plays during the season. Space does not permit my listing the gifts that have come to the school during the year. The special Pi Phi shelf in the high school library holds many lovely new volumes given as memorials. We have received money for speech records for the English classes and musical recordings for the music department. Christmas gifts for the children were many and varied. We again sent individual gifts to the students in three rural schools, remembered the lower grades in our school; and there were special gifts and clothing for the dormitory students from the Terre Haute Alum= Club. These gifts came from all over the United States and from Honolulu. They are typical representations of the affectionate interest held by our large membership for the Settlement School. We express gratitude for these gifts, for the unselfish devotion of the members of the Settlement School Committee, and for our loyal local employees. Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER, Director Great Potential for Character Building Pointing out how the fraternity may become an educational institution of great significance, Dr. Thomas A. Brady, Vice President of the University of Missouri, has listed these propositions as basic: "1. The educational institution should be concerned not only with formal instruction but with the building of character and the social integration of the individual as well. "2. Formal instruction alone, being entirely verbal and visual, can impart truths and correct principles but will not serve as a substitute for daily experience in molding the individual. "3. The experience most effective in molding the character of the student is that which he receives in daily contact with others of his own age." Dr. Brady's argument for the fraternity, then, requires one further step. "This would be the contention that, granted the importance of experience with students his own age, the greatest achievement in the building character may be made if (a) the association is voluntary, and (b) if the students themselves, under proper guidance have as large a voice as possible in managing and directing the organization which makes the corporate life possible." Dr. Brady's views were expressed in an address at the 29th biennial convention of Phi Kappa, a general fraternity for Catholic men. From "Quiet Please" in Fraternity Month Earl F. Schoening, Secretary-Treasurer of Phi Sigma Kappa, had this to say, "A fraternity should be what it was fundamentally designed to be: a social organization to make for a more congenial and a more pleasant college life than could otherwise be had; a richer undergraduate experience because in carrying on the work of the social organization, officers and members acquire lessons which stand them in good stead after college. They can learn something of leadership and financial management. I feel strongly that fraternity membership is an asset to any man in after-college life whether he admits it or not."

For all but two of the six, visiting the memorial to our Founders was a new thrill and they were inspired and impressed, not only with the beauty of the house but with the feeling that it is a vital living center of social activity in Monmouth. Mrs. Mabel Johnson who came to Holt House in December of 1950 is gracious and charming and rep-resents the Fraternity well. The committee enjoyed her hospitality while in Monmouth and left with the assurance that she is taking care and the pride in the house as she would her own home. She has welcomed visitors from many states. During the year 1952-53, Sept. to June, Holt House was used sixty-nine times as a meeting place or as a setting for private entertaining. Illinois Alpha and the Monmouth Alumna Club enjoyed the use of it for initiation and for Founders' Day and for two or three rush parties. Two clubs from neighboring towns held meetings there. Three groups in Monmouth rent the house for their monthly meetings and others use it two or three times a year. The Monmouth PEO meets at the house monthly as does the Women's Club of Monmouth, also the Arrow Mothers' Club. Not counting the times the house was used by Pi Phi groups or by regular renters, the house accommodated, on nine-teen occasions, private parties of varied nature, wed-ding receptions, rehearsal dinners, showers, bridge parties and teas. Other groups using the house this year are: New Century Club, DAR, Fortnightly Club, OGM and the Hospital Auxiliary, and three sororities. Holt House is indeed a charming home in which to entertain. Because Monmouth College is celebrating its Centennial this year, the house was offered to the college to be used for any function during Commencement Week or any time during the spring. In thanking the committee chairman for the offer, Dr. Gibson, President of Monmouth College, wrote, "We do appreciate the variety of ways in which Holt House not only serves our college but serves the community. We are indebted to Pi Phi for a great many things, and we are proud of the current group of girls on our campus as well as the fine alumnae chapter in our community." The first gift to be received after the Houston Convention was an I.C. pin sent by Vera Wattles Kirkpatrick, Nebraska Beta, of Corpus Christi, Texas. The pin was given to her years ago by an aunt, Carrie Wattles Swinder, initiated into Iowa Gamma in 1883, who died November 5, 1945. The pin is lovely and has been placed in the shadow box which we are now using for old pins. Last fall Mr. Earl Bridge of Detroit sent to Holt House a large, beautiful silver tray that had belonged to his wife, Evelyn Holliday Bridge, who died last spring. She was a former Monmouth resident and was on the Holt House Committee at the time of her death. The tray has been appropriately engraved and is being used at many teas and parties given at the house. A group of Detroit and Dearborn Pi Phis recently sent a check for $50.00 to be used at the discretion of the Holt House Committee to purchase a needed and worth-while memorial to Evelyn Bridge who, the letter. states, "was one of the outstanding and diligent workers in our club and in COMMITTEE lieu of flowers at the time of her death this fund was started." It is hoped that other groups will choose to follow this kind of a memorial for their deceased friends. Washington Alpha has sent a beautiful blue and white quilt; the Arrow and Chain appears in four places, the names of the founders living at the time the quilt was made, are embroidered, and in the center block "Grace Coolidge, Vermont Alpha." Special gifts to Holt House include $25.00 from the Milwaukee Club, $25.00 from the Kansas City Missouri Club, and $9.15 from the Joliet, Illinois Club to be used for a dozen silver spoons. These gifts are in addition to the annual donations sent by these clubs. The Committee is most appreciative of the financial support accorded the house by the many contributing chapters and alumna clubs. Total contributions were somewht below those of the preceding year however, and total expenditures were slightly higher. The number of contributing alumni clubs decreased from 213 to 199 for this year. Active chapter contributors decreased from 89 to 81. Total contributions are $349.70 less than last year. The only province to reach 100% this year is Delta which has reached this goal for several years. The clubs in Theta Province reached 100% as did the chapters in Epsilon, Kappa, Lambda and Zeta Provinces. The highest contributors were: $50.00-California Louisiana A Kansas City, Mo. Club $35.00-Oklahoma A $34.00 Akron, Ohio Club $30.00 Tennessee B $25.00-Kansas B Texas B Monmouth, Ill. Club North Shore, Ill. Club Pittsburgh, Pa. Club Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, with Eta Province second, the same as last year. Next in place came Beta Province, then Mu and in fifth place, Epsilon Province. The committee found the furnishings most complete, however some repairs and replacements were necessary. A sidewalk from the rear door to the drive-way and a loading platform there, were installed. A casing around the furnace was replaced, the furnace cleaned, and the humidifier was re-conditioned. The piano was tuned, and one string was replaced. This summer a rug for the Pine Room must be purchased, and the two Holt House films repaired or replaced. The Holt House Chairman is grateful for the continued cooperation of the committee members. The Treasurer, Torrance Etheridge, has been most efficient and thorough in the handling of Holt House funds and has been very prompt in her reports; her annual report is most complete. Marion Tyte has served as secretary of the committee, taking minutes of our Monmouth conference, and typing and mailing copies to committee members and to the Grand President and Grand Vice-President. Gertrude Leetz has kept up the house inventory that was so well-compiled by Mrs. McMurray of Peoria. Louise Campbell, the Monmouth member of the committee has had complete charge of the 57

        44 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW with less knowledge of the long development of the area, one knows that Pi Beta Phi is needed and appreciated. The future program will change, adjust itself to new conditions, but we could ill afford to discontinue our interests. With the majority of fraternity members believing in the School and our efforts there, we must continue our support to the best of our ability. This past month I heard an address by the president of one of our western colleges in which he referred to the sequence which sometimes occurs in the treatment of a worth-while activity: "First, we Choose it; Then we Use it; And then, if we Abuse it, It follows that we Lose it." CHOOSE USE ABUSE LOSE ! I earnestly hope this sequence will not obtain in our Settlement School, on account of the few rumblings heard, to the effect that our project has served its purpose. It is always wonderful to discover how many fine and able Pi Phis there are. In no place is this more quickly demonstrated than in service on the Settlement School Committee. The duties are many and the time for action, short. I have ever been appreciative of the Committee's assistance but particularly duringthe past two years when the burdens have been doubly heavy. Each member has responded hand. sorely to the extra calls for help. At this summer's meeting, Louise W. Nobler, Washington Beta, former Lambda Province Vice President of Everett, Washington was "pledged" to the Committee. She will serve as . Public Relations members and will edit "News of Little Pigeon" in the ARROW. Virginia Brackett Green, Indiana Gamma, former Delta Province Vice President, assumes the duties of the Chairman. This report concludes twenty two years and more of close official contact with the fraternity and I would register my gratitude for the privilege of this service. During this time the Settlement School has become very real and very dear to me. For my successor I can only wish the same heart-warming associations and in-creased opportunities for service in Pi Beta Phi. The Grand Council, all officers, the Staff and the Commit-tee members have ever been ready to show their cooperation and their commendation. I wish also to express my gratitude to the alum= clubs, active chapters and individual Pi Phis who, by their encouragement and their continued support have made possible the maintenance of our philanthropy. RUTH BARRETT SMITH REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1953 A pebble dropped into still water produces an ever-widening circle of ripples. In much the same way the first Settlement School workers introduced new ideas in education, sanitation, industry, and ways of living that have enlarged and grown with the years, ever spreading and enlarging that influence. Workers may come and go, Committee membership change, the economy of the village undergo startling transformations, but the idea of service to the mountain people remains the same as when this Memorial to our Founders was started forty-one years ago. Community Building of all sorts of tourist courts, shops and restaurants has been almost continuous throughout the year with little slowdown during the winter months. The Riverside Hotel had its "face lifted," and now has an exterior something like Mount Vernon. The Mountain View built new shuffleboard courts on the corner adjoining our property and changed the swampy ground across the street by draining it and making the river channel deeper before filling in the ground. A new Catholic church is being built in the Airport field, and we are at last to have a new building for the Post Office. Bruce Whaley is building a two-story stone and frame structure to house the Post Office and a craft shop on the first floor, with offices and apartments on the upper floor. The American Legion paid off the indebtedness on its property and is now working towards funds for a building. All these physical changes caused one newspaper reporter to refer to the town as "a Miami Beach without an ocean front, an Atlantic City without a beauty pageant, or a Colorado Springs without 16,000-foot mountains." He also added that 95 per cent of the business enterprises, from taxi service to hotels, is owned by natives of the area and that just a few miles from town you will still find the old time way of life being lived in cabin homes. The local people are much engrossed with all this business during the touristseason, but later in the year find time to meet socially and to work for worthy causes. Union church services were held on special occasions. The Thanksgiving service was held in the Baptist church with the new Methodist minister, Reverend Spurgeon McCartt, preaching the sermon. There was a service outside by the community Christmas tree when the lights were turned on, and at Easter there was the usual sunrise service on the Greystone lawn. Girl Scouting in the village is being carried on by an enthusiastic group of young mothers and others. Over 100 girls are participating in the program. The local leaders were hostesses to a one-day Area Workshop for Leaders held at the Assembly Grounds in October. National Girl Scout week was observed with an Open House at the New Gatlinburg Inn recreation room, and the Court of Awards was held one Sunday afternoon in the basement of the Baptist church. One troop of Boy Scouts is quite active, but the lack of leaders hinders a wider participation in that program. All of the local children were guests of the American Legion at their annual Christmas party held at the Cherokee Theater. This is a gay occasion with candy, gifts, and fun for all. The children who were not too fortunate were remembered well by local people, especially by the Santa who delivers gifts in costume and works hard for several months at the projects. He is Mr. Byron Herbold, a local chef. He and his wife have no children, but they spend hours working for the poor and needy. At Easter, the churches sponsored an egg hunt for all children on the Whittle lawn. The local Garden Club again had an outstanding show of Christmas greens and arrangements at the December meeting. The lobby of the Mountain View was filled with the different entries. Here again the children were included. Miss Smith worked with her art classes, Miss Freshour with the home economics classes, and the Girl Scout troops all brought interesting items for the show. Fund-raising for the Polio Fund by having a big party at one of the hotels has THE SEPTEMBER ARROW been an annual practice. The one this year was held at the Greystone Playhouse and was most successful. The receipts were $1,800.00 from the party and the polio candles that had been placed around town in different business places. It was fun to have Marianne Wild, Olivia Moore and Ruth Smith as our guests at the affair and to help eat the cake that Marianne won on a chance. Another benefit party was the one given by the \X''omen's Auxiliary of the Episcopal Guild. This netted them $335.00. A drive for the Red Cross and one for the benefit of the village library were carried on and were fairly successful. The young girls from our house had a good time when they helped serve as hostesses at the Fox Hunters Ball. That association met in Sevier County for their 59th Annual Field Trials during November, with the social affairs being held in Gatlinburg. October was a beautiful month with the exception of many forest fires in the surrounding mountains. We had none in the Park area, but did have overcast skies and were worried about the lack of rain and the constant threat of real danger, should a big fire get started. The weather was not so favorable when the third annual Wildflower Pilgrmage was held in the spring. It was rainy, but that did not seem to dampen the enthusiasm of the people who came from many places to study the flowers in the Park. Another spring event was the Horse Show, sponsored by the local Lions Club. It was something new to Gatlinburg. I do not think the Club made any money and they certainly worked hard putting on the affair, but it did prove interesting to tourists and locals alike. Changes in Staff and Physical Plant Perhaps of more interest than community affairs have been the changes in our own staff: Joan New-comer, Kansas Beta, came last July to take Lillian's place as my assistant. She has fitted into our life beatitifully and besides doing an efficient job at the school has contributed to community activities through her Girl Scout troop and work with the choir and the youth program at the Methodist church. She has been in demand as an entertainer, giving willingly of her talents. Another new staff member is Katie Mc-Intosh, Alabama Beta, who came to us right from college to help as bookkeeper at the Arrowcraft Shop. Katie was a music major and plays the organ at the Episcopal church and directs the choir, besides helping Mrs. Armstrong with the music program at the school. Ethel Snow resigned and left the school in December. It seemed strange without her, for she had been such a part of the school life in Gatlinburg for many years that her loyalty and talents were almost taken for granted. In February Mrs. Marion Mueller, Indiana Gamma, came to take over the Shop. She has proved to be very efficient, and in the few months she has been here has the situation well in hand. The Fraternity can be proud of its new representatives at the Settlement School. The year has marked many improvements in buildings. Stuart, Pollard, and Teachers Cottages, and the Health Center have all been painted. The barn was given a fresh coat of red paint, and the dormitory boys did the same for the brooder houses. Most important was the completion of the new Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House, the car port, and the setting for the house. A fieldstone retaining wall with the lichens carefully placed on the front side, a rustic bridge across the drainage ditch, slate sidewalks resembling stepping stones, a new lawn sloping gently down to the path across the field, and plantings around the house have taken hours of time and effort. There is still much to be done, butthe essential things have been taken care of. '1 house is lovely and those of us who are privileged live in it are more than grateful to everyone who made the dream of a new staff house a reality. School The year started out well, with a complete fact] and an enrollment of 510, 32 more girls than be Due to several causes, before the year ended a numl of changes in the faculty had been made. The F ternity enriched the curriculum and helped to m the school an accredited one by providing seve teachers. Mr. Chan Huskey served his first year teacher of physical education and coached the bask ball teams very well. Mrs. Aletha Armstrong ag taught the music classes and worked with cho groups, Ann Smith had the work in arts and cra. and Mr. Carl Huskey taught the high school bi woodworking. Marjorie looked after the health of student body with their daily first aid requests, and the spring had a fulltime job when we had our sh of epidemics of measles, mumps, chicken pox, whooping cough. In addition to these regular si members we were happy in that the two young Phis working at their own jobs were able to c tribute so much to the school program. Joni used talents in various ways and Katie accompanied Mrs. Armstrong. The usual events followed each ot in the general pattern of all schools. The gay cola leaves decorating the grade school blackboards g way to Pilgrams, turkeys, and pumpkins, and then jolly Santas and Christmas trees. There was no school carnival at Halloween, but the first six gra had a colorful costume parade with prizes for different classes. Football suits were laid aside al a fairly successful season, and basketball became favorite sport. "Strictly Formal" was the junior ci play given in the fall. Miss Margretta Craig, a r English teacher, was the class sponsor and direc the play. It was fun, especially for us, for -two the dormitory girls had parts. There was the us two-day vacation at Thanksgiving and two we for Christmas. December was such a short sch month with many things crowded into the days. the rooms had parties with the mother furnishing freshments. Pi Phi chapters and alumnae clubs r vided an orange for every child in school, and tl~. were individual gifts for the children in the first f grades. The older grades received nice books for ti room libraries, and one grade got the athletic eqt ment that the Cleveland Alumnae Club always ser We always have charming Christmas programs, bi thought Mrs. Armtrong quite outdid herself on one last year. It was in the nature of a Nativity of ancient Christmas songs and carols called Coming of the Prince of Peace." The children sani sweetly and the staging was specially good. Every helped make it a success: Ann, Arlie, Neal, and all grade school teachers. Katie's accompaniment lovely. January and February were busy months, the high school students having semester exam. Lions. Valentine parties in all the elementary grg gave color and happiness to those children. ' seniors sponsored a big party for the high sci students proving that red hearts and cupids can ti even a high school boy. By March several epider were causing much absenteeism in the school teacher had to miss over three weeks with a case of whooping .cough, and another one had emergency operation. Mr. Jack Miller resigned, 1 ing another vacancy. The problem was solved by use of student teachers from the University of 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nessee. Mr. Lewelling was shifted to Mr. Miller's commercial classes and the student teachers took over the other work. A group of fourteen were assigned to Gatlinburg for their work in practice teaching. It would have been hard to finish' the year without their help. The senior class play, "A Broom for the Bride," was well cast and well given. The home economics teacher, Miss Carolyn Freshour, was one of the class sponsors and directed the play. Another project of the seniors was the school annual. I doubt if this book would ever have gone to press if Joni had not come to the rescue with her knowledge of journal-ism and helped them meet the deadline. Dorothy Manley worked up a small operetta for the third grade students called "The Magic Word." A more ambitious operetta was the annual one given by Mrs. Armstrong. She had many discouragements for so many of the children were out of school on ac-count of illness, Katie got sick, and at the last minute, Mr. Armstrong had a heart attack! Joni came to the rescue again, playing the difficult score, and the play went on. The twenty-one seniors finished their school days with a trip to Washington, D.C. They had been well-instructed as to what they were to see, and I think got a great deal out of the experience. They returned to final examinations and Commencement activities. The Baccalaureate service was held in the Methodist church with Reverend McCartt preaching the sermon. The high school chorus, under Mrs. Armstrong's direction, provided the music. Class night was held in the High School auditorium. It was a clever little program written and directed by Joni, called "Graduation Choo Choo." The Commencement exercises were held in the Baptist church. Dean I. N. Carr from Carson Newman College gave the address. He is from a family that came from this area and he went to our school as a child. At a dinner I gave preceding the * program, he spoke of the changes in the community, and again during his talk he spoke of that and of the work done by the Fraternity during the years. During the summer of 1952, three of our teachers completed work on their Bachelor's degrees. This helped give Gatlinburg a very good rating in their instructional staff in a county where there are still many permit teachers. Next year, Mr. Dewy Large will replace Mr. Walter Ogle as principal. He has a master's de.7,ree in school administration and has many plans for improving the school. We have a new County Superintendent of Schools, Mr. Roy Ledwell, who was long connected with Sevier County High School. Mr. Charlie Clabo replaced Mr. Fred Ingle on the Board of Education, and we are to have a new janitor. With the County and the Fraternity working together, we will be able to have a better school than we had last year if all the plans work out. P.T.A. The school lunch program was again sponsored by this organization. Mrs. Morrell gave efficient service and the children were well fed. More free lunches had to be provided than in the past several years. Of all the money-making projects, rummage sales are one of the favorite P.T.A. methods. These sales are held in the school music room, always on the day the Pi Phi weavers receive their monthly checks. The sales usually bring in about an average of $120.00. One sale helped buy new suits for the girls' basketball team, another helped pay for the gray cyclorama curtains for the stage, and a third was used for lockers in the hall. The really big project was the second Minstrel Show. This was written and directed by alocal man, Harry M. Bird. He has had experience with such shows before and really put on a grand entertainment. The goal was a new piano for the assembly room towards which the county Board had promised 8300.00. Enough was realized to buy the piano and to have a "dolly" made for it so it can be moved into a safe place when the gym is used for basketball games. Some good programs were given at the monthly meetings with good average attendance and interest in the work of the organization in its efforts to help both the parents and the school. Dormitory Twelve dormitory students lived at the school during the year. Of the eight girls, one was Martha Houser, Mary's senior daughter, three were juniors, and the other five were second year students. Joni chaperoned the girls, and the four boys were under Mr. Lewelling's care. Two boys were sophomores and the other two were freshmen. All of the girls and boys, with possibly one exception, were good students and very capably executed their work assignments. We again had trouble finding a cook except for the winter months when our good Leona was free from her restaurant job. The rest of the time we had some help from others, but mostly it was Miss Hodgen who fed the family. The girls were good help, but the whole situation was not fair, although seemingly unavoidable. Of course, the'move into the new house was the main event of the year. The management of the Greystone Hotel offered a crew of men for the job of moving the stoves, refrigerator, and heavy kitchen equipment. They came one Saturday morning, and with the help of our regular men and the dormitory boys and girls, everything was installed and we had our first meal that night, December 6th. The boys moved out of Pollard into the rooms vacated at Teachers Cottage by the staff moving into the new house, and that old house was closed until time for Workshop students to occupy it. The first social affair in the new house was the Open House honoring Ethel Snow on December 15th. It was a nasty, cold day, but we had many guests. Among these were several of the weavers, all of whom had been sent a special invitation, and a party of friends from the University who had helped plan certain things about the house. It is a lovely place in which to entertain large groups, and that day the holiday decorations made the setting especially effective. Our local alumnie presided at the punch bowl. Since then we have entertained a number of times. We held an open house for the members of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild during their spring meeting, and a coffee party for the student teachers and our regular teachers and staff. One group from the Council of Southern Mountain Workers met in the lounge for two meetings. Miss Hodgen entertained the Methodist ladies one afternoon, and the ladies from the Episcopal church met with Tina and Katie another afternoon. Marjorie had her bridge club for a dessert luncheon, and one evening another club met with her. We have entertained at several dinner parties the local ministers and their families and other friends. There were two Christmas parties at Stuart, one for the dormitory students, and one for Joni's Scout troop. Mrs. Henry has again used the living room and piano at Stuart for her music pupils and since she lives in Pigeon Forge is most appreciative of the privilege. Health Center Gatlinburg without a Health Center and a Pi Phi nurse ! I imagine the community would regard such a THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 47 situation as a real calamity, for from the time the local babies are brought to the Health Center to be weighed and given their first inoculations, through pre-school examinations and their school years until perhaps they have children of their own, the Health Center with our nurse, kindly Marjorie Chalmers, has been considered a haven. The small pebble dropped by the first nurse, Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario Alpha, thirty-three years ago, started ripples that are still expanding in the area. Different clinics are held at the Health Center during the year. These include the one for pre-school children entering the first grade, and about two yearly visits from the state mobile X-Ray unit. Marjorie's Friday afternoon clinic hours bring many young mothers for counsel and advice. During the school year, she is kept busy looking after the health needs of the 500 children in our school and in making visits to three rural schools, giving nursing service to the childen enrolled there. In the field of community work, she worked with the county polio unit and was chosen to attend a study course in atomic nursing that was given at Nashville. Two of the meetings of the health division of the Council of Southern Mountain Workers were held at the Health Center. The members admired greatly our modern building and equipment. We acknowledged with gratitude the gifts sent especially for the health pro-gram. Sigma Phi Gamma International Sorority gives us money through the Council of Southern Mountain Workers to be used for eye and dental corrections. Through the kindness of a Maryville oculist and a local dentist, this money stretches over a number of needy cases. A Christmas gift of fifteen dollars from the Portland Alumni Club was added to this fund. Chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma are assigned to help us and gifts of small items useful to the nurse and even money come from time to time. In our own membership there are individuals and alumnm clubs that send layettes, something that we have never had a surplus of since I have been here. Farm Our farmer has suffered the usual vicissitudes due to the weather either too much or too little rainfall. Wet weather was responsible for the need of a string of tile to drain the side garden into the spring, and the dry weather ruined some of the garden crops. Some seeds lay dormant and never did come up, while other vegetables died from lack of water. We have had quite a few things for the table, but not much of the sweet corn we are all so fond of. Richard has helped Arlie and Neal with the work of getting the new lawn seeded and in shape. For clays the dormitory boys spent their working hours picking up the rocks that had been left by the graders. We had especially good luck with the baby chicks and have had good egg production all year. Arroweraf! The year has been a busy one with many changes. New faces in management and sales staff have made no radical change in the operation of the shop. We are getting used to having Marion Mueller in Ethel's place, Katie at Mrs. Cole's desk, and two new sales-girls in charge of selling our lovely merchandise to the tourists. Ethel had to set up the Convention Shop, which is always a task. Those of you who were at the Shamrock will remember we had an especially fine display, Fall shipping was very heavy with no let-up until just before Christmas. Business has been good at both of the shops. Tourists are always interested in seeing a loom in operation, so we have hadone set up in the front salesroom with a weaver demonstrating on it. Irene Wilson wove the drapery material that Tina designed for the lounge and hall of our new Staff House on that loom, and at present Susie Maples makes the shuttle fly. Last summer, Tina was given leave of absence to attend a six weeks workshop at the Inter-Mountain Indian School in Utah where she worked under the famous Dorothy Liebes. She and Irene demonstrated at the Crafts-man's Fair in Asheville last July. Edna helped sell our products in the booth that we shared with the McDonalds (pottery), Marian Heard and Jane Glass (jewelry), and Mr. Ronald Slayton (wood products), formerly with the University of Tennessee. Arrowcraft weavings were exhibited at the Cherokee Indian Fair and were entered at the Fall Craft Show held at the University of Tennessee. In recognition of the weavers who have worked continuously for Pi Phi for many years, Marion Mueller and Tina arranged a party which was held at the Staff House. Seven weavers with a record of twenty-five years of service to Arrow-craft were the honored guests. Each was given a Stuart Nye pin suitably engraved on the back. All enjoyed the visiting and there was much recalling of old times. They sang some old harp songs before we had refreshments. These consisted of punch and a cake beautifully decorated with an arrow. Everyone regretted that Ethel Snow was not present, for she knew all the weavers. It would have been nice if our former weaving designer, Jene Redding, could have been there, for she had started many of this group weaving "for the school." Jene had seen many of them earlier in the spring when she was our guest for a few days. She was invited to give a talk at the spring meeting of the Southern Highland 'Handicraft Guild held at the Greystone Hotel, coming down from Boston where she now operates her own weaving service. Summer Activities Pi Phi Visitors and Staff House Dedication Our official Pi Phi family held meetings in town during the summer. Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and then the Province Officers arrived. We were delighted to have them here. Committee arranged for a lovely dinner, a tour of the grounds with meetings with the local resident staff and several of the teachers hired by the Fraternity, a visit to Arrowcraft and for them to be present at the formal dedication of the staff house. This was a simple ceremony held in the lounge with local Pi Phi alum-rue and friends of the school also in attendance. To all of us the highlight was when the building was dedicated and named the "Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House." No name could have been more fitting nor an honor more deserved. As Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Ruth Smith, had worked untiringly for this house; from the time that the site and architect were selected until the building stood, completed. She was aided by her husband, Warren T. Smith, a builder of experience, who flew from Oregon at his own expense to help with the many complicated details involved in letting the contract for the house. His advice was invaluable and saved the Fraternity hundreds of dollars. We regretted that he could not have been present at the ceremony to hear the tributes paid to Ruth and her modest speech of acceptance of the honor. The name plaque of wrought iron which is in place by the front door reminds us all of the unselfish service of a person who leaves the Committee this year. I think that everyone present at the dedication was impressed with Pi Phis close bonds of 48 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW friendship, tangibly expressed in a beautiful building which will add to the effectiveness of the work done at the Settlement School. In 1952, summer schools at most universities and colleges showed a decrease in the number of registrations. This was also true of our Craft Workshop, but the group was an enthusiastic and talented one. Even a person with only a slight knowledge of good crafts, when attending one of the open house exhibits, could realize that the work turned out was superior in design and quality of workmanship. Courses were offered in Weaving, Metal, Jewelry, Pottery, and Wood Working. Interesting trips to other craft centers, such as those in Asheville, Cherokee, and Brasstown, North Carolina, were a part of the pro-gram. The group enjoyed several picnics in the mountains. We always make so many new friends among the students that it is with real regret we see the sessions end. The Gateway Stock Company again rented the school auditorium for the season. Mr. John Richards brings down from New York a groupof talented young actors who appear in five different plays during the season. Space does not permit my listing the gifts that have come to the school during the year. The special Pi Phi shelf in the high school library holds many lovely new volumes given as memorials. We have received money for speech records for the English classes and musical recordings for the music department. Christmas gifts for the children were many and varied. We again sent individual gifts to the students in three rural schools, remembered the lower grades in our school; and there were special gifts and clothing for the dormitory students from the Terre Haute Alum= Club. These gifts came from all over the United States and from Honolulu. They are typical representations of the affectionate interest held by our large membership for the Settlement School. We express gratitude for these gifts, for the unselfish devotion of the members of the Settlement School Committee, and for our loyal local employees. Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER, Director Great Potential for Character Building Pointing out how the fraternity may become an educational institution of great significance, Dr. Thomas A. Brady, Vice President of the University of Missouri, has listed these propositions as basic: "1. The educational institution should be concerned not only with formal instruction but with the building of character and the social integration of the individual as well. "2. Formal instruction alone, being entirely verbal and visual, can impart truths and correct principles but will not serve as a substitute for daily experience in molding the individual. "3. The experience most effective in molding the character of the student is that which he receives in daily contact with others of his own age." Dr. Brady's argument for the fraternity, then, requires one further step. "This would be the contention that, granted the importance of experience with students his own age, the greatest achievement in the building character may be made if (a) the association is voluntary, and (b) if the students themselves, under proper guidance have as large a voice as possible in managing and directing the organization which makes the corporate life possible." Dr. Brady's views were expressed in an address at the 29th biennial convention of Phi Kappa, a general fraternity for Catholic men. From "Quiet Please" in Fraternity Month Earl F. Schoening, Secretary-Treasurer of Phi Sigma Kappa, had this to say, "A fraternity should be what it was fundamentally designed to be: a social organization to make for a more congenial and a more pleasant college life than could otherwise be had; a richer undergraduate experience because in carrying on the work of the social organization, officers and members acquire lessons which stand them in good stead after college. They can learn something of leadership and financial management. I feel strongly that fraternity membership is an asset to any man in after-college life whether he admits it or not." THE SEPT.EMSER ARROW TREASURER OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Little Rock, Arkansas August 6, 1953 Mrs. Thomas E. Graham, Treasurer Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Oklahoma City, Oklahoma DEAR MRS.

For all but two of the six, visiting the memorial to our Founders was a new thrill and they were inspired and impressed, not only with the beauty of the house but with the feeling that it is a vital living center of social activity in Monmouth. Mrs. Mabel Johnson who came to Holt House in December of 1950 is gracious and charming and rep-resents the Fraternity well. The committee enjoyed her hospitality while in Monmouth and left with the assurance that she is taking care and the pride in the house as she would her own home. She has welcomed visitors from many states. During the year 1952-53, Sept. to June, Holt House was used sixty-nine times as a meeting place or as a setting for private entertaining. Illinois Alpha and the Monmouth Alumna Club enjoyed the use of it for initiation and for Founders' Day and for two or three rush parties. Two clubs from neighboring towns held meetings there. Three groups in Monmouth rent the house for their monthly meetings and others use it two or three times a year. The Monmouth PEO meets at the house monthly as does the Women's Club of Monmouth, also the Arrow Mothers' Club. Not counting the times the house was used by Pi Phi groups or by regular renters, the house accommodated, on nine-teen occasions, private parties of varied nature, wed-ding receptions, rehearsal dinners, showers, bridge parties and teas. Other groups using the house this year are: New Century Club, DAR, Fortnightly Club, OGM and the Hospital Auxiliary, and three sororities. Holt House is indeed a charming home in which to entertain. Because Monmouth College is celebrating its Centennial this year, the house was offered to the college to be used for any function during Commencement Week or any time during the spring. In thanking the committee chairman for the offer, Dr. Gibson, President of Monmouth College, wrote, "We do appreciate the variety of ways in which Holt House not only serves our college but serves the community. We are indebted to Pi Phi for a great many things, and we are proud of the current group of girls on our campus as well as the fine alumnae chapter in our community." The first gift to be received after the Houston Convention was an I.C. pin sent by Vera Wattles Kirkpatrick, Nebraska Beta, of Corpus Christi, Texas. The pin was given to her years ago by an aunt, Carrie Wattles Swinder, initiated into Iowa Gamma in 1883, who died November 5, 1945. The pin is lovely and has been placed in the shadow box which we are now using for old pins. Last fall Mr. Earl Bridge of Detroit sent to Holt House a large, beautiful silver tray that had belonged to his wife, Evelyn Holliday Bridge, who died last spring. She was a former Monmouth resident and was on the Holt House Committee at the time of her death. The tray has been appropriately engraved and is being used at many teas and parties given at the house. A group of Detroit and Dearborn Pi Phis recently sent a check for $50.00 to be used at the discretion of the Holt House Committee to purchase a needed and worth-while memorial to Evelyn Bridge who, the letter. states, "was one of the outstanding and diligent workers in our club and in COMMITTEE lieu of flowers at the time of her death this fund was started." It is hoped that other groups will choose to follow this kind of a memorial for their deceased friends. Washington Alpha has sent a beautiful blue and white quilt; the Arrow and Chain appears in four places, the names of the founders living at the time the quilt was made, are embroidered, and in the center block "Grace Coolidge, Vermont Alpha." Special gifts to Holt House include $25.00 from the Milwaukee Club, $25.00 from the Kansas City Missouri Club, and $9.15 from the Joliet, Illinois Club to be used for a dozen silver spoons. These gifts are in addition to the annual donations sent by these clubs. The Committee is most appreciative of the financial support accorded the house by the many contributing chapters and alumna clubs. Total contributions were somewht below those of the preceding year however, and total expenditures were slightly higher. The number of contributing alumni clubs decreased from 213 to 199 for this year. Active chapter contributors decreased from 89 to 81. Total contributions are $349.70 less than last year. The only province to reach 100% this year is Delta which has reached this goal for several years. The clubs in Theta Province reached 100% as did the chapters in Epsilon, Kappa, Lambda and Zeta Provinces. The highest contributors were: $50.00-California Louisiana A Kansas City, Mo. Club $35.00-Oklahoma A $34.00 Akron, Ohio Club $30.00 Tennessee B $25.00-Kansas B Texas B Monmouth, Ill. Club North Shore, Ill. Club Pittsburgh, Pa. Club Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, with Eta Province second, the same as last year. Next in place came Beta Province, then Mu and in fifth place, Epsilon Province. The committee found the furnishings most complete, however some repairs and replacements were necessary. A sidewalk from the rear door to the drive-way and a loading platform there, were installed. A casing around the furnace was replaced, the furnace cleaned, and the humidifier was re-conditioned. The piano was tuned, and one string was replaced. This summer a rug for the Pine Room must be purchased, and the two Holt House films repaired or replaced. The Holt House Chairman is grateful for the continued cooperation of the committee members. The Treasurer, Torrance Etheridge, has been most efficient and thorough in the handling of Holt House funds and has been very prompt in her reports; her annual report is most complete. Marion Tyte has served as secretary of the committee, taking minutes of our Monmouth conference, and typing and mailing copies to committee members and to the Grand President and Grand Vice-President. Gertrude Leetz has kept up the house inventory that was so well-compiled by Mrs. McMurray of Peoria. Louise Campbell, the Monmouth member of the committee has had complete charge of the 57

        46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nessee. Mr. Lewelling was shifted to Mr. Miller's commercial classes and the student teachers took over the other work. A group of fourteen were assigned to Gatlinburg for their work in practice teaching. It would have been hard to finish' the year without their help. The senior class play, "A Broom for the Bride," was well cast and well given. The home economics teacher, Miss Carolyn Freshour, was one of the class sponsors and directed the play. Another project of the seniors was the school annual. I doubt if this book would ever have gone to press if Joni had not come to the rescue with her knowledge of journal-ism and helped them meet the deadline. Dorothy Manley worked up a small operetta for the third grade students called "The Magic Word." A more ambitious operetta was the annual one given by Mrs. Armstrong. She had many discouragements for so many of the children were out of school on ac-count of illness, Katie got sick, and at the last minute, Mr. Armstrong had a heart attack! Joni came to the rescue again, playing the difficult score, and the play went on. The twenty-one seniors finished their school days with a trip to Washington, D.C. They had been well-instructed as to what they were to see, and I think got a great deal out of the experience. They returned to final examinations and Commencement activities. The Baccalaureate service was held in the Methodist church with Reverend McCartt preaching the sermon. The high school chorus, under Mrs. Armstrong's direction, provided the music. Class night was held in the High School auditorium. It was a clever little program written and directed by Joni, called "Graduation Choo Choo." The Commencement exercises were held in the Baptist church. Dean I. N. Carr from Carson Newman College gave the address. He is from a family that came from this area and he went to our school as a child. At a dinner I gave preceding the * program, he spoke of the changes in the community, and again during his talk he spoke of that and of the work done by the Fraternity during the years. During the summer of 1952, three of our teachers completed work on their Bachelor's degrees. This helped give Gatlinburg a very good rating in their instructional staff in a county where there are still many permit teachers. Next year, Mr. Dewy Large will replace Mr. Walter Ogle as principal. He has a master's de.7,ree in school administration and has many plans for improving the school. We have a new County Superintendent of Schools, Mr. Roy Ledwell, who was long connected with Sevier County High School. Mr. Charlie Clabo replaced Mr. Fred Ingle on the Board of Education, and we are to have a new janitor. With the County and the Fraternity working together, we will be able to have a better school than we had last year if all the plans work out. P.T.A. The school lunch program was again sponsored by this organization. Mrs. Morrell gave efficient service and the children were well fed. More free lunches had to be provided than in the past several years. Of all the money-making projects, rummage sales are one of the favorite P.T.A. methods. These sales are held in the school music room, always on the day the Pi Phi weavers receive their monthly checks. The sales usually bring in about an average of $120.00. One sale helped buy new suits for the girls' basketball team, another helped pay for the gray cyclorama curtains for the stage, and a third was used for lockers in the hall. The really big project was the second Minstrel Show. This was written and directed by alocal man, Harry M. Bird. He has had experience with such shows before and really put on a grand entertainment. The goal was a new piano for the assembly room towards which the county Board had promised 8300.00. Enough was realized to buy the piano and to have a "dolly" made for it so it can be moved into a safe place when the gym is used for basketball games. Some good programs were given at the monthly meetings with good average attendance and interest in the work of the organization in its efforts to help both the parents and the school. Dormitory Twelve dormitory students lived at the school during the year. Of the eight girls, one was Martha Houser, Mary's senior daughter, three were juniors, and the other five were second year students. Joni chaperoned the girls, and the four boys were under Mr. Lewelling's care. Two boys were sophomores and the other two were freshmen. All of the girls and boys, with possibly one exception, were good students and very capably executed their work assignments. We again had trouble finding a cook except for the winter months when our good Leona was free from her restaurant job. The rest of the time we had some help from others, but mostly it was Miss Hodgen who fed the family. The girls were good help, but the whole situation was not fair, although seemingly unavoidable. Of course, the'move into the new house was the main event of the year. The management of the Greystone Hotel offered a crew of men for the job of moving the stoves, refrigerator, and heavy kitchen equipment. They came one Saturday morning, and with the help of our regular men and the dormitory boys and girls, everything was installed and we had our first meal that night, December 6th. The boys moved out of Pollard into the rooms vacated at Teachers Cottage by the staff moving into the new house, and that old house was closed until time for Workshop students to occupy it. The first social affair in the new house was the Open House honoring Ethel Snow on December 15th. It was a nasty, cold day, but we had many guests. Among these were several of the weavers, all of whom had been sent a special invitation, and a party of friends from the University who had helped plan certain things about the house. It is a lovely place in which to entertain large groups, and that day the holiday decorations made the setting especially effective. Our local alumnie presided at the punch bowl. Since then we have entertained a number of times. We held an open house for the members of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild during their spring meeting, and a coffee party for the student teachers and our regular teachers and staff. One group from the Council of Southern Mountain Workers met in the lounge for two meetings. Miss Hodgen entertained the Methodist ladies one afternoon, and the ladies from the Episcopal church met with Tina and Katie another afternoon. Marjorie had her bridge club for a dessert luncheon, and one evening another club met with her. We have entertained at several dinner parties the local ministers and their families and other friends. There were two Christmas parties at Stuart, one for the dormitory students, and one for Joni's Scout troop. Mrs. Henry has again used the living room and piano at Stuart for her music pupils and since she lives in Pigeon Forge is most appreciative of the privilege. Health Center Gatlinburg without a Health Center and a Pi Phi nurse ! I imagine the community would regard such a THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 47 situation as a real calamity, for from the time the local babies are brought to the Health Center to be weighed and given their first inoculations, through pre-school examinations and their school years until perhaps they have children of their own, the Health Center with our nurse, kindly Marjorie Chalmers, has been considered a haven. The small pebble dropped by the first nurse, Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario Alpha, thirty-three years ago, started ripples that are still expanding in the area. Different clinics are held at the Health Center during the year. These include the one for pre-school children entering the first grade, and about two yearly visits from the state mobile X-Ray unit. Marjorie's Friday afternoon clinic hours bring many young mothers for counsel and advice. During the school year, she is kept busy looking after the health needs of the 500 children in our school and in making visits to three rural schools, giving nursing service to the childen enrolled there. In the field of community work, she worked with the county polio unit and was chosen to attend a study course in atomic nursing that was given at Nashville. Two of the meetings of the health division of the Council of Southern Mountain Workers were held at the Health Center. The members admired greatly our modern building and equipment. We acknowledged with gratitude the gifts sent especially for the health pro-gram. Sigma Phi Gamma International Sorority gives us money through the Council of Southern Mountain Workers to be used for eye and dental corrections. Through the kindness of a Maryville oculist and a local dentist, this money stretches over a number of needy cases. A Christmas gift of fifteen dollars from the Portland Alumni Club was added to this fund. Chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma are assigned to help us and gifts of small items useful to the nurse and even money come from time to time. In our own membership there are individuals and alumnm clubs that send layettes, something that we have never had a surplus of since I have been here. Farm Our farmer has suffered the usual vicissitudes due to the weather either too much or too little rainfall. Wet weather was responsible for the need of a string of tile to drain the side garden into the spring, and the dry weather ruined some of the garden crops. Some seeds lay dormant and never did come up, while other vegetables died from lack of water. We have had quite a few things for the table, but not much of the sweet corn we are all so fond of. Richard has helped Arlie and Neal with the work of getting the new lawn seeded and in shape. For clays the dormitory boys spent their working hours picking up the rocks that had been left by the graders. We had especially good luck with the baby chicks and have had good egg production all year. Arroweraf! The year has been a busy one with many changes. New faces in management and sales staff have made no radical change in the operation of the shop. We are getting used to having Marion Mueller in Ethel's place, Katie at Mrs. Cole's desk, and two new sales-girls in charge of selling our lovely merchandise to the tourists. Ethel had to set up the Convention Shop, which is always a task. Those of you who were at the Shamrock will remember we had an especially fine display, Fall shipping was very heavy with no let-up until just before Christmas. Business has been good at both of the shops. Tourists are always interested in seeing a loom in operation, so we have hadone set up in the front salesroom with a weaver demonstrating on it. Irene Wilson wove the drapery material that Tina designed for the lounge and hall of our new Staff House on that loom, and at present Susie Maples makes the shuttle fly. Last summer, Tina was given leave of absence to attend a six weeks workshop at the Inter-Mountain Indian School in Utah where she worked under the famous Dorothy Liebes. She and Irene demonstrated at the Crafts-man's Fair in Asheville last July. Edna helped sell our products in the booth that we shared with the McDonalds (pottery), Marian Heard and Jane Glass (jewelry), and Mr. Ronald Slayton (wood products), formerly with the University of Tennessee. Arrowcraft weavings were exhibited at the Cherokee Indian Fair and were entered at the Fall Craft Show held at the University of Tennessee. In recognition of the weavers who have worked continuously for Pi Phi for many years, Marion Mueller and Tina arranged a party which was held at the Staff House. Seven weavers with a record of twenty-five years of service to Arrow-craft were the honored guests. Each was given a Stuart Nye pin suitably engraved on the back. All enjoyed the visiting and there was much recalling of old times. They sang some old harp songs before we had refreshments. These consisted of punch and a cake beautifully decorated with an arrow. Everyone regretted that Ethel Snow was not present, for she knew all the weavers. It would have been nice if our former weaving designer, Jene Redding, could have been there, for she had started many of this group weaving "for the school." Jene had seen many of them earlier in the spring when she was our guest for a few days. She was invited to give a talk at the spring meeting of the Southern Highland 'Handicraft Guild held at the Greystone Hotel, coming down from Boston where she now operates her own weaving service. Summer Activities Pi Phi Visitors and Staff House Dedication Our official Pi Phi family held meetings in town during the summer. Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and then the Province Officers arrived. We were delighted to have them here. Committee arranged for a lovely dinner, a tour of the grounds with meetings with the local resident staff and several of the teachers hired by the Fraternity, a visit to Arrowcraft and for them to be present at the formal dedication of the staff house. This was a simple ceremony held in the lounge with local Pi Phi alum-rue and friends of the school also in attendance. To all of us the highlight was when the building was dedicated and named the "Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House." No name could have been more fitting nor an honor more deserved. As Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Ruth Smith, had worked untiringly for this house; from the time that the site and architect were selected until the building stood, completed. She was aided by her husband, Warren T. Smith, a builder of experience, who flew from Oregon at his own expense to help with the many complicated details involved in letting the contract for the house. His advice was invaluable and saved the Fraternity hundreds of dollars. We regretted that he could not have been present at the ceremony to hear the tributes paid to Ruth and her modest speech of acceptance of the honor. The name plaque of wrought iron which is in place by the front door reminds us all of the unselfish service of a person who leaves the Committee this year. I think that everyone present at the dedication was impressed with Pi Phis close bonds of 48 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW friendship, tangibly expressed in a beautiful building which will add to the effectiveness of the work done at the Settlement School. In 1952, summer schools at most universities and colleges showed a decrease in the number of registrations. This was also true of our Craft Workshop, but the group was an enthusiastic and talented one. Even a person with only a slight knowledge of good crafts, when attending one of the open house exhibits, could realize that the work turned out was superior in design and quality of workmanship. Courses were offered in Weaving, Metal, Jewelry, Pottery, and Wood Working. Interesting trips to other craft centers, such as those in Asheville, Cherokee, and Brasstown, North Carolina, were a part of the pro-gram. The group enjoyed several picnics in the mountains. We always make so many new friends among the students that it is with real regret we see the sessions end. The Gateway Stock Company again rented the school auditorium for the season. Mr. John Richards brings down from New York a groupof talented young actors who appear in five different plays during the season. Space does not permit my listing the gifts that have come to the school during the year. The special Pi Phi shelf in the high school library holds many lovely new volumes given as memorials. We have received money for speech records for the English classes and musical recordings for the music department. Christmas gifts for the children were many and varied. We again sent individual gifts to the students in three rural schools, remembered the lower grades in our school; and there were special gifts and clothing for the dormitory students from the Terre Haute Alum= Club. These gifts came from all over the United States and from Honolulu. They are typical representations of the affectionate interest held by our large membership for the Settlement School. We express gratitude for these gifts, for the unselfish devotion of the members of the Settlement School Committee, and for our loyal local employees. Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER, Director Great Potential for Character Building Pointing out how the fraternity may become an educational institution of great significance, Dr. Thomas A. Brady, Vice President of the University of Missouri, has listed these propositions as basic: "1. The educational institution should be concerned not only with formal instruction but with the building of character and the social integration of the individual as well. "2. Formal instruction alone, being entirely verbal and visual, can impart truths and correct principles but will not serve as a substitute for daily experience in molding the individual. "3. The experience most effective in molding the character of the student is that which he receives in daily contact with others of his own age." Dr. Brady's argument for the fraternity, then, requires one further step. "This would be the contention that, granted the importance of experience with students his own age, the greatest achievement in the building character may be made if (a) the association is voluntary, and (b) if the students themselves, under proper guidance have as large a voice as possible in managing and directing the organization which makes the corporate life possible." Dr. Brady's views were expressed in an address at the 29th biennial convention of Phi Kappa, a general fraternity for Catholic men. From "Quiet Please" in Fraternity Month Earl F. Schoening, Secretary-Treasurer of Phi Sigma Kappa, had this to say, "A fraternity should be what it was fundamentally designed to be: a social organization to make for a more congenial and a more pleasant college life than could otherwise be had; a richer undergraduate experience because in carrying on the work of the social organization, officers and members acquire lessons which stand them in good stead after college. They can learn something of leadership and financial management. I feel strongly that fraternity membership is an asset to any man in after-college life whether he admits it or not."

For all but two of the six, visiting the memorial to our Founders was a new thrill and they were inspired and impressed, not only with the beauty of the house but with the feeling that it is a vital living center of social activity in Monmouth. Mrs. Mabel Johnson who came to Holt House in December of 1950 is gracious and charming and rep-resents the Fraternity well. The committee enjoyed her hospitality while in Monmouth and left with the assurance that she is taking care and the pride in the house as she would her own home. She has welcomed visitors from many states. During the year 1952-53, Sept. to June, Holt House was used sixty-nine times as a meeting place or as a setting for private entertaining. Illinois Alpha and the Monmouth Alumna Club enjoyed the use of it for initiation and for Founders' Day and for two or three rush parties. Two clubs from neighboring towns held meetings there. Three groups in Monmouth rent the house for their monthly meetings and others use it two or three times a year. The Monmouth PEO meets at the house monthly as does the Women's Club of Monmouth, also the Arrow Mothers' Club. Not counting the times the house was used by Pi Phi groups or by regular renters, the house accommodated, on nine-teen occasions, private parties of varied nature, wed-ding receptions, rehearsal dinners, showers, bridge parties and teas. Other groups using the house this year are: New Century Club, DAR, Fortnightly Club, OGM and the Hospital Auxiliary, and three sororities. Holt House is indeed a charming home in which to entertain. Because Monmouth College is celebrating its Centennial this year, the house was offered to the college to be used for any function during Commencement Week or any time during the spring. In thanking the committee chairman for the offer, Dr. Gibson, President of Monmouth College, wrote, "We do appreciate the variety of ways in which Holt House not only serves our college but serves the community. We are indebted to Pi Phi for a great many things, and we are proud of the current group of girls on our campus as well as the fine alumnae chapter in our community." The first gift to be received after the Houston Convention was an I.C. pin sent by Vera Wattles Kirkpatrick, Nebraska Beta, of Corpus Christi, Texas. The pin was given to her years ago by an aunt, Carrie Wattles Swinder, initiated into Iowa Gamma in 1883, who died November 5, 1945. The pin is lovely and has been placed in the shadow box which we are now using for old pins. Last fall Mr. Earl Bridge of Detroit sent to Holt House a large, beautiful silver tray that had belonged to his wife, Evelyn Holliday Bridge, who died last spring. She was a former Monmouth resident and was on the Holt House Committee at the time of her death. The tray has been appropriately engraved and is being used at many teas and parties given at the house. A group of Detroit and Dearborn Pi Phis recently sent a check for $50.00 to be used at the discretion of the Holt House Committee to purchase a needed and worth-while memorial to Evelyn Bridge who, the letter. states, "was one of the outstanding and diligent workers in our club and in COMMITTEE lieu of flowers at the time of her death this fund was started." It is hoped that other groups will choose to follow this kind of a memorial for their deceased friends. Washington Alpha has sent a beautiful blue and white quilt; the Arrow and Chain appears in four places, the names of the founders living at the time the quilt was made, are embroidered, and in the center block "Grace Coolidge, Vermont Alpha." Special gifts to Holt House include $25.00 from the Milwaukee Club, $25.00 from the Kansas City Missouri Club, and $9.15 from the Joliet, Illinois Club to be used for a dozen silver spoons. These gifts are in addition to the annual donations sent by these clubs. The Committee is most appreciative of the financial support accorded the house by the many contributing chapters and alumna clubs. Total contributions were somewht below those of the preceding year however, and total expenditures were slightly higher. The number of contributing alumni clubs decreased from 213 to 199 for this year. Active chapter contributors decreased from 89 to 81. Total contributions are $349.70 less than last year. The only province to reach 100% this year is Delta which has reached this goal for several years. The clubs in Theta Province reached 100% as did the chapters in Epsilon, Kappa, Lambda and Zeta Provinces. The highest contributors were: $50.00-California Louisiana A Kansas City, Mo. Club $35.00-Oklahoma A $34.00 Akron, Ohio Club $30.00 Tennessee B $25.00-Kansas B Texas B Monmouth, Ill. Club North Shore, Ill. Club Pittsburgh, Pa. Club Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, with Eta Province second, the same as last year. Next in place came Beta Province, then Mu and in fifth place, Epsilon Province. The committee found the furnishings most complete, however some repairs and replacements were necessary. A sidewalk from the rear door to the drive-way and a loading platform there, were installed. A casing around the furnace was replaced, the furnace cleaned, and the humidifier was re-conditioned. The piano was tuned, and one string was replaced. This summer a rug for the Pine Room must be purchased, and the two Holt House films repaired or replaced. The Holt House Chairman is grateful for the continued cooperation of the committee members. The Treasurer, Torrance Etheridge, has been most efficient and thorough in the handling of Holt House funds and has been very prompt in her reports; her annual report is most complete. Marion Tyte has served as secretary of the committee, taking minutes of our Monmouth conference, and typing and mailing copies to committee members and to the Grand President and Grand Vice-President. Gertrude Leetz has kept up the house inventory that was so well-compiled by Mrs. McMurray of Peoria. Louise Campbell, the Monmouth member of the committee has had complete charge of the 57

        48 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW friendship, tangibly expressed in a beautiful building which will add to the effectiveness of the work done at the Settlement School. In 1952, summer schools at most universities and colleges showed a decrease in the number of registrations. This was also true of our Craft Workshop, but the group was an enthusiastic and talented one. Even a person with only a slight knowledge of good crafts, when attending one of the open house exhibits, could realize that the work turned out was superior in design and quality of workmanship. Courses were offered in Weaving, Metal, Jewelry, Pottery, and Wood Working. Interesting trips to other craft centers, such as those in Asheville, Cherokee, and Brasstown, North Carolina, were a part of the pro-gram. The group enjoyed several picnics in the mountains. We always make so many new friends among the students that it is with real regret we see the sessions end. The Gateway Stock Company again rented the school auditorium for the season. Mr. John Richards brings down from New York a groupof talented young actors who appear in five different plays during the season. Space does not permit my listing the gifts that have come to the school during the year. The special Pi Phi shelf in the high school library holds many lovely new volumes given as memorials. We have received money for speech records for the English classes and musical recordings for the music department. Christmas gifts for the children were many and varied. We again sent individual gifts to the students in three rural schools, remembered the lower grades in our school; and there were special gifts and clothing for the dormitory students from the Terre Haute Alum= Club. These gifts came from all over the United States and from Honolulu. They are typical representations of the affectionate interest held by our large membership for the Settlement School. We express gratitude for these gifts, for the unselfish devotion of the members of the Settlement School Committee, and for our loyal local employees. Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER, Director Great Potential for Character Building Pointing out how the fraternity may become an educational institution of great significance, Dr. Thomas A. Brady, Vice President of the University of Missouri, has listed these propositions as basic: "1. The educational institution should be concerned not only with formal instruction but with the building of character and the social integration of the individual as well. "2. Formal instruction alone, being entirely verbal and visual, can impart truths and correct principles but will not serve as a substitute for daily experience in molding the individual. "3. The experience most effective in molding the character of the student is that which he receives in daily contact with others of his own age." Dr. Brady's argument for the fraternity, then, requires one further step. "This would be the contention that, granted the importance of experience with students his own age, the greatest achievement in the building character may be made if (a) the association is voluntary, and (b) if the students themselves, under proper guidance have as large a voice as possible in managing and directing the organization which makes the corporate life possible." Dr. Brady's views were expressed in an address at the 29th biennial convention of Phi Kappa, a general fraternity for Catholic men. From "Quiet Please" in Fraternity Month Earl F. Schoening, Secretary-Treasurer of Phi Sigma Kappa, had this to say, "A fraternity should be what it was fundamentally designed to be: a social organization to make for a more congenial and a more pleasant college life than could otherwise be had; a richer undergraduate experience because in carrying on the work of the social organization, officers and members acquire lessons which stand them in good stead after college. They can learn something of leadership and financial management. I feel strongly that fraternity membership is an asset to any man in after-college life whether he admits it or not." THE SEPT.EMSER ARROW TREASURER OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Little Rock, Arkansas August 6, 1953 Mrs. Thomas E. Graham, Treasurer Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Oklahoma City, Oklahoma DEAR MRS.

For all but two of the six, visiting the memorial to our Founders was a new thrill and they were inspired and impressed, not only with the beauty of the house but with the feeling that it is a vital living center of social activity in Monmouth. Mrs. Mabel Johnson who came to Holt House in December of 1950 is gracious and charming and rep-resents the Fraternity well. The committee enjoyed her hospitality while in Monmouth and left with the assurance that she is taking care and the pride in the house as she would her own home. She has welcomed visitors from many states. During the year 1952-53, Sept. to June, Holt House was used sixty-nine times as a meeting place or as a setting for private entertaining. Illinois Alpha and the Monmouth Alumna Club enjoyed the use of it for initiation and for Founders' Day and for two or three rush parties. Two clubs from neighboring towns held meetings there. Three groups in Monmouth rent the house for their monthly meetings and others use it two or three times a year. The Monmouth PEO meets at the house monthly as does the Women's Club of Monmouth, also the Arrow Mothers' Club. Not counting the times the house was used by Pi Phi groups or by regular renters, the house accommodated, on nine-teen occasions, private parties of varied nature, wed-ding receptions, rehearsal dinners, showers, bridge parties and teas. Other groups using the house this year are: New Century Club, DAR, Fortnightly Club, OGM and the Hospital Auxiliary, and three sororities. Holt House is indeed a charming home in which to entertain. Because Monmouth College is celebrating its Centennial this year, the house was offered to the college to be used for any function during Commencement Week or any time during the spring. In thanking the committee chairman for the offer, Dr. Gibson, President of Monmouth College, wrote, "We do appreciate the variety of ways in which Holt House not only serves our college but serves the community. We are indebted to Pi Phi for a great many things, and we are proud of the current group of girls on our campus as well as the fine alumnae chapter in our community." The first gift to be received after the Houston Convention was an I.C. pin sent by Vera Wattles Kirkpatrick, Nebraska Beta, of Corpus Christi, Texas. The pin was given to her years ago by an aunt, Carrie Wattles Swinder, initiated into Iowa Gamma in 1883, who died November 5, 1945. The pin is lovely and has been placed in the shadow box which we are now using for old pins. Last fall Mr. Earl Bridge of Detroit sent to Holt House a large, beautiful silver tray that had belonged to his wife, Evelyn Holliday Bridge, who died last spring. She was a former Monmouth resident and was on the Holt House Committee at the time of her death. The tray has been appropriately engraved and is being used at many teas and parties given at the house. A group of Detroit and Dearborn Pi Phis recently sent a check for $50.00 to be used at the discretion of the Holt House Committee to purchase a needed and worth-while memorial to Evelyn Bridge who, the letter. states, "was one of the outstanding and diligent workers in our club and in COMMITTEE lieu of flowers at the time of her death this fund was started." It is hoped that other groups will choose to follow this kind of a memorial for their deceased friends. Washington Alpha has sent a beautiful blue and white quilt; the Arrow and Chain appears in four places, the names of the founders living at the time the quilt was made, are embroidered, and in the center block "Grace Coolidge, Vermont Alpha." Special gifts to Holt House include $25.00 from the Milwaukee Club, $25.00 from the Kansas City Missouri Club, and $9.15 from the Joliet, Illinois Club to be used for a dozen silver spoons. These gifts are in addition to the annual donations sent by these clubs. The Committee is most appreciative of the financial support accorded the house by the many contributing chapters and alumna clubs. Total contributions were somewht below those of the preceding year however, and total expenditures were slightly higher. The number of contributing alumni clubs decreased from 213 to 199 for this year. Active chapter contributors decreased from 89 to 81. Total contributions are $349.70 less than last year. The only province to reach 100% this year is Delta which has reached this goal for several years. The clubs in Theta Province reached 100% as did the chapters in Epsilon, Kappa, Lambda and Zeta Provinces. The highest contributors were: $50.00-California Louisiana A Kansas City, Mo. Club $35.00-Oklahoma A $34.00 Akron, Ohio Club $30.00 Tennessee B $25.00-Kansas B Texas B Monmouth, Ill. Club North Shore, Ill. Club Pittsburgh, Pa. Club Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, with Eta Province second, the same as last year. Next in place came Beta Province, then Mu and in fifth place, Epsilon Province. The committee found the furnishings most complete, however some repairs and replacements were necessary. A sidewalk from the rear door to the drive-way and a loading platform there, were installed. A casing around the furnace was replaced, the furnace cleaned, and the humidifier was re-conditioned. The piano was tuned, and one string was replaced. This summer a rug for the Pine Room must be purchased, and the two Holt House films repaired or replaced. The Holt House Chairman is grateful for the continued cooperation of the committee members. The Treasurer, Torrance Etheridge, has been most efficient and thorough in the handling of Holt House funds and has been very prompt in her reports; her annual report is most complete. Marion Tyte has served as secretary of the committee, taking minutes of our Monmouth conference, and typing and mailing copies to committee members and to the Grand President and Grand Vice-President. Gertrude Leetz has kept up the house inventory that was so well-compiled by Mrs. McMurray of Peoria. Louise Campbell, the Monmouth member of the committee has had complete charge of the 57

For all but two of the six, visiting the memorial to our Founders was a new thrill and they were inspired and impressed, not only with the beauty of the house but with the feeling that it is a vital living center of social activity in Monmouth. Mrs. Mabel Johnson who came to Holt House in December of 1950 is gracious and charming and rep-resents the Fraternity well. The committee enjoyed her hospitality while in Monmouth and left with the assurance that she is taking care and the pride in the house as she would her own home. She has welcomed visitors from many states. During the year 1952-53, Sept. to June, Holt House was used sixty-nine times as a meeting place or as a setting for private entertaining. Illinois Alpha and the Monmouth Alumna Club enjoyed the use of it for initiation and for Founders' Day and for two or three rush parties. Two clubs from neighboring towns held meetings there. Three groups in Monmouth rent the house for their monthly meetings and others use it two or three times a year. The Monmouth PEO meets at the house monthly as does the Women's Club of Monmouth, also the Arrow Mothers' Club. Not counting the times the house was used by Pi Phi groups or by regular renters, the house accommodated, on nine-teen occasions, private parties of varied nature, wed-ding receptions, rehearsal dinners, showers, bridge parties and teas. Other groups using the house this year are: New Century Club, DAR, Fortnightly Club, OGM and the Hospital Auxiliary, and three sororities. Holt House is indeed a charming home in which to entertain. Because Monmouth College is celebrating its Centennial this year, the house was offered to the college to be used for any function during Commencement Week or any time during the spring. In thanking the committee chairman for the offer, Dr. Gibson, President of Monmouth College, wrote, "We do appreciate the variety of ways in which Holt House not only serves our college but serves the community. We are indebted to Pi Phi for a great many things, and we are proud of the current group of girls on our campus as well as the fine alumnae chapter in our community." The first gift to be received after the Houston Convention was an I.C. pin sent by Vera Wattles Kirkpatrick, Nebraska Beta, of Corpus Christi, Texas. The pin was given to her years ago by an aunt, Carrie Wattles Swinder, initiated into Iowa Gamma in 1883, who died November 5, 1945. The pin is lovely and has been placed in the shadow box which we are now using for old pins. Last fall Mr. Earl Bridge of Detroit sent to Holt House a large, beautiful silver tray that had belonged to his wife, Evelyn Holliday Bridge, who died last spring. She was a former Monmouth resident and was on the Holt House Committee at the time of her death. The tray has been appropriately engraved and is being used at many teas and parties given at the house. A group of Detroit and Dearborn Pi Phis recently sent a check for $50.00 to be used at the discretion of the Holt House Committee to purchase a needed and worth-while memorial to Evelyn Bridge who, the letter. states, "was one of the outstanding and diligent workers in our club and in COMMITTEE lieu of flowers at the time of her death this fund was started." It is hoped that other groups will choose to follow this kind of a memorial for their deceased friends. Washington Alpha has sent a beautiful blue and white quilt; the Arrow and Chain appears in four places, the names of the founders living at the time the quilt was made, are embroidered, and in the center block "Grace Coolidge, Vermont Alpha." Special gifts to Holt House include $25.00 from the Milwaukee Club, $25.00 from the Kansas City Missouri Club, and $9.15 from the Joliet, Illinois Club to be used for a dozen silver spoons. These gifts are in addition to the annual donations sent by these clubs. The Committee is most appreciative of the financial support accorded the house by the many contributing chapters and alumna clubs. Total contributions were somewht below those of the preceding year however, and total expenditures were slightly higher. The number of contributing alumni clubs decreased from 213 to 199 for this year. Active chapter contributors decreased from 89 to 81. Total contributions are $349.70 less than last year. The only province to reach 100% this year is Delta which has reached this goal for several years. The clubs in Theta Province reached 100% as did the chapters in Epsilon, Kappa, Lambda and Zeta Provinces. The highest contributors were: $50.00-California Louisiana A Kansas City, Mo. Club $35.00-Oklahoma A $34.00 Akron, Ohio Club $30.00 Tennessee B $25.00-Kansas B Texas B Monmouth, Ill. Club North Shore, Ill. Club Pittsburgh, Pa. Club Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, with Eta Province second, the same as last year. Next in place came Beta Province, then Mu and in fifth place, Epsilon Province. The committee found the furnishings most complete, however some repairs and replacements were necessary. A sidewalk from the rear door to the drive-way and a loading platform there, were installed. A casing around the furnace was replaced, the furnace cleaned, and the humidifier was re-conditioned. The piano was tuned, and one string was replaced. This summer a rug for the Pine Room must be purchased, and the two Holt House films repaired or replaced. The Holt House Chairman is grateful for the continued cooperation of the committee members. The Treasurer, Torrance Etheridge, has been most efficient and thorough in the handling of Holt House funds and has been very prompt in her reports; her annual report is most complete. Marion Tyte has served as secretary of the committee, taking minutes of our Monmouth conference, and typing and mailing copies to committee members and to the Grand President and Grand Vice-President. Gertrude Leetz has kept up the house inventory that was so well-compiled by Mrs. McMurray of Peoria. Louise Campbell, the Monmouth member of the committee has had complete charge of the 57

For all but two of the six, visiting the memorial to our Founders was a new thrill and they were inspired and impressed, not only with the beauty of the house but with the feeling that it is a vital living center of social activity in Monmouth. Mrs. Mabel Johnson who came to Holt House in December of 1950 is gracious and charming and rep-resents the Fraternity well. The committee enjoyed her hospitality while in Monmouth and left with the assurance that she is taking care and the pride in the house as she would her own home. She has welcomed visitors from many states. During the year 1952-53, Sept. to June, Holt House was used sixty-nine times as a meeting place or as a setting for private entertaining. Illinois Alpha and the Monmouth Alumna Club enjoyed the use of it for initiation and for Founders' Day and for two or three rush parties. Two clubs from neighboring towns held meetings there. Three groups in Monmouth rent the house for their monthly meetings and others use it two or three times a year. The Monmouth PEO meets at the house monthly as does the Women's Club of Monmouth, also the Arrow Mothers' Club. Not counting the times the house was used by Pi Phi groups or by regular renters, the house accommodated, on nine-teen occasions, private parties of varied nature, wed-ding receptions, rehearsal dinners, showers, bridge parties and teas. Other groups using the house this year are: New Century Club, DAR, Fortnightly Club, OGM and the Hospital Auxiliary, and three sororities. Holt House is indeed a charming home in which to entertain. Because Monmouth College is celebrating its Centennial this year, the house was offered to the college to be used for any function during Commencement Week or any time during the spring. In thanking the committee chairman for the offer, Dr. Gibson, President of Monmouth College, wrote, "We do appreciate the variety of ways in which Holt House not only serves our college but serves the community. We are indebted to Pi Phi for a great many things, and we are proud of the current group of girls on our campus as well as the fine alumnae chapter in our community." The first gift to be received after the Houston Convention was an I.C. pin sent by Vera Wattles Kirkpatrick, Nebraska Beta, of Corpus Christi, Texas. The pin was given to her years ago by an aunt, Carrie Wattles Swinder, initiated into Iowa Gamma in 1883, who died November 5, 1945. The pin is lovely and has been placed in the shadow box which we are now using for old pins. Last fall Mr. Earl Bridge of Detroit sent to Holt House a large, beautiful silver tray that had belonged to his wife, Evelyn Holliday Bridge, who died last spring. She was a former Monmouth resident and was on the Holt House Committee at the time of her death. The tray has been appropriately engraved and is being used at many teas and parties given at the house. A group of Detroit and Dearborn Pi Phis recently sent a check for $50.00 to be used at the discretion of the Holt House Committee to purchase a needed and worth-while memorial to Evelyn Bridge who, the letter. states, "was one of the outstanding and diligent workers in our club and in COMMITTEE lieu of flowers at the time of her death this fund was started." It is hoped that other groups will choose to follow this kind of a memorial for their deceased friends. Washington Alpha has sent a beautiful blue and white quilt; the Arrow and Chain appears in four places, the names of the founders living at the time the quilt was made, are embroidered, and in the center block "Grace Coolidge, Vermont Alpha." Special gifts to Holt House include $25.00 from the Milwaukee Club, $25.00 from the Kansas City Missouri Club, and $9.15 from the Joliet, Illinois Club to be used for a dozen silver spoons. These gifts are in addition to the annual donations sent by these clubs. The Committee is most appreciative of the financial support accorded the house by the many contributing chapters and alumna clubs. Total contributions were somewht below those of the preceding year however, and total expenditures were slightly higher. The number of contributing alumni clubs decreased from 213 to 199 for this year. Active chapter contributors decreased from 89 to 81. Total contributions are $349.70 less than last year. The only province to reach 100% this year is Delta which has reached this goal for several years. The clubs in Theta Province reached 100% as did the chapters in Epsilon, Kappa, Lambda and Zeta Provinces. The highest contributors were: $50.00-California Louisiana A Kansas City, Mo. Club $35.00-Oklahoma A $34.00 Akron, Ohio Club $30.00 Tennessee B $25.00-Kansas B Texas B Monmouth, Ill. Club North Shore, Ill. Club Pittsburgh, Pa. Club Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, with Eta Province second, the same as last year. Next in place came Beta Province, then Mu and in fifth place, Epsilon Province. The committee found the furnishings most complete, however some repairs and replacements were necessary. A sidewalk from the rear door to the drive-way and a loading platform there, were installed. A casing around the furnace was replaced, the furnace cleaned, and the humidifier was re-conditioned. The piano was tuned, and one string was replaced. This summer a rug for the Pine Room must be purchased, and the two Holt House films repaired or replaced. The Holt House Chairman is grateful for the continued cooperation of the committee members. The Treasurer, Torrance Etheridge, has been most efficient and thorough in the handling of Holt House funds and has been very prompt in her reports; her annual report is most complete. Marion Tyte has served as secretary of the committee, taking minutes of our Monmouth conference, and typing and mailing copies to committee members and to the Grand President and Grand Vice-President. Gertrude Leetz has kept up the house inventory that was so well-compiled by Mrs. McMurray of Peoria. Louise Campbell, the Monmouth member of the committee has had complete charge of the 57

For all but two of the six, visiting the memorial to our Founders was a new thrill and they were inspired and impressed, not only with the beauty of the house but with the feeling that it is a vital living center of social activity in Monmouth. Mrs. Mabel Johnson who came to Holt House in December of 1950 is gracious and charming and rep-resents the Fraternity well. The committee enjoyed her hospitality while in Monmouth and left with the assurance that she is taking care and the pride in the house as she would her own home. She has welcomed visitors from many states. During the year 1952-53, Sept. to June, Holt House was used sixty-nine times as a meeting place or as a setting for private entertaining. Illinois Alpha and the Monmouth Alumna Club enjoyed the use of it for initiation and for Founders' Day and for two or three rush parties. Two clubs from neighboring towns held meetings there. Three groups in Monmouth rent the house for their monthly meetings and others use it two or three times a year. The Monmouth PEO meets at the house monthly as does the Women's Club of Monmouth, also the Arrow Mothers' Club. Not counting the times the house was used by Pi Phi groups or by regular renters, the house accommodated, on nine-teen occasions, private parties of varied nature, wed-ding receptions, rehearsal dinners, showers, bridge parties and teas. Other groups using the house this year are: New Century Club, DAR, Fortnightly Club, OGM and the Hospital Auxiliary, and three sororities. Holt House is indeed a charming home in which to entertain. Because Monmouth College is celebrating its Centennial this year, the house was offered to the college to be used for any function during Commencement Week or any time during the spring. In thanking the committee chairman for the offer, Dr. Gibson, President of Monmouth College, wrote, "We do appreciate the variety of ways in which Holt House not only serves our college but serves the community. We are indebted to Pi Phi for a great many things, and we are proud of the current group of girls on our campus as well as the fine alumnae chapter in our community." The first gift to be received after the Houston Convention was an I.C. pin sent by Vera Wattles Kirkpatrick, Nebraska Beta, of Corpus Christi, Texas. The pin was given to her years ago by an aunt, Carrie Wattles Swinder, initiated into Iowa Gamma in 1883, who died November 5, 1945. The pin is lovely and has been placed in the shadow box which we are now using for old pins. Last fall Mr. Earl Bridge of Detroit sent to Holt House a large, beautiful silver tray that had belonged to his wife, Evelyn Holliday Bridge, who died last spring. She was a former Monmouth resident and was on the Holt House Committee at the time of her death. The tray has been appropriately engraved and is being used at many teas and parties given at the house. A group of Detroit and Dearborn Pi Phis recently sent a check for $50.00 to be used at the discretion of the Holt House Committee to purchase a needed and worth-while memorial to Evelyn Bridge who, the letter. states, "was one of the outstanding and diligent workers in our club and in COMMITTEE lieu of flowers at the time of her death this fund was started." It is hoped that other groups will choose to follow this kind of a memorial for their deceased friends. Washington Alpha has sent a beautiful blue and white quilt; the Arrow and Chain appears in four places, the names of the founders living at the time the quilt was made, are embroidered, and in the center block "Grace Coolidge, Vermont Alpha." Special gifts to Holt House include $25.00 from the Milwaukee Club, $25.00 from the Kansas City Missouri Club, and $9.15 from the Joliet, Illinois Club to be used for a dozen silver spoons. These gifts are in addition to the annual donations sent by these clubs.

Louise Campbell, the Monmouth member of the committee has had complete charge of the 57 yid THE SEPTEMBER ARROW CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE Cecil Rhodes, when making his will to establish the Rhodes scholarships, wrote, "Educational relations make the strongest tie." How right was Pi Beta Phi, affiliated with education through all its years, when it chose that field for its philanthropy! How wise were the leaders of 1910 and 1911 to recognize that the level of culture in a country depends upon the education of its people ! Pi Beta Phi first offered in Gatlinburg only the basic needs the three Rs. Then came the necessity for health protection and methods of overcoming malnutrition. Next, we turned to another phase of educational progress the encouragement of weaving and other handicrafts with new colors and new ideas for the local people, already gifted, and the marketing of their products through Arrowcraft. Policies must ever be in a state of flux, subject always to changes which best meet current needs and developments, and as the county and state became financially able to assume more of their true responsibilities, we gave them their opportunity and turned to yet an-other phase of educational advance, the encouragement and development of the handicrafts in the whole Southern Highlands area. In 1945 still another transition came with the establishment of the Pi Beta Phi University of Tennessee Summer Workshop in Crafts. This time it was not only to further the crafts in the mountain areas of the south but to spread this education clear across the United States. This summer the ninth Workshop was held in Gatlinburg when twenty-two states, spreading from Florida to Toronto and westward to Colorado and Texas were represented. Twenty-two in attendance were graduate-students, seventeen were undergraduates and twenty-seven of the total sixty-six were non-credit, studying for sheer love of the crafts. Not only has there been a revival of interest in the crafts and related arts for the joy of creating but also has come a recognition of the great therapeutic value of crafts for hundreds of people handicapped through war or other injures, physical and mental, and instructors must be trained. Our Work-shop is a new venture in education and is attracting wide-spread attention to Pi Beta Phi and the University's all-year program in Related Arts and Crafts. Now two other summer schools for credit have been set up in the east but ours was the first. Plans for the Summer Workshop are made at the time of the Chairman's fall visit to the School. Then Miss Jessie W. Harris, Vice Dean of the College of Home Economics, Miss Henrietta R. Sivyer, Head of the Department of Related Arts and Crafts, Miss Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design, Miss Ruth Buckley, Head of the Department of Foods and Nutrition, together with Miss Dyer, her Assistant and the Chairman assemble in conference. One cannot go far wrong with such able advisors and Pi Beta Phi is ever grateful for their aid. Miss Harris, 1938 Convention initiate, has given her thought to our Workshop from before its inception and Miss Heard has been its Director from the start. We have appreciated, too, the encouragement from Prof. F. J. Lowry, Dean of the University Extension, under whose department we operate. The 1953 Workshop offered Metal Work and Jewelery, Weaving, Textile Design, Pottery, and Enameling for beginners and advanced students. We lean heavily on Miss Heard's enthusiastic leadership as well as her skill in the teaching of Advanced Jewelery making. Because of the present increased interest in Enameling, Mr. Kenneth S. Bates was brought down from the Cleveland Institute of Arts as instructor. His handsome display of museum pieces, particularly the enamels on pure silver or copper served as major incentives in that field. All phases of the curriculum had top instructors in their fields and the results of the three and six weeks' efforts, when displayed at two Open Houses, proved the value of their teaching. As mentioned in previous annual reports, the bottle neck of former Workshops has been the lack of adequate housing and too small kitchen and dining space to care for the staffs and summer students. This situation has now been eased with the completion of the new Staff House. This twelve bedroom home not only provides new year around living for our regular staff and the Workshop staff for six weeks but the dining room cares for one hundred comfortably. The kitchen is planned for scientific operation. Again we had the advice of the University of Tennessee: Miss Buckley on the kitchen planning; Miss Sivyer and Miss Heard with furnishings and colors. Money for the building of the Staff House came from bequests (the Garshwiler estate and the Graham estate), from California Alpha money, and from the Sinking Fund into which have been regularly placed amounts for such construction as needed at the Settlement School. The concept of having the house furnished by extra contributions to honor a friend, a relative, other loyal Pi Phi, or from devotion to the Settlement School came to the Committee even before plans for the Staff House were on paper. The idea was spear-headed by Maryland Alpha which pledged the balance of its treasury, one thousand dollars, at the Jasper Convention just as the chapter was withdrawing from the Goucher campus. We are very proud of the response to the letter sent out last fall by the Publicity member of the Committee and most particularly of those alumnae clubs which made their contribution to the Staff House furnishings without reducing the amount regularly donated to the maintenance program of the School. The following are those who, to date, share in the pleasure of seeing the house become habitable, attractive, and restful. Some contributions were made with specific purposes in mind. These are recorded but the balance will be assigned this summer and listed in a later ARROW. As promised previously, credit will also be posted at the Staff House.

Frances C. Curtis Memorial Gladys R. Finch Memorial Those clubs beside whose name appears one asterisk contributed to the Staff House without reducing their regular Settlement School contribution. Where two stars are evident, that club not only did not reduce the size of its regular contribution from last year but increased it! There are still four bedrooms whose furnishings must be provided and aside from these we are still in need of many things. On the practical side are such as a vacuum cleaner, a waxer, floor and table lamps, a clock. Among the more costly morale builders could be named a Deep Freeze or a refrigerator which will provide ice as well as furnish additional storage room (We have no ice machine at present and Tennessee heat really calls for one!) and a spinet piano. The piano is much desired. And now to the all-year program at the Settlement School Some staff changes have occurred this year. In December, the resignation of Ethel M. Snow as Manager of Arrowcraft became effective. During her sixteen years of service, she had become an integral part of Arrowcraft's relations with the alumnm, and to relinquish her meant a real adjustment. We appreciated her staying on through the fall shipping season. To the position came Mrs. Marian Webb Mueller, Indiana G, who in her six months has demonstrated her business ability and her merchandising talents. This June Lena Hodgen resigned as Housekeeper and for those who saw her quiet efficiency, the School will seem changed without her. Two others, Pi Phis, Joan ( Joni) Newcomer, Kansas Beta and Katherine (Katie) McIntosh, Alabama B, have been welcome additions to the official family. Ruth Dyer's expression, "Never a dull moment!" aptly describes the busy life of our staff. Miss Dyer herself never could be said to lead a leisurely existence nor a monotonous one for the she is in demand from morning till night. To read her report gives a full idea of her supervisory duties from overseeing the progress of the Staff House and its landscaping and that of the whole school to lecturing on her box or bird collections or passing out the diplomas at commencement time but it could never include all the unexpected demands. The Committee owes Miss Dyer a debt of gratitude for her vigilance and her interests in protecting Pi Phi possessions in Gatlinburg. Serv-ing as assistant to Miss Dyer is Joni Newcomer who, with her versatility has adapted herself quickly to the School and community needs. Joni has led a Girl Scout troop, taken charge of a young people's group and music at her church, lent her journalistic talents to the school and been most generous with her music on all occasions. At the Conclusion of the manual sent to each member of the staff it says, "The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee concurs in the opinion of the local committee that the interests of the school are best fostered when staff members participate in church and community enterprises." This, of course, is done in their own free time but each quickly finds herself drawn into church and community activity and makes her contribution willingly. Pi Beta Phi has provided four teachers to the County School in Gatlinburg this year and three, Mrs. Armstrong, Music, Ann Smith, Arts and Crafts, and Carl Huskey have been back with us this past year. The last named is on half-time but his contribution in teaching wood-working is valuable because many of the boys who do not go on to college are enabled, by his instruction, to find employment in the woodcraft shops of the area. They learn to handle safely the power machines and turn out commendable small pieces of furniture. Mrs. Aletha Armstrong continued her class work in Music with the elementary grades while directing the high school glee club, giving voice instruction for ten promising solo voices and preparing and producing two large performances during the year. Both of these used the grade and the high school students. In the Christmas play, "The Coming of the Prince of Peace" (Dickinson) the main continuity was handled by the Glee Club. In late spring the operetta "The Magic Nutcracker" (Tschaikovsky) was most successful. For both these productions Katie McIntosh practiced with them and served as the accompanist. Since she is a graduate in Music from the University of Alabama, her help was a great addition as was that of Ann Smith for settings and backgrounds. Mrs. Armstrong emphasizes that progress has been made in recognizing and developing the native voices and has expressed the need for a wire recorder in order that the young people may properly evaluate their tone and learn the value of voice training. This and money for still other fine records could well be suggestions for special club or chapter Christmas gifts. Ann Smith returned to complete her first full year of teaching Arts and Crafts after coming to us immediately after graduation from U.T. last March. The elementary pupils were exposed each week to developing their creativeness with everything from finger painting to the making of puppets. The 7th and 8th grade girls made match boxes, plastic bracelets, metal trays and Christmas decorations, to name a few. The boys did not take so readily to art but managed to show interest in poster making, metal work and crafts strip work. Two made very creditable lamps. There has to be much poster work for the school events which keep all students busy. There were classes of eleven and twelve each for the Junior and Senior girls, one hour daily wherein they did advanced metal work, made Christmas gifts and decorations. They entered these in the Christmas Garden Club Show and received a number of ribbons. Design and color were stressed all year. They worked also in leather and when weaving was offered, several advanced class girls made stoles. Entries were sent to two Arts and Crafts exhibits during the year: in the fall to the U.T. exhibit, and at the end of the year work from both grade and high 42 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW school went to Cherokee, N.C. for display. Ann is serving this summer as one of the Graduate Assistants at the Workshop. Mr. Chan Huskey, with a Master's degree came to us last fall from Sevierville High School to teach Physical Education and Health in the High School. The latter is taught only to the Sophomores each year and forty two completed the stipulated state text in May. In the gymnasium classes conditioning was given to all and there were intramurals and tournaments to arouse good class and school spirit. Games such as "Crows and crains," "Beater goes round," "Chain dodge ball," foreign to a western neophyte at least, were mixed with the old familiar relays, tugs of war, rope climbing, rooster fights, and arm wrestles. Basketball continues to hold high interest for both girls and boys. Twenty games were played in the district and our team was entered in the district tournament. Mr. Huskey, with the help of the rest of the faculty, conducted a field day for the entire school and swimming was included in the program for the final weeks of school, when a local pool was made available. It is unfortunate that the gymnasium is in-adequate because of size and small dressing room space. We hope that the County can provide some improvement in dressing room facilities before school opens in September. The County does not plan for any immediate building program in Gatlinburg though plans are on file. Two of the County schools burned within the past year and of necessity had to be replaced, and the County Superintendent told the Committee that the two story grade school building in the County seat is really unsafe structurally, and a fire-trap. We have had pleasant relations and cooperation with Mr. Roy Ledwell, County Superintendent, who is new this year and with Mr. Charles Clabo, Gatlin-burg representative on the County Board of Education. We also claim the president of the School Board, Mr. Ownby, as a friend since his wife teaches in our high school. The new principal for next year, Mr. Dewey Large has his Master's in School Administration and comes with high recommendations. The County Board is careful in consulting Miss Dyer on applications, which was a stipulation of the Pi Beta Phi County Lease Agreement some years ago, and is appreciated. We have been discouraged at the appearance and lack of maintenance of repairs which was also a stipulation of our agreement with the County and hope for better results next year. We ask that the teachers, whose salaries are paid by us, co-operate with the principal and superintendent in the same manner as do the other teachers. Three regular teachers, Schley Cardwell, 2nd grade, Carolyn Freshour, Home Economics, and Carl Lewelling, Commerce, have lived with our staff this past year and were claimed as part of our official family. With politics what they are in the Tennessee legislature, some one said, "This was not the year for Schools," though free text books were voted. We shall probably wait for some time for a revived interest in new Gatlinburg school plans. The P.T.A. has become an increasingly active organization in support of the needs of the school. This year, they have again operated the school lunch room, earned sufficient to replace the cyclorama on the school auditorium stage and have purchased a spinet piano for the auditorium. They also assisted our nurse in the preliminary arrangements for the Pre-school Round-up examinations. The Health Center continues to be a vital part of the Settlement School plant, as shown by the summation here given though it does not reveal all the ac-tivities of our nurse, Marjorie Chalmers, nor the difficulty in finding proper balance between the length of office hours and visits to the outlying district schools and the mountain homes.

However, in spite of vacation, the business class students gave up those days to assist in making out the necessary records. The doctors of the town cooperate fully with our program and are cognizant of the tremendous contribution which our Health Center gives to the cornmunity health and welfare. This past year Marjorie was active in the area polio drive and in conference with local, district and state representatives in Civil Defense. This spring she was appointed to the State Women's Advisory Committee for Civil Defense. Her weekly "Health Shots" which has appeared for five years in the Gatlinburg Press has proved a fine means of disseminating wise preventive information not only to the town itself but to a widened area through the paper's circulation elsewhere. We are ever appreciative of the assistance provided by Sigma Phi Gamma, national business women's organization, whose philanthropic services in Eye Correction extend through the mountain areas. Several different chapters have our Health Center assigned them each year and their donations to us widen our sphere of service. The Loan Closet, in large part supplied by the Pi Beta Phis from everywhere has its contents ever on the move. Sick room supplies and baby scales are usually returned but the layettes always need replenishing and new or used clothing in good condition, for all ages, is a special need every year. The contributions are welcomed and appreciated when loaned or given. Arrowcraft continues to produce its lovely products and the Pi Phis continue to find new markets for them. Accenting the length of time we have been in production was the party which Mrs. Muellr and Mrs. McMorran gave the weavers this spring, for on that occasion nine weavers were honored for having woven for Arrowcraft over a twenty five year period. A project is worthy which contributes toward the support of sixty or more weavers, most particularly during this period of high living costs. But when one realizes that the proceeds from all the combined sales also help to pay the salaries and to maintain the Settlement School as it should be, one recognizes our need for your continued help and our great appreciation for all each club does. Space does not permit the listing of sales amounts for every club but by turning to the Province Vice Presidents' charts in this ARROW, one may find just what any club has done up to May 31. Eight clubs THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 43 exceeded $1000. sales in 1952. We appreciate the promptness in payments this year and the fact that so many others have augmented their sales to pass the thousand dollar mark. Here are those whose paid-up purchases topped the thousand mark; there would have been several others included, had they settled their accounts before the auditor's visit. 1. Champaign-Urbana, III $2,153.41 2. Philadelphia, Pa 1,634.12 3. Coos County, Ore 1,580.4() 4. Houston, Tex 1,528.89 5. Pasadena, Calif 1,494.89 6. Pittsburgh, Pa 1,488.53 7.

Albuquerque, N.Mex 1,079.25 15. Bloomfield Hills, Mich 1,040.00 I am sure that each of you can appreciate that Katie McIntosh, Bookkeeper, would have a far easier task if every club, chapter, and person purchasing from Arrowcraft were to pay her bills promptly. Arrowcraft is a business and too, must meet its bills. When goods are sold, please pay promptly, or if not, return them for credit well within the time limit. It seems unfair that an incoming club Settlement School sales chair-man be faced with hold-over balances due. 1952-53 proved to be a big shipping season. Even with good imagination it is hard to think in terms of more than 800 skirts, over 300 stoles, 1900 seamless bags or Whig Rose doilies to the number of 6000. These examples attest the beauty of the designing by Tina McMorran, head of the Weaving department. The coming year, some of the articles will be available only "as long as they last" but new patterns will sup-plant the out-going ones. There are new cotton plaid fringed table mats in blues and browns to accompany cottage pottery: a new baby blanket; a new evening purse made so that no federal tax need be added; a new blue skirt; pillow covers, high-lighted with metallic threads; beautiful wide belts to which may be added a wooden buckle of walnut or cherry or maple; and bands for luggage racks, just to name a few. Assisting Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. McMorran in sales and weaving are Edna Cook, Ruby Watson, Nellie Cook and Susie Maples. Edna who has been with Arrowcraft six years divides her time between assisting Mrs. McMorran with the weavers and helping in the sales room. Ruby and Nellie are salesgirls while Susie, clad in one of our colorful cotton skirts, demonstrates at the loom, weaving the sparkling pillow tops. Mrs. Edna McCutchan is in charge of the branch shop in the lobby of the Mountain View Hotel. In addition to the returns in money from your sales, we are grateful for all the general contributions and for the effort and sacrifice which they represent. May we again call your attention to the policy which states that when a benefit is advertised in the name of the Settlement School, all amounts above expenses must go to our philanthropy. The fraternity lawyer also states that the fraternity may not sanction exemption from federal tax on admission tickets unless the money comes to the School. The Committee would refer you to the Chart of the Settlement School Income and Expense Dollars in your files and which may also be found in the1952 Information Arrow, page 62. (Correction: "Activities" should read "Actives.") The sample year shows an average income and outgo and why larger donations would he helpful. "School facility operation" requires 30% of every dollar received, "Instruction" amounts to 22%, the "Summer Workshop," 13%, "Additions to Reserve and Sinking Fund," 15%, which leaves a remaining 20% to provide for Replacements, Insurance, Repairs and Committee management expense. Over a period of some years, I have hoped to see a contribution from every single club and chapter but appreciation is no less sincere for all that has been given. An accolade goes to the St. Louis alumna club for again sending its annual thousand dollars, which it has done for many years. Another Epsilon province club, Kansas City, Mo. stands second with $700.00 to its credit. Our Grand Vice President must be very proud of her own club and of her province, too! The following clubs and chapters are on the honor roll this year, with contributions of one hundred fifty dollars or more (clubs) and sixty dollars or .more from the chapters. Clubs Chapters St. Louis, Mo. . .$1000.00 Missouri B $ 125.00 Kansas City, Mo. 700.00 Texas A 100.00 Milwaukee, Wis. 300.00 California I' 100.00 Cleveland-East 225.00 Louisiana A 85.00 Indianapolis, Ind. 210.00 Illinois El 75.00 Philadelphia, Pa. 200.00 Kansas B 75.00 Denver, Colo. ..... 200.00 Colorado A 75.00 N. New jersey .... 175.00 Nebraska B 68.59 Houston, Tex 150.00 Wisconsin I' 65.00 Missouri A 60.00 Twelve other clubs were in the $100. bracket and eight other chapters gave between $50. and $60.00. From the Magazine Agency profits this year our treasury received $7,532.10. This amount could be greatly augmented if every club inspired every member to subscribe for at least one magazine through the fraternity agency, and every chapter member sent one subscription to her family as a gift. Shall we consider our work in Gatlinburg finished and seek some other type of philanthorpy? Think first of the place we hold in the fraternity world, for our educational service to those outside Pi Beta Phi. Would you withdraw the benefits of our Health program relieving the over-taxed doctors of school inspections, inoculations and consultations on minor difficulties or accidents, the pre-natal advice and care given to new mothers, or First Aid to the school children, week after week? The program of sanitation, disease prevention and health preservation would have a tremendous set-back. The Workshop program is well launched and has a large future as it is expanded; many students returning to their many states carry a wide-spread message of the fraternity's influence not only on the handicrafts of the southern mountains but on every helpful and healthful objective of that vicinity. No money donated to us is spent other than on the Settlement School program and the withdrawal of these funds would have the wrong economic effect upon the community. Should we sacrifice the service we give our weavers and lose prestige as we display and sell the beautiful articles made for Arrowcraft and distributed all over the United States? It does not necessarily follow that we shall always have direct obligations in secondary education for the Gatlinburg school system, but when one goes to Gatlinburg and talks with the pioneers, the older established residents or the doctors rather than. the newcomers in business, eager for the tourist trade but 44 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW with less knowledge of the long development of the area, one knows that Pi Beta Phi is needed and appreciated. The future program will change, adjust itself to new conditions, but we could ill afford to discontinue our interests. With the majority of fraternity members believing in the School and our efforts there, we must continue our support to the best of our ability. This past month I heard an address by the president of one of our western colleges in which he referred to the sequence which sometimes occurs in the treatment of a worth-while activity: "First, we Choose it; Then we Use it; And then, if we Abuse it, It follows that we Lose it." CHOOSE USE ABUSE LOSE ! I earnestly hope this sequence will not obtain in our Settlement School, on account of the few rumblings heard, to the effect that our project has served its purpose. It is always wonderful to discover how many fine and able Pi Phis there are. In no place is this more quickly demonstrated than in service on the Settlement School Committee. The duties are many and the time for action, short. I have ever been appreciative of the Committee's assistance but particularly duringthe past two years when the burdens have been doubly heavy. Each member has responded hand. sorely to the extra calls for help. At this summer's meeting, Louise W. Nobler, Washington Beta, former Lambda Province Vice President of Everett, Washington was "pledged" to the Committee. She will serve as . Public Relations members and will edit "News of Little Pigeon" in the ARROW. Virginia Brackett Green, Indiana Gamma, former Delta Province Vice President, assumes the duties of the Chairman. This report concludes twenty two years and more of close official contact with the fraternity and I would register my gratitude for the privilege of this service. During this time the Settlement School has become very real and very dear to me. For my successor I can only wish the same heart-warming associations and in-creased opportunities for service in Pi Beta Phi. The Grand Council, all officers, the Staff and the Commit-tee members have ever been ready to show their cooperation and their commendation. I wish also to express my gratitude to the alum= clubs, active chapters and individual Pi Phis who, by their encouragement and their continued support have made possible the maintenance of our philanthropy. RUTH BARRETT SMITH REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL 1953 A pebble dropped into still water produces an ever-widening circle of ripples. In much the same way the first Settlement School workers introduced new ideas in education, sanitation, industry, and ways of living that have enlarged and grown with the years, ever spreading and enlarging that influence. Workers may come and go, Committee membership change, the economy of the village undergo startling transformations, but the idea of service to the mountain people remains the same as when this Memorial to our Founders was started forty-one years ago. Community Building of all sorts of tourist courts, shops and restaurants has been almost continuous throughout the year with little slowdown during the winter months. The Riverside Hotel had its "face lifted," and now has an exterior something like Mount Vernon. The Mountain View built new shuffleboard courts on the corner adjoining our property and changed the swampy ground across the street by draining it and making the river channel deeper before filling in the ground. A new Catholic church is being built in the Airport field, and we are at last to have a new building for the Post Office. Bruce Whaley is building a two-story stone and frame structure to house the Post Office and a craft shop on the first floor, with offices and apartments on the upper floor. The American Legion paid off the indebtedness on its property and is now working towards funds for a building. All these physical changes caused one newspaper reporter to refer to the town as "a Miami Beach without an ocean front, an Atlantic City without a beauty pageant, or a Colorado Springs without 16,000-foot mountains." He also added that 95 per cent of the business enterprises, from taxi service to hotels, is owned by natives of the area and that just a few miles from town you will still find the old time way of life being lived in cabin homes. The local people are much engrossed with all this business during the touristseason, but later in the year find time to meet socially and to work for worthy causes. Union church services were held on special occasions. The Thanksgiving service was held in the Baptist church with the new Methodist minister, Reverend Spurgeon McCartt, preaching the sermon. There was a service outside by the community Christmas tree when the lights were turned on, and at Easter there was the usual sunrise service on the Greystone lawn. Girl Scouting in the village is being carried on by an enthusiastic group of young mothers and others. Over 100 girls are participating in the program. The local leaders were hostesses to a one-day Area Workshop for Leaders held at the Assembly Grounds in October. National Girl Scout week was observed with an Open House at the New Gatlinburg Inn recreation room, and the Court of Awards was held one Sunday afternoon in the basement of the Baptist church. One troop of Boy Scouts is quite active, but the lack of leaders hinders a wider participation in that program. All of the local children were guests of the American Legion at their annual Christmas party held at the Cherokee Theater. This is a gay occasion with candy, gifts, and fun for all. The children who were not too fortunate were remembered well by local people, especially by the Santa who delivers gifts in costume and works hard for several months at the projects. He is Mr. Byron Herbold, a local chef. He and his wife have no children, but they spend hours working for the poor and needy. At Easter, the churches sponsored an egg hunt for all children on the Whittle lawn. The local Garden Club again had an outstanding show of Christmas greens and arrangements at the December meeting. The lobby of the Mountain View was filled with the different entries. Here again the children were included. Miss Smith worked with her art classes, Miss Freshour with the home economics classes, and the Girl Scout troops all brought interesting items for the show. Fund-raising for the Polio Fund by having a big party at one of the hotels has THE SEPTEMBER ARROW been an annual practice. The one this year was held at the Greystone Playhouse and was most successful. The receipts were $1,800.00 from the party and the polio candles that had been placed around town in different business places. It was fun to have Marianne Wild, Olivia Moore and Ruth Smith as our guests at the affair and to help eat the cake that Marianne won on a chance. Another benefit party was the one given by the \X''omen's Auxiliary of the Episcopal Guild. This netted them $335.00. A drive for the Red Cross and one for the benefit of the village library were carried on and were fairly successful. The young girls from our house had a good time when they helped serve as hostesses at the Fox Hunters Ball. That association met in Sevier County for their 59th Annual Field Trials during November, with the social affairs being held in Gatlinburg. October was a beautiful month with the exception of many forest fires in the surrounding mountains. We had none in the Park area, but did have overcast skies and were worried about the lack of rain and the constant threat of real danger, should a big fire get started. The weather was not so favorable when the third annual Wildflower Pilgrmage was held in the spring. It was rainy, but that did not seem to dampen the enthusiasm of the people who came from many places to study the flowers in the Park. Another spring event was the Horse Show, sponsored by the local Lions Club. It was something new to Gatlinburg. I do not think the Club made any money and they certainly worked hard putting on the affair, but it did prove interesting to tourists and locals alike. Changes in Staff and Physical Plant Perhaps of more interest than community affairs have been the changes in our own staff: Joan New-comer, Kansas Beta, came last July to take Lillian's place as my assistant. She has fitted into our life beatitifully and besides doing an efficient job at the school has contributed to community activities through her Girl Scout troop and work with the choir and the youth program at the Methodist church. She has been in demand as an entertainer, giving willingly of her talents. Another new staff member is Katie Mc-Intosh, Alabama Beta, who came to us right from college to help as bookkeeper at the Arrowcraft Shop. Katie was a music major and plays the organ at the Episcopal church and directs the choir, besides helping Mrs. Armstrong with the music program at the school. Ethel Snow resigned and left the school in December. It seemed strange without her, for she had been such a part of the school life in Gatlinburg for many years that her loyalty and talents were almost taken for granted. In February Mrs. Marion Mueller, Indiana Gamma, came to take over the Shop. She has proved to be very efficient, and in the few months she has been here has the situation well in hand. The Fraternity can be proud of its new representatives at the Settlement School. The year has marked many improvements in buildings. Stuart, Pollard, and Teachers Cottages, and the Health Center have all been painted. The barn was given a fresh coat of red paint, and the dormitory boys did the same for the brooder houses. Most important was the completion of the new Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House, the car port, and the setting for the house. A fieldstone retaining wall with the lichens carefully placed on the front side, a rustic bridge across the drainage ditch, slate sidewalks resembling stepping stones, a new lawn sloping gently down to the path across the field, and plantings around the house have taken hours of time and effort. There is still much to be done, butthe essential things have been taken care of. '1 house is lovely and those of us who are privileged live in it are more than grateful to everyone who made the dream of a new staff house a reality. School The year started out well, with a complete fact] and an enrollment of 510, 32 more girls than be Due to several causes, before the year ended a numl of changes in the faculty had been made. The F ternity enriched the curriculum and helped to m the school an accredited one by providing seve teachers. Mr. Chan Huskey served his first year teacher of physical education and coached the bask ball teams very well. Mrs. Aletha Armstrong ag taught the music classes and worked with cho groups, Ann Smith had the work in arts and cra. and Mr. Carl Huskey taught the high school bi woodworking. Marjorie looked after the health of student body with their daily first aid requests, and the spring had a fulltime job when we had our sh of epidemics of measles, mumps, chicken pox, whooping cough. In addition to these regular si members we were happy in that the two young Phis working at their own jobs were able to c tribute so much to the school program. Joni used talents in various ways and Katie accompanied Mrs. Armstrong. The usual events followed each ot in the general pattern of all schools. The gay cola leaves decorating the grade school blackboards g way to Pilgrams, turkeys, and pumpkins, and then jolly Santas and Christmas trees. There was no school carnival at Halloween, but the first six gra had a colorful costume parade with prizes for different classes. Football suits were laid aside al a fairly successful season, and basketball became favorite sport. "Strictly Formal" was the junior ci play given in the fall. Miss Margretta Craig, a r English teacher, was the class sponsor and direc the play. It was fun, especially for us, for -two the dormitory girls had parts. There was the us two-day vacation at Thanksgiving and two we for Christmas. December was such a short sch month with many things crowded into the days. the rooms had parties with the mother furnishing freshments. Pi Phi chapters and alumnae clubs r vided an orange for every child in school, and tl~. were individual gifts for the children in the first f grades. The older grades received nice books for ti room libraries, and one grade got the athletic eqt ment that the Cleveland Alumnae Club always ser We always have charming Christmas programs, bi thought Mrs. Armtrong quite outdid herself on one last year. It was in the nature of a Nativity of ancient Christmas songs and carols called Coming of the Prince of Peace." The children sani sweetly and the staging was specially good. Every helped make it a success: Ann, Arlie, Neal, and all grade school teachers. Katie's accompaniment lovely. January and February were busy months, the high school students having semester exam. Lions. Valentine parties in all the elementary grg gave color and happiness to those children. ' seniors sponsored a big party for the high sci students proving that red hearts and cupids can ti even a high school boy. By March several epider were causing much absenteeism in the school teacher had to miss over three weeks with a case of whooping .cough, and another one had emergency operation. Mr. Jack Miller resigned, 1 ing another vacancy. The problem was solved by use of student teachers from the University of 46 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW nessee. Mr. Lewelling was shifted to Mr. Miller's commercial classes and the student teachers took over the other work. A group of fourteen were assigned to Gatlinburg for their work in practice teaching. It would have been hard to finish' the year without their help. The senior class play, "A Broom for the Bride," was well cast and well given. The home economics teacher, Miss Carolyn Freshour, was one of the class sponsors and directed the play. Another project of the seniors was the school annual. I doubt if this book would ever have gone to press if Joni had not come to the rescue with her knowledge of journal-ism and helped them meet the deadline. Dorothy Manley worked up a small operetta for the third grade students called "The Magic Word." A more ambitious operetta was the annual one given by Mrs. Armstrong. She had many discouragements for so many of the children were out of school on ac-count of illness, Katie got sick, and at the last minute, Mr. Armstrong had a heart attack! Joni came to the rescue again, playing the difficult score, and the play went on. The twenty-one seniors finished their school days with a trip to Washington, D.C. They had been well-instructed as to what they were to see, and I think got a great deal out of the experience. They returned to final examinations and Commencement activities. The Baccalaureate service was held in the Methodist church with Reverend McCartt preaching the sermon. The high school chorus, under Mrs. Armstrong's direction, provided the music. Class night was held in the High School auditorium. It was a clever little program written and directed by Joni, called "Graduation Choo Choo." The Commencement exercises were held in the Baptist church. Dean I. N. Carr from Carson Newman College gave the address. He is from a family that came from this area and he went to our school as a child. At a dinner I gave preceding the * program, he spoke of the changes in the community, and again during his talk he spoke of that and of the work done by the Fraternity during the years. During the summer of 1952, three of our teachers completed work on their Bachelor's degrees. This helped give Gatlinburg a very good rating in their instructional staff in a county where there are still many permit teachers. Next year, Mr. Dewy Large will replace Mr. Walter Ogle as principal. He has a master's de.7,ree in school administration and has many plans for improving the school. We have a new County Superintendent of Schools, Mr. Roy Ledwell, who was long connected with Sevier County High School. Mr. Charlie Clabo replaced Mr. Fred Ingle on the Board of Education, and we are to have a new janitor. With the County and the Fraternity working together, we will be able to have a better school than we had last year if all the plans work out. P.T.A. The school lunch program was again sponsored by this organization. Mrs. Morrell gave efficient service and the children were well fed. More free lunches had to be provided than in the past several years. Of all the money-making projects, rummage sales are one of the favorite P.T.A. methods. These sales are held in the school music room, always on the day the Pi Phi weavers receive their monthly checks. The sales usually bring in about an average of $120.00. One sale helped buy new suits for the girls' basketball team, another helped pay for the gray cyclorama curtains for the stage, and a third was used for lockers in the hall. The really big project was the second Minstrel Show. This was written and directed by alocal man, Harry M. Bird. He has had experience with such shows before and really put on a grand entertainment. The goal was a new piano for the assembly room towards which the county Board had promised 8300.00. Enough was realized to buy the piano and to have a "dolly" made for it so it can be moved into a safe place when the gym is used for basketball games. Some good programs were given at the monthly meetings with good average attendance and interest in the work of the organization in its efforts to help both the parents and the school. Dormitory Twelve dormitory students lived at the school during the year. Of the eight girls, one was Martha Houser, Mary's senior daughter, three were juniors, and the other five were second year students. Joni chaperoned the girls, and the four boys were under Mr. Lewelling's care. Two boys were sophomores and the other two were freshmen. All of the girls and boys, with possibly one exception, were good students and very capably executed their work assignments. We again had trouble finding a cook except for the winter months when our good Leona was free from her restaurant job. The rest of the time we had some help from others, but mostly it was Miss Hodgen who fed the family. The girls were good help, but the whole situation was not fair, although seemingly unavoidable. Of course, the'move into the new house was the main event of the year. The management of the Greystone Hotel offered a crew of men for the job of moving the stoves, refrigerator, and heavy kitchen equipment. They came one Saturday morning, and with the help of our regular men and the dormitory boys and girls, everything was installed and we had our first meal that night, December 6th. The boys moved out of Pollard into the rooms vacated at Teachers Cottage by the staff moving into the new house, and that old house was closed until time for Workshop students to occupy it. The first social affair in the new house was the Open House honoring Ethel Snow on December 15th. It was a nasty, cold day, but we had many guests. Among these were several of the weavers, all of whom had been sent a special invitation, and a party of friends from the University who had helped plan certain things about the house. It is a lovely place in which to entertain large groups, and that day the holiday decorations made the setting especially effective. Our local alumnie presided at the punch bowl. Since then we have entertained a number of times. We held an open house for the members of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild during their spring meeting, and a coffee party for the student teachers and our regular teachers and staff. One group from the Council of Southern Mountain Workers met in the lounge for two meetings. Miss Hodgen entertained the Methodist ladies one afternoon, and the ladies from the Episcopal church met with Tina and Katie another afternoon. Marjorie had her bridge club for a dessert luncheon, and one evening another club met with her. We have entertained at several dinner parties the local ministers and their families and other friends. There were two Christmas parties at Stuart, one for the dormitory students, and one for Joni's Scout troop. Mrs. Henry has again used the living room and piano at Stuart for her music pupils and since she lives in Pigeon Forge is most appreciative of the privilege. Health Center Gatlinburg without a Health Center and a Pi Phi nurse ! I imagine the community would regard such a THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 47 situation as a real calamity, for from the time the local babies are brought to the Health Center to be weighed and given their first inoculations, through pre-school examinations and their school years until perhaps they have children of their own, the Health Center with our nurse, kindly Marjorie Chalmers, has been considered a haven. The small pebble dropped by the first nurse, Phyllis Higinbotham, Ontario Alpha, thirty-three years ago, started ripples that are still expanding in the area. Different clinics are held at the Health Center during the year. These include the one for pre-school children entering the first grade, and about two yearly visits from the state mobile X-Ray unit. Marjorie's Friday afternoon clinic hours bring many young mothers for counsel and advice. During the school year, she is kept busy looking after the health needs of the 500 children in our school and in making visits to three rural schools, giving nursing service to the childen enrolled there. In the field of community work, she worked with the county polio unit and was chosen to attend a study course in atomic nursing that was given at Nashville. Two of the meetings of the health division of the Council of Southern Mountain Workers were held at the Health Center. The members admired greatly our modern building and equipment. We acknowledged with gratitude the gifts sent especially for the health pro-gram. Sigma Phi Gamma International Sorority gives us money through the Council of Southern Mountain Workers to be used for eye and dental corrections. Through the kindness of a Maryville oculist and a local dentist, this money stretches over a number of needy cases. A Christmas gift of fifteen dollars from the Portland Alumni Club was added to this fund. Chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma are assigned to help us and gifts of small items useful to the nurse and even money come from time to time. In our own membership there are individuals and alumnm clubs that send layettes, something that we have never had a surplus of since I have been here. Farm Our farmer has suffered the usual vicissitudes due to the weather either too much or too little rainfall. Wet weather was responsible for the need of a string of tile to drain the side garden into the spring, and the dry weather ruined some of the garden crops. Some seeds lay dormant and never did come up, while other vegetables died from lack of water. We have had quite a few things for the table, but not much of the sweet corn we are all so fond of. Richard has helped Arlie and Neal with the work of getting the new lawn seeded and in shape. For clays the dormitory boys spent their working hours picking up the rocks that had been left by the graders. We had especially good luck with the baby chicks and have had good egg production all year. Arroweraf! The year has been a busy one with many changes. New faces in management and sales staff have made no radical change in the operation of the shop. We are getting used to having Marion Mueller in Ethel's place, Katie at Mrs. Cole's desk, and two new sales-girls in charge of selling our lovely merchandise to the tourists. Ethel had to set up the Convention Shop, which is always a task. Those of you who were at the Shamrock will remember we had an especially fine display, Fall shipping was very heavy with no let-up until just before Christmas. Business has been good at both of the shops. Tourists are always interested in seeing a loom in operation, so we have hadone set up in the front salesroom with a weaver demonstrating on it. Irene Wilson wove the drapery material that Tina designed for the lounge and hall of our new Staff House on that loom, and at present Susie Maples makes the shuttle fly. Last summer, Tina was given leave of absence to attend a six weeks workshop at the Inter-Mountain Indian School in Utah where she worked under the famous Dorothy Liebes. She and Irene demonstrated at the Crafts-man's Fair in Asheville last July. Edna helped sell our products in the booth that we shared with the McDonalds (pottery), Marian Heard and Jane Glass (jewelry), and Mr. Ronald Slayton (wood products), formerly with the University of Tennessee. Arrowcraft weavings were exhibited at the Cherokee Indian Fair and were entered at the Fall Craft Show held at the University of Tennessee. In recognition of the weavers who have worked continuously for Pi Phi for many years, Marion Mueller and Tina arranged a party which was held at the Staff House. Seven weavers with a record of twenty-five years of service to Arrow-craft were the honored guests. Each was given a Stuart Nye pin suitably engraved on the back. All enjoyed the visiting and there was much recalling of old times. They sang some old harp songs before we had refreshments. These consisted of punch and a cake beautifully decorated with an arrow. Everyone regretted that Ethel Snow was not present, for she knew all the weavers. It would have been nice if our former weaving designer, Jene Redding, could have been there, for she had started many of this group weaving "for the school." Jene had seen many of them earlier in the spring when she was our guest for a few days. She was invited to give a talk at the spring meeting of the Southern Highland 'Handicraft Guild held at the Greystone Hotel, coming down from Boston where she now operates her own weaving service. Summer Activities Pi Phi Visitors and Staff House Dedication Our official Pi Phi family held meetings in town during the summer. Grand Council, the Settlement School Committee and then the Province Officers arrived. We were delighted to have them here. Committee arranged for a lovely dinner, a tour of the grounds with meetings with the local resident staff and several of the teachers hired by the Fraternity, a visit to Arrowcraft and for them to be present at the formal dedication of the staff house. This was a simple ceremony held in the lounge with local Pi Phi alum-rue and friends of the school also in attendance. To all of us the highlight was when the building was dedicated and named the "Ruth Barrett Smith Staff House." No name could have been more fitting nor an honor more deserved. As Chairman of the Settlement School Committee, Ruth Smith, had worked untiringly for this house; from the time that the site and architect were selected until the building stood, completed. She was aided by her husband, Warren T. Smith, a builder of experience, who flew from Oregon at his own expense to help with the many complicated details involved in letting the contract for the house. His advice was invaluable and saved the Fraternity hundreds of dollars. We regretted that he could not have been present at the ceremony to hear the tributes paid to Ruth and her modest speech of acceptance of the honor. The name plaque of wrought iron which is in place by the front door reminds us all of the unselfish service of a person who leaves the Committee this year. I think that everyone present at the dedication was impressed with Pi Phis close bonds of 48 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW friendship, tangibly expressed in a beautiful building which will add to the effectiveness of the work done at the Settlement School. In 1952, summer schools at most universities and colleges showed a decrease in the number of registrations. This was also true of our Craft Workshop, but the group was an enthusiastic and talented one. Even a person with only a slight knowledge of good crafts, when attending one of the open house exhibits, could realize that the work turned out was superior in design and quality of workmanship. Courses were offered in Weaving, Metal, Jewelry, Pottery, and Wood Working. Interesting trips to other craft centers, such as those in Asheville, Cherokee, and Brasstown, North Carolina, were a part of the pro-gram. The group enjoyed several picnics in the mountains. We always make so many new friends among the students that it is with real regret we see the sessions end. The Gateway Stock Company again rented the school auditorium for the season. Mr. John Richards brings down from New York a groupof talented young actors who appear in five different plays during the season. Space does not permit my listing the gifts that have come to the school during the year. The special Pi Phi shelf in the high school library holds many lovely new volumes given as memorials. We have received money for speech records for the English classes and musical recordings for the music department. Christmas gifts for the children were many and varied. We again sent individual gifts to the students in three rural schools, remembered the lower grades in our school; and there were special gifts and clothing for the dormitory students from the Terre Haute Alum= Club. These gifts came from all over the United States and from Honolulu. They are typical representations of the affectionate interest held by our large membership for the Settlement School. We express gratitude for these gifts, for the unselfish devotion of the members of the Settlement School Committee, and for our loyal local employees. Respectfully submitted, RUTH DYER, Director Great Potential for Character Building Pointing out how the fraternity may become an educational institution of great significance, Dr. Thomas A. Brady, Vice President of the University of Missouri, has listed these propositions as basic: "1. The educational institution should be concerned not only with formal instruction but with the building of character and the social integration of the individual as well. "2. Formal instruction alone, being entirely verbal and visual, can impart truths and correct principles but will not serve as a substitute for daily experience in molding the individual. "3. The experience most effective in molding the character of the student is that which he receives in daily contact with others of his own age." Dr. Brady's argument for the fraternity, then, requires one further step. "This would be the contention that, granted the importance of experience with students his own age, the greatest achievement in the building character may be made if (a) the association is voluntary, and (b) if the students themselves, under proper guidance have as large a voice as possible in managing and directing the organization which makes the corporate life possible." Dr. Brady's views were expressed in an address at the 29th biennial convention of Phi Kappa, a general fraternity for Catholic men. From "Quiet Please" in Fraternity Month Earl F. Schoening, Secretary-Treasurer of Phi Sigma Kappa, had this to say, "A fraternity should be what it was fundamentally designed to be: a social organization to make for a more congenial and a more pleasant college life than could otherwise be had; a richer undergraduate experience because in carrying on the work of the social organization, officers and members acquire lessons which stand them in good stead after college. They can learn something of leadership and financial management. I feel strongly that fraternity membership is an asset to any man in after-college life whether he admits it or not." THE SEPT.EMSER ARROW TREASURER OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL Little Rock, Arkansas August 6, 1953 Mrs. Thomas E. Graham, Treasurer Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Oklahoma City, Oklahoma DEAR MRS.

For all but two of the six, visiting the memorial to our Founders was a new thrill and they were inspired and impressed, not only with the beauty of the house but with the feeling that it is a vital living center of social activity in Monmouth. Mrs. Mabel Johnson who came to Holt House in December of 1950 is gracious and charming and rep-resents the Fraternity well. The committee enjoyed her hospitality while in Monmouth and left with the assurance that she is taking care and the pride in the house as she would her own home. She has welcomed visitors from many states. During the year 1952-53, Sept. to June, Holt House was used sixty-nine times as a meeting place or as a setting for private entertaining. Illinois Alpha and the Monmouth Alumna Club enjoyed the use of it for initiation and for Founders' Day and for two or three rush parties. Two clubs from neighboring towns held meetings there. Three groups in Monmouth rent the house for their monthly meetings and others use it two or three times a year. The Monmouth PEO meets at the house monthly as does the Women's Club of Monmouth, also the Arrow Mothers' Club. Not counting the times the house was used by Pi Phi groups or by regular renters, the house accommodated, on nine-teen occasions, private parties of varied nature, wed-ding receptions, rehearsal dinners, showers, bridge parties and teas. Other groups using the house this year are: New Century Club, DAR, Fortnightly Club, OGM and the Hospital Auxiliary, and three sororities. Holt House is indeed a charming home in which to entertain. Because Monmouth College is celebrating its Centennial this year, the house was offered to the college to be used for any function during Commencement Week or any time during the spring. In thanking the committee chairman for the offer, Dr. Gibson, President of Monmouth College, wrote, "We do appreciate the variety of ways in which Holt House not only serves our college but serves the community. We are indebted to Pi Phi for a great many things, and we are proud of the current group of girls on our campus as well as the fine alumnae chapter in our community." The first gift to be received after the Houston Convention was an I.C. pin sent by Vera Wattles Kirkpatrick, Nebraska Beta, of Corpus Christi, Texas. The pin was given to her years ago by an aunt, Carrie Wattles Swinder, initiated into Iowa Gamma in 1883, who died November 5, 1945. The pin is lovely and has been placed in the shadow box which we are now using for old pins. Last fall Mr. Earl Bridge of Detroit sent to Holt House a large, beautiful silver tray that had belonged to his wife, Evelyn Holliday Bridge, who died last spring. She was a former Monmouth resident and was on the Holt House Committee at the time of her death. The tray has been appropriately engraved and is being used at many teas and parties given at the house. A group of Detroit and Dearborn Pi Phis recently sent a check for $50.00 to be used at the discretion of the Holt House Committee to purchase a needed and worth-while memorial to Evelyn Bridge who, the letter. states, "was one of the outstanding and diligent workers in our club and in COMMITTEE lieu of flowers at the time of her death this fund was started." It is hoped that other groups will choose to follow this kind of a memorial for their deceased friends. Washington Alpha has sent a beautiful blue and white quilt; the Arrow and Chain appears in four places, the names of the founders living at the time the quilt was made, are embroidered, and in the center block "Grace Coolidge, Vermont Alpha." Special gifts to Holt House include $25.00 from the Milwaukee Club, $25.00 from the Kansas City Missouri Club, and $9.15 from the Joliet, Illinois Club to be used for a dozen silver spoons. These gifts are in addition to the annual donations sent by these clubs. The Committee is most appreciative of the financial support accorded the house by the many contributing chapters and alumna clubs. Total contributions were somewht below those of the preceding year however, and total expenditures were slightly higher. The number of contributing alumni clubs decreased from 213 to 199 for this year. Active chapter contributors decreased from 89 to 81. Total contributions are $349.70 less than last year. The only province to reach 100% this year is Delta which has reached this goal for several years. The clubs in Theta Province reached 100% as did the chapters in Epsilon, Kappa, Lambda and Zeta Provinces. The highest contributors were: $50.00-California Louisiana A Kansas City, Mo. Club $35.00-Oklahoma A $34.00 Akron, Ohio Club $30.00 Tennessee B $25.00-Kansas B Texas B Monmouth, Ill. Club North Shore, Ill. Club Pittsburgh, Pa. Club Monetarily, Kappa Province contributions were highest, with Eta Province second, the same as last year. Next in place came Beta Province, then Mu and in fifth place, Epsilon Province. The committee found the furnishings most complete, however some repairs and replacements were necessary. A sidewalk from the rear door to the drive-way and a loading platform there, were installed. A casing around the furnace was replaced, the furnace cleaned, and the humidifier was re-conditioned. The piano was tuned, and one string was replaced. This summer a rug for the Pine Room must be purchased, and the two Holt House films repaired or replaced. The Holt House Chairman is grateful for the continued cooperation of the committee members. The Treasurer, Torrance Etheridge, has been most efficient and thorough in the handling of Holt House funds and has been very prompt in her reports; her annual report is most complete. Marion Tyte has served as secretary of the committee, taking minutes of our Monmouth conference, and typing and mailing copies to committee members and to the Grand President and Grand Vice-President. Gertrude Leetz has kept up the house inventory that was so well-compiled by Mrs. McMurray of Peoria. Louise Campbell, the Monmouth member of the committee has had complete charge of the 57
