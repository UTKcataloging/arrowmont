NEWS FROM LITTLE PIG-EON EDITED BY SARAH POMEROY RUGG, Massachusetts A From time to time we have recorded in these pages the development of various phases of work of our School, industrial, medical, social, all of which have left a decided impress on the community of Gatlinburg. It is a long time since we have devoted space to a discussion of the purely educational side of the work from the viewpoint of the schoolroom. Yet it is the oldest part of our entire settlement scheme and in the schoolroom life lies the greatest hope for the future. For this reason space in this issue is given over entirely to consideration of this topic and no one is so well able to discuss it as the highly successful principal of our Pi Beta Phi School. TALES OF CLASSROOM AND PLAYGROUND BY HELEN CHEW To tell you that we have a five-roomed schoolhouse, 110 pupils en-rolled, seven teachers, ten grades, with courses in cooking, sewing, weaving and shop work would hardly help you to recognize our school as an institution somewhat different from other schools of its class. And no doubt the same everyday trials and pleasures of all schoolrooms are experienced here, for boys and girls are alike the world over. But the little personalities of the children, developed through generations of isolation, give the school a character which is almost indefinable. It is through these little characteristics that you learn to know institutions as well as human life. It would take an able pen to bring our school to you in such a way, but adding this little glimpse of school life to the health work and farm activities about which you have been reading this year, you may be able to recognize the school as a whole in its vital relation to our community. The influence of the school, and by that I mean every phase of activity included in the settlement, is not confined to the pupils or NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 45 their families. When a situation requires the advice and support o the school, everyone is ready to take the responsibility, if expedient The problem of the church house could not be solved without Mis Evelyn's advice and Mr. Mattil's aid in drawing the plans. Election are held in the school yard, for which we supply chairs and tables There is no other meeting place for public addresses and social gath erings, and now until the new church house is completed all service will be held at the schoolhouse. With all these the real life of th school is its pupils, their everyday activities and possibilities. Tardiness and irregular attendance are two of the local problems A glimpse of the roads, without the pleasure of traveling then would be sufficient excuse for truancy, most of our friends would sa) and indeed they are but the temperamental slowness of the mountai boy transcends his desire for punctuality andeven the brightest driest days 'find stragglers at nine or even later. One of the aims of education is to develop the ability to use thos things nearest to hand. To find a use for the natural Tennessee rock which adorn the school ground would tax the wisdom of many. stone for every minute lost from school would hardly clear the fiel, for action but the result will be evident in the foundation of som future building. Nothing has furnished more amusement and gaine more permanent success than the rock pile in the far corner of th school yard. This may savor of the old galley idea, yet the motiv and attitude of the offenders were quite to the contrary. The schem worked splendidly as long as the culprits were little fellows (tl, authority of the teacher is still unimpaired) , but it was with fear an trembling that the same sentence was pronounced on the big boy After much deliberation they began the rock gathering, giving tlimpression of slipping away every minute. It was not until the tin was up and they were safely out of the school yard that the outcon of the venture was assured. The result of the discipline was soon very noticeable in our outdo( basketball court which was cleared in this way and ready for our fir game, in fact the first game the players had ever seen. The intere in the game was high, their team work quite good, but the skill throwing baskets still undeveloped. The rain had made the cou very muddy and the new suits and bare knees soon gave evidence insecure footing. Their faces glowed with the violent effort .111 were making. Never before had the boys moved with such speed al ;6i THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI lick.ness. For once they were shaken out of their habitual delib-'ateness. It was not without its humorous touch. Several boys sisted upon wearing their caps which were frequently knocked off. othing prevented the owner from stopping the game to replace the ,st article on his head. Even Mr. Denton's "Let the old cap go" )uldn't move the owner. A score of 70-1 would have discouraged .ost boys but not ours and when the weather permits, they line up )r daily practice. The boys are taking another step forward this year by the organi-Ltion of a Hi-Y.* With us such progress is very slow. but two boys -e going to the Conference of East Tennessee Hi-Y Clubs at Morstown which will no doubt broaden their vision of school life, its tivities and possibilities. We hope they will bring home an inspiraon for all the boys. The girls have surpassed the boys in that phase of school life. rntil this year the boys and girls have always had their literary )ciety together, but the needs were so different that this year the cperiment of dividing them has been tried. The success with the iris is very marked. Few high school girls of their age would show tperior ability and poise in conducting a meeting to the two girls n-e who have served as presidents the first term. Their fear of )pearing before an audience is gradually disappearing and their )ility to plan programs was shown in the Christmas meeting. Every lest was presented with a spray of holly which they were requested ) pin on. Every girl answered roll call with a seasonal verse or ible text, and after the entire company had sung several carols a ary delightful program was given, every number of which was exerted by the girls, even to the piano accompaniment. Last year the School gave The Birds' Christmas Carol, and this ?Alwe shall give Little Men. Nothing delights these mountain boys .ore than dramatic work. We hope to win first in the oratorical mtest at Sevierville this year, as we did last year. We are handi-Ipped a little in these activities as well as in athletics, since we are le only two-year high school that participates in these events. Even we lose out in many meets now the time will come when we can Ater on equal terms with the others, and our place will be assured 3.

For some time the need of a suitable home for the boys who come to us from a distance has been most apparent, and for the first time that problem has been solved..

The boys are very happy to live so near for last term one walked twelve miles and the other sixteen miles each day. The third member of the family is handicapped by the loss of one leg and unless we could have cared for him here, school would have been impossible for him. There are many others who could come if we could take them. The only way we can take any more girls is by making use of the Huff Hotel. Unsatisfactory as that would be, it is the best and only solution at present. Mrs. Dowell and the family of six in the Mary Pollard Cottage is the extent of its capacity. These are some problems which every year become more acute. This winter term sees the beginning again of the noon lunch served to the youngest children in school. This lunch consists usually of one warm dish, sometimes a bowl of soup, a baked potato, an egg or glass of milk with crackers which they add to what they have brought. They delight in sitting about the table in the basement, all saying their grace together before the meal and each taking turns acting as host and hostess when it is time to be excused. The time may come when the older ones also may have this privilege. Added to the value of warm food is the practice of preparing the meal, setting the table and the unconscious absorption of table manners, quite unknown in their own homes. An interesting experiment has been made in the high school with the Thorndike-McCall intelligence tests which have been given to the New York City pupils, a test which ascertains the ability to obtain facts and ideas from the printed page. "The results show an evenness and similarity of intelligence, a homogeneity of the group strikingly in contrast to city groups of school children." These tests were graded by and the above criticism quoted from Miss Miller, the school chairman.

The sixth grade is another strong class as is also the fourth, but the fifth is made up largely of those pupils who never progress by merit of work, too old for the grade, too indifferent for effort. The high school is rather free from that type because such pupils rarely reach thbse grades before reaching the age at which they can drop out. However, there are very few boys of real school age out of school this year. A class in 'agriculture fOr the boys and men not enrolled for regular school work will reach those who have outgrown the schoolroom.

The boys are taking another step forward this year by the organi-Ltion of a Hi-Y.* With us such progress is very slow. but two boys -e going to the Conference of East Tennessee Hi-Y Clubs at Morstown which will no doubt broaden their vision of school life, its tivities and possibilities. We hope they will bring home an inspiraon for all the boys. The girls have surpassed the boys in that phase of school life. rntil this year the boys and girls have always had their literary )ciety together, but the needs were so different that this year the cperiment of dividing them has been tried. The success with the iris is very marked. Few high school girls of their age would show tperior ability and poise in conducting a meeting to the two girls n-e who have served as presidents the first term. Their fear of )pearing before an audience is gradually disappearing and their )ility to plan programs was shown in the Christmas meeting. Every lest was presented with a spray of holly which they were requested ) pin on. Every girl answered roll call with a seasonal verse or ible text, and after the entire company had sung several carols a ary delightful program was given, every number of which was exerted by the girls, even to the piano accompaniment. Last year the School gave The Birds' Christmas Carol, and this ?Alwe shall give Little Men. Nothing delights these mountain boys .ore than dramatic work. We hope to win first in the oratorical mtest at Sevierville this year, as we did last year. We are handi-Ipped a little in these activities as well as in athletics, since we are le only two-year high school that participates in these events. Even we lose out in many meets now the time will come when we can Ater on equal terms with the others, and our place will be assured 3. The latent abilities and talent which these children show is *Hi-Y is a state organization for high school boys, very much on the order the Y. M. C. A., and the name means High School Y. M. C. A.

We hope to make this attempt at girls' organization a part of the National Girls' Reserve Movement of the Y. W. C. A. For some time the need of a suitable home for the boys who come to us from a distance has been most apparent, and for the first time that problem has been solved.. At present three boys and Mr. Denton are living in the Creswell house on Burg Hill. Mrs. Ownby is installed as housekeeper. The boys are very happy to live so near for last term one walked twelve miles and the other sixteen miles each day. The third member of the family is handicapped by the loss of one leg and unless we could have cared for him here, school would have been impossible for him. There are many others who could come if we could take them. The only way we can take any more girls is by making use of the Huff Hotel. Unsatisfactory as that would be, it is the best and only solution at present. Mrs. Dowell and the family of six in the Mary Pollard Cottage is the extent of its capacity. These are some problems which every year become more acute. This winter term sees the beginning again of the noon lunch served to the youngest children in school. This lunch consists usually of one warm dish, sometimes a bowl of soup, a baked potato, an egg or glass of milk with crackers which they add to what they have brought. They delight in sitting about the table in the basement, all saying their grace together before the meal and each taking turns acting as host and hostess when it is time to be excused. The time may come when the older ones also may have this privilege. Added to the value of warm food is the practice of preparing the meal, setting the table and the unconscious absorption of table manners, quite unknown in their own homes. An interesting experiment has been made in the high school with the Thorndike-McCall intelligence tests which have been given to the New York City pupils, a test which ascertains the ability to obtain facts and ideas from the printed page. "The results show an evenness and similarity of intelligence, a homogeneity of the group strikingly in contrast to city groups of school children." These tests were graded by and the above criticism quoted from Miss Miller, the school chairman. One is often appalled at the ignorance in our advanced pupils of the simple facts which are required as a founda58 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI .on for all educational progress. Yet when you remember that every act they learn is through conscious effort, nothing is absorbed unconziously through the years at home and outside associations, it is no wonder that London as the capital of England is as unfamiliar as eheran in Persia, that California and Massachusetts are as foreign ountries as France or Germany. High school pupils who have never een a street car or a business block, railroad train or brick sidewalks ave difficulty in forming concepts of the social, economic and politial institutions of society. These tests were especially well-fitted for ,s because the pupils' knowledge of facts was of no consideration, ^nly his ability to think. Lest you receive the idea that the path of a mountain school-teacher s strewn with success at every turn, here are some of our difficulties .nd worries. In a number of homes, instead of making school life serious business, there is a tendency on the part of the parents to tumor their children in their notions. Then the teacher must make series of visits to try to reconcile the sulking child without losing ter position of dignity and authority as well as not antagonizing the 'amilv. The desire for an education is never great enough to rise .hove the usual schoolroom difficulties. Possibly three months later rou will learn of the circumstance which led some pupil to walk out. The attempt to hold a class together until their second year of sigh school is difficult. The present sophomore class was the eighth trade, of course, three years ago, and without the loss of a member t had reached its last year in our school. In October the first blow :ame when serious eye trouble prevented Lillian from continuing. mother loss come in December when Lona "stopped 'out" to com-)Iete her sister's term of teaching "up Baskins." An aunt required he services of a third during an illness. The removal of the Whaley amily to a new farm upon which a great deal of work must be done, uch as building and clearing land, took the oldest boy from school wo-thirds of the time, leaving one boy to hold up the honor of the lass. Seldom does such misfortune befall a class in that way. Nine finished last year which was ususually good. The freshman class, hough very young, some having commenced school when they were hree, is a strong one. The eighth grade is weak, made up largely f stragglers who cannot possibly 'finish the work satisfactorily mough to enter high school. Some days there are two in the class, ome days maybe seven, making progress very slow. Then again the NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 459 seventh grade is a large class and a strong one that can very possibly progress normally a grade a year, especially if we have a nine months' school year. The sixth grade is another strong class as is also the fourth, but the fifth is made up largely of those pupils who never progress by merit of work, too old for the grade, too indifferent for effort. The high school is rather free from that type because such pupils rarely reach thbse grades before reaching the age at which they can drop out. However, there are very few boys of real school age out of school this year. A class in 'agriculture fOr the boys and men not enrolled for regular school work will reach those who have outgrown the schoolroom. By and by some of these older ones will come strolling back and then the problem will be to find them a place, a task for which one -Mu:st be equal in such a school as, this. With the spring work season near at hand the difficulty of organized progress in some classes is in-creased for the children do the work, even the very littlest tots. In spite of these discouragements each year brings us a little nearer to our goal. More children stay with us every year, parents feel the need and try to plan their work accordingly, and there is a greater desire on the part of the pupils themselves. Every-year findssome of our pupils enrolled in other schools which can take them farther than we can. 'If we continue nine months this year, for the first time, it will be because of their wish. Our success cannot be measured. ,by the facts stored away in their heads but by. their awakened desire .to learn and to seek after those things by which the next generation of mountain people will take a step forward. When we use this as our scale to measure success or failure the Pi Phi School need not be ashamed. Very often one .of our leading magazines tells the story of some mountaineer who has risen from his log cabin birthplace to a position of eminence in the professional or business world. No doubt the-slumbering scientist can be discovered in the following dissertation on natural history which was delivered before an English' class some weeks ago. It is published here for the edification of 'all readers. WHY A TOAD HAS NO TAIL I think toads have no tails because they are hatched out of an egg, just like a chicken. They are raised in water and not in fields. A cow and horse need a tail to keep the flies off and protect their legs. Flies do not bother a toad so he needs no tail. If a toad had need for a tail it would have been put on him. CECIL MAPLES.
