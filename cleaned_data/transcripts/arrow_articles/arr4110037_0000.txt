This is to certify that I have examined the books of account and records of Miss Anne Stuart, Grand Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity at the close of business June 30, 1924, that the above statements are correct and in accordance with the books and, records and that the "Recapitulation" as shown above reflects a true and correct statement of the financial condition of the fraternity. A. A. KOENIG Auditor. REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE To Grand Council : This year has been a most trying one to everyone connected with the School. The enforced absence of Mrs. Rugg and Miss Stuart's being abroad threw the burden of the work upon Mrs. Curtis, Miss Bishop, Mrs. Turner and myself. It was doubly hard on Mrs. Turner as she felt as I did last year, not having been to the School that her opinion was not of much value. This year Grand Council will appoint the new members ahead of time in order that if possible they may be at the committee meeting, thus enabling the committee to work with greater efficiency. Our letting the teacher of domestic arts go before we had obtained the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science appropriation proved to be a tragedy. For months we went without a domestic science teacher as notification of our failure to secure this aid came so late that it was impossible to get a domestic science teacher. In order, however, to keep up part of that work we had a former pupil, Allie Ownby, conduct the weaving department. Her work proved to be quite successful. During our annual fair Mr. Matti" infected his hand which caused him to be out of school for some time. The erection of the barn by Jim REPORTS OF OFFICERS Reagan, renovating of the cottages, coupled With the breakdown of the Delco 'system and the pump engine and the enforced absence of Miss Higginbotham, all' made the strain on Miss Bishop very hard. We had planned to have for her an assistant in the clerical department but we could prevail upon no one to accept it. In spite of all this we have conducted School With 151 pupils in the regular fashion and in a most encouraging way. The spirit of the overworked teachers was fine. We had six teachers on the staff, most of them did their school work, had to help with the cooking part of the time and do other things. never before required of them. Not one complaint did we hear from them and they did their tasks with a real zeal that could not be equalled. The seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth grades had a full nine-months term of school. The other grades were dismissed earlier as had been planned by last year's committee. The' barn is completed. I felt after my visit there that there were necessary changes to be made in the construction of the barn, in order to cut the expense. Some things which we left out could have been helpful to lessen the work but as we were building this barn for a model, we felt we should not equip it too completely as it was impossible for everyone to follow our plan in that way. Both the Stuart and Pollard cottages were remodeled to meet adequately the present needs of the School. These cottages are now home-like, comfortable and practical. They are both used as girls' dormitories. We have rented the Higginbotham-Bishop Cottage for a boys' dormitory, which was last year presided over by Mrs. Roberts, a II B 4). We placed new furniture in the living room of the Teachers' Cottage, also new beds, using the old 'beds in the dormitories for the girls. In every cottage, as well as the hospital, we installed a heating plant that in future years could be connected with a central heating plant. Besides doing this, the School conducted an annual fair which would do credit to any thriving community. The old board walk from the School to the road was replaced by a cement walk. I feel that in my report the next step to discuss is our future policy. This year I shall suggest to the committee that we use Gatlinburg as a center and in the future supply feeder schools further back in the mountains, such as Sugarlands, Baskins, and others. During the past year the county board has asked several times for us to go up into the Sugarlands to have school and it is my earnest hope that with the assistance of the Sugarlands people we may open a school there this fall. I should like, if possible, to' add one more year of school work for the pupils and nine-months term, for all. In Miss Chew's report of last year she recommended an ungraded class in which the teachers could look after students who in years were above the grade they were in. This would encourage them to come to school and do away with the embarrassment of being in a class below their years. 37 3S THE 'ARROW OF rl BETA Pier We have been over-working the, Delco plant for several years, as was brought out by Miss Stuart in our discussion last year. This over-work brought about the inevitable, the breaking down of the plant which caused the community to realize the need of electric light and power. Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples have put in tentatively a dynamo connected with the Luther Reagan dam, asking II B ci) to go in with the Gatlin-burg Electric and Power Company. In. the digest of the minutes I will add more about all propositions,' especially this. Miss Chew reports that this has been the most successful year in the history of our School. She says from the academic point of view there are always disappointments, a falling short of one's expectations of one's pupils to grasp the facts which one feels absolutely are necessary. Miss Chew now feels as the committee has felt for years back that we should stress more the ;agricultural and domestic 'sides. Last year the school faculty adopted a new system of recording our pupils and their school work. I hope this filing of the records will enable us to Make an illiteracy survey and bring our pupils to the view point that their parents could be taught by them and thus eliminate a great deal of illiteracy in our community The library has been re-catalogued. The books have been grouped on the shelves under the headings of Standard Fiction, Popular i'iction, Boy's Books, Girl's Books, Children's Books, Essay and Poetry, History, Geography, Folk Stories, Reference, Science, English and Mathematics. The school house has been used as a community meeting place but recently the barn has supplanted this as there is more room to play and it could be used as an indoor court for basketball. To summarize what has been accomplished in the School, according to Miss Chew, would be: 1. A greater spirit of unity between pupil and teacher, between School and patron. 2. Created a place for us in the athletic world. 3. Established filing system of records for the school work. 4. Tested our children with standardized tests. 5. Began to catalogue the library. 6. Revised our course of study from an academic point of view. 7. Our National Girls' Reserve Club included all but two girls in the four upper grades. We have $9.00 in the treasury. We gave $2.00 toward Mrs. Coolidge's picture. S. County certificates for eight grades. 9. Possibility of a state registered high school. WHAT WE NEED 1. Domestic Science-e-cooking. 2. Domestic Art-sewing. 3. Housekeeping. 4. Health Education. REPORTS OF OFFICERS . 39 5. Practical Agriculture that holds. 6. Fewer grades to teacher in lower grades. 7. A course of study working to a definite result that everybody follows, S. A ,definite social program to bring School and community together. Our development of the weaving must go on. We must inspire new designs, new combinations of colors and originality in the weaving of rugs, coverlets and baskets. I have tried to interest more keenly each alumnze club, by writing personal letters to each president and secretary. It is with deep regret that after all the time I spent in writing those letters, precious few considered them important enough to read to their alumna! clubs. In order to, popularize the Fire-side Industries I have gotten out a new booklet. Let me add here that for the first time in our history has the fire-side industries been a financial success. EaCh year previous the School has had a deficit in this part of the work. We have also arranged for new slides which we hope to add from time to, time. We used these new slides at the Eastern Conference in Washington, trying to arrange them in a logical order so that they would portray a continued story of human interest and appreciation of the work being done there. I felt that it was a great opportunity to present the Settlement School problems at Washington and travelled from Texas there so that everyone who visited the Conference might know that the Settlement School is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, thing any fraternity in the 'United States is doing. I hope that the future will show our efforts were not in vain. We have had representatives from the School at the Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, also at the Conference in Berea. The result of those visits brought Mrs. John Campbell and Miss Butler to visit the School. Their suggestions brought us new ideas, helped us solve many old problems and made us feel more optimistic. They assured us that our School had gone forward in an easier and more constructive manner and with less difficult problems arising than any of the other mountain schools. Mr. Mattil of the Smith-Hughes Agri-cultural Department, reported that he had been handicapped in his work, first, due to illness ; second, due to the fact that we did not have a farmer to manage the School part of the work in a constructive manner. He emphasized the need of this, but with all the problems he has. to contend with, his work has come out beautifully. The people have' organized Community Club which will be of great value not only to the School but to Gatlinburg itself. While the year has been a most strenuous, one, it has been a great pleasure to me as Chairman to serve on this committee. I cannot close without thanking each member of my committee for her hearty cooperation and each teacher for her splendid work during the year, 40 THE: AuRow o:F Pt BETA PHI and without expressing regret for losing two such valuable members as Sarah Rugg and Melinda Stuart. These have all served valiently during the year and without them I could not have gone through. Respectfully submitted, NIT. HILL STARK. DIGEST OF MINUTES SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING MAY l, 1924 A full membership of the committee was present and with pe mission of Grand Council the two new appointees were preSant, also, thus enabling them to carry on their duties in a better way ,because, unless you have been .to the School, it is impossible to realize what a tremendous and wonderful .work it is. Grand Council authorized.the committee to buy several acres south of the school building.. This will straighten out the south line and the building which is on this land can be..used for weaving and a library which I will tell you about later. . As we had decided to do extensive improvements at the last emumittee meeting, it was a pleasure to see how splendidly this work has been carried on. The Mary Pollard Cottage, which was a story and a half, was made into a two-story building, having dormitory and bath room for the girls up-stairs. and kitchen and dining room downstairs, All the rooms were repainted and floors. cleaned and it made a very lovely place for the girls to stay. The Stuart Cottage had a large open space under it which was closed up. Cement floors were put in there and in, one compartment a store-room was built which enables us to buy .supplies at wholesale, thus reducing the living cost. (.)u the other side of the partition a wash room was constructed f(-)r the girls to do their laundry, so it will .eliMinate washin,g out of doors in the bad weather as they have done heretofore. The barn is about completed, There are a few other necessary equipments to be placed but it is being used right along now, The 1..)arn is a model in every respect for the community to see.. We are quite proud of it and at present it has many purposes. Last winter the isoys used it for basket ball and on Saturday nights it was converted into a. moving picture building. The committee this year put in tire extinguishers as was authorized last year and refilled some that have been used. At the Jennie :Nichols Memorial Health Center a L'Yasement had to be dug in order to put in a system of heating similar to Arcola but not quite as expensive.. In each of the cottages we put in the same system because these radiators could be connected with a central heating plant when .we have enough ,money to put it. in. ,, It was decided again that we would go in with the county regard REPORTS OF OFFICERS 41 lug the Red Cross. Health unit. Miss Higginbotham was reappointed as Head Nurse. A practical nurse will be secured to help Miss Higginbotham to do practical nursing in the community. She will be a great benefit to the people as often times they have had to pay the price of a trained nurse when they could ill afford it. Another thing which has been worrying the committee for some years is the lighting question. It seemed useless to pay for the hauling of gasoline when we could use the power from Little Pigeon river to furnish us all the electricity we could use. With the breaking down of our Delta) system this winter and having to cut off Mr. Huff from eleetTio lights, it made the people realize that the time was at hand in which to put, in a dam. The committee agreed to help defray our part of the expenses and go into a corporation composed of Mr. Huff, Mr. Maples and Pi Beta Phi. The dam will supply the community with alternating current, 1.10 voltage, 60 cycle, or in other words, standard current. This will be a great blessing to the School as now we can have washing machines and mangles, besides other conveniences derived from electricity. It will save the School financially. Last year we had nine months school for the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades. This year the Head Resident was instructed to have full nine months term for every grade in the School. We decided to have fewer grades for each teacher to teach so she could give more individual attention to the student. We failed to get state aid from Smith-Hughes Department of Home Economics on account of State's lack of funds but will try again for it. The matter of the selection of teachers took up a great deal of time this year as there were many problems to decide. First, to secure a teacher who could over-see the boys in their farm and outside work, besides teach the third grade. Mr. Mattil has been doing this in the past but it is impossible for him to do that and keep up the work of the Smith-Hughes Agricultural Department. Mr. Matill has put in an orchard which is thriving well. He has also organized a Community Club which is going to be a God-send to Gatlinburg and surrounding country. Ile was re-elected as teacher for the year. EmilyBurton, Marion Folsom and Helen Chew were re-elected on the teaching staff. Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, is to have charge of the domeatie science department. Allie Ownby, one of our former pupils, because of her excellent work and her eagerness to instruct, was re-elected to teach weaving. Helen Barrett, a Pi Beta Phi from Illinois, is als(,) on the staff. It is a great satisfaction to know some of our former pupils are back teaching in the school. Harmo Taylor and Margaret White of Texas A will be connected with the teaching staff also. The Head Resident was authorized to start a school catalogue. This contains full information of all students ever connected with our School and we feel this card catalogue will enable the children to see that their fathers and mothers learn to read and write. 42 THE ARROW OF Pt BETA PHI Miss Chew resigned as Principal of the School to become head of the Sugarland's unit. The County School Board requested that the committee appoint a head for the school. They will give us ;a certain sum, not decided at yet, a school house, a teacher's cottage and some more land if we will include the Sugarlands under our supervision. This extension work has been the dream of Miss Emma Harper Turner for a long time. It was she who gave us the thought of doing extension work and since this was our first step we felt that it should be called the Emma Harper Turner Center. It gave the committee a great deal of pleasure to know that the Center would bear her name as they have felt keenly the interest she has taken in the School always. It was decided to start a library in which we could have reading rooms open on Saturday and Sunday afternoons and eventually start a circulating library .also. This library will be known hereafter as the Grace Goodhue Coolidge Library. We named it after Mrs. Coolidge, Vermont B, whom all Pi Phis attending the Washington Eastern Con ference learned to love and respect. We could not elect all the teaching staff as we are making so many changes and felt that we had tol'Iet some go and get others to do the type of work we wanted done. During the summer we will have Lucy Nickerson conduct a class in vegetable dyeing and fire-side industries. We think this will be of great value to the community. While Miss Higginbotham is away on her vacation we have employed Miss Bell to take care of her work. There was a joint session of Grand Council and the Settlement School Committee. It was decided that whenever we build the new school building we should put in a fire-proof vault for Settlement School records and Grand Council archives. At this' session it was decided that we use a trade mark for articles made at the School, also that Mrs. Lizzie Reagan be given a Patroness Pin, a token of Pi Beta Phi's love and appreciation for her wonderful work at the School. The Grand Council decided that since there was to be a new Treasurer to take over the books, Miss Stuart's request be granted that she re-open her books in order to give all clubs recognition and to pay all outstanding bills. The committee granted Miss Bishop a three months' leave of absence as she has not had adequate vacation for several years. Mrs. Reginald Geare will have charge of the publicity for the next year. The illustrated leaflet containing prices and information concerning the fire-side industries which was published last year may be had upon request of the Chairman. The school will also send a weekly letter concerning school interests to the Montgomery Vindicator. Under the direction of the Treasurer, the Budget for 1924-25 was prepared and later accepted. Before adjourning the Chairman instructed Mrs. Curtis to write REPORTS OF OFFICERS 43 Miss Stuart and Rugg thanking them for their untiring efforts ou the committee and regrets for the expiration of their terms of office. Respectfully submitted, NITA STARK. Chairman, Settlement School Committee.

It looked to be a Herculean task. Were it not for the assistance of Geraldine Mars and Mrs. Spring, I would be wondering yet. But the tangle became a form, and what was at first a trial became even a pleasure, for one learns and learns through such work--discovers the real mechanism of its publication and the personalities that make it up. As far into things as it has led me the commission has been to foster, as well as to perform the routine editorial work on, the Alumme Personals, the In Memoriam notices, the Alumn Club reports, the schedule of Coming Events, and the .A.lumnte Department Directory. It was thought that an improvement would be made accruing to the benefit of the alumna clubs themselves were the annual club reports to appear in the June ARROw, instead of in the secret October edition, for then the information therein would be available before the various clubs drew up their plans in the fall as is customary. Proceeding on this line the reports have been obtained', copy prepared and edited, and sent in for the June, 1924, AaRow. Along with the request for the club reports as sent out to the club secretaries, it was suggested that a

        3S THE 'ARROW OF rl BETA Pier We have been over-working the, Delco plant for several years, as was brought out by Miss Stuart in our discussion last year. This over-work brought about the inevitable, the breaking down of the plant which caused the community to realize the need of electric light and power. Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples have put in tentatively a dynamo connected with the Luther Reagan dam, asking II B ci) to go in with the Gatlin-burg Electric and Power Company. In. the digest of the minutes I will add more about all propositions,' especially this. Miss Chew reports that this has been the most successful year in the history of our School. She says from the academic point of view there are always disappointments, a falling short of one's expectations of one's pupils to grasp the facts which one feels absolutely are necessary. Miss Chew now feels as the committee has felt for years back that we should stress more the ;agricultural and domestic 'sides. Last year the school faculty adopted a new system of recording our pupils and their school work. I hope this filing of the records will enable us to Make an illiteracy survey and bring our pupils to the view point that their parents could be taught by them and thus eliminate a great deal of illiteracy in our community The library has been re-catalogued. The books have been grouped on the shelves under the headings of Standard Fiction, Popular i'iction, Boy's Books, Girl's Books, Children's Books, Essay and Poetry, History, Geography, Folk Stories, Reference, Science, English and Mathematics. The school house has been used as a community meeting place but recently the barn has supplanted this as there is more room to play and it could be used as an indoor court for basketball. To summarize what has been accomplished in the School, according to Miss Chew, would be: 1. A greater spirit of unity between pupil and teacher, between School and patron. 2. Created a place for us in the athletic world. 3. Established filing system of records for the school work. 4. Tested our children with standardized tests. 5. Began to catalogue the library. 6. Revised our course of study from an academic point of view. 7. Our National Girls' Reserve Club included all but two girls in the four upper grades. We have $9.00 in the treasury. We gave $2.00 toward Mrs. Coolidge's picture. S. County certificates for eight grades. 9. Possibility of a state registered high school. WHAT WE NEED 1. Domestic Science-e-cooking. 2. Domestic Art-sewing. 3. Housekeeping. 4. Health Education. REPORTS OF OFFICERS . 39 5. Practical Agriculture that holds. 6. Fewer grades to teacher in lower grades. 7. A course of study working to a definite result that everybody follows, S. A ,definite social program to bring School and community together. Our development of the weaving must go on. We must inspire new designs, new combinations of colors and originality in the weaving of rugs, coverlets and baskets. I have tried to interest more keenly each alumnze club, by writing personal letters to each president and secretary. It is with deep regret that after all the time I spent in writing those letters, precious few considered them important enough to read to their alumna! clubs. In order to, popularize the Fire-side Industries I have gotten out a new booklet. Let me add here that for the first time in our history has the fire-side industries been a financial success. EaCh year previous the School has had a deficit in this part of the work. We have also arranged for new slides which we hope to add from time to, time. We used these new slides at the Eastern Conference in Washington, trying to arrange them in a logical order so that they would portray a continued story of human interest and appreciation of the work being done there. I felt that it was a great opportunity to present the Settlement School problems at Washington and travelled from Texas there so that everyone who visited the Conference might know that the Settlement School is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, thing any fraternity in the 'United States is doing. I hope that the future will show our efforts were not in vain. We have had representatives from the School at the Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, also at the Conference in Berea. The result of those visits brought Mrs. John Campbell and Miss Butler to visit the School. Their suggestions brought us new ideas, helped us solve many old problems and made us feel more optimistic. They assured us that our School had gone forward in an easier and more constructive manner and with less difficult problems arising than any of the other mountain schools. Mr. Mattil of the Smith-Hughes Agri-cultural Department, reported that he had been handicapped in his work, first, due to illness ; second, due to the fact that we did not have a farmer to manage the School part of the work in a constructive manner. He emphasized the need of this, but with all the problems he has. to contend with, his work has come out beautifully. The people have' organized Community Club which will be of great value not only to the School but to Gatlinburg itself. While the year has been a most strenuous, one, it has been a great pleasure to me as Chairman to serve on this committee. I cannot close without thanking each member of my committee for her hearty cooperation and each teacher for her splendid work during the year, 40 THE: AuRow o:F Pt BETA PHI and without expressing regret for losing two such valuable members as Sarah Rugg and Melinda Stuart. These have all served valiently during the year and without them I could not have gone through. Respectfully submitted, NIT. HILL STARK. DIGEST OF MINUTES SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING MAY l, 1924 A full membership of the committee was present and with pe mission of Grand Council the two new appointees were preSant, also, thus enabling them to carry on their duties in a better way ,because, unless you have been .to the School, it is impossible to realize what a tremendous and wonderful .work it is. Grand Council authorized.the committee to buy several acres south of the school building.. This will straighten out the south line and the building which is on this land can be..used for weaving and a library which I will tell you about later. . As we had decided to do extensive improvements at the last emumittee meeting, it was a pleasure to see how splendidly this work has been carried on. The Mary Pollard Cottage, which was a story and a half, was made into a two-story building, having dormitory and bath room for the girls up-stairs. and kitchen and dining room downstairs, All the rooms were repainted and floors. cleaned and it made a very lovely place for the girls to stay. The Stuart Cottage had a large open space under it which was closed up. Cement floors were put in there and in, one compartment a store-room was built which enables us to buy .supplies at wholesale, thus reducing the living cost. (.)u the other side of the partition a wash room was constructed f(-)r the girls to do their laundry, so it will .eliMinate washin,g out of doors in the bad weather as they have done heretofore. The barn is about completed, There are a few other necessary equipments to be placed but it is being used right along now, The 1..)arn is a model in every respect for the community to see.. We are quite proud of it and at present it has many purposes. Last winter the isoys used it for basket ball and on Saturday nights it was converted into a. moving picture building. The committee this year put in tire extinguishers as was authorized last year and refilled some that have been used. At the Jennie :Nichols Memorial Health Center a L'Yasement had to be dug in order to put in a system of heating similar to Arcola but not quite as expensive.. In each of the cottages we put in the same system because these radiators could be connected with a central heating plant when .we have enough ,money to put it. in. ,, It was decided again that we would go in with the county regard REPORTS OF OFFICERS 41 lug the Red Cross. Health unit. Miss Higginbotham was reappointed as Head Nurse. A practical nurse will be secured to help Miss Higginbotham to do practical nursing in the community. She will be a great benefit to the people as often times they have had to pay the price of a trained nurse when they could ill afford it. Another thing which has been worrying the committee for some years is the lighting question. It seemed useless to pay for the hauling of gasoline when we could use the power from Little Pigeon river to furnish us all the electricity we could use. With the breaking down of our Delta) system this winter and having to cut off Mr. Huff from eleetTio lights, it made the people realize that the time was at hand in which to put, in a dam. The committee agreed to help defray our part of the expenses and go into a corporation composed of Mr. Huff, Mr. Maples and Pi Beta Phi. The dam will supply the community with alternating current, 1.10 voltage, 60 cycle, or in other words, standard current. This will be a great blessing to the School as now we can have washing machines and mangles, besides other conveniences derived from electricity. It will save the School financially. Last year we had nine months school for the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades. This year the Head Resident was instructed to have full nine months term for every grade in the School. We decided to have fewer grades for each teacher to teach so she could give more individual attention to the student. We failed to get state aid from Smith-Hughes Department of Home Economics on account of State's lack of funds but will try again for it. The matter of the selection of teachers took up a great deal of time this year as there were many problems to decide. First, to secure a teacher who could over-see the boys in their farm and outside work, besides teach the third grade. Mr. Mattil has been doing this in the past but it is impossible for him to do that and keep up the work of the Smith-Hughes Agricultural Department. Mr. Matill has put in an orchard which is thriving well. He has also organized a Community Club which is going to be a God-send to Gatlinburg and surrounding country. Ile was re-elected as teacher for the year. EmilyBurton, Marion Folsom and Helen Chew were re-elected on the teaching staff. Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, is to have charge of the domeatie science department. Allie Ownby, one of our former pupils, because of her excellent work and her eagerness to instruct, was re-elected to teach weaving. Helen Barrett, a Pi Beta Phi from Illinois, is als(,) on the staff. It is a great satisfaction to know some of our former pupils are back teaching in the school. Harmo Taylor and Margaret White of Texas A will be connected with the teaching staff also. The Head Resident was authorized to start a school catalogue. This contains full information of all students ever connected with our School and we feel this card catalogue will enable the children to see that their fathers and mothers learn to read and write. 42 THE ARROW OF Pt BETA PHI Miss Chew resigned as Principal of the School to become head of the Sugarland's unit. The County School Board requested that the committee appoint a head for the school. They will give us ;a certain sum, not decided at yet, a school house, a teacher's cottage and some more land if we will include the Sugarlands under our supervision. This extension work has been the dream of Miss Emma Harper Turner for a long time. It was she who gave us the thought of doing extension work and since this was our first step we felt that it should be called the Emma Harper Turner Center. It gave the committee a great deal of pleasure to know that the Center would bear her name as they have felt keenly the interest she has taken in the School always. It was decided to start a library in which we could have reading rooms open on Saturday and Sunday afternoons and eventually start a circulating library .also. This library will be known hereafter as the Grace Goodhue Coolidge Library. We named it after Mrs. Coolidge, Vermont B, whom all Pi Phis attending the Washington Eastern Con ference learned to love and respect. We could not elect all the teaching staff as we are making so many changes and felt that we had tol'Iet some go and get others to do the type of work we wanted done. During the summer we will have Lucy Nickerson conduct a class in vegetable dyeing and fire-side industries. We think this will be of great value to the community. While Miss Higginbotham is away on her vacation we have employed Miss Bell to take care of her work. There was a joint session of Grand Council and the Settlement School Committee. It was decided that whenever we build the new school building we should put in a fire-proof vault for Settlement School records and Grand Council archives. At this' session it was decided that we use a trade mark for articles made at the School, also that Mrs. Lizzie Reagan be given a Patroness Pin, a token of Pi Beta Phi's love and appreciation for her wonderful work at the School. The Grand Council decided that since there was to be a new Treasurer to take over the books, Miss Stuart's request be granted that she re-open her books in order to give all clubs recognition and to pay all outstanding bills. The committee granted Miss Bishop a three months' leave of absence as she has not had adequate vacation for several years. Mrs. Reginald Geare will have charge of the publicity for the next year. The illustrated leaflet containing prices and information concerning the fire-side industries which was published last year may be had upon request of the Chairman. The school will also send a weekly letter concerning school interests to the Montgomery Vindicator. Under the direction of the Treasurer, the Budget for 1924-25 was prepared and later accepted. Before adjourning the Chairman instructed Mrs. Curtis to write REPORTS OF OFFICERS 43 Miss Stuart and Rugg thanking them for their untiring efforts ou the committee and regrets for the expiration of their terms of office. Respectfully submitted, NITA STARK. Chairman, Settlement School Committee.

It looked to be a Herculean task. Were it not for the assistance of Geraldine Mars and Mrs. Spring, I would be wondering yet. But the tangle became a form, and what was at first a trial became even a pleasure, for one learns and learns through such work--discovers the real mechanism of its publication and the personalities that make it up. As far into things as it has led me the commission has been to foster, as well as to perform the routine editorial work on, the Alumme Personals, the In Memoriam notices, the Alumn Club reports, the schedule of Coming Events, and the .A.lumnte Department Directory. It was thought that an improvement would be made accruing to the benefit of the alumna clubs themselves were the annual club reports to appear in the June ARROw, instead of in the secret October edition, for then the information therein would be available before the various clubs drew up their plans in the fall as is customary. Proceeding on this line the reports have been obtained', copy prepared and edited, and sent in for the June, 1924, AaRow. Along with the request for the club reports as sent out to the club secretaries, it was suggested that a

It was thought that an improvement would be made accruing to the benefit of the alumna clubs themselves were the annual club reports to appear in the June ARROw, instead of in the secret October edition, for then the information therein would be available before the various clubs drew up their plans in the fall as is customary. Proceeding on this line the reports have been obtained', copy prepared and edited, and sent in for the June, 1924, AaRow.

        42 THE ARROW OF Pt BETA PHI Miss Chew resigned as Principal of the School to become head of the Sugarland's unit. The County School Board requested that the committee appoint a head for the school. They will give us ;a certain sum, not decided at yet, a school house, a teacher's cottage and some more land if we will include the Sugarlands under our supervision. This extension work has been the dream of Miss Emma Harper Turner for a long time. It was she who gave us the thought of doing extension work and since this was our first step we felt that it should be called the Emma Harper Turner Center. It gave the committee a great deal of pleasure to know that the Center would bear her name as they have felt keenly the interest she has taken in the School always. It was decided to start a library in which we could have reading rooms open on Saturday and Sunday afternoons and eventually start a circulating library .also. This library will be known hereafter as the Grace Goodhue Coolidge Library. We named it after Mrs. Coolidge, Vermont B, whom all Pi Phis attending the Washington Eastern Con ference learned to love and respect. We could not elect all the teaching staff as we are making so many changes and felt that we had tol'Iet some go and get others to do the type of work we wanted done. During the summer we will have Lucy Nickerson conduct a class in vegetable dyeing and fire-side industries. We think this will be of great value to the community. While Miss Higginbotham is away on her vacation we have employed Miss Bell to take care of her work. There was a joint session of Grand Council and the Settlement School Committee. It was decided that whenever we build the new school building we should put in a fire-proof vault for Settlement School records and Grand Council archives. At this' session it was decided that we use a trade mark for articles made at the School, also that Mrs. Lizzie Reagan be given a Patroness Pin, a token of Pi Beta Phi's love and appreciation for her wonderful work at the School. The Grand Council decided that since there was to be a new Treasurer to take over the books, Miss Stuart's request be granted that she re-open her books in order to give all clubs recognition and to pay all outstanding bills. The committee granted Miss Bishop a three months' leave of absence as she has not had adequate vacation for several years. Mrs. Reginald Geare will have charge of the publicity for the next year. The illustrated leaflet containing prices and information concerning the fire-side industries which was published last year may be had upon request of the Chairman. The school will also send a weekly letter concerning school interests to the Montgomery Vindicator. Under the direction of the Treasurer, the Budget for 1924-25 was prepared and later accepted.

This is to certify that I have examined the books of account and records of Miss Anne Stuart, Grand Treasurer of the Pi Beta Phi Fraternity at the close of business June 30, 1924, that the above statements are correct and in accordance with the books and, records and that the "Recapitulation" as shown above reflects a true and correct statement of the financial condition of the fraternity. A. A. KOENIG Auditor. REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE To Grand Council : This year has been a most trying one to everyone connected with the School. The enforced absence of Mrs. Rugg and Miss Stuart's being abroad threw the burden of the work upon Mrs. Curtis, Miss Bishop, Mrs. Turner and myself. It was doubly hard on Mrs. Turner as she felt as I did last year, not having been to the School that her opinion was not of much value. This year Grand Council will appoint the new members ahead of time in order that if possible they may be at the committee meeting, thus enabling the committee to work with greater efficiency. Our letting the teacher of domestic arts go before we had obtained the Smith-Hughes Domestic Science appropriation proved to be a tragedy. For months we went without a domestic science teacher as notification of our failure to secure this aid came so late that it was impossible to get a domestic science teacher. In order, however, to keep up part of that work we had a former pupil, Allie Ownby, conduct the weaving department. Her work proved to be quite successful. During our annual fair Mr. Matti" infected his hand which caused him to be out of school for some time. The erection of the barn by Jim REPORTS OF OFFICERS Reagan, renovating of the cottages, coupled With the breakdown of the Delco 'system and the pump engine and the enforced absence of Miss Higginbotham, all' made the strain on Miss Bishop very hard. We had planned to have for her an assistant in the clerical department but we could prevail upon no one to accept it. In spite of all this we have conducted School With 151 pupils in the regular fashion and in a most encouraging way. The spirit of the overworked teachers was fine. We had six teachers on the staff, most of them did their school work, had to help with the cooking part of the time and do other things. never before required of them. Not one complaint did we hear from them and they did their tasks with a real zeal that could not be equalled. The seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth grades had a full nine-months term of school. The other grades were dismissed earlier as had been planned by last year's committee. The' barn is completed. I felt after my visit there that there were necessary changes to be made in the construction of the barn, in order to cut the expense. Some things which we left out could have been helpful to lessen the work but as we were building this barn for a model, we felt we should not equip it too completely as it was impossible for everyone to follow our plan in that way. Both the Stuart and Pollard cottages were remodeled to meet adequately the present needs of the School. These cottages are now home-like, comfortable and practical. They are both used as girls' dormitories. We have rented the Higginbotham-Bishop Cottage for a boys' dormitory, which was last year presided over by Mrs. Roberts, a II B 4). We placed new furniture in the living room of the Teachers' Cottage, also new beds, using the old 'beds in the dormitories for the girls. In every cottage, as well as the hospital, we installed a heating plant that in future years could be connected with a central heating plant. Besides doing this, the School conducted an annual fair which would do credit to any thriving community. The old board walk from the School to the road was replaced by a cement walk. I feel that in my report the next step to discuss is our future policy. This year I shall suggest to the committee that we use Gatlinburg as a center and in the future supply feeder schools further back in the mountains, such as Sugarlands, Baskins, and others. During the past year the county board has asked several times for us to go up into the Sugarlands to have school and it is my earnest hope that with the assistance of the Sugarlands people we may open a school there this fall. I should like, if possible, to' add one more year of school work for the pupils and nine-months term, for all. In Miss Chew's report of last year she recommended an ungraded class in which the teachers could look after students who in years were above the grade they were in. This would encourage them to come to school and do away with the embarrassment of being in a class below their years. 37 3S THE 'ARROW OF rl BETA Pier We have been over-working the, Delco plant for several years, as was brought out by Miss Stuart in our discussion last year. This over-work brought about the inevitable, the breaking down of the plant which caused the community to realize the need of electric light and power. Mr. Huff and Mr. Maples have put in tentatively a dynamo connected with the Luther Reagan dam, asking II B ci) to go in with the Gatlin-burg Electric and Power Company. In. the digest of the minutes I will add more about all propositions,' especially this. Miss Chew reports that this has been the most successful year in the history of our School. She says from the academic point of view there are always disappointments, a falling short of one's expectations of one's pupils to grasp the facts which one feels absolutely are necessary. Miss Chew now feels as the committee has felt for years back that we should stress more the ;agricultural and domestic 'sides. Last year the school faculty adopted a new system of recording our pupils and their school work. I hope this filing of the records will enable us to Make an illiteracy survey and bring our pupils to the view point that their parents could be taught by them and thus eliminate a great deal of illiteracy in our community The library has been re-catalogued. The books have been grouped on the shelves under the headings of Standard Fiction, Popular i'iction, Boy's Books, Girl's Books, Children's Books, Essay and Poetry, History, Geography, Folk Stories, Reference, Science, English and Mathematics. The school house has been used as a community meeting place but recently the barn has supplanted this as there is more room to play and it could be used as an indoor court for basketball. To summarize what has been accomplished in the School, according to Miss Chew, would be: 1. A greater spirit of unity between pupil and teacher, between School and patron. 2. Created a place for us in the athletic world. 3. Established filing system of records for the school work. 4. Tested our children with standardized tests. 5. Began to catalogue the library. 6. Revised our course of study from an academic point of view. 7. Our National Girls' Reserve Club included all but two girls in the four upper grades. We have $9.00 in the treasury. We gave $2.00 toward Mrs. Coolidge's picture. S. County certificates for eight grades. 9. Possibility of a state registered high school. WHAT WE NEED 1. Domestic Science-e-cooking. 2. Domestic Art-sewing. 3. Housekeeping. 4. Health Education. REPORTS OF OFFICERS . 39 5. Practical Agriculture that holds. 6. Fewer grades to teacher in lower grades. 7. A course of study working to a definite result that everybody follows, S. A ,definite social program to bring School and community together. Our development of the weaving must go on. We must inspire new designs, new combinations of colors and originality in the weaving of rugs, coverlets and baskets. I have tried to interest more keenly each alumnze club, by writing personal letters to each president and secretary. It is with deep regret that after all the time I spent in writing those letters, precious few considered them important enough to read to their alumna! clubs. In order to, popularize the Fire-side Industries I have gotten out a new booklet. Let me add here that for the first time in our history has the fire-side industries been a financial success. EaCh year previous the School has had a deficit in this part of the work. We have also arranged for new slides which we hope to add from time to, time. We used these new slides at the Eastern Conference in Washington, trying to arrange them in a logical order so that they would portray a continued story of human interest and appreciation of the work being done there. I felt that it was a great opportunity to present the Settlement School problems at Washington and travelled from Texas there so that everyone who visited the Conference might know that the Settlement School is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, thing any fraternity in the 'United States is doing. I hope that the future will show our efforts were not in vain. We have had representatives from the School at the Mountain Workers' Conference in Knoxville, also at the Conference in Berea. The result of those visits brought Mrs. John Campbell and Miss Butler to visit the School. Their suggestions brought us new ideas, helped us solve many old problems and made us feel more optimistic. They assured us that our School had gone forward in an easier and more constructive manner and with less difficult problems arising than any of the other mountain schools. Mr. Mattil of the Smith-Hughes Agri-cultural Department, reported that he had been handicapped in his work, first, due to illness ; second, due to the fact that we did not have a farmer to manage the School part of the work in a constructive manner. He emphasized the need of this, but with all the problems he has. to contend with, his work has come out beautifully. The people have' organized Community Club which will be of great value not only to the School but to Gatlinburg itself. While the year has been a most strenuous, one, it has been a great pleasure to me as Chairman to serve on this committee. I cannot close without thanking each member of my committee for her hearty cooperation and each teacher for her splendid work during the year, 40 THE: AuRow o:F Pt BETA PHI and without expressing regret for losing two such valuable members as Sarah Rugg and Melinda Stuart. These have all served valiently during the year and without them I could not have gone through. Respectfully submitted, NIT. HILL STARK. DIGEST OF MINUTES SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING MAY l, 1924 A full membership of the committee was present and with pe mission of Grand Council the two new appointees were preSant, also, thus enabling them to carry on their duties in a better way ,because, unless you have been .to the School, it is impossible to realize what a tremendous and wonderful .work it is. Grand Council authorized.the committee to buy several acres south of the school building.. This will straighten out the south line and the building which is on this land can be..used for weaving and a library which I will tell you about later. . As we had decided to do extensive improvements at the last emumittee meeting, it was a pleasure to see how splendidly this work has been carried on. The Mary Pollard Cottage, which was a story and a half, was made into a two-story building, having dormitory and bath room for the girls up-stairs. and kitchen and dining room downstairs, All the rooms were repainted and floors. cleaned and it made a very lovely place for the girls to stay. The Stuart Cottage had a large open space under it which was closed up. Cement floors were put in there and in, one compartment a store-room was built which enables us to buy .supplies at wholesale, thus reducing the living cost. (.)u the other side of the partition a wash room was constructed f(-)r the girls to do their laundry, so it will .eliMinate washin,g out of doors in the bad weather as they have done heretofore. The barn is about completed, There are a few other necessary equipments to be placed but it is being used right along now, The 1..)arn is a model in every respect for the community to see.. We are quite proud of it and at present it has many purposes. Last winter the isoys used it for basket ball and on Saturday nights it was converted into a. moving picture building. The committee this year put in tire extinguishers as was authorized last year and refilled some that have been used. At the Jennie :Nichols Memorial Health Center a L'Yasement had to be dug in order to put in a system of heating similar to Arcola but not quite as expensive.. In each of the cottages we put in the same system because these radiators could be connected with a central heating plant when .we have enough ,money to put it. in. ,, It was decided again that we would go in with the county regard REPORTS OF OFFICERS 41 lug the Red Cross. Health unit. Miss Higginbotham was reappointed as Head Nurse. A practical nurse will be secured to help Miss Higginbotham to do practical nursing in the community. She will be a great benefit to the people as often times they have had to pay the price of a trained nurse when they could ill afford it. Another thing which has been worrying the committee for some years is the lighting question. It seemed useless to pay for the hauling of gasoline when we could use the power from Little Pigeon river to furnish us all the electricity we could use. With the breaking down of our Delta) system this winter and having to cut off Mr. Huff from eleetTio lights, it made the people realize that the time was at hand in which to put, in a dam. The committee agreed to help defray our part of the expenses and go into a corporation composed of Mr. Huff, Mr. Maples and Pi Beta Phi. The dam will supply the community with alternating current, 1.10 voltage, 60 cycle, or in other words, standard current. This will be a great blessing to the School as now we can have washing machines and mangles, besides other conveniences derived from electricity. It will save the School financially. Last year we had nine months school for the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades. This year the Head Resident was instructed to have full nine months term for every grade in the School. We decided to have fewer grades for each teacher to teach so she could give more individual attention to the student. We failed to get state aid from Smith-Hughes Department of Home Economics on account of State's lack of funds but will try again for it. The matter of the selection of teachers took up a great deal of time this year as there were many problems to decide. First, to secure a teacher who could over-see the boys in their farm and outside work, besides teach the third grade. Mr. Mattil has been doing this in the past but it is impossible for him to do that and keep up the work of the Smith-Hughes Agricultural Department. Mr. Matill has put in an orchard which is thriving well. He has also organized a Community Club which is going to be a God-send to Gatlinburg and surrounding country. Ile was re-elected as teacher for the year. EmilyBurton, Marion Folsom and Helen Chew were re-elected on the teaching staff. Barbara Dewell, Iowa r, is to have charge of the domeatie science department. Allie Ownby, one of our former pupils, because of her excellent work and her eagerness to instruct, was re-elected to teach weaving. Helen Barrett, a Pi Beta Phi from Illinois, is als(,) on the staff. It is a great satisfaction to know some of our former pupils are back teaching in the school. Harmo Taylor and Margaret White of Texas A will be connected with the teaching staff also. The Head Resident was authorized to start a school catalogue. This contains full information of all students ever connected with our School and we feel this card catalogue will enable the children to see that their fathers and mothers learn to read and write. 42 THE ARROW OF Pt BETA PHI Miss Chew resigned as Principal of the School to become head of the Sugarland's unit. The County School Board requested that the committee appoint a head for the school. They will give us ;a certain sum, not decided at yet, a school house, a teacher's cottage and some more land if we will include the Sugarlands under our supervision. This extension work has been the dream of Miss Emma Harper Turner for a long time. It was she who gave us the thought of doing extension work and since this was our first step we felt that it should be called the Emma Harper Turner Center. It gave the committee a great deal of pleasure to know that the Center would bear her name as they have felt keenly the interest she has taken in the School always. It was decided to start a library in which we could have reading rooms open on Saturday and Sunday afternoons and eventually start a circulating library .also. This library will be known hereafter as the Grace Goodhue Coolidge Library. We named it after Mrs. Coolidge, Vermont B, whom all Pi Phis attending the Washington Eastern Con ference learned to love and respect. We could not elect all the teaching staff as we are making so many changes and felt that we had tol'Iet some go and get others to do the type of work we wanted done. During the summer we will have Lucy Nickerson conduct a class in vegetable dyeing and fire-side industries. We think this will be of great value to the community. While Miss Higginbotham is away on her vacation we have employed Miss Bell to take care of her work. There was a joint session of Grand Council and the Settlement School Committee. It was decided that whenever we build the new school building we should put in a fire-proof vault for Settlement School records and Grand Council archives. At this' session it was decided that we use a trade mark for articles made at the School, also that Mrs. Lizzie Reagan be given a Patroness Pin, a token of Pi Beta Phi's love and appreciation for her wonderful work at the School. The Grand Council decided that since there was to be a new Treasurer to take over the books, Miss Stuart's request be granted that she re-open her books in order to give all clubs recognition and to pay all outstanding bills. The committee granted Miss Bishop a three months' leave of absence as she has not had adequate vacation for several years. Mrs. Reginald Geare will have charge of the publicity for the next year. The illustrated leaflet containing prices and information concerning the fire-side industries which was published last year may be had upon request of the Chairman. The school will also send a weekly letter concerning school interests to the Montgomery Vindicator. Under the direction of the Treasurer, the Budget for 1924-25 was prepared and later accepted. Before adjourning the Chairman instructed Mrs. Curtis to write REPORTS OF OFFICERS 43 Miss Stuart and Rugg thanking them for their untiring efforts ou the committee and regrets for the expiration of their terms of office. Respectfully submitted, NITA STARK. Chairman, Settlement School Committee.

It looked to be a Herculean task. Were it not for the assistance of Geraldine Mars and Mrs. Spring, I would be wondering yet. But the tangle became a form, and what was at first a trial became even a pleasure, for one learns and learns through such work--discovers the real mechanism of its publication and the personalities that make it up. As far into things as it has led me the commission has been to foster, as well as to perform the routine editorial work on, the Alumme Personals, the In Memoriam notices, the Alumn Club reports, the schedule of Coming Events, and the .A.lumnte Department Directory. It was thought that an improvement would be made accruing to the benefit of the alumna clubs themselves were the annual club reports to appear in the June ARROw, instead of in the secret October edition, for then the information therein would be available before the various clubs drew up their plans in the fall as is customary. Proceeding on this line the reports have been obtained', copy prepared and edited, and sent in for the June, 1924, AaRow. Along with the request for the club reports as sent out to the club secretaries, it was suggested that a
